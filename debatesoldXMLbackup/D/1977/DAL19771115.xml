    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether unemployment figures have risen in the week ending 21st October, 1977; and whether the rate of job loss has increased in recent months.</P>

      <P>The number of persons on the live register in the week ended 21st October, 1977, was 105,331; this represents an increase of 552 in relation to the previous week. The relative changes in the live register totals in recent months do not support the view that the rate of job loss has increased during this period.</P>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to include in the Official Report a statement giving the live register totals for corresponding dates in July, August and September of this year along with the differences in relation to corresponding dates in the same months of 1976.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 4 and 5 together. <Col N="859" /> I am in consultation at present with the organisations concerned, namely, the teachers, the colleges of education and the school managers, and I expect to be in a position to make a statement before the end of this week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that only 144 of the 398 people who did the courses would have been entitled to go to a teacher training college as graduate students in any event, and does the Minister propose to make any differentiation between those 144 and the remainder when it comes to employment or to training courses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The question the Deputy asked was if I had plans for the introduction of special trainee teachers.  I have such plans and I will be making a statement on this matter before the end of this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not extraordinary that having promised 600 extra teachers in primary schools we now find that less than a quarter of those <Col N="860" /> involved are people who would be entitled to enter training colleges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say how many of the people now teaching are being paid?  Is he aware that quite a number of the people who have taken up positions have not received payment from the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising a point of order.  Question No. 5 refers to &ldquo;disappointing consequences&rdquo; and I submit that this is a most disappointing consequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that there is no question of those people not being employed.  We are carrying on negotiations to make sure that all the interests concerned will be fully behind their employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my intention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he has had any consultations with the INTO prior to the announcement of his intention to introduce university graduates in primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>7.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education the present position with regard to the employment of university graduates on a permanent basis in primary schools; and if he intends to pursue this policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that there has for many years been an advertised competition annually for the admission of university graduates to a one-year course in a college of education to enable them to qualify for recognition as teachers in national schools on a permanent basis.  It is the intention that such competitions should continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="861" /> In the case of the special scheme for the employment of graduates as trainee teachers in national schools there were consultations with the INTO executive prior to the announcement of this scheme.  In fact, the executive agreed to the scheme when I modified it to omit them in certain areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say why there was such an about-turn by the INTO and why the scheme was completely rejected later?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In the month of July the only effective people available for consultation were the democratically elected executive of the INTO.  By a democratic process in accordance with their rules, the members of the INTO held a special congress which rejected the scheme as originally proposed. The distinction is quite clear.  Anybody conversant with normal trade union procedure will understand what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that imply that the executive were out of touch with the wishes of the ordinary members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not part of my duty to reflect on the democratically elected executive of any trade union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to have a similar scheme next year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to disobey a rule but I should like to comment on the supplementary question, if it pleases the Chair.  The basic principle in our manifesto was that we were to improve the pupil-teacher ratio.  Every possible avenue for the recruitment of trained teachers will be explored to ensure that the pupil-teacher ratio is improved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will describe the revised system of teacher allocation which will be necessary to ensure that <Col N="862" /> no pupil in primary schools will be in classes exceeding 40; and the date on which this upper limit will become operative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to achieve the objective of ensuring that, with proper organisation of classes, the number of pupils in any one class would not exceed 40, it is considered that it would be necessary to revise the current figures of average enrolment required for the appointment and retention of teachers in such a manner that the number of additional units required for each extra assistant teacher would not exceed 35.</P>
      <P>It is intended to reach this position at the earliest possible date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I have more concrete information at the earliest possible date?  Can the Minister give a categorical assurance to the House that there will be no primary school pupil in a class of over 40 by June 1981?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy asked that supplementary because he put in this question in a different format originally and then he changed it.  This question now indicates how he was thinking.  For the health of our democracy it is an important question. Nobody approached me and nobody got in as a result of a personal approach to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>Untrained teachers are employed in national schools only when qualified teachers are not available and then only in a temporary capacity for a limited period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>University graduates are not recognised as qualified teachers in national schools unless they have been selected under the annually advertised competition for entry to a college of education and have completed successfully a one-year course in the college.  It is <Col N="865" /> intended to continue these arrangements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's approach to the problem of special graduate teachers, the House should be given an explanation of the future policy in relation to employing graduate teachers in national schools. Does the Minister intend to have them as a permanent inflow into the primary sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered that question.  University graduates are not recognised as qualified teachers in national schools unless they have been selected under the annually advertised competition for entry to a college of education.  We intend to continue that scheme and to recruit as many leaving certificate students as possible to continue our main objective of reducing the pupil-teacher ratio.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>How many graduates left other employment to take up teaching and stated so in their application forms?  How many of them are recorded as coming from full-time remunerated insured employment to take up those positions?  Is that information available in the Minister's Department?  Is the Minister aware that the stated purpose of the exercise of taking on such graduates was to provide employment for graduates <Col N="867" /> who had no employment?  Can the Minister give us that information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct; let us be accurate.  The exact figure of people who had some position before they were recruited I do not have but I will get it and give it to the Deputy. The vast majority of the people recruited were those who had degrees, some had diplomas and some Ceard Teastas Gaeilge.  They may not have had jobs and it was the intention to use them in the schools in a proper fashion to improve the pupil-teacher ratio.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell's question asked me if I considered that schooling prior to the age of six years can be detrimental and if I would make a statement on the benefits or otherwise of kindergartens for children under the age of four.  I have answered that question.  It is a very complicated one.  Our back-up committee carried out a very through study on this matter and got expert advice.  In some countries there are schemes for pre-school education that are too heavily structured and could be harmful to children.  On the other hand, schemes without proper structuring, too loose, could be harmful. There is a golden mean as far as that type of course is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>When we last discussed this Bill I referred to the magnitude of the problem of creating full employment which we are facing at present.  Looked at superficially this Bill might appear to be a non-controversial measure.  It is substantially the same as the Regional Bill introduced last May by the Minister's predecessor. The Bill is designed to give obvious and very necessary additional powers to the IDA to enable the authority to accelerate industrial job creation. The Bill is more significant than the measures contained in it.  Its real significance lies in the fact that the IDA are the main job creation agency in this State and on them will fall the main brunt of meeting the challenge of creating full employment in the years ahead.  To analyse the Bill one has to look at this legislation against a background which contains two very important component parts.  First, we have a situation where we have a growing population, an increasing labour force and no emigration. Second, we have to analyse and assess this Bill against the background of the Fianna Fáil election manifesto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> In that manifesto under the heading of &ldquo;Industry and Commerce&rdquo;, three or four pages dealt with the plans proposed to be taken to accelerate industrial development.  There are two very important sentences dealing with that section.  One says that a revolution must take place in the management of industrial expansion if the essential employment targets are to be achieved. The other sentence is on page 15 at the conclusion of that section.  That extraordinary statement says that there are tens of thousands of secure jobs only waiting to be created.</P>
    <P>The Government have been in office for four months and this Minister was his party's spokesman on Industry and Commerce for a considerable time prior to that.  Surely it would not be too much to expect that the Government, and particularly the Minister, would have availed themselves of the opportunity offered by the presentation of this Bill to indicate and give some evidence of new thinking, or a new approach, to lend some credibility to the extraordinary statement that there are tens of thousands of secure jobs only waiting to be created.  There is no evidence in this Bill of the revolution which must take place in the management of industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>As I said, this Bill is substantially the same as the Bill introduced last May.  The provisions in the Bill presented last May must be looked at against the background of a then major Government decision to establish a national development corporation.  This Bill is being introduced in the context of the establishment of what the Minister calls an industrial development consortium.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement a fortnight ago, the Minister dismissed the concept of a national development corporation. He did not make any effort to indicate the reasons why a national development corporation was not on. Instead of that corporation he outlined, not just briefly but in the vaguest possible terms, a new concept of an industrial consortium.  He said they would have the function of monitoring industrial progress.  He gave no indication of what the role and function of the proposed consortium might be, or <Col N="930" /> what function they would have <i>vis-à-vis</i> the IDA or the other industrial employment agencies.</P>
    <P>I believe we are in a totally new ball game in relation to the creation of industrial employment.  As the Fianna Fáil manifesto said, a revolution must take place.  The point I want to emphasise is that after four months in office there is no evidence in this Bill of the proposed revolution in industrial expansion and there is little, if any, evidence of even new thinking.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this Bill which will release a new dynamism, or accelerate industrial development in a way which would ensure that we can tackle quickly and effectively the major challenge of creating full employment for a growing population. The Coalition Government were very much aware of the problem.  It was in recognition of the fact that previous policies in relation to industrial development and that the existing industrial development agencies were no longer adequate to meet this challenge, that the last Government decided to proceed with the concept of a national development corporation while also recognising the fact that national plans and policies, particularly in the area of economic development and job creation, had to be implemented at regional and local levels.  Side by side with the concept of a national development corporation, there was provision for the establishment of effective regional development agencies.</P>
    <P>One can validly conclude from the Minister's speech and from other indications from the Government over the past four months, despite the predictions and the flowery phrases in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto in relation to industrial development and job creation, that they have no new or original ideas.  Surely, not merely to lend credibility to the Fianna Fáil manifesto but with a view to taking Dáil Éireann into his confidence, the Minister should have made some effort to explain and spell out the role, the functions and the likely effectiveness of the proposed industrial consortium.</P>
    <P>Much has been said and written <Col N="931" /> about the challenge of creating employment. All sorts of plans and schemes have been put forward as ways of dealing with this major problem but very little real action has been taken.  Irrespective of which side of the House one is on, one must be concerned with this problem.  We are anxious that the IDA in particular&mdash; they are the main job-creating agency &mdash;be given the necessary powers to proceed with their work at a much accelerated pace.  The Minister indicated also that he proposes at some time in the future to review the role and the functions of the IDA.  Should that not have been the first step if the Government were serious in regard to the promises contained in their manifesto? I recall the Minister, while he was on this side of the House, speaking loudly, eloquently and at great length on the creation of new industry. In particular I recall an extraordinary statement of his and one which he repeated on many occasions.  At one point when he was calling on the then Government to proceed with the establishment of industries, he said that he would be prepared to take a gamble even if it resulted in a 50 per cent failure rate.  That type of thinking will not generate the additional employment that is required.</P>
    <P>A review of the IDA is very necessary.  That is an obvious and logical starting point if we are serious about the whole question of industrial development and job creation.  In addition to paying tribute to the IDA for their efforts in this sphere credit must be given, too, to the associated job-creating agencies.  The IDA was established in 1950.  It represented a new dimension in the whole area of industrial promotion and development. I regard the establishment of the IDA as the single most important event in the industrial history of this State. Another very important related activity has stemmed from the decision that came to be known as the Sweetman Finance Act, 1956, which made possible the participation of foreign industrialists in industrial development here.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to note this morning in one of the newspapers a <Col N="932" /> statement by An t-Uasal Ó Slatarra who, I understand, is Cathaoirleach of the IDA, in which he very rightly and fairly said that, despite the serious worldwide economic recession of the past four years, substantial and even remarkable progress was made in generating new industrial development. As well as paying tribute to the IDA, mention must be made also in this context of SFADCo, Gaeltarra Éireann, the Industrial Credit Company and even Fóir Teoranta.  In a manner that has been remarkable, all these agencies, both individually and collectively, have faced up to the almost impossible challenge of generating new industrial employment in the past four years.</P>
    <P>However, the time has come for a serious examination and for a comprehensive review of the mandate under which the IDA have been working. At this point I should like to refer to another extraordinary statement in the Fianna Fáil manifesto and something that is very relevant to the Bill.  Referring to the development of natural resources Fianna Fáil said that it is in this area their efforts will lie in the future rather than in the exclusive encouragement of ephemeral foreign finishing industries using foreign raw materials.  I see this statement as being a shocking indictment of the politics that were pursued by four successive Fianna Fáil Governments between 1957 and 1972 during which time the bulk of the industrial employment was created by foreign industrialists.</P>
    <P>In reviewing the activities of the IDA and in the context of this extraordinary statement from Fianna Fáil about ephemeral foreign industry, it might be no harm to look, for example, at the industries which folded up during the economic recession, to consider the reasons for their folding up and the reasons for many of them, at the first advance of adverse trade winds, hoisting their sails and disappearing almost overnight.</P>
    <P>I have said here on many occasions that the mandate given to the IDA was too narrow and too restrictive in the sense that there was over-emphasis on the attracting of foreign industry and <Col N="933" /> in particular industry which to a large extent was merely of an assembly nature and not requiring large scale investment by the industrialists concerned. This was the type of industry that was easy to fold up quickly.  The great failure in our industrial development policy down through the years has been the appalling manner in which our greatest natural resources have been ignored.  When one talks of natural resources generally what he has in mind are minerals and offshore oil, but I regard the land of the country and the sea surrounding it as our greatest natural resources.  I am not in any way attributing all the blame to the IDA, to SFADCo or to any other associated agency in this respect because these agencies must operate within the terms of Government directives but it was a tragedy particularly in the boom years, worldwide, of the sixties that the vast potential of these two major natural resources was neglected.</P>
    <P>With proper policies and the right approach there is vast potential in Ireland for a massive expansion in food technology and the food-processing industry.  Likewise on the sea in fisheries development, which has been grossly neglected, there is potential for the establishment of a fish processing industry and ancillary activities which in a small country like this must be absolutely enormous.</P>
    <P>During the past four-and-a-half years when I had the privilege of being Minister for the Gaeltacht with a major responsibility for promoting economic activity and employment in those regions, I directed Gaeltarra Éireann to assess the potential for fisheries development. An in-depth study was carried out both here and in other countries. One thing which came to light was how poorly this country compared with other maritime countries in relation to the processing of fish.  We discovered that there was no fish cannery here.  I am glad to say that a major new fish cannery was opened some months ago near Burtonport, County Donegal.  Greater emphasis will have to be placed in future on the development of the maximum potential of the opportunities of our food processing and fish-processing industries.  Another area, <Col N="934" /> that of mari-culture or marine biology, has been totally overlooked down the years.  A start has recently been made in west Galway in the cultivation of shellfish and so forth.</P>
    <P>All these have employment potential. They are industries based on the natural resources of this country. Previous industrial policy, as admitted in the Fianna Fáil manifesto, was wrong in that it did not place enough emphasis on this aspect.  In recent years, particularly in the four years during which I was a member of the Government, the manufacturing industrial development strategy of the IDA underwent considerable change.  There was a re-orientation, a change from the traditional approach of perhaps over-emphasising the ephemeral foreign finishing industries which are referred to in the Fianna Fáil manifesto, and a greater emphasis on high technology, export-oriented, high-capital industries. The Minister will be aware of this because we have three outstanding examples in the mid-western region. We have the massive Syntex pharmaceutical plant at Clarecastle.  We have the outstandingly successful Burlington high-technology textile plant near Limerick city which has another branch now in Tralee and I understand intend to have two further ones in other parts of the country.  We have perhaps the highest technology industry in this country in the Analog electronics plant at Raheen, near Limerick.</P>
    <P>The IDA were extremely successful in recent years in attracting this type of high technology where there was massive capital investment by the industrialists concerned and therefore a commitment by the industrialists, and a substantial stake in the country. Foreign industries of this kind are what we should be trying to attract to Ireland.  Apart from the massive capital investment involved, they are high technology industries which provide a range of job opportunities for highly skilled people, professionals and graduates.</P>
    <P>There is reference also in the Minister's speech to an aspect of industrial development which is of tremendous importance, again something on which <Col N="935" /> there was nothing like enough emphasis down the years.  It is what has come to be known as the small industry.  I have a personal interest in the development of small industries.  I recall that in the sixties a major survey or study was carried out into the potential and role of the small industry in modern industrial nations.  I am sure the Minister has a special interest in this matter also because the two people who spearheaded this survey and this study were the then Limerick County Manager, Mr. Tom O'Connor, and the present Bishop of Limerick, Dr. Jeremiah Noonan.  Mr. O'Connor was seconded a short time afterwards to help the small industries section of the IDA.  That study, and subsequent studies that have been carried out, into the role of the small industry and the contribution a small industry can make to industrial job creation all confirm that these small industries, particularly in a developing nation like this, have a vital role to play.</P>
    <P>I would support any measure that might be taken to enable the IDA to encourage and accelerate the creation of small industries.  The definition of what is or is not a small industry varies from place to place and from country to country.  The significant thing is that even in the most industrially advanced nations, such as the USA and West Germany, an amazing proportion of the total industrial employment emanates from small industries, very often, in Germany in particular, from the one-man and two-man craft industries. In some countries also the importance of the small industry has been recognised by many Governments to the extent that they have special agencies responsible for organisation, developing and expanding small industries.  It probably was inevitable over the years that when a local community sought an industry or in a national approach to attracting an industry to this country there was over emphasis on the size of the industry.  A small industry employing ten people in a village did not attract very much attention compared with an industry which came into a big town employing 200 or 300 people, <Col N="936" /> but the economic and social significance of that small industry was very important.  There is great scope in the country for the promotion of small industries.  During the past four years I had the opportunity of studying at first hand the difficulties and the possibilities of small industries, because the greater part of the indsutrial development strategy of Gaeltarra Éireann is centred around small industries. There is need now for a new look at the whole approach to the development of small industries.</P>
    <P>I know that the IDA, through the small industries section, have been doing a very good job, but perhaps something additional may be necessary. I believe the time has now come when it might be more advisable to follow the example of other countries who have special agencies responsible for the promotion of small scale industries. The outstanding example of how local initiative and local enterprise can develop natural resources and effectively create small industries is Glencolumbkille, one of the most remote parishes in the most westerly part of the country.  We have an outstanding example here of what small industries and craft workers have achieved.  There are now 11 commercial companies in that small parish. Fish processing, horticulture, farming and tourism have been developed in this village.  It is believed that in five years' time there will be full employment in that small parish.  I am not saying this to gain any political points but I suggest that the methods adopted in Glencolumbkille should be examined by every organisation in the country, Government, semi-State and private local development.  The success of what has been achieved in that village is due to the dedication of one man, Fr. James McDyer.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that a new look at national level be taken, first of all, at small industries and, secondly&mdash;and perhaps more importantly&mdash;at the possibility of the development of craft industries.  One associates western Germany with large scale advanced industry, but it is gratifying to find the tremendous number of people there who are <Col N="937" /> engaged in what are called craft industries. There are inherited skills in the small villages and towns of the country which could be developed.  The problem with craft workers is that they work in isolation.  I believe some national institution should be set up to co-ordinate their efforts.</P>
    <P>I believe that science and technology and research and development have failed in the creation of industrial jobs.  I am disappointed that our university institutions have not played their proper role in the development of industry.  I make one notable exception, University College, Galway, with which I had very close association when I had the privilege of being Minister for the Gaeltacht. The contribution of science and technology to industrial development has not been very remarkable.  We have in our university institutions great manpower and research resources.  We have brilliant scientists and technologists.  But the effort has not been made to convert that scientific research, technology and expertise towards job creation.  There have been some noteworthy examples of this in recent years.  I want to pay special tribute to University College, Galway, for the close co-operation in which they are working with Gaeltarra Éireann, the development agency for the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I want to give a few examples of the potential in this direction.  I refer to the extraordinarily successful research work carried out over the years by the Marine Biology Faculty in UCG and the still more remarkable results obtained in the past couple of years where this scientific research was applied to the creation and development of jobs Over the years the Agricultural Institute have amassed a tremendous volume of scientific documentation.  I am not at all satisfied with the effort made to translate that scientific research into practical economic development.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous challenge here.  The IDA, the main job creation agency of the State, will have to look much more closely at this aspect of industrial development.  The closest relationship will have to be built up <Col N="938" /> between the IDA and the research institutions of the State.  I discovered in the past few days only&mdash;and perhaps the Minister will tell me if I am right&mdash;that the National Board of Science and Technology has been transferred from his Department to the Department of Economic Planning and Development.  That is a disastrous mistake because we are talking about a major challenge facing the nation.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce had a role in its administration.  Be that as it may, it does not invalidate the point I am making.  There will have to be closer links between our scientific and research institutions and the industry and employment creating agencies of the State.</P>
      <P>I believe in giving facts and examples and not shouting my head off about something I know nothing about.  I referred to the Marine Biology Faculty in UCG and how the research there has been translated into practical development, fisheries development, shell fish farming, and so on, all of which provide jobs. Another example is Professor Seamus Timoney of UCG who has made a major world breakthrough in the development of his armoured car.  I am very proud of the fact that Gaeltarra Éireann are associated with Professor Timoney in the commercial exploitation of this vehicle.  In 1974 or 1975 Gaeltarra Éireann agreed to support the Timoney invention with the result that they established a Gaeltarra Éireann-sponsored industry in Baile Ghib in County Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all our university institutions <Col N="939" /> there are people like Professor Paddy Keady of the Marine Biology Faculty in Galway and Professor Seamus Timoney in the mechanical engineering section of UCD.  No encouragement has been given to these people in the past.  I am sorry to say that, very often in my experience, an inventor or somebody like that was looked on as being an oddbod or a crank.  I recommend that the Minister should take a very serious look at this whole question and set up the necessary lines of communication between our research institutes and the IDA.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Kelly, referred to another instrument of economic development which is very relevant to the whole question of industrial development and job creation.  He referred to the potential in local communities for people to do their own thing, to establish small industries, and so on.  I referred already to what one man was able to do through community development in Glencolumbkille. I referred also to the possibility of encouraging people with special skills in craft work and otherwise to develop their talents.  I referred to the question of small industries and the need to encourage people with special skills and training to set up their own businesses.</P>
    <P>I want to mention now the concept of community development, that is, the ability and the possibility and the potential local communities have through their collective organised efforts to promote economic development in their regions.  In this respect, Glencolumbkille is the outstanding example.  There are others too.  We have local development associations in practically every town and village, people who give of their time and voluntary service to the development of their own localities.  A top priority in the programmes of practically all development associations is to secure an industry for a small town or village in their area.</P>
    <P>The IDA could very effectively look at the whole question of community development.  In 1974, Gaeltarra Éireann embarked on a very successful experiment in the promotion of community <Col N="940" /> development which resulted in substantial development in remote areas and job creation as well.  We have a number of national organisations, notably Muintir na Tire, who could play a major role and be of tremendous assistance to the IDA and the other job creating agencies in devising new ways and means of creating jobs through industrial development or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I have a note here headed &ldquo;Enterprise&rdquo;. A key factor in accelerating the development of industry is the need for enterprise and initiative.  This is very relevant to the significance of the small industries and their role in national development to which I have already referred.  We are not short of talent.  We are not short of initiative. We are not short of enterprise, and we are not short of capital.  How are we to marry these four factors into a situation where the individual with the talent, or skill, or initiative, can be encouraged and facilitated in taking the final step forward in setting up his own small industry or business?</P>
    <P>In the context of small industries special attention will have to be paid to encouraging enterpreneurs.  This is a matter I have discussed with many people and I believe there is a vast potential not merely at home but among our own people in Britain and in the United States of America.  They have acquired skills, expertise and a special knowledge of industry.  They would like to come home and they could be attracted provided an appropriate and suitable formula is devised which will encourage them to take this final step forward.  There is no shortage of ideas or initiative.  Getting what exists translated into an actual project seems to constitute some sort of problem. Some people with whom I have discussed the matter have said they are afraid to take the final step because they fear failure.  The media may have contributed to this fear which now inhibits those with the potential from taking the final plunge.</P>
    <P>In this context I welcome the recent trend on the part of the media and I particularly commend the weekly article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> under the heading of &ldquo;Opportunity&rdquo;.  Prior to that there was a series of successful <Col N="941" /> case histories involving entrepreneurs. It would be invidious to name them but certain sections of the media have undoubtedly shown a lack of balance down through the years because failure has been highlighted and success has never got anything like the same attention.  There is need to encourage entrepreneurs.  How that can be done may pose a problem, but encouragement is necessary.  Special financial arrangements must be available to tide over the man who makes a genuine effort but who, through no fault of his own, fails in whatever the particular enterprise is.  I would not condemn him.  I would give him another opportunity to try again.</P>
    <P>All Members of this Parliament are concerned about the magnitude of the problem with which we find ourselves confronted in providing employment for our young people and re-employment for the many thousands who were victims of the international economic recession in recent years.  It is a very great problem.  We have no emigration. We have a rising population and a better educated young people coming on the employment market every year. It is, as the Minister said in Mitchelstown, a daunting challenge.  The IDA will have a major role to play in facing this challenge and I hope that before long we shall have some evidence from those who are now in the hot seat and shouldering leadership that they are serious in what they said in their manifesto about the tens of thousands of jobs waiting to be created.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. L. Lawlor Mr. L. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that this Bill is urgently needed.  It provides an ideal opportunity to look back briefly at the workings of the IDA.  The experience and knowledge gained since their formation has created a wealth of information of tremendous value now.  During the first years of the IDA in the fifties that body were going through a process of management structure.  The economy was depressed and on the assumption of office by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1957 the late Seán Lemass was given the portfolio of Minister for Industry and Commerce. With his colleagues he set about drawing up the First Programme for <Col N="942" /> Economic Expansion.  That was a positive recognition of the need for detailed planning.  It provided the IDA and other Government agencies as well as private enterprise with a blueprint. The IDA set about their task in the sixties of achieving what had been laid down in the ongoing programmes for economic expansion.  It is not necessary for me to dwell on the sixties.  We are all familiar with the excellent promotional work the IDA carried out in selling Ireland as a base for industrial development.  Programming under Fianna Fáil Governments ceased from 1968 to 1972 and since then there has been a lack of detailed planning.  During the last Government's period in office we referred to this on many occasions because we believed there was a need for detailed planning.</P>
      <P>The Minister in this Bill is paying due recognition to the need for a return to controlled planning so that bodies like the IDA can set their own targets and endeavour to achieve their own aims.  It is the responsibility of the Government to do the overall planning and programming and that is what the Minister has in mind in setting up this Industrial Development Consortium. I was surprised to hear some Opposition Deputies criticise the Minister when, in the past, we have heard many criticisms of Minister not bringing before this Dáil detailed information. The Minister has now provided us with an opportunity of assessing and discussing the workings of this consortium as well as those of the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the present Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, Deputy O'Malley, we have a man with the scope and opportunity to carry out the well-established Fianna Fáil tradition of implementing legislation designed to provide more muscle for Irish industry. It is opportune to restate very briefly the main aims of the Bill.  It is designed to encourage the development of domestic industry with particular attention to small- and medium-sized enterprises.  This is a section in the Bill which has been called for for quite some time.  With a world-wide recession the real need was to get back to the smaller, less heavily-invested type of structure and I believe the IDA recognise <Col N="943" /> the need for assistance at a level lower than that of the multi-nationals.</P>
    <P>The second part of the Bill is designed to stimulate those who have ideas and skills and to help them to become industrialists.  The French call such people entrepreneurs; perhaps we should apply our own term and, in looking up the word in the native tongue, I find it is fear fiontrach.  We have to try to create our own initiative and expansion and perhaps we should look to a source other than the French for the term.  The third aim in the Bill is to introduce new investment powers particularly suitable to new enterprise development programmes.</P>
    <P>I see this Bill as a practical approach to these objectives.  Given the powers in the Bill, Irish industry can meet the demands and provide its fair share of jobs so vitally necessary at this stage. I see the Bill as a change in the IDA financial strategy.  It is a new form of Government investment and it is worth while trying to assess in detail the necessity for this financial change.  If we look back over the last four years we find we had a number of Irish operations with a very narrow financial base. With continual expansion, particularly in the late sixties, some companies found that when their profit margins and their trading situation declined they had undertaken the building up of an administration and an overheads figure which quickly brought them into trouble and created problems for them. In 1977 we had a number of brilliantly executed studies and reports initiated by the banks and the IDA.  These reports showed that a number of very viable companies were short of liquid capital at the time.  There is a recognition in this Bill that in future the IDA can take some positive action when it sees an enterprise with the management, structure and plant and everything bar liquid capital.</P>
    <P>Our hopes lie in a number of existing and new markets.  There are numerous opportunities to sell through our traditional outlets.  There is a market rapidly opening up in the Middle East but some of our companies do not have the financial and marketing muscle to expand into these areas.  The Bill gives <Col N="944" /> an opportunity for IDA personnel to talk to existing concerns about expansion and if one of the areas that need attention is the injection of equity into companies, the IDA can take positive action according to the detailed wording of this Bill.</P>
    <P>What is put before us now as politicians and legislators is a demand that we respond to the requirements of industry, harmonise with it and that we plug into the market place by meeting its practical requirements.  We are now proposing an infrastructure that will provide us with the best available flow of information.  It will be a form of guidance with an efficient channel to ensure that our commitment to genuine enterprise is efficiently demonstrated in the most practical terms, that where money is needed it can be provided.</P>
    <P>The consortium under the Minister's chairmanship and comprising the other Ministers as detailed in the Bill with the top civil servants and heads of semi-State companies will ensure co-ordination of interest and effort at the very top level.  In recognising the need for the setting up of this consortium, the Association of Business Administration Graduates recently brought together the heads of the major semi-State bodies to outline State agencies' aid to private enterprise. That, in itself, was a recognition of the need for the body the Minister is suggesting in the early sections of the Bill.  It will clarify responsibilities and in the present circumstances it is quite on the cards to have such bodies as the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, An Foras Talúntais. An Foras Forbartha, the National Board for Science and Technology and others competing for research and development capital.  I see the Bill as providing a forum for co-ordinating debate.  When the Minister sits down with his colleagues in the Cabinet and requests approval for finance he will have had the opportunity of assessing in detail requests for finance from these other bodies who may be overlapping to some extent.</P>
    <P>At present we have a number of different Government agencies carrying on or intending to carry on research and development.  We have <Col N="945" /> universities doing likewise.  Deputy O'Donnell referred in detail to Galway University.  Some of the universities, particularly in the marine area, are presently doing research and there is positive overlapping.  In setting up the consortium the Minister has recognised the situation and will ensure that all available resources are brought together in a positive way.</P>
    <P>In referring to Fóir Teo., I believe the Minister intends to take it out of the area of patronage of hopeless cases.  It is far too often associated with bankruptcy or at least bad financial circumstances with the result that help from Fóir Teoranta can in itself be a drawback and can easily put a stigma on a particular industry and damage its trading prospects.  Again, the Minister is recognising a very important fact here and he proposes to bring up-to-date State aid to industry and enterprise.  The consortium is a guarantee that the IDA will be constantly sensitive to what is happening in industry in two fields that are equally important, job creation and job maintenance.  Little would be gained if new jobs were created and other jobs lost.  We have seen a number of jobs lost and this could possibly have been avoided if the powers that the IDA will have when the House passes this Bill were available.</P>
    <P>There must be a change in the job situation.  There is always need for rationalisation and changes in production methods&mdash;perhaps we have seen too much of that&mdash;but there are also many areas in industry where jobs are lost because even very good companies with prospects and good management do not get help at the right time.  The consortium, plus a stronger IDA, can overcome some of the problems that have arisen in the past, particularly in the mid-seventies.</P>
    <P>The Bill calls for the encouragement of growth of domestic industry with particular attention to medium-sized industries.  In this area we can be well satisfied with the IDA's track record to date.  The latest major study of its involvement covers the period from 1966 to 1974.  In 1974 firms grant-aided by the IDA accounted for 30 per cent of gross output, 28 per <Col N="946" /> cent of employment and 61 per cent of manufacturing exports.  The comparable figures for 1966 were 11 per cent of gross output, 9 per cent of employment and 42 per cent of manufacturing exports.  The medium-and smaller-sized companies have been playing a vital role.  During that period new enterprises accounted for one-third of the increased industrial output and almost two-thirds of the increased industrial exports, and firms grant-aided by the IDA accounted for almost all of the increase in the manufacturing employment sector.  The evidence is that the IDA has come up with the goods in the past.</P>
    <P>We are now in the situation where expansion must begin again, where new opportunities present themselves and where different approaches are called for.  Many of our private and co-operative enterprises have good premises, a sound plant, welltrained personnel, sound management and good profits; they have everything except the money required to get out and attack the market place.  Their problem may be that the depressed years have drained their financial resources.  The need for capital may be holding them back.  I am familiar with the sort of situation where there are good possibilities for different operations, but where the necessary capital is lacking.  A number of companies had to stand still during the last three or four years, and with the continual rising cost of administration and so on, if they cannot move forward they will gradually slide back. Unless the IDA can give assistance, so that companies with excellent potential can expand, they will not be providing the type of help necessary to Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The IDA are being given tremendous financial muscle under this Bill.  They have justified that type of support from the new Government. During the sixties when there were surpluses in the developed countries and when it was easier than it is now to attract multi-national companies the IDA globe-trotted and put their complete force and drive into that area. This Bill recognises that a double-fronted programme is needed from now on.  We have created an industrial <Col N="947" /> base and we can play a major role within the country to expand it. The Minister outlined that the IDA's situation from here on will be 50 per cent foreign job approvals and 50 per cent Irish job approvals.  That is a major change in trend.</P>
    <P>In achieving those job approvals the IDA will need the financial muscle provided in the Bill.  The IDA can now step in and take a share in companies; they can share in the risk involved in the development stage and in the profits, and they can ensure that the taxpayer's money is used properly. The IDA in being involved will be of major assistance in the expansion of a number of companies.  For the taxpayer it will mean a full follow through of the investment, and for the owners of the business it will mean a minimum of pressure for repayment, compared with the situation where a substantial loan is involved.  For all concerned it will mean getting more products on the road.  In former days there could have been an outcry against the prospect of a State board as a partner in a company.  It would have been regarded as anything from big brother to a tax boy.  Today the industrial situation is different.  The business approach, the presence of professional and financial expertise and the existence of genuine profit and tax records ensure that a State board can be a very welcome partner. It can provide an essential ingredient for progress, in this case money on acceptable terms.  If companies can afford absolute independence, they are welcome to it, but if they need State assistance they must think in longer terms than this year's balance sheet.  The proposals in this Bill ensure that no one goes to the wall for doing the right things.  We have seen several firms that would have been a McKinsey dream, in terms of added value processing and good marketing approaches, but they have been allowed to slip out of a viable situation for the last three or four years.  We do not know what their real problems were, but if the IDA were part of their company we would certainly find out and profit from that information.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> Recently the IDA saw fit to commission a study into the meat packaging and processing industry as a result of a continual request for investment from the meat plant operators.  They did not know how long the demand for State investment and aid to these operations would continue or whether it was along the right lines, so they commissioned a firm of consultants to produce a report.  I hope that the IDA will now give due recognition to the document published. Major recommendations were made in relation to what is probably our real natural resource, and will be for many a day to come.  Even though oil and gas are reckoned to be natural resources, it is worth while to reflect that we have one of the most rare natural resources in the world today, the capacity to produce quality food in large volumes.</P>
    <P>The main recommendation in the report is that every effort should be made to develop the beef-processing industry to its fullest potential, and it suggests a significant share for us in the British and German canned beef markets.  The principle has been established already because the IDA have recognised the beef-processing industry's great potential.</P>
    <P>I welcome that report and I trust the Minister and the IDA will implement it in as much detail as possible because this is positively our largest industry.  There are several co-operative movements in that sector of industry and we have heard repeatedly that they have been short of liquid capital for the reason that their beginnings were small, their expansion has been phenomenal and has caused a continuous drain on their resources: any profits they made were going back into expansion and they had not an opportunity to invest in longer-term projects.  The powers being given to the IDA would enable them to give detailed assistance to the co-operative movement and to other such private enterprise elements.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we have not been giving ourselves enough credit as manufacturers. We have tended to look to others to show us how, and in the process we have been selling ourselves <Col N="949" /> short.  In 1976 no fewer than 236 small enterprises were approved for grant aid, resulting in 3,000 job approvals.  Three-quarters of these were set up by Irish entrepreneurs.  Therefore, we have scope to develop a lot more.</P>
    <P>Twenty-four per cent of our work force are engaged in agriculture but if we travel along any country road and look out for Irish-made farm machinery we will not see nearly enough of it being used.  A detailed study in this area of engineering was carried out by the National Science Council and it is easily recognisable that the fall-down occurs between the dissemination of such information as was gleaned and its detailed implementation. I hope that the proposed industrial development consortium will bring about much greater implementation of such recommendations from bodies such as the National Science Council.</P>
    <P>It has been noticeable that the IDA have not been able to assist enterprises they would have liked to help, not because the enterprises did not seem viable but because the powers were not there.  That is why the new consortium are being given this specific added power.</P>
    <P>It is our duty to discuss this Bill in detail because nothing can be more important to the employment increase element than the detailed provisions in the Bill that will enable financial assistance to be given to industry.  It is our duty to make it crystal clear to existing Irish industries and to potential ones that we, the politicians, are aware of this and that we are doing something positive to assist in a constructive way.  This Bill, and the positive proposal on the consortium, are clear indications of a message from Dáil Éireann about the Government's new strategy: that behind the IDA we have a Government committed to industrial development and progress. The consortium and the IDA will have the real financial and energy muscle necessary.</P>
    <P>The change the Taoiseach made in re-naming the Department and transferring energy to Industry and Commerce was worth while.  The Department <Col N="950" /> of Industry, Commerce and Energy are now a co-ordinating body in regard to finance and energy.  Perhaps the Minister can try to find the quickest way to give industry a shot in the arm through the medium of State bodies that we have.  At the moment the ESB have all the power necessary and that might be one of the quickest ways to provide assistance. In the meantime the industrial development consortium, together with the Departments of Economic Planning and Development and of Industry, Commerce and Energy can look at a number of areas through which an urgent change in industrial strategy could be achieved.</P>
    <P>At the moment the IDA are looking generally at industrial potential, CTT are endeavouring to open up markets for the production of IDA-sponsored industries and the Industrial Credit Company are providing the finance. There is need for co-ordination of effort and the proposed consortium is the right move.  Those in Opposition at the moment were looking for a national development consortium. The structures are there and this move is a progressive and positive step to bring together existing units of organisation, instead of getting involved in the setting-up of further bodies.  It is a co-ordination of resources and is the right move.  This Bill will give the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary the opportunity to follow in the footsteps of the late Seán Lemass, who is now considered to be the architect of our industries.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also give us an opportunity to expand the food processing industry.  Any expansion of this industry must be done in a controlled way.  When there is too much material it is processed in an unsatisfactory way. On the other hand, if the material is short, production is switched off.  The food processing industry has made great progress, particularly in relation to meat.  However, we are still exporting 700,000 live cattle each year.  The processing of these animals at home would create employment.  We should concentrate on this area because the cost per head job approvals would be less than in the manufacturing sector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="951" /> The IDA announced recently that they have reduced the cost per job approval from £5,900 in 1973-74 to £3,500 in 1976, which is a move in the right direction.  The figure of £3,500 is an acceptable one, though it may have increased since 1976.  Attracting industry from abroad is no longer as easy as it was.  Other countries have had unemployment problems and are trying to create employment by expanding at home.  The IDA are aware of this fact and the Bill clarifies it.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for an ideal mix between State investment and private enterprise.  While a number of companies have returned to profitability during the first half of 1977 it is likely that they will continue to be cautious in regard to expansion.  It is right that the IDA should have the financial strength to invest in private enterprise. This Bill will help to produce results in the area of job creation and I welcome it for that reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill. The IDA also deserve our support. Since its establishment the IDA has proved to be the best employment creator we have ever had.</P>
      <P>The last speaker gave the impression that the IDA was established in the sixties under the late Seán Lemass.  I should like to point out that the IDA was the brainchild of the late Gerry Sweetman and was established by a Coalition Government.  At that time the Bill creating the IDA was subjected to severe criticism in the House on the ground that what we had was adequate to create employment.</P>
      <P>The IDA always had the support of both sides of the House because of its dedication to job creation and to giving us an industrial image abroad. At present we are exporting our expertise. The ESB and other companies have sent engineers to Third World countries.  In sending our people abroad we are helping to develop Third World countries and creating an image of ourselves as an industrial nation.  The IDA is interested in this type of exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should develop our training programmes for middle and top management. <Col N="952" /> If we are to attract industries to invest here we must have sound industrial relations.  We tend to lay the blame elsewhere for bad industrial relations.  Where you have efficient management you will have few, if any, industrial disputes.  The IDA can play a role in this regard.  If the view goes abroad that we are a nation of undisciplined workers and are prone to strikes we will not succeed in attracting any industry, irrespective of the inducements we offer.</P>
    <P>The only way we can develop a proper attitude is by enlightened management.  By and large management here is enlightened and highly developed, but that is not to say that sufficient is being done.  I do not think it is.  We must have constant training and the development of right attitudes in industry.  We are a young developing country and we should not adopt old traditional methods.  It is never too late to change.  The IDA has the management with new ideas to develop the type of enlightened thinking we require to attract industry.  Members on this side of the House spoke in favour of the establishment of a national development board but it does not matter whether it is called a consortium or a development board as long as it has some function and meaning.  The consortium was thought up to counteract what we were talking about.  It will be a meaningless body.  There is talk about getting together a number of groups that can be brought together at any time and I have no doubt they meet regularly to discuss common problems.</P>
    <P>I note that one austere group are missing from the consortium, the banks.  It can be stated that we cannot force the banks in, that they are private concerns, but they have a role to play in this regard.  They have been remiss in the past and did not play their part in Irish industry.  The last speaker spoke about liquid money and cash and that is what makes industry advance.  In many ways the banks hold the purse strings.  I am not asking the banks to rescue lame-duck enterprises, because we are not interested in such concerns.  We are interested in commercial enterprises which can show a <Col N="953" /> profit.  The profit motive is important if we are to expand.  We should never be afraid of the word &ldquo;profit&rdquo;. Any concern that does not realise a profit does not remain in business too long.</P>
    <P>The consortium should have the authority to go into business, like the IDA.  That is another reason why I would have welcomed the inclusion of the banks.  The consortium will be a nice cosy group, but it will not function. There is nothing wrong with the idea and I am not against such groups meeting, but the consortium should have been given more bite.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that we have sufficient boards.  A similar statement was made when the IDA was set up but that negative attitude should not be taken too seriously.  We should always take a chance and be prepared to look at opportunities.  I would eliminate a number of existing boards because they are of little consequence. A national development board would have had an important role to play had it been given proper authority and the right people to run it.  I have no doubt that the idea of the consortium will be adopted by this House because Fianna Fáil have the necessary majority to pass this legislation and I hope it will work effectively. I have nothing against trying any idea but I must state that I do not like this one because I consider it a useless exercise introduced to counteract the idea put forward by the National Coalition.  It is a gimmick.</P>
    <P>The IDA should take an active interest in worker cooperatives.  It is hard for a group of workers who have spent most of their working life on the factory floor to take over a concern that has failed because of lack of finance or lack of orders.  The IDA has a role to play in this regard.  In the event of a group of workers deciding to take over a concern that has gone to the wall the IDA should give all the managerial assistance required because workers would not have the knowledge of management.  Without proper management the workers could fail also.  We could stave off redundancies if we adopted that type of approach.  The IDA could examine <Col N="954" /> the case of a company which may be in financial difficulties and if they think it is viable, or if the workers think it is viable, the IDA should take the chance and support the workers.</P>
    <P>In various areas there are groups of people with ideas and expertise.  The IDA could generate the will to form worker co-operatives.  Very often people lack leadership and knowledge and the IDA could play an important role in this regard.</P>
    <P>The worker co-operative idea originated in the north of Spain about 1964 and it has been very successful there.  The employment content might not be high but we should not be too worried about that.  Small industries can develop in time and that is where I believe our future lies.  We tend to think of companies like Alcan and imagine that they will solve our unemployment problem.  We thought that the Ballymun scheme would solve our housing problems but big undertakings do not necessarily solve problems.  We must not be like the fishermen waiting to catch the big ones and letting all the small ones pass by.  The worker co-operative is just another string in the bow.</P>
    <P>The unemployment problem will be with us for some time because of the increase in our population and the number of young people coming onto the labour market.  This is not a party political point; it is a real problem which confronts us all as legislators.  It is most distressing to see young people walking around the streets and anything which can be done to alleviate this problem is important.  We should not be afraid to innovate.  One idea is to form worker co-operatives and the IDA may be working on other plans. They are not a body to lie down and wait for things to happen.  We must pin our hopes on the development of small industry.</P>
    <P>The Dublin city area has been neglected over the years.  I do not blame the IDA because this area was completely excluded from grants.  The previous Government included Dublin in the grants scheme but much damage was done before this happened.  From the point of view of unemployment, <Col N="955" /> Dublin is a disaster area.  Very little is happening, particularly in the centre city area.  Plans have been initiated in part of my own area, the Coombe, and a number of small factories are to be built there.  I am happy about that, but it is only a small development. I was preaching about small developments earlier on and I will continue to do so, but it is important that we look upon the situation in Dublin as an emergency.  We should declare an employment emergency, particularly in the centre city area.  I know and represent this area and I do not say this in any emotive way, but the social problems and evils springing from unemployment are there for all to see.  It behoves us to work towards solving this problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to see development within the port of Dublin.  It has been neglected over the years for one reason or another and various groups of people saw to it that development should not take place.  By and large the port is an industrial area and there is great potential for employment.  We have the capacity for industrial development and further land can be provided by reclamation.</P>
    <P>Much can be done if we are really serious about providing the jobs required in Dublin.  Passing any of the unemployment exchanges and seeing the number of able-bodies people heading towards them, one would imagine that one was in close proximity to either Dalymount Park or Lansdowne Road.  The IDA must tackle the problems that are holding up any real progress regarding employment in the Dublin area.  Since 1967 every industry that started up in the port area was strongly objected to and that has quite a distressing effect upon people who want to develop industries in this area.  It behoves the IDA, with their new-found money and muscle, to ensure that such industries can get off the ground.  The unemployment situation will be very lopsided if this problem is not tackled.</P>
    <P>When we were going to school the only resources we had were the green grass and the boglands.  Since then we have discovered rich mineral resources <Col N="956" /> with great potential.  Gas has been discovered off our shore and, hopefully, we will discover oil to add to our future wealth.  When we mine our natural resources it is important that we not merely ship the raw ore out of the port of Dublin, Drogheda or from whichever port it emanates to other smelters and industries.  That would be of very little use here.  In those circumstances, we could still accrue wealth from it but a small proportion only.  The industrialists of Europe and elsewhere might well be the people who would exploit our mines.  This is something we must watch carefully also.</P>
    <P>I realise the major problems to be faced in the setting up of a smelter here.  But we must take our courage in our hands and say: we are going to have a smelter; we are going to have it soon.  While there are arguments against and while there is under-utilisation of smelters in the European markets&mdash;that is why the large empire builders will not come in here&mdash;nonetheless, that is all right.  We have to attract them here and offer the right kind of incentive because once the smelter is established it will have a large employment content.  It is the spin-off industries with which I am concerned, a whole new area.  Once a smelter is established with that type of industry here a whole new field of industry can start up with tremendous potential for employment.  Let us not under-estimate that.  The whole face of industry could change once we establish a smelter here, with spin-off industries. Then industrialists will tend to come to the raw material rather than <i>vice versa.</i>  That is a function of both the IDA and of the Government.  The vast amounts of money required should be obtained.  We should go ahead and develop and, in time, we will have been proved to be right.</P>
    <P>The same can be said about our agricultural industry, about processing our raw materials to their fullest potential.  It is becoming more sophisticated and has proved to be such in the last few years.  However, there are still too many unprocessed cattle going out of this country.  It can be said that, even with regard to dead cattle, further processing could be carried <Col N="957" /> out, with cuts being available on the market.  The same applies to our agricultural produce.  I am not saying there has been any neglect in this area, there has not been but the position could be improved still further, creating more jobs and wealth for the nation.</P>
    <P>If we develop our wealth, in turn, we can develop our country in the manner we want which is something the under-developed countries cannot do.  If we develop quickly enough along the right lines then we can provide the type of services we, in this House, would like to see, particularly those geared to the aged, the infirm and disabled.  That can be done only if we provide our own wealth, process our raw materials and utilise their potential in the right way.</P>
    <P>I am glad that a new board on science and technology has been set up.  It was to have come under the aegis of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.  It has been shifted now to the new Department for Economic Planning and Development. I think it was somebody from this side of the House who said this was disastrous.  I do not think so.  Once it comes under the aegis of a government department and can play an effective role that is all that matters. We have neglected the question of science and technology over the years. Indeed, we have tended to go for the academic rather than the technological and, as a result, I believe we have suffered.  The new board can and will make the necessary recommendations, will plan and budget for the development of science and technology.  We must remember that we live in a highly technological world today.  We must match the technology of other countries, ensure that we keep up with what is happening in the rest of the world, indeed not alone keep up with it but, in certain respects, be ahead of it so that we can develop our industry and perhaps supply other parts of the world with our expertise. That can be achieved only if the right type of board is set up and I have no doubt but that that will be accomplished.</P>
    <P>This is an excellent Bill containing the right ideas which, when implemented, <Col N="958" /> will make a tremendous change in this field.  The same can be said of the whole of our educational structure.  Bias here has always been towards universities and the academic side of universities with the colleges of technology always&mdash;and to some degree even to day&mdash;being regarded as the poor relation.  The attitude has been that if you are not so bright, you can go along to one of those places and they will look after you.  That was the tendency&mdash;if you were not bright you went to the technical college and, if you were, you went to secondary school and afterwards to university. I suppose that reflected the attitude to the whole of our educational system, that possibly one should not get involved working with one's hands, that rather one should get a job in the civil service, be a secondary school teacher or something of that nature; that was the thing to do.</P>
    <P>We must change those attitudes.  The fact that there is such unemployment amongst graduates at present seems to be bringing about that change.  Such graduates are now scratching their heads asking themselves who directed them into this area when perhaps they might be more profitably employed in the area of technology.  The Department of Education had a role to play in that respect.  But our technological development happened more by accident rather than by plan.  Only by having a highly trained and sophisticated work force can we hope to attract sophisticated industry, indeed not alone attract it here but built it up.</P>
    <P>It might be said that we tend to emphasise the importance of attracting industry here.  A potential Irish industrialist always seems to have the impression that the IDA tend to favour the foreign rather than the Irish company. I know that is not correct.  But, when one speaks to people endeavouring to set up industries here, one always gets the impression that they have the feeling that the foreigners have one up on them and will get the better deal.  A good public relations exercise in this respect might help the IDA to break down that false impression. We must develop our industry. We are a young country but <Col N="959" /> we do not seem to have the innovative, industrial mind to work for the creation of a new type of product, of development, which can be identified with us.  This must be examined.</P>
    <P>Now that the IDA have a little more money with which to involve themselves in enterprise they might take it upon themselves to get involved in this type of initiative because certainly the banks will not do so.  Unless they are working on a gilt-edged security, they will ignore one and one can look for one's money elsewhere.  The banks did not help in any way in industrial enterprises.  Now that the IDA have got a little more capital they can take some chances.  We must take chances particularly with the Irish in-industrialist, the <i>entrepreneur</i>, or the small or large co-operative that wants to establish an industry.  If the enterprise is viable it should be helped.  I am sure the IDA will adopt a constructive approach.  If that is done the future of the country will be good.</P>
    <P>Another reason why I consider it desirable for the IDA to get involved in companies is that the multinational companies may not find it so easy to pull out.  The fact that the IDA have a stake in a company may help to stabilise it.  It would be desirable for the IDA to have a stake in as many multinational companies as possible to ensure that they do not withdraw from this country.  This is an area where the State and private enterprise can work together in an efficient way. When the IDA are involved in a company that is profitable they can reinvest their profits and develop industry further.  It should not merely be a question of siphoning off profits; they must be ploughed back into industry to extend it further.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  The IDA have done worthwhile work and I am sure they will continue.  This measure will enable them to improve still further and to develop more native industries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil stated in their manifesto that they would tackle seriously the problem of unemployment. This Bill is a significant contribution in that direction.  We are all aware that unemployment is our greatest <Col N="960" /> problem and that we must make an all-out effort to solve it.  Admittedly it is a world problem but I do not think we should look at it from that point of view.  Looked at in that way it is a really terrifying problem. Rather, the very large unemployment figure should stir us into action, it should bring about a situation where we can honestly say we are doing something to cure the problem.</P>
      <P>It is futile and silly to blame outside influences and conditions as being responsible for our present situation. We had enough of that from 1973 to 1977 when members of the National Coalition constantly came up with the excuse that our unemployment problem was due to outside influences.  We should not regard the unemployment problem as insoluble.  Some 30,000 school leavers each year will require work but we should look to the next ten years with courage and conviction and commit ourselves to tackling the problem.  There are more than 115,000 unemployed at the moment.  We must ensure that that will not be the position in four years time when Fianna Fáil's first term of office will be over.</P>
      <P>We know about the job requirements for the next decade but we must supply the means for people to get employment at home.  Our country has the capacity and the natural resources to support our growing population. Many of these resources are virtually untapped and others are not developed to the fullest extent.  In some cases our resources are exported in an unprocessed form&mdash;another way of exporting employment.  Here the Minister and the IDA should take some steps with regard to processing our agricultural produce.  We must instil confidence in our people.  We must have strength and faith in our country's ability to survive and to thrive. I should imagine that a little national pride would not be out of place.  Our new industries would be helped and stabilised with the addition of some patriotism.</P>
      <P>In the recent Irish Catholic Bishops Pastoral on Justice, it is stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the primary duties of society is to create employment opportunities for the greatest possible <Col N="961" /> number of its citizens.  Work is one of man's most important means of self-fulfilment.</P>
    <P>The message continues:</P>
    <P>In our kind of society productive work and the independence which goes with it are important conditions for retaining the respect of the community.  Those who remain workless for long inevitably become marginalised in society.  Being out of work tends to breed resentment against society.</P>
    <P>It is the primary function of the Dáil to create worthwhile, fruitful and useful work for the greatest possible number of our people.  We would then be saying to our fellow citizens that as a society we have need of them. The Government, the Minister, the Parlimentary Secretary and this Dáil must do something.</P>
    <P>The aim to maximise employment should be accepted by everyone as a national challenge.  This will not be easy because any sane person must know that our economic situation will never be improved without more work, more restraint, increased saving and sacrifice.  Sacrifice is a word none of us cares to mention but I am convinced that sacrifice is needed now more than ever to help industry. Sacrifice is a word that scares most people.  It is not a popular word.  Any Deputy would be failing in his duty, in justice and in honesty, if he did not mention sacrifice as one of the essential means of solving our economic and unemployment problems. By sacrifice I mean that those who employ and those who have secure employment should remember that it is not good to have more than 100,000 people out of work and that it is a danger for society to have 30,000 school leavers added to the unemployment register with very few job prospects.</P>
    <P>It is significant that we have the highest proportion of young people in Europe&mdash;more than half our population are under the age of 29.  That clearly highlights the fact that many of our young people are unemployed. As I said, it is not just the Government's job to ensure that those people are employed, it is a task for each <Col N="962" /> and every citizen.  To bring about a situation where most people are employed, it would be essential that those in good jobs show restraint from seeking disproportionate increases in wages which naturally increase inflation which in turn brings about further unemployment.  We have these twin evils, as they are called, affecting our economic and industrial development&mdash;unemployment and inflation.</P>
    <P>This Bill is part of the Government's contribution towards economic growth and job creation.  The IDA have done great work in the sixties and in the seventies, but they need more muscle and power as we go into the eighties because we still have these twin evils and 30,000 annual school leavers coming on the scene.  The IDA from now until the early eighties will have to show a great deal more enterprise, muscle and power to provide job opportunities for those people at home.</P>
    <P>It is good to see that section 3 provides encouragement for men and women of vision and courage to establish industries.  Our people are our greatest natural resource.  We have always had people with initiative and drive in industry, but unfortunately in the past many of them emigrated and brought about a situation where many job opportunities were created through their initiative and drive in their adopted lands.  It was unfortunate that they had to leave their native land but the time is coming when they can stay at home.  It is my belief that if the initiatives and help contained in section 3 had been in operation for the past ten years, we would have tens of thousands of our present unemployed in productive jobs.</P>
    <P>As I said, more than half our population are under the age of 29 years. There must be many among this vast number who, if given the opportunity and financial aid, would become initiators and creators of employment. Section 3 is praiseworthy because it takes into account for the first time the fact that we have a large supply of well-educated, talented, skilful workers who are receptive to new ideas.  I would like to see Irish entrepreneurs <Col N="963" /> get all the benefits provided under this section.</P>
    <P>In the past I have heard criticism of the IDA.  It was said that one had to be a foreigner to get maximum benefits.  There were times when I thought the same myself.  Sometimes those rumours are based on false assumptions.  Very often the native industrialist might not have measured up to the required standard. However, it is my conviction that native industrialists should have at least an equal chance with foreign industrialists. There is the opinion in some quarters that grants have been available more freely to people who are not of Irish nationality.  If this has been the situation I trust the Minister will ensure that there will be no grounds for such fears in the future.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides for financial aid to amalgamating industries in order to enable them to gear themselves to greater productivity and efficiency in terms of modern competition. Through the IDA the Government will be giving individual loan guarantees of more than £500,000. These are large amounts of money but the worthiness or otherwise of applicant firms will no doubt be examined scrupulously by the IDA whose regulations will ensure that the public funds concerned will be spent profitably and well.</P>
    <P>In regard to amalgamation, I should like to sound a note of warning.  Where amalgamations take place there is a tendency to loss of employment.  We all know of cases in which amalgamation improves efficiency and profit margins, but there is also very often a loss of employment in the industry concerned.  Consequently, I trust that in regard to the application of sections 2 and 3 of the Bill, every step possible will be taken to minimise, if not prevent, job losses.  The primary aim at all times must be that of job creation. Having said that, I agree that in some instances amalgamation is necessary. However, I am confident that the Minister will be ever watchful of the situation in order to ensure that there is no drastic reduction in any instance in the number of people employed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="964" /> Amalgamation tends also to reduce the number of the smaller type of industries and these are the sort of industries that are very necessary and desirable in rural areas so that people can be employed in their own areas.  There is much scope in rural areas for development particularly from an agricultural point of view.  Unfortunately the situation in some of our under-developed rural areas is not being improved and there are cases in which the situation is becoming worse.  We all know of towns and villages in which industrial development is taking place, but for every area in which development has taken place one can think of at least ten areas in which there has not been development.  From that point of view it is essential that small industries are encouraged; otherwise, our young people will not be able to find employment in their own areas.  In the smaller industries also there is the tendency for employment to be spread on a more equitable basis than is the case in single larger units.</P>
    <P>The creation of jobs in industry leads automatically to the creation of further jobs in the service area.  An additional 5,000 jobs in a new industry could mean in effect the creation ultimately of 10,000 new jobs.  While I am on this subject I would refer to the number of factories that were set up with IDA approval and help but which have since been closed.  In some cases it must be conceded that the closures were unavoidable.  I do not suppose it would be reasonable to expect more than an 80 per cent success rate in regard to new industries, but we must realise that when an industry closes there is the loss not only of the jobs in that industry but also in the related service industries.  Therefore a loss directly of 100 jobs locally could mean effectively a loss of 200 jobs on national level.  Apart from the factories that have closed there are also IDA financed premises that remain unoccupied. Because of the investment of public funds in these premises they should be given priority and, where possible, immediate commitment.</P>
    <P>In this context I would direct the attention of the House to my own county where there have been four IDA factories idle for the past number <Col N="965" /> of years.  These are at Edenderry, Clara, Tullamore and Birr and all of them have been built for more than two years.  Indeed, the factory at Clara has been closed for almost five years.  The total employed in the town of Clara prior to 1970 was in the neighbourhood of 1,000 people.  Since then and since the redundancy within Goodbodys that figure has been reduced to 500.  In 1970 when that redundancy problem arose the Fianna Fáil Government took action and two IDA factories were built in Clara. One was occupied within months of being built and I am glad to say it now employs almost 200 people. There were redundancies in the region of 400 to 500 at that time in Goodbodys. The Minister through his Department will be aware that the second factory was occupied in 1970 for a short period, about six or nine months, and has been left vacant and idle since then.  Clara was then declared a designated area and the higher rate of grants was made available through that designation.  As a result quite a number of people who have been redundant did get job opportunities in their own town and were re-employed.  However, when the National Coalition came to office in 1973 the designation of Clara was lifted, and naturally no further industrialists could be attracted there.  The Minister should ensure that an industry goes into that vacant IDA factory which will provide job opportunities for a town which has been an industrial centre since the time of Grattan's Parliament.  Clara is unique in that sense.  I doubt very much if there is an older industrial centre in the 26-county Republic.  I hope the Minister will give that matter serious and quick attention.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned Edenderry.  Tullamore and Birr.  I was led to believe quite recently that an industry is taking up the idle IDA factory in Birr.  Let us hope that it will be a success and will bring job opportunities to people there.  Tullamore is another town which has been sorely neglected from the industrial point of view for quite a long time.  It is the capital of the county and has had an IDA factory idle for the past three or <Col N="966" /> four years.  I understand that a section of that factory is being taken up by an industrialist who will be employing a very small number. There was hope that the very much larger industry would be coming to Tullamore but I am sorry to say that recent rumours about that are not good.  Let us hope they are not true.</P>
    <P>I stress again the need for industry in County Offaly.  The fact that Bord na Móna and the IDA have been so aligned in County Offaly has resulted in serious neglect of that county from an industrial development point of view.  Statistics indicate that we are almost at the bottom of the scale in regard to industrial development, only County Leitrim being lower.  Because of the Bord na Móna and ESB developments there was a tendency at all levels to say: &ldquo;Those people in Offaly are all right.  They have the power stations and the bog developments and that is enough for them&rdquo;.  Naturally when we had the ESB and the bog developments we had a lot of young people&mdash;now, I am glad to say, well-educated young people&mdash;coming on the market with no job opportunities available to them in their own county. The Minister, his Department and the IDA must see to it that industrialists will be brought to the idle IDA factories in Offaly.</P>
    <P>When the provisions of the Industrial Development Bill are being applied I hope pride of place will go to agriculture-based industries.  After all, in that respect we have the industrialist's dream in raw materials, technicians, innovators, a youthful work force, and a hungry world.  Regarding the encouragement of entrepreneurs that I mentioned when referring to section 3, I would like to refer to the many technicians and planners in bodies such as the ESB and Bord na Móna who would make ideal entrepreneurs. They have the development skills, the knowledge and the necessary drive.  I believe that people engaged in research in bodies like the two I have mentioned would be particularly suited to branch out and to be encouraged to do, as it were, their own thing, in different industries.  The people I have in mind have over the <Col N="967" /> years a very good record in efficiency and in applying their skills.  In this matter it is most encouraging to see in section 9 of the Bill a much-needed enlargement of grants for research.  This will contribute enormously to the growth of output in industry and will bring about a better use of our natural resources and diversification and proliferation of goods manufactured, all of which will increase home consumption and bring about a marked increase in exports.</P>
    <P>On much the same lines, section 9 gives a realistic grant which will ensure efficiency of training in industry. Where possible priority should be given to research and training in ancillary industries.  For example, in agriculture, where less raw materials are involved, less will have to be imported and there is more there to be exported.</P>
    <P>There is a great opening for the development of many lines in the meat industry.  Quite a sizeable number of our cattle are still exported on the hoof.  I recently read an article about the development of meat processing, having different cuts of meat to ensure that a greater number are employed in our meat industry.  It seems there was some problem with MCA payments and also in regard to the different cuts and the different weights of cuts of meat.  The Minister for Agriculture will be more concerned with this than the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  I believe both Ministers should get together on this to ensure that this problem does not continue.  I believe that if that matter is properly dealt with a great number of job opportunities can be created in the meat processing industry.</P>
    <P>It seems that the number of cattle exported on the hoof is decreasing but is not decreasing fast enough.  I feel that through the further development of our agricultural land we are reaching the stage when almost 80 per cent of our total cattle production can be slaughtered and that meat processing and other ancillary developments from this processing can be developed. In that way thousands more people could be employed in that industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> This Bill shows that the Government realise that other countries are in a much worse plight than we were in the last century.  If we want justice for our people we must be just towards others.  I hope that section 4, which provides for technical and advisory assistance to developing countries, is not merely a pious wish.  International co-operation brings peace to the world. Our best way to co-operate is to give what we have in abundance.  I suppose what we have to give is our knowhow, our techniques and our experience.  By this we will make friends abroad and create a responsible, active and balanced community at home.</P>
    <P>There is a great need for everybody outside the Government and the Minister concerned to face this huge task of reducing the great number of people on our unemployment register.  It will not be very easy to ensure that all our people are employed.  I believe that this Bill contributes towards alleviating our unemployment problem.  I know that the Minister will ensure that everything is done to create jobs, especially jobs for young people.  I hope the Minister will bear in mind the necessity of ensuring that most if not all of the 30,000 school leavers available will be able to find job opportunities at home.  The people have now come together to ensure that this is done.  Those who are employed and those who employ have got to co-operate to ensure that job opportunities are available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In my remarks I will try to avoid repeating many of the very cogent and important arguments that have already been put forward.  I hope, principally, to introduce one or two matters which I believe are important and which have not been dealt with in any great detail as yet.  I assume this Bill may be interpreted as part of the frontal assault which presumably the Government wish to make on the unemployment problem.  We welcome this.  I will go so far as to say that it may be said to be rather little and rather late but nevertheless it will undoubtedly enhance the competing prospects of the IDA.  It will also introduce the very important notion of equity and of increasing the role which the IDA will be able to play in ensuring <Col N="969" /> that, by their participation in companies, the public interest is well and truly served.</P>
      <P>I should like, in wishing this Bill every success and in wishing the Minister every success in the very onerous duties which lie before him to point to some of the assumptions which underline this Bill which I consider are important.  It seems to me that, if one discusses economic and employment issues generally in relation to specific items such as this, one rarely gets the opportunity of standing back and seeing if our basic policies and our basic philosophies are the right ones.  The whole impetus and attraction of this type of Bill lies in compounding the very valuable enticement factors which the country has for investment from abroad and within its shores.</P>
      <P>As I hope to point out in a few moments, this may not be enough any longer because, to a degree, there is an element of what one might might almost call industrial prostitution.  A previous speaker referred to towns with facilities for industry and for job creation waiting anxiously, with bated breath to use a cliche, for someone to come in and give them life and hope.  I have to be honest.  There is a certain indefinable sadness about that.  We should put a little more emphasis on personal initiative and personal effort, and on the State encouraging us and creating the structures necessary for the evolution of that effort.</P>
      <P>For historial, cultural and other reasons, perhaps, we have been too wont to be satisfied with what blows in the wind in terms of the jobs created here.  As time goes by there will be increasing competition for jobs. This Bill is designed to cope with it. I anticipate therefore that our policy, right though it has been and is, of opening our arms to the commercial interests of the world may lead us eventually to lower the price somewhat. An extension of that has dangers, it is proper to point out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do so in the context of a debate in which other speakers have rightly pointed out the necessity for recognising the enormous difficulty for individuals in terms of their social role <Col N="970" /> and their peace of mind, and for the economy in terms of the whole jobs situation.  I do not wish to underestimate that.  Obviously the need to create jobs will remain with us for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>This Bill strengthens the hand of the IDA.  Whether it goes far enough, I am not certain.  My disquiet in that regard is underlined by the admittedly relatively short period of approximately four months during which the new Government have been in office. Although it is a short period, it is fair to say a casual or objective observer might reasonably have expected that a little more could have been done.  I say that particularly in the light of the fact that very strong and assertive claims were made that jobs were there and were merely waiting to be created.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to introduce a shallow political note into a matter of great national importance, but I have seen no evidence of this immediate wizardry in terms of jobs.  It does not exist for this Government or any future Government. There are no easy options of waving a magic wand and creating jobs overnight.  This does not happen. Perhaps it is a disservice to democracy, to the unemployed, and to the young, to pretend that overnight one can create the kind of solutions we need.</P>
    <P>Some people queried the effectiveness of the IDA in this debate.  One speaker said the IDA have failed lamentably, or words to that effect.  I do not agree with that.  The IDA have done a good job.  Obviously they have not done the job some politicians believe they should have done, which, presumably, would be to try to create full employment.  Let us not forget that the effectiveness of the IDA, or any other State or semi-State organisation, will only be as good as the political will and wisdom of this Chamber, and only as effective as the sense of vision of the Government and Parliament.</P>
    <P>If there has been a failure it has been a failure of Governments, a failure in our attitude to the creation of jobs and the way we have tried to sell people the idea that jobs can be created <Col N="971" /> overnight.  When one talks about the relative success of the IDA, it is difficult to be certain what one is speaking about.  One of my own preoccupations and concerns has always been to what extent one can judge success in what might be called loosely the public service.  What are the goals in the public service?  By what standards do the IDA operate?  How are they to be successful?  I suppose one could say success for the IDA might be the achievement of their targets.  That has not happened, is not happening, and is unlikely to happen.</P>
    <P>On the basis of their own projections and performances, the IDA have had considerable setbacks.  In terms of job creation, from 1973 to 1976 there has been a deficit.  In terms of gross job gains and losses from 1973 to 1976 there has been a deficit of nearly 4,000 jobs.  Obviously some areas have suffered particularly in this regard, and principally the heart of the eastern region, the Dublin area.  I am aware, as I am sure other Members of the House are aware, of the valiant struggle by the IDA to cope with their enormous problems.</P>
    <P>1976, the year for which the most recent annual report of the IDA is available, was the fourth year of a five-year period covered by the IDA's regional development plan from 1973 to 1977, first published in 1972.  This plan set targets for the creation of new jobs and undoubtedly tried to achieve those targets in the context of enormous international problems and the recession which beset them.  In that climate they did a good job.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the net job creation over the first four years was substantially below target.  There was a decline of 1.9 per cent in the number of persons employed in manufacturing industry.  This compares with a gain of 7,600 jobs required to achieve the net growth rate projected in the 1972 plan. Ironically one could pass the comment that, despite this brave struggle by the IDA to cope, if they were a private commercial company they would now be in serious difficulty by reason of not achieving their targets.  That is no reflection on them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="972" /> The IDA admit that historically approximately 60 per cent of their job approvals have been translated into actual jobs during the five-year period immediately subsequent to the approvals.  If one analyses rationally and objectively the function of the IDA in relation to job creation and maintenance, it seems their role is essentially to try to maintain in terms of numbers the reservoir of jobs which exists.  That takes into account the new jobs they create which, unfortunately, have tended numerically at least to replace those jobs which went out of existence, presumably through market forces and unprofitability.</P>
    <P>There is evidence to suggest this topping up of the reservoir of jobs will become more difficult for the IDA and the Government by virtue of the apparent net contractions across the whole employment pool.  From 1970 to 1974, there was a net increase of 5,000 jobs which, apparently, cost something in the region of £225 million.  From the period 1973 to this year, the indications are that there has been no net increase in jobs and that we have simply maintained the situation as it was.  That does not diminish, or attempt to diminish, the fact that new jobs were created but, as I said, they were counterbalanced by jobs going out of existence.</P>
    <P>Whether designedly or otherwise, the IDA have operated, in effect, as a catalyst for insuring that this reservoir of jobs&mdash;I am speaking numerically&mdash; was kept continually at a certain level. They do this by commitment and dedication. Obviously they have coped very well as a job creating agency of a small country in a rather enormous international economy.  They have been helped by the support of both sides of this House in doing their job. However, I wonder if perhaps the time has now come when we should consider a much wider dimension and a much wider vision as essential if we are to create the kind of conditions in the heart of every Member in relation to employment and the social harmony of our nation.  Without the IDA the present unemployment problem would be much worse.  In fact, the situation would be nothing less than catastrophic <Col N="973" /> and probably inestimable. Remembering that, the nation owes a debt of gratitude to the IDA.</P>
    <P>Some have blamed the IDA and said they have failed.  That is not a realistic approach.  The IDA are the executive arm of the Government and Parliament and specifically of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy and, if there has been failure, then that is the area in which it has occurred.  The IDA or any other body will function only as well at any time as the powers entrusted to it by this or any other Dáil and as the vision which generates that particular entrusting allows it to function.  If is, if you like, an economic catalyst powered, or otherwise, by the Government and bobbing about on an enormous international economic sea.</P>
    <P>This was underlined in 1976 when the authority's experience mirrored the improving economic fortunes at home and abroad and the general up-swing which occurred in the international economy.  The better than predicted outturn of 18,312 job approvals, over 1,000 more than the target set for the year, reflected a substantial increase in the number of projects successfully negotiated in the latter part of 1976. In the second half of that year industrial companies at home and overseas began to move ahead with new plans presumably buoyed up with the obvious evidence internationally of economic improvement.  This benefited the home economy to the extent that the IDA's fight for jobs began to show positive results, higher than the average six monthly period prior to that over the last three or four years.</P>
    <P>This was also evident in relation to developments in other areas because, when one talks about jobs, there are many areas of the economy to which one can refer.  In the past year there were, for example, a number of significant developments which should lead to a strengthening and expansion of the heavy industry sector.  Indeed, earlier this year we had the proposed zinc smelter project to process part of the output from the Navan mines being announced.  One hopes this is not merely in itself a creator of jobs but an omen that we are moving into <Col N="974" /> a new area of industry and job creation in which we do not have either a tradition or a history.</P>
    <P>The IDA's small industries programme was particularly successful during 1976 with a total of 236 small industrial projects approved for grant assistance.  These are expected to generate something in excess of 3,000 jobs.  There was solid evidence, particularly during the last year, that things are on the upturn and that there is cause for reasonable optimism about the degree to which we will be able to maintain the number of jobs in existence.  As I said, the creation of new jobs is a different problem and needs to be tackled with a wider vision than has been traditional.</P>
    <P>In passing, I should mention&mdash;it has not been mentioned so far to the best of my knowledge&mdash;that the IDA, charged as they are with responsibility for getting new jobs and winning new jobs in the face of international competition, could hardly be faulted if they had thrown caution to the winds from the point of view of ecology and protecting the environment and therefore it is very laudable, and certainly to be welcomed, when the contrary can be said, when in fact the IDA have operated antipollution measures and made efforts to eliminate dirty industry, the type of industry and projects other countries would not accept, with a vigour and a wisdom other countries could envy. This obviously is very difficult and it will be more difficult in the future because of the increasing pressure to lower the price.  The IDA's difficulty will be that there will obviously be calls from all quarters to create jobs almost at any cost.  We saw an example recently of what would have been undoubtedly a desirable attribute to our economy in the Cork area when one understands the price offered amounted to something like a package valued at approximately £50 million for the Ford factory.  I am not sure if that figure is accurate but it is the figure one heard mentioned.</P>
    <P>In their attempts to preserve the ecology and conserve the environment the IDA will at all times need the support and the backup of local <Col N="975" /> authorities and, indeed, these local authorities paradoxically are in some respects in a strange position because they have not operated standards the IDA put into operation although they are charged specifically with the job of monitoring and ensuring such standards are implemented.  Not merely then in terms of the way the IDA have combated the problem but also in terms of the way in which they have gone about the problem and the respect they have shown for the environment do they deserve our gratitude.</P>
    <P>This jobs challenge generally, the difficulty and the need to create new jobs, what exactly is the nature of it and what are its dimensions?  Two of the great god words of the age are &ldquo;job creation&rdquo;.  It is important that we should have some idea of precisely what we are talking about, how serious the problem is and how many jobs we need.  The figures most of us have available indicate that something on average in the region of 23,000 jobs were necessary some time back outside of agriculture.  Since 1974 we have had more up-to-date information which indicates we are talking basically between now and 1986 of the need to provide something in the order of 250,000 jobs.  This figure allows for a certain degree of unemployment.  I need hardly point out that no Government in the history of the State have ever come anywhere near that figure. I have to be honest and say that I am not impressed to date with the evidence over the past four months that that job and that figure will be tackled in any better degree.  In fact, the expectations built up may yet provide and may yet be a great problem in terms of the credibility of many young people in their Parliament and in terms of their aspirations and their view of the integrity of public life generally.</P>
    <P>One of the lessons we have learned in the context of unemployment is that we must not ever risk the temptation of including ever again a man's or a woman's job as a political carrot and that goes for all parties.  It is far too serious and far too tragic if the <Col N="976" /> aims do not materialise and the objectives are not realised.  I have no doubt the aims will not materialise.  I am not saying that in any sense of triumphalism. I say it more in sorrow than in anger.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, seen the need, if we are to create the kind of desirable employment prospects we hope for, to create an increase of more than 50 per cent in the 1976 level of industrial employment and 25 per cent in the 1976 level of employment in the services industry.  This is an enormous challenge and I wish the Minister and the Government every success in undertaking it.  Once upon a time a Minister or Government could, perhaps, have held faint hope that the safety valve of emigration would take away some of the pressure.  That is no longer true.  That has gone and I welcome that situation because it is a sad thing for any nation to export its people.  Thankfully, that has now ceased.  I look forward to the day when this Parliament will be able to cope with the problems of its people to the extent that they will return in increasing numbers and bring with them accumulated expertise and cultural experience that they have gained abroad.</P>
    <P>So, for the 51,000 people out of work in 1965 emigration provided no answer, or for the 90,000 out of work in 1975 or for the 108,000 out of work last year.  It is clear that the old solutions will no longer work and that a major effort by all parties to resolve what must be seen as a national crisis will be needed.  As our spokesman on Industry and Commerce indicated, I have no doubt the Minister will readily be provided with every co-operation from this side of the House in trying to ensure the welfare of our people.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned with the difficulties of young people.  What are the figures?  In the seven largest OECD countries there are nearly six million young people under the age of 25 listed as unemployed.  Young people account for about 42 per cent of all recorded unemployment, the average incidence being about three times as great as among the 25-64 age group. In other words, youth unemployment <Col N="977" /> is now chronic at home and abroad. It has been rising since the sixties in virtually all OECD and other European countries, whether judged by measured rates of unemployment or by young people's share of total unemployment. It now falls most heavily on school leavers seeking work.  It falls particularly heavily on girls unemployed under 20.  At present we are told that there are 3,700,000 young people who left schools and universities, presumably qualified, throughout the EEC countries who are still out of work.  We are also told that by 1982 there will be nearly 3.5 million 16-year-olds out of work while the number of people reaching 65 years will reach only two million leaving a net surplus on the job market of around 2.3 million.</P>
    <P>One of the tragedies of statistics and figures is they tend to dehumanise what is essentially a human problem. How can anyone visualise one million people?  In my very first election, a local election, I awoke one night during the campaign almost in cold perspiration wondering how in God's name I would get 500 people to vote because I thought of 500 people in a line or queue and it seemed a great number.  Fortunately, that number was considerably exceeded when the poll came around and I have not since suffered a similar nightmare &mdash;nor do I expect to do so&mdash;but it underlined for me the difficulty of gauging what we mean when we talk about one million.  We are talking of millions of young people without jobs. In some countries since 1973 unemployment among the young has doubled; in others, trebled and in still others, quadrupled.  It would be unrealistic for this House or any similar House in any country to expect that this demographic time bomb situation will be allowed to continue without major international revolt.  Experts in Brussels tell us that those under 25 represent about one-third of the more than five million wholly unemployed in EEC member countries.  Attempts are being made by the employment of various funds and portions of funds to cope with it.</P>
    <P>In Britain we see an even more drastic <Col N="978" /> position where, obviously, industrial contraction of any kind will tend to precipitate enormous numbers of young people into the ranks of the unemployed.  Sure enough, the unemployed numbers exploded there from 174,000 in mid-1974 to 436,000 in mid-1975&mdash;one year.  In France and Italy, figures earlier this year were reported as around 400,000 and some experts place them closer to a half-million in France and 600,000 in Italy.  And I am only speaking of people who may be considered young, approximately 25 years old or under.</P>
    <P>Therefore, on the whole, the economic and employment picture throughout the Community in 1975 is generally considered to have been the worst since the end of the war in 1945.  We should bear in mind that here we are only talking about creating jobs, units into which people are automatically slotted.  We are putting aside for the moment all the noble attributes inculcated into us over the years in regard to what is desirable in a job&mdash;job satisfaction, self-fulfilment, contribution to the community, dedication in terms of selflessness, service to others. We are omitting for the moment all these high-minded, noble ideals, although I suggest we cannot leave them out altogether.  We are leaving them out because our primary concern is to create jobs and have young people and not so young people employed. That is perfectly understandable, but there are very deep social implications involved as well as numerical implications that I have tried to underline.  What about young people looking for more stable or satisfactory work more befitting their education or natural aspirations?  What about those who do not even bother, those who suffer from the social alienation of not even troubling to register for work because they do not believe they can get it?  There is also the lack of opportunity for self-fulfilment.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls upon the <Col N="979" /> Government to honour without delay its commitment to abolish existing residential ground rents.</P>
    <P>The subject of ground rents is an emotive one in this country over the centuries.  We have had a long history of landlord and tenant agitation.  In the last century this was mainly concerned with the rights of tenant farmers.  Most of us, particularly those like myself coming from a rural area, were reared on stories of the Land League, the three Fs, the Boycott campaign, the Ashbourne and Wyndham Land Acts and the early Land Acts.  All this is in the past, but one cannot forget the problems and difficulties connected with the payment of land annuities&mdash;something roughly equivalent to ground rents&mdash;particularly during the Economic War years of the thirties.  The agitation today is related mainly to ground rents on residential properties, the system whereby householders have to pay an annual sum to their landlords, the system whereby the householder does not own the freehold of his own house.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the National Coalition introduced the Landlord and Tenant Bill, 1977, which provided for a prohibition on the creation of future ground rents.  The Fianna Fáil manifesto included a commitment to provide a scheme which will lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.  The then Opposition spokesman, now Minister, Deputy Collins, wrote to ACRA, the central body for residents' associations, on 24th May last, promising to introduce the necessary legislation within six months of the formation of the Government. So far no such legislation has been introduced. Neither before nor since the election has any indication been given by Fianna Fáil as to how they intend to honour this commitment.  Furthermore, in reply to a question of mine on 27th October last, the Minister did not even know the annual ground rent income in the country.  One is driven to the conclusion that Fianna Fáil had and have no idea how ground rents could be abolished.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="980" /> One thing is certain, whatever interpretation the Government now try to put on their commitments, whatever effort they may now make to draw back from, to split hairs, confuse or otherwise welch on that commitment, the residential ground rent tenants of this country expect that they will not have to pay more ground rent and that the Government will foot the bill to enable that aim to be achieved.  I see it as my job as Opposition spokesman to ensure that these thousands of householders will not be disappointed in that regard.  For that reason, I propose this motion on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposed by the Minister seems to be a clear attempt to buy time so that he can think up something to get himself off the hook. Let the Minister and the other members of the Government be quite clear about this: he and his colleagues will be reminded of their manifesto obligations to the public at every opportunity and the Minister for Justice will not be let off the hook.  Too much passion and emotion have been aroused by this issue to permit the hopes and aspirations of so many to be dashed in disillusionment.  We already have an indication that Fianna Fáil have neither the will nor the ability to deliver on their election promises.  Already their credibility in this regard is suspect, as has been shown by the few taken in by the promise of the £1,000 grant on houses. If the Government press their amendment it will be a further indication that election promises are for the purpose of securing votes and not for implementation.  The electorate expect and deserve better.  I urge the Minister to withdraw this amendment and to accept our motion, which merely asks the Government to honour their election commitments.  If they fail to do so they are exposed as shams of the first order.</P>
    <P>To return to the terms of this motion, it is necessary to trace the development of landlord and tenant legislation over the years.  Only in that way can the Fianna Fáil commitment on ground rent be seen in proper perspective and in its true context.  One of <Col N="981" /> the early developments of modern landlord and tenant law was the practice whereby the freeholder of land in or near a town leased it at a low rent for a number of years and the lessee undertook to erect a specified number of houses on the land.  The lessee made his profit by selling his interest in the houses or by subletting them to occupying tenants.  Up to the present century there was no standard practice as to the length of such a lease.  In some cases leases for lives were given; in others the lengths of the term varied from 70 to 150 years.  In isolated cases leases for 999 years were given.  In a number of Irish towns prior to 1900 houses were erected on lettings for 20 years or even on yearly tenancies.  The lengths of the term is normally 99 years.  In 1906, after a long agitation, tenants of town houses got some relief. We had the Town Tenants Act of 1906, which gave tenants of houses on tenancies of not less than a year compensation for improvements and for unreasonable disturbance.</P>
    <P>The final report of the Meredith Commission in 1928 marked the next step.  This report introduced a fair rent definition which bears a great resemblance to the gross rent definition in the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1931. This Act was an extremely important piece of legislation because it effectively set the pattern for the statutory regulation of relations between the urban landlords and tenants.  It was called a tenants charter in that it introduced for the first time protection for urban tenants against dispossession on the expiry of their tenancies.  It gave them the right to renewal of tenancies. Prior to this an urban tenant whose lease expired had no legal right to remain on in the property and the landlord was entitled to recover possession. This was so even when the tenant had put up the building.  The 1931 Act was also of considerable importance in the sense that it introduced the statutory concepts of building lease and proprietary lease as opposed to occupational tenancies.</P>
    <P>In general, a building lease was one under which the landlord leased the tenant a plot of land with a covenant in the lease that the tenant would <Col N="982" /> build a house on that land.  The proprietary lease was a sublease under a building lease.  The essential thing with both kind of leases is that it is the tenant who owns the bricks and mortar. The landlord therefore has only a minor interest in the whole property which is normally represented by the fact that the rent was low.  The rent in the case of this type of lease has come to be known as a ground rent.  This is as opposed to an occupational tenancy where, in effect, the landlord owns the bricks and mortar and the tenant's interest is related primarily to his occupation of the premises, and normally his rent would be much higher than under a building or proprietary lease. The 1931 Act, Part V, provided a procedure for getting a reversionary lease in the case of property held subject to ground rent.  The rent payable on the granting of a reversionary lease was to be a quarter of the gross rent.  The theory of the 1931 Act was that a lessee who had improved a bare site by erecting buildings on it or who had acquired the builder's interest should get a reversionary lease unless the landlord proved that it should not be given for certain specified reasons, mainly involving redevelopment and good estate management.  The main point was that the rent payable should only be in respect of the site value and should contain no element attributable to the buildings erected on the land.</P>
    <P>With the passage of time there were certain flaws in the 1931 Act.  An attempt was made to remedy these in the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1943.  The next step resulted from the Rents and Leaseholds Commission, which reported in 1954 with certain recommendations which were embodied in the Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act of 1958. This Act extended considerably the right to a reversionary lease on the part of ground rent lessees.  The portion of the gross rent attributable to the ground was reduced to one-sixth and under the terms of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967, this proportion was further reduced to one-eighth. The 1967 Act introduced for the first time a measure of leasehold <Col N="983" /> enfranchisement, that is the right to certain leaseholders and tenants to acquire the freehold of their properties. The 1971 Act extended to new classes of tenants the rights given in the 1958 Act to get a reversionary lease and in the 1967 Act to purchase a freehold.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember in the context of this motion that the right to purchase freehold has been in existence for more than ten years.  The cost of purchase was at a sum to be fixed by the county registrar, bearing in mind certain specific provisions of the Act. In certain cases, which would apply to the majority of modern residential ground rents, the price should not exceed the amount which is invested at the date of purchase in the most recent Government long-term loan which would give a gross annual return equal to the amount of the ground rent.</P>
    <P>The most recent long-term Government loan was 13 per cent Finance Stock, 1997 to 2002, which gives a multiplier of 7.692 per cent.  I should point out that because of the improvement in sterling and other international economic factors, interest rates have fallen very much in recent times.  The most recent UK long-term loan was issued last Friday, the 10 per cent Treasury Stock, 1992.  Normally one would expect that any new Government loan here would be issued at approximately the same terms, and this would increase the multiplier to 10 per cent.  Therefore, one must bear that in mind when considering the overall cost of ground rent abolition.</P>
    <P>The evidence is that the right to purchase the freehold which was introduced in the 1967 Act has not been availed of to any great extent.  One of the major problems involved was the necessity to track down the title, not alone in reference to the interest of the most recent landlord but all the superior interests back to the freehold owner. Considerable trouble and expense could have been experienced where a pyramid of interests occurred, and it was my experience as a practising lawyer that this was the most usual situation, rather than having a ground rent lessee holding direct from a freehold owner. <Col N="984" /> Further complications arose when owners of superior interests were infants or persons of unsound mind or other complications of a similar nature, and in general the considerable legal expense that would be involved in tracking down the various title interests was a discouragement to prospective purchasers of freehold interests.</P>
    <P>Then, in 1977, the Minister, now Senator Cooney, introduced a Bill in February.  The Bill sought to resolve this problem in a very simple way. Under the procedure proposed, a lessee merely had to apply to the county registrar who would carry out the full transaction.  After satisfying himself that the lessee was entitled to purchase, the county registrar would determine the purchase money, and on receipt of it he would give the freehold to the tenant by way of statutory vesting certificate.  The purchase money would be lodged in court, and it would then be up to the various landlord interests to prove their various titles and to make their claims against the moneys lodged in court.</P>
    <P>That procedure would have represented a far-reaching innovation and would have gone a long way towards resolving difficulties which were preventing ground rent tenants from purchasing. In effect, the tenant would not have had to bother chasing the various landlord interests or investigating the title of such interests, many of which incidentally might have been defective.  The whole onus would have been transferred from the lessee to the landlords.  That Bill proposed certain other additions which would have favoured tenants, including the right to purchase the freehold.  That was to be extended to new classes of lessees and yearly tenants.  The Bill would have given the right of perpetual renewal of long leases, with the alternative right of outright purchase of the freehold, to ground rent tenants of every known kind.  It would have extended a simple and inexpensive form of arbitration by the county registrars. As already mentioned, it provided for prohibition of the creation of future ground rents on dwelling houses.  That was provided for in section 108 of that Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="985" /> That Bill of course contained many other provisions which I will not go into at this stage.  They were provisions designed to improve the lot of tenants of other types.  Unfortunately, the Bill died with the Dáil dissolution.  As time goes on I will be pressing the Minister to implement many of the other provisions of that Bill, which had a great welcome from tenants of all types all over the country.  I regret that the general reform of landlord and tenant law is in abeyance and I will confine my remarks tonight to the subject of ground rents only.  I will be returning to the other matters at a later stage as opportunities arise.</P>
    <P>The problems in relation to the creation of future ground rents and of an easier and more inexpensive method of purchase were dealt with in the 1977 Bill, and it is very important that both factors should be borne in mind when one tries to interpret Fianna Fáil's commitment in this respect. It is in that context that Fianna Fáil's commitment to provide a scheme leading to the abolition of existing ground rents must be construed. That commitment was given in the Fianna Fáil manifesto and in a letter to ACRA on 24th May last.  In that letter, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, confirmed that commitment. He committed his party to introduce the necessary legislation within six months of the formation of a Government.  In reply to a question in the Dáil on 27th October last, the Minister indicated that a short Landlord and Tenant Bill would be introduced at an early stage providing for the prohibition of the creation of future ground rents on ordinary dwelling houses.  Such a Bill would, of course, be merely doing what was provided for in section 108 of the earlier Bill.</P>
    <P>In passing, I urge the Minister to bring this to a conclusion with all possible haste.  Incidentally, he has not given any explanation as to why future prohibition and abolition of existing ground rents are not to be dealt with in a single Bill.  There does not seem to be any reason why this should not be done, but perhaps the answer is obvious.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="986" /> To get back to the question of the abolition of existing ground rents, the Minister has not given any indication as to how it would be done.  It seems to me that it is possible to implement that commitment only by way of confiscation or compensation.  Dealing first with the question of confiscation, Article 43 of the Constitution provides for the protection of private property rights.  It would therefore appear to be unconstitutional to terminate landlords' interests without compensation, and any Bill providing otherwise would probably be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional.  The Constitution could be changed by a referendum; but the Taoiseach, on the opening day of this Session, indicated that the only constitutional changes proposed were in relation to bail and adoption.  Accordingly, I can only assume that such a course of action is not intended.</P>
    <P>However, it is no harm to mention that, if such a course of action were suggested, the ground rent lessees, the tenants themselves, who would appear to initially benefit from such a move would, because of the diminution in the rights of private property involved in such a change, find that the very thing they were seeking would thereby be lost.  In effect, their legitimate aspirations to the ownership of their houses and property would not be constitutionally guaranteed.</P>
    <P>Having disposed of the question of confiscation, we turn our minds to what was promised by the present administration in their manifesto.  We already had a system whereby the ground rent lessees could purchase by paying a certain sum to the landlords.  While not pretending that the 1977 Bill would abolish existing residential ground rents, the Coalition Government provided for a cheaper and more effective way of purchase by the tenants.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil commitment is to abolish existing ground rents.  In other words, according to the dictionary definition, to do away with them.  The only reasonable interpretation that can be drawn from this commitment is that the Government will provide appropriate compensation.  I suggest <Col N="987" /> that this commitment cannot be construed in any other way.</P>
    <P>How seriously the costs of the operation have been investigated by Deputy Collins and his colleagues is evidenced by the fact that, on 27th October, in reply to a question of mine, the Minister was not even aware of the total annual ground rent income. At that date, having stated that he did not have this information, the Minister said that he would send it to me in due course if he could get it within his Department.  This information has not yet come to hand so presumably it is not yet available to the Minister.  Can he or his Government be taken seriously in relation to this commitment?</P>
    <P>Since the Minister was not able to tot up the bill, I thought I should provide some help in this regard.  I have attempted to obtain estimates of the amounts involved.  Because I have not access to official sources, the figures that I quote must of necessity be very rough estimates.  Despite that fact, it is proper and right that these figures should be put on the table at this stage.  If the Minister is in a position to put forward more official figures, I am quite prepared to listen to him. The best estimate I have been able to obtain is that the annual ground rent income for residential properties is of the order of £12½ million to £15 million.  To get an idea of the capital purchase cost involved I have worked out rough maximum and minimum figures.  Taking the lower income figure of £12½ million per annum and using the present multiplier of 7.692 per cent we end up with a figure of nearly £100 million.  If we take the upper income figure of £15 million per annum and the 10 per cent likely multiplier resulting from the issue of any new Government loan, we end up with a capital sum of £150 million.  In addition to these figures, consideration must also be given to the substantial administrative costs involved in any Government-organised abolition scheme.</P>
    <P>I do stress that my figures are approximate.  However, they are something <Col N="988" /> to be working on pending official figures from the Minister.  One way or the other, the capital cost is enormous. It seems that, in order to procure the votes of ground rent tenants, Fianna Fáil committed the Exchequer to the payment of a sum of that order.  In passing, it is fair to mention that on that basis these must have been the most expensive votes in the history of democratic politics.  Whether the compensation is provided by way of cash or bonds would seem to be immaterial. Bonds are worthless unless they can be redeemed for cash.</P>
    <P>I should make the position of my party very clear.  The Government committed themselves to the abolition of existing residential ground rents and it is our job to ensure that the Government do not welch on their promise and that they fully implement it.  We will fight on behalf of the tenants to ensure that there is no backsliding in this regard.  At no stage did Fianna Fáil spell out how they were to effect the abolition of existing ground rents.  I have gone to some lengths to sketch the background in an effort to put the matter into proper perspective.  It seems that the Fianna Fáil commitment is to provide the necessary compensation to enable this to be effectively done.  Otherwise there will not be an end to the existing ground rents system.  I have given an estimate of the cost solely because this aspect seems to have been totally neglected by Fianna Fáil either before the election, when the commitment was given, or since assuming power.  Having made an estimate of the cost, I now present the bill to the Minister for Justice for payment by calling on the Government to implement without delay their commitment to abolish existing residential ground rents.</P>
    <P>The Minister has put down an amendment asking this House to express its confidence in the Minister for Justice to introduce at an early date a scheme leading to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.  The Minister's amendment must be seen for what it is.  I can only interpret it as a delaying tactic, a cover for a nonexistent plan, something that is unworthy of a responsible Government. <Col N="989" /> In the light of the facts outlined the Minister has failed miserably to inspire confidence in his ability to deal with this matter.  Does it inspire confidence to give a commitment to abolish ground rents when it is obvious that the Minister has not a clue of the cost involved?  Does it inspire confidence when the Minister refuses to accept a motion in what could be termed the dying days of 1977 to have his commitment to ACRA of 24th May to introduce legislation within six months honoured without delay?</P>
    <P>I wonder why the Minister cannot accept this motion and why he feels it necessary to put down an amendment. I suppose the weight of the seven dozen apostles trooping through the lobby may give the Minister an impression of confidence, but I would say to him that he can be assured that this confidence will not be shared by many thousands of disillusioned householders.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances I urge the Minister to play this one the honest way.  A commitment was given in the manifesto and it is unequivocal.  The manifesto states that Fianna Fáil will provide a scheme which will lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.  A further commitment was given that legislation in this regard would be introduced within six months of the formation of the Government. In those circumstances it is difficult to understand why the Minister put down an amendment. This session will end in a few weeks' time and the House will not meet again until the middle of January and by that time the six months will have elapsed.  Therefore, the Bill should be introduced in the next few weeks if it is the intention of the Minister to honour his commitment.  If the Minister is serious about his commitment and intends to implement his promise why does he not accept our motion?  In fact it is a motion that should have been put down by the Govenrment if they intended honouring their commitment.</P>
    <P>Suspicions rise in my mind that the Government do not intend honouring their commitment.  If that is so I presume the Minister will come clean and enlighten the House and the many <Col N="990" /> thousands of ground rent tenants about the situation.  If it is the intention of the Minister to honour his commitment he must be in a position to outline his proposals.  I accept that the drafting of a Bill is a slow process but the proposals must have been worked out before the election.  The Minister should tell the House the headings of his proposals.  If the Minister does not accept our motion I suggest it is because the Government do not intend honouring their promise, that they are backsliding on their commitment. How can the Minister expect us to express any confidence in him or his intentions bearing in mind that background?  Expressions of spurious confidence are not and will not be acceptable to ground rent tenants.  For that reason I ask the Minister to withdraw his amendment and honour his commitment now.  He should abolish ground rents and retain some credibility. If the Minister fails to do so and rejects our motion it can only be interpreted as showing Fianna Fáil in their true colours, a party of all promises and no action, a party without credibility sowing another seed of defeat which I suggest will grow and flourish over the next few years and come into full flower at the next general election.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;expresses its confidence in the Minister for Justice to introduce at an early date a scheme leading to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government gave a commitment with regard to ground rents, a commitment which is contained in the election manifesto which has already been read into the record by Deputy O'Keeffe.  I should like to say also that I gave a commitment, on behalf of my party, last May to the effect that I was setting a time limit on my party, if elected to Government, within which that commitment would be acted upon.  I should like to read a letter. <Col N="991" /> signed by me, dated 24th May, 1977, which I sent to the secretary of the sub-committee on ground rents of ACRA.  The letter reads:</P>
    <P>With reference to recent discussions with ACRA Sub Committee on Ground Rents I wish to state that having been returned to office Fianna Fáil will provide a scheme which will lead to the abolition of existing residential Ground Rents.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to commit my Party to introduce the necessary legislation within six months of formation of Government.</P>
    <P>That was a serious commitment given by me as a spokesman for Fianna Fáil. It is serious when coupled with the statement of policy contained in our election manifesto.  Despite what Deputy O'Keeffe might think, despite what he might want to read into the situation as he sees it now, I am sorry that I will upset him by saying that I have every confidence in myself as Minister for Justice and in the Government of which I am a member to keep that solemn promise, given first by my party in their election manifesto and secondly the promise given by me with regard to the time limit, contained in my letter of 24th May.</P>
    <P>The Deputy need not lose any sleep with regard to whether or not my Government, my party or myself will lose any credibility.  I understand his concern and I am prepared to leave it at that.  I reject out of hand the many political charges made by Deputy O'Keeffe and I want to say to him, in the nicest way possible, that he should look up the record of debates here on this vexed question of ground rents.  If he does so he will see that his own party which helped form the last Government did not have a record of which they could be proud with regard to those they purport to carry the flag for tonight.  If we are to be accused of using this vexed issue of ground rents as an election ploy I want to refer the Deputy to a statement issued by the Government Information Services, on behalf of the former Government, on 6th June, 1974.  That statement is on the record if the Deputy wishes to see <Col N="992" /> it and I do not think I should waste time, effort and energy reading it in full but the Deputy should pay attention to it.  In that statement the then Government said they intended introducing legislation &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;. There was no time limit there. They said that they were going to introduce legislation as soon as possible which would contain a provision to prohibit the creation of future ground rents.</P>
    <P>At that time I suggested to the then Minister, Senator Cooney, that if he were prepared to introduce legislation &mdash;a simple Bill, as I described it, to prevent the creation of future ground rents&mdash;I, on behalf of my party, would welcome that Bill and, as far as I could under the circumstances that prevailed, I gave him an assurance that the Bill would be given a speedy passage through the House.  That was three and a half years ago.  The Minister did not take the advice and did not do anything about it.  I am on record in this House as saying that such a Bill would be given a fairly speedy passage.  A simple Bill could have prevented the creation of a problem for many people.  We were told that the Coalition built so many houses per year.  If that figure is as accurate as the Coalition would want us to believe&mdash;and I doubt that it is&mdash; one would not need a calculator to show the number of houses which could have been without ground rents.</P>
    <P>I find it a little hypocritical and certainly ironic that I am being castigated &mdash;admittedly in a very nice way&mdash;by the spokesman for the Opposition for bringing in a Bill to prevent the creation of future ground rents.  I would hope that the Bill would be circulated tomorrow or the following day and debated next week.</P>
    <P>Regarding this motion, the Deputy knows quite well that a Bill must be introduced in the Oireachtas.  This House has been sitting for about four weeks but there are several weeks left and I should like to assure the House that I have every intention of introducing the legislation.  It is standard practice in this House that the contents of a Bill are not debated or discussed until such time as the Bill is <Col N="993" /> circulated.  When this Bill is circulated, as it will be, then we will have a debate on it but not until such time.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for Deputy O'Keeffe to put down this motion and I accept that he must do so because business is fairly short, as it were, for Private Members' Motions.  I can only say that in the past when I was sitting on the Opposition side and introduced Private Members' Motions calling on the Government to do something positive and worth while, I was chided by Members of the Deputy's party for misusing the time of the House; I was told I was abusing privilege and wasting time.  If that were true then, and I do not accept it, then the party of which Deputy O'Keeffe is a Member could be very easily open to that charge and it would stick much quicker now than it was meant to stick against me.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to say, as Deputy O'Keeffe has said, that this subject did not arise until before the election.  That is not true and the record proves it.  We had a number of debates in this House regarding the problem of ground rents and I suggest that the Deputy and members of his party have ample opportunity to study these debates. Before Deputy O'Keeffe accuses me or anybody else in my party of making promises for the general election, let me remind him that the statement issued on 6th June, 1974 by the Coalition Government was issued just before the local elections and was a very hot potato in the Dublin Corporation elections. Let the man who accuses me strike his own breast if he is innocent. I forgive Deputy O'Keeffe, as I should do.  He is a new Member of the House and those who are politically longer in the tooth should have advised him.  I have a certain sympathy for him but one must be very careful in throwing stones when living in a glasshouse; it is a dangerous thing and one could get splinters of glass in one's hands and other parts of the body.  I am doing something definite and positive about the ground rents question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will repeat something I have said already and I will not <Col N="994" /> interrupt Deputy Fitzpatrick when he is making his contribution.  I said that next Tuesday or Wednesday, if the Whips agree, I will do something positive and definite regarding the ground rents question.  I would hope with the permission and approval of the House to have enacted within a very short time a Bill to prevent the creation of future ground rents.  This is something I looked for from the Coalition Government and which they refused to give.  I would further say for the benefit of Deputy Fitzpatrick that the commitment given by my party in their election manifesto and the time commitment I have given on behalf of my party will be honoured.</P>
      <P>If other motions were available for discussion rather than this one and if I had failed to keep within the time limit, which was voluntary on my part, then Deputy O'Keeffe could have put down a motion and had a go at me. This Dáil has been meeting for about four weeks and I am being taken to task.  I know that he has his tongue in his cheek to a certain degree but I should like to assure the Deputy that I have every intention of dealing with this matter in the way that I and my party said it would be dealt with prior to becoming the Government of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the breaking of promises, I have here copies of letters to different members of the previous Government by the then Minister for Justice to the effect that the legislation will be introduced &ldquo;this session&rdquo; or &ldquo;before the end of the session&rdquo; and &ldquo;very early next session&rdquo;.  I will not waste the time of the House by reading these letters because they are already on record.  I am in a different position. There is the double problem, as I saw it then and as I see it now, of the existing and new ground rents.  The Bill dealing with the prohibition of the creation of new ground rents will be circulated within a matter of hours. We will debate that for what is in it, and, when I am ready to come before this House with legislation dealing with the assurance given by my party in their election manifesto, which will be honoured, Deputy O'Keeffe and members of his party need have no <Col N="995" /> fears about that.  If I do not do it, I am putting it on the line; I will be back.  He can put down the motion and then he has fair game to start criticising the Government if they do not do what they said they would do. Might I say this, for the record, to those who are now showing great concern on behalf of the people who have the ground rents problem, it is a great pity that the same concern was not shown when they were on this side of the House.</P>

      <P>May I say to the new Deputy that he now shares the party benches with many of those of his party who were in government then; that the new Deputy is not an Independent; he is here as a member of the Labour Party that sat in government. Not alone did the Government of the time not show concern for those who had the problem of ground rents, but the Minister of the day refused even to meet the association representing those who were trying to highlight the ground rents problem.  That is on public record in this House.  Might I say to Deputy O'Keeffe and to the new Deputy here in the Labour Party that those of their party members who were in government at the time refused to influence the then Minister for Justice to meet those people and discuss their problems with them.  I met them; I met them on a number of occasions; I discussed their problems in detail with them.  I did not always agree with their point of view&mdash;I told them that&mdash;and in no way could they agree with my point of view at all times.  We respected each other's point of view.  We had much discussion about a matter near and dear to many people whom they represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I was doing that, urging the Government to do something there and then, as quickly as possible to prevent the creation of future ground rents, there was not a bleep from the many Fine Gael and Labour men who sat here behind the then Minister.  I was chided by Members of the Government <Col N="996" /> parties for taking the stand that I did.  I see a colleague of mine walking around the side of the House&mdash;that same Deputy who took part in the debate at the time&mdash;Deputy Raphael Burke, who was chided by members of the Fine Gael Party and accused of wasting time because we took up the case of the ground rents people at the time and urged that something be done about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all on the record. Might I say to Deputy O'Keeffe that he should have another look at the record.  I could name the Deputy, without even trying, who told me I was wasting the time of the House.  He is a Dublin city Deputy&mdash;I think his constituency was the old South East; I am not sure what is its new name&mdash;Deputy Fergus O'Brien of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe feels very upset because I put down an amendment to his Private Members' Motion.  My amendment is a very clear one.  In it I am asking the House to express its confidence in the Minister for Justice to introduce, at an early date, a scheme leading to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.  There is nothing contentious in that.  In all fairness to Deputy O'Keeffe and anybody else in this House I see no reason why he should throw off his clothes at that amendment because let me say that whether or not Deputy O'Keeffe's motion was on the Order Paper&mdash; calling on the Government to honour without delay and so on&mdash;I, as the responsible Minister in this area, had every intention of doing what I said I would on behalf of the Government within the time limit I set for the Government last May.  There is no need in the world for Deputy O'Keeffe to take umbrage at this.  Perhaps it is something to which he might not be accustomed.  An amendment of this nature is and has been in the past quite acceptable.  There is nothing whatsoever in it about which the Deputy should feel aggrieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" /> It is very easy to make accusations or to point the finger.  Let me say to the Deputy that his accusation and finger-pointing with regard to statements made for the purpose of getting votes were unjustified.  I put a time limit on it and I will work within that time limit.  If that accusation is to be made, then the Deputy should make it against his own party arising out of the statement issued by the Government Information Service of the 6th June, 1974, dealing with that question of ground rents.  May I again remind the Deputy that that was the period of time immediately prior to the local elections&mdash;June, 1974; June, 1977; three years, a long period of time, many sitting days of this House, many days on which the Deputy's party did nothing, not even introduce the simple Bill that would have prevented new houses coming within the scope of ground rents at the time.  If there were 25,000 or 20,000 houses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Before that Bill was introduced at all, long before, during the course of a Private Members' debate in this House, I asked the then Minister for Justice to introduce a simple Bill dealing with the prohibition of the creation of future ground rents.  Therefore it was not a part of that Bill at all.</P>
      <P>Let me say as well, again for the record&mdash;and it is as well that Deputy O'Keeffe should know this&mdash;I am surprised he was not told by some of his own, particularly by those who were in Government, that there was ample time to discuss the Committee Stage of the Landlord and Tenant Bill which was dropped.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to support this very simple motion which asks a very competent Minister to honour a commitment given by his Government.  The commitment is there in black and white for all to see.  It is not in dispute by any party in the House.</P>
      <P>The only matter that can be in dispute is when the commitment will be honoured and if I understood the Minister correctly that is what he said. I regret I was not able to be present for all of his speech but I heard enough to say that he deserves the major reputation he had in UCD as a person of consummate political skill. That has been displayed in this House tonight.</P>
      <P>This motion calls on the Government to honour their commitment. They have an unprecedented majority, they are a single party Government and they have attributed their success in regaining office to the intellectual capacity of their &ldquo;think-tank&rdquo; to implement their promises.  I suppose we must be thankful for small mercies, that we extracted a written promise from Fianna Fáil on this occasion.  I am sure there are some people on the other side who regret that it was put down in black and white.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> There is no use in the Minister saying that if we are good and patient and if the Whips agree he will do something about the matter.  There is no use in saying that he will bring in a Bill next week that will abolish the creation of new ground rents.  We realise that is not a problem in legislative but rather perhaps in economic, terms.  I do not claim to have any specialist skill in this matter.  In their Manifesto Fianna Fáil state that they will provide a scheme that will lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution has the joint authorship of a man whose role in Irish history is illustrious&mdash;there is a building named after him among other things&mdash;and a man who was a former Archbishop of the diocese of Dublin. Under that Constitution the status of property is so sacrosanct that it cannot be abolished without some form of recompense. Therefore, the real problem in the implementation of this promise by Fianna Fáil is the cost involved. With the prospect of the 5 per cent statutory or voluntarily obtained wage agreement rapidly evaporating&mdash;it was never on in the first place: the Government never attempted to ascertain if it was on&mdash;they will have difficulty in raising the necessary finance to fund their already over-optimistic job creation targets let alone to sink money into something that will not create one single new job.</P>
    <P>Despite his legendary political skill which has followed him from UCD to this House, I do not envy the Minister for Justice.  The creation of the machine that was capable of organising a very successful social service that would make the Minister for Health and Social Welfare blush at the extent of its comprehensiveness&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not envy the Minister his job when he will have to argue around the Cabinet table with the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and the Minister for Education who was pathetic at Question <Col N="1002" /> Time today in his efforts to answer questions about the payment of teachers.  I should not like to be the Minister for Justice when they ask him the simple question of how many jobs it will create.</P>
      <P>Let us parade now the dishonesty of that promise.  Nowhere in the costings in this manifesto&mdash;or in the revised costings of the Taoiseach or of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development who are now saying that unless we get the 5 per cent everything else falls&mdash;have I seen provision for the financial implementation of this promise.</P>
      <P>If the Opposition have a role it is to ensure that the Government of the day provide good government.  If a party have been given an unprecedented mandate by the population, perhaps in desperation, in a sense of renewed confidence in the &ldquo;soldiers of destiny&rdquo; or out of some form of indifference or a &ldquo;let us go for a change&rdquo; attitude, we have one very simple task and that is to hang their promises around their necks every week, every month and every year.</P>
      <P>The problem is not the prohibition of the creation of new ground rents. That is not a legislative problem.  It is the Minister's problem to make reality out of that promise.  Do not confuse us with the difficulties of prominent Fine Gael backbenchers, or the reason why my colleague, Deputy B. Desmond, allegedly did not get the Committee Stage on to the floor of the House.  Let us concentrate on the issue of the day which is the motion in the name of the Fine Gael Party attempting to hang around their necks the promise in black and white from Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real problem here is the cost. That is a problem because of our Constitution to which on previous occasions the Fianna Fáil Party, through the former Minister for Local Government, Mr. Kevin Boland, refused to propose an amendment which would result in the diminution of property rights with regard to the nationalisation of urban building land. Historically that refusal by the Fianna Fáil Government of the day to come to terms with the concept of property <Col N="1003" /> and private ownership at that stage of the development of our society, is going to hang the present incumbent of the office of Justice.</P>
    <P>We have a simple task at this time. Our people voted for a party in the belief, naive or cynical take your choice, that what was in the manifesto would be implemented.  It is unacceptable for the Minister to come here now or in three years time and say &ldquo;Let us get rid of the first half, which is the prohibition of new ground rents&rdquo;. I am not denying that that would be welcome because it would and it should be law.  I regret that it is not law but there are many things which should have been law a long time ago but are not and people on both sides of the House regret it.  If there is a lesson to be learned from that, it is not the throwing of snide remarks across the floor of this House.  It is that we should look seriously at the way we make laws, which is very antiquated to say the least.  If there is a lesson to be learned it should be in how we look at our Constitution and the real constraints it puts on the present incumbents in Government.  I do not deny that that is an attractive promise and I can readily see why you have it in your manifesto.  It makes a lot of sense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise if I have given offence to the Chair.  Why should anybody have to pay ground rent? Why should I have to pay ground rent to the Earl of Pembroke?  Why should anybody have to pay ground rent to the heirs and heiresses of robber barons?  It is a nonsense and should not exist.  Therefore, any proposal or election promise which offered to do this without qualification is welcome. There is no HP offered here.  The commitment of this Government is quite <Col N="1004" /> clear.  They are not saying they will give half now and half later.  They are saying they will &ldquo;abolish&rdquo;, not &ldquo;prohibit the creation of new&rdquo;.  The word used is quite clear.</P>
      <P>This is a simple motion calling on the Government who, after four and a half months in office, having been out of office for a mere four and a half years, and before that were approximately 16 years in office, have enough political expertise, wisdom and ample votes in the overflowing seats to make reality of that promise, if they so choose.  All that is causing them to drag their feet&mdash;and we have seen the first signs of that now&mdash;is the reality of the cost.  When it comes to it, this Government do not have the guts for real structural change in our society and they will back off any constitutional change or reform.  They have done it before and they will do it again.</P>
      <P>If one reads this document one will see a party pledging action on every single issue that confronts our society at the moment.  What have we got in questions during the last four weeks? &ldquo;Under review&rdquo;; &ldquo;I have not had time to look at it yet&rdquo;; &ldquo;my Department are taking a detailed look at it&rdquo;; &ldquo;I will report back to the Deputy&rdquo;&mdash;the young Deputy, the new Deputy &mdash;&ldquo;when I have had time to consider it&rdquo;.  Everything is under review.  This was not a document of review; it was one of action.  The promise in page 21 was not a promise to review the situation about ground rents, it was a promise to abolish them.  They did not put in the qualification that it would cost money and one had the choice of not paying ground rent or having new jobs.  We are not accepting that qualification. Why should we?</P>
      <P>In support of this simple straightforward motion I am saying that the Government should either put up or shut up and go back to the people and say &ldquo;We are sorry, we cannot deliver&rdquo; and let the people decide.  I have pleasure in supporting this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be associated with Deputy O'Keeffe's and Deputy Quinn's remarks on this <Col N="1005" /> motion.  One speaks on this motion in the expectation that the Minister will dispense some of the sympathy he has given to all speakers so far.  It is my expectation that before very long he will need sympathy more than we do. No matter how one construes this or tries to misinterpret the purpose of this evening's discussion, the Minister's response is extremely disturbing.  I thought he would have accepted this motion without equivocation.  Instead we get an amendment which asks us to express our confidence in the Minister for Justice and in the way he will tackle the problem.  It is too early yet for one to be certain about the question of confidence in the Minister for Justice, but it is disturbing to have observed from outside the House the vociferous and vehement exclamations of the Minister when it applied to the work of his predecessor during very difficult years in regard to a wide variety of topics ranging from ground rents to inquiries into prisons and then to witness what has happened in the interim&mdash;the chameleon-like attitude of the Minister and, indeed, of all the Ministers and the amazing effect that government appears to have had on all these men and women who some months ago knew all the answers.  Now there is no cry of instant action on ground rents.  There is no bleating about the great hardship they are causing and neither is there an outcry or a demand for a public inquiry into prison conditions or into any of the other areas with which the Minister had been so concerned while in Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no wish to be argumentative but perhaps I would be permitted to ask a rhetorical question. <Col N="1006" /> By what criteria am I to assess confidence in the Minister for Justice other than the manner in which he measures up to the words that he expressed while in opposition?  So far the record in that respect is very discouraging.  As Deputy Quinn has pointed out, we have had nothing but constant references to reviews, to thinking about something or other and, basically, to kicking-to-touch at every available opportunity.</P>
      <P>The amendment, because it is almost a direct negative of the motion, implies that the Minister is reluctant or even refuses totally to accept even the spirit of the motion we tabled, which calls, in the interest of the public, for the honouring of the commitment that the Minister entered into when it was politically expedient to do so.  But he has expressed himself as refusing to accept that commitment.  Instead he is trying to fuzz the issue and to turn it into a question of confidence in him. The issue is not one of confidence in the Minister.  May be there will be another day when we will be concerned about confidence in the Minister or in the Government but, as the Minister has said, only four months have passed since the change of Government.  It would be inappropriate at this stage, unless something drastic should happen, to question our basic confidence in the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the specific pledge with which we are concerned this evening, I am disturbed.  The confidence I should hope to entrust is somewhat shaken by the Minister referring at great length to the alleged transgressions and sins of omission of the previous Government. I was not a Member of the Dáil at that time but I was a member of the party who were the principal partner in Government.  I have no doubt that a number of mistakes were made. There is no point in denying that.  The people indicated that in their opinion Fianna Fáil would do a better job. Therefore, to talk about our alleged lack of concern or lack of action is only to underscore what is at least partially obvious.  That is why Fianna Fáil were elected.  The people were unhappy and Fianna Fáil told them in a manifesto that was a panacea for all ills that they had all the answers to all <Col N="1007" /> the national problems, that they had the remedies immediately and not at some halcyon date in the future.  The word &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; is a constant, repetitious nail in the coffin of that manifesto because a coffin it will become before the next four years have passed.  It will become an albatross to hang around the necks of the Minister and his colleagues.  It was on the basis of the pledges given both in that manifesto and outside it that the people voted for Fianna Fáil.  I trust that the Minister acknowledges the serious concern of this side of the House in our attempts to have those pledges implemented. I trust that he realises the bad example the Government would be giving to young people in particular by not honouring those pledges.  Confidence in the parliamentary system is low enough already in some quarters. Let us not turn it into a complete farce by making instant promises for political expediency and the next day choosing to ignore them.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister will deny that he has committed himself to the abolition of ground rents and to introducing the necessary legislation within six months of the formation of Government. He has a time lag of some weeks. His point is well made that, perhaps, we should have waited for the remaining weeks to expire.  We would have waited had it not been for the fact that from the Minister's replies to a number of questions tabled by some Deputies, including Deputy O'Keeffe, it was reasonable to presume there are no ideas in the cupboard on the ground rents question.</P>
    <P>We asked whether the Minister was in a position to say if a constitutional amendment were necessary in respect of legislation in this area.  That question <Col N="1008" /> was not answered except in a very evasive way.  Similarly the question of the cost in respect of ground rents was also evaded.  All of this leads to the belief that the Fianna Fáil promise in this regard was nothing more than a political gimmick to outbid the then Government.  That Government could have been enticed to enter the market place.  Perhaps some of their supporters would say that they should have been so enticed in a bid for votes.  When associations, vested interests and pressure groups, including ACRA, which is the one involved here, sought pledges prior to the election they found ready listeners in Fianna Fáil and they got their pledge in writing.  The Government at the time said honestly that they could not commit themselves in this regard, that they would have to think out the problem.  Already they had gone a certain length in this regard. There was a commitment at least to ensure the abolition of the creation of new ground rents.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the political carrot was too enticing.  Consequently, we have the nil result.  I am certain that not only the promise in this regard but many of the other promises were made without any regard to the social, economic, or other consequences.  The name of the game was to get back into power at all costs.  That attitude is shoddy, unseemly and a disgrace, because right across the face of Government for the last four months and particularly during the past four weeks there has been no evidence of anything but inertia, inactivity and a total lack of ideas.</P>

      <P>(iv)  £48.72; £97.32.</P>

    <P>(v)  The amount of added service granted on ill-health retirement varies with actual pensionable service.  Added service is provided as follows:&mdash;(a) members of the scheme with between five and ten years of actual pensionable service at retirement will be allowed an equivalent amount of added service, such amount of added service not to exceed the difference between the member's age at retirement and <Col N="893" /> age 65; (b) members of the scheme with between ten and 20 years of actual pensionable service at retirement will be allowed the more favourable of: (I) an amount of service equal to the difference between actual pensionable service and 20 years, the added service not to exceed the difference between the member's age at retirement and age 65; (II) six years and 243 days, the added service not to exceed the difference between the member's age at retirement and age 65.  Members over age 65 at retirement cannot, therefore, benefit under this section; (c) members of the scheme with more than 20 years of actual pensionable service at retirement will be allowed to add whichever is the lesser of six years and 243 days and the difference between their age at retirement and age 65.  Members over age 65 at retirement cannot, therefore, benefit under this section.</P>
    <P>(vi)  there are no contributions, on the part of members of the scheme, for service pension.</P>
    <P>(vii)  a contributory widow's and children's scheme has been agreed in principle at the Joint Industrial Council for State Industrial Employees. This would provide a widow's pension of one-half of the service pension.</P>
    <P>(viii)  the contributions under the widow's scheme now being prepared would be: (a) periodic contributions equal to 1½ per cent of the amount by which weekly pay exceeds twice the maximum personal weekly rate of old age, contributory, pension payable to a man who has no adult dependant or qualified children, in respect of pensionable service subsequent to the operative date of the scheme; (b) lump sum contributions equal to 1 per cent of the annual equivalent of the amount by which weekly pay exceeds twice the maximum personal weekly rate of old age, contributory, pension payable from time to time to a man who has no adult dependant or qualified children, in respect of each year of pensionable service for which periodic contributions were not paid; (c) where the pensionable remuneration includes an element other than pay, a lump sum contribution of 1 per cent of that <Col N="894" /> element in respect of each year of reckonable service.</P>
    <P>(ix)  the significant features of the scheme are set out above.  In the case of death in service a gratuity, varying with service from one year's pay to 1½ year's pay, may be paid in respect of the deceased member.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Buncrana, arrangements are in hand to establish a departmentally staffed manual exchange there because the accommodation in the existing sub-office exchange is insufficient for the number of switchboards now required.  A prefabricated building to accommodate the switchboards has been delivered and work on installing the switchboards is in progress.  Before the new manual exchange can be brought into service certain associated equipment must be installed in a new building being erected at Buncrana for an automatic <Col N="903" /> exchange.  There has been delay by the contractor in completing this building but the Commissioners of Public Works are hopeful that the work will be finished within about three months.  The new manual exchange will be brought into service within a further three months or so. It should improve the service significantly in Buncrana.</P>

      <P>The JET Research project is a Community project which means that it has been accepted by all member countries and will be financed by them through the main budget of the Communities.  It follows therefore that my Department have been involved in all of the discussions and negotiations leading to the final approval of the project, which is the main element in the thermonuclear fusion research project of the Communities. A considerable delay in the final approval of the project was caused by a disagreement as to the location of the main installation.  This problem was finally resolved by a Research Council, which I attended on the 25th October, and which finally approved Culham in England as the location.</P>
      <P>We shall be involved as members of the JET Council and the supporting committees and working groups which will supervise and monitor the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="909" /> It is anticipated that benefits will accure to this country in the form of research contracts and contracts for industry in the high technology area which will lead to the development of new expertise in this country.</P>

      <P>The effects of the floating of the pound on petrol prices and ESB charges are being kept under review.</P>
      <P>In regard to petrol prices, under the current price control arrangements Irish wholesale prices are linked to the corresponding prices in the Outer Zone of the United Kingdom.  In the short-term it suits us to retain this link because as a result of competition among oil companies in Britain and Northern Ireland we are able to benefit.  Any reduction in petrol prices in the United Kingdom will be given effect in this country within seven days.</P>
      <P>In regard to ESB charges, any reduction in the price of fuel oil as a result of the floating of the pound will be taken into account when the fuel surcharge is next reviewed in time for the April-May 1978 billing period.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to a reply on 25th October, 1977, to an earlier question by him regarding the use of cutaway bogs.  This reply indicated that an interdepartmental committee was being set up to investigate the possible uses of Bord na Móna cutaway bogs with a view to ensuring that they are properly developed and used in the best national interests and to supervise and co-ordinate whatever technical studies are considered necessary in this connection.</P>
      <P>In view of the investigations proposed, it is not considered that the commitment of expenditure and time which would be needed to prepare a detailed reply to the questions now asked would be justified.  The Deputy's suggestions regarding the growing of sugar beet will be brought to the attention of the interdepartmental committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested is as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  The gratuity unit per year is one-thirtieth of retiring wages for each year of pensionable service up to a maximum of thirty-thirtieths.  Retiring Wages are defined in the Turf Development Act, 1953 (Regular Works Employees) Superannuation (Amendment) No. 3 Scheme, 1972.  In the case of a member earning £44 per week with 40 years' service the gratuity unit per year would amount to £88.469p and he would receive a gratuity of £2,654.08.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The service pension unit per year is one eightieth of retiring wages, as defined, <Col N="912" /> for each year of pensionable service up to a maximum of forty-eightieths. In the case of a member earning £44 per week with 40 years' service the service pension unit per year would amount to £14.198p and he would receive a pension of £567.84 per annum.</P>
    <P>(3) and (4) Gratuities and pensions are payable only on reaching retiring age, or on earlier retirement on grounds of ill-health with not less than ten years' pensionable service.  A member who is retired from the board's service through ill-health and who has less than ten years' pensionable service may be eligible for a gratuity equal to one twelfth of his retiring wage for each year of pensionable service.  In the case of such a person who retires with five years' service earning £44 per week, the gratuity payable is determined in accordance with the regulations of the scheme and there is no standard reply.  Each case would differ depending on age, length of service and taxable earnings of the individual concerned.  No pension would be payable.  In the case of such a person who has completed ten years' service, he would receive a gratuity of £884.69 and a pension of £141.96 per annum.</P>
    <P>(5)  In the case of retirement due to ill-health there is no provision for added service in the scheme.</P>
    <P>(6)  3 per cent of contribution wages, as defined in the Bord na Móna (Regular Works Employees) Superannuation (Amendment) No. 3 Scheme, 1972.</P>
    <P>(7)  and (8)  There is no provision for the payment of a widows' pension under the scheme.</P>
    <P>(9)  The other significant features of the scheme are contained in the Bord na Móna (Regular Works Employees) Superannuation Schemes.</P>
    <P>I might add that a member of the Bord na Móna Superannuation Scheme for manual workers would also qualify for the appropriate social welfare pension benefits.</P>

      <P>As indicated to the House by my predecessor on 4th May, 1976 &mdash;Official Report, Vol. 290, Column 506&mdash;the costs incurred were for various reasons very difficult to calculate but it was estimated that overtime costs incurred in connection with the arrangements amounted to about £114,000.  My predecessor also indicated that the costs incurred were less than what would be likely to have been incurred if the Government had not intervened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the information requested relates to the superannuation conditions of local authority servants as revised with effect from 27th May, 1977, arising out of the interim report of the Working Party on Local Authority Superannuation. The report is applicable to servants becoming pensionable on or after 1st June, 1978, and to existing pensionable servants with effect from 27th May, 1977, or the date of becoming pensionable, if later, on the basis of individual options to be exercised by them.  It is assumed, also, that the reference in the question to <Col N="917" /> gratuity is a reference to the lump sum payable on retirement.</P>
      <P>The requested information is as follows:</P>
      <P>(i)  £85.80 for each year of pensionable service&mdash;maximum £3,432;</P>
      <P>(ii) (a) in respect of service before 27th May, 1977, £28.60 for each year of pensionable service&mdash;maximum £1,144;</P>
      <P>(b) in respect of service on or after 27th May, 1977 £9.62 for each year of pensionable service&mdash;maximum £384.80;</P>
      <P>(iii)  £429; £858;</P>
      <P>(iv) (a) in respect of service before 27th May, 1977: 5 years&mdash;£2.75 per week, 10 years &mdash;£5.50 per week;</P>
      <P>(b)  in respect of service from 27th May, 1977: 5 years&mdash;£0.925 per week; 10 years&mdash;£1.85 per week;</P>
      <P>(v)  &mdash;a servant with not less than five and not less than ten years of actual pensionable service may be allowed an equivalent amount of added service, the amount added not to be such as to make the service of the servant greater than it would be if he were to continue in employment to age 65;</P>
      <P>&mdash;a servant with more than ten years and not more than 20 years of actual pensionable service may be allowed the more favourable of:</P>
      <P>(a)  an amount of added years equal to the different between his actual pensionable service and 20 years&mdash;the amount added not to be such as to make his service greater than it would be if he were to continue in employment to age 65;</P>
      <P>(b)  six and two-third years&mdash; the amount added not to be such as to make his service greater than it would be if he were to continue in employment to age 60;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;a servant with more than 20 years of actual pensionable service <Col N="918" /> may be allowed six and two-third years, the amount added not to be such as to make his service greater than it would be if he were to continue in employment to age 60;</P>
    <P>(vi) (a)  in respect of service before 27th May, 1977, £1.76 per week;</P>
    <P>(b)  in respect of service from 27th May, 1977, £0.52 per week;</P>
    <P>(vii)  if a servant elects to have the revised superannuation conditions applied to him he may participate in a contributory widows' and orphans' pension scheme on an optional basis;</P>
    <P>(viii)  periodic contributions in respect of the scheme referred to at (vii) would be 1½ per cent of the amount by which the servant's weekly pay exceeds twice the maximum personal weekly rate of old age, contributory pension payable to a man with no adult dependent or qualified children. There would also be provision for deduction from lump sum or death gratuity in respect of years of service which were taken into account in the calculation of the widows' and orphans' pension and for which periodic contributions were not paid;</P>
    <P>(ix)  other significant features of the revised scheme are that a death gratuity, in the case of death in service of a pensionable employee would amount to a minimum of a year's pay and a maximum of one and a half times a year's pay depending on service; and that superannuation benefits would be preserved and become payable at age 60 in the case of voluntary retirement after not less than five years' pensionable service.</P>
    <P>Note: In regard to (ii), (iv) and (vi) above, the reduced amounts of service pensions and contributions in respect of service on or after the 27th May, 1977 arise from the application to such service of arrangements for co-ordination with Social Welfare benefits, as recommended <Col N="919" /> in the interim report of the Working Party on Local Authority Superannuation.</P>

The total amount to which he became entitled subsequent to the temporary employment was less than the amount, £50, he had been entitled to prior to it.  This was because the amount then payable to him in accordance with the relevant regulations was now governed by his earnings in the 1977-78 tax year instead of 1976-77 tax year.  In the result a new relevant tax year applied, in which his earnings were substantially lower than in the previous year.</P>

      <P>The person in question has been awarded a Nicolas Copernicus Fellowship offered by the Government of Poland, under the sponsorship of UNESCO, for post-graduate studies in Poland.  The scheme was advertised by my Department on the basis of the travel expenses being met by a successful applicant.  The person in question qualified also for a maintenance allowance for post-graduate training in research in pure science and engineering at an Irish university or institution of higher education.  The conditions of the maintenance allowance scheme preclude use of the allowance for study abroad.</P>
