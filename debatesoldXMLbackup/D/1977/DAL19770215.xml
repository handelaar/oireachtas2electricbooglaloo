      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Preparations for the change to the metric system in the live and dead weight meat trades began in early October when charts and tables showing conversions from imperial to metric weights were issued to marts. The use of these aids and the display of the metric weights of animals sold in the ring helped to familiarise mart personnel, farmers and buyers with the new system.  In addition, before the change over date, which was 3rd January, 1977, supplies of new conversion charts and tables, this time showing conversions from metric back to imperial weights, were widely distributed. <Col N="1378" /> My Department also produced a pocket-sized ready reckoner which included live and dead weight conversions for cattle, sheep and pigs. This reckoner was issued to marts, meat factories and to advisory staffs and has met with a substantial demand from the public.</P>
      <P>The imperial equivalent of the metric weight of all lots in the sales ring will continue to be shown until the public become familiar with the new system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if his Department have formulated any proposals to bring the statutory control of sheep dipping within the functions of his Department and/or the Animal Health Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory control of sheep dipping is already a function of my Department under section 35 of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966.  Responsibility for the execution and enforcement of the sheep dipping orders made under the Act rests, however, with the various local authorities and it is not proposed to change that position.</P>
      <P>As regards the Advisory Council on Animal Health and Disease Eradication, it is within the functions of the council to make recommendations to me on matters relating to sheep scab but there can be no question of giving the council statutory powers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>County councils are responsible for enforcing the sheep dipping regulations but the Department are responsible for the placing of Department rams.  Allegations have been made in the west that the Department are responsible for the spread of sheep scab.  I sent in a question in relation to this matter and I am surprised it is not on the Order Paper. This is a serious matter in the west. The sheep dipping regulations were carried out rigidly by the county councils but yet there is a lot of sheep scab.</P>

      <P>I did not say that county councils do not carry out the regulations but I should like to know what effort is being made to trace the source of sheep scab in the west. Allegations have been made that the Department are responsible.  I am not accusing the Department but there is substantial proof that it was caused by rams sent down by the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if the same system of sheep dipping will be allowed in 1977 as was in operation prior to last year as many farmers consider that the June and July dipping was much more successful than one dipping in the month of October or November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been established that the mite which causes sheep scab does not generally become active until late autumn and winter and that the only effective way to control the disease is to have all sheep dipped at that time.  Summer dipping was not effective in controlling sheep scab and so I do not propose to revert to that system.  Farmers are of course free to dip their sheep in summer if they so desire but this will not relieve them of the obligation to carry out the statutory winter dipping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Many farmers were surprised at the changes that took place because dipping which was carried out in June or July was brought forward.  Dipping in those months ensured that there were no attacks on sheep by maggots and so on.  Many farmers were satisfied with the double dipping system because it served a dual purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing to preclude any farmer from dipping his sheep in June if he so desires. A special committee of the Department of Agriculture set up in 1973 suggested the change in the regulations. The regulations were changed with the consent of farming organisations. Farmers have agreed with the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that winter dipping is essential for the control of scab but farmers must dip their sheep in summer time to avoid maggots.  I was informed by the Minister that further investigations would be carried <Col N="1381" /> out to see if sheep should be dipped in September also.  When these regulations were being reviewed January was even suggested for dipping, the most ridiculous suggestion ever put on paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware of the upsurge in the level of selenium poisoning in cattle and horses within a radius of 15 miles of the Hill of Tara in the last two years; if the last two dry summers are the cause; if it has been caused by the disturbance of shale in the drainage of the river Boyne and the spreading of spoil on the banks; the action that was taken to inform farmers in the risk areas of County Meath after the Agricultural Institute had marked the area on their maps in the mid-sixties; the research that has been carried out since then to find a cure for it; and the action being taken at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if areas in County Meath have the highest level of selenium in the soil in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1382" /> Varying levels of selenium have been found in soil samples from ten counties, the highest concentration being found in samples from County Meath.</P>
    <P>In the past two years samples from two horses and three cattle in County Meath were referred to my Department's Veterinary Research Laboratory for investigation of suspected selenium poisoning.  Levels indicative of toxic intake were found in a horse and two cattle.</P>
    <P>No case involving suspected selenium poisoning had been referred to the laboratory from any part of the country in the ten years prior to 1975. There are no scientific findings to indicate that the dry summers of the past two years caused an increase in the risk of selenium poisoning nor is there any reason to believe that the disturbance of shale or the spreading of spoil from the river Boyne increased the risk.</P>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's reference to the information on selenium levels in certain areas of County Meath issued by the Agricultural Institute in the mid-sixties, the position is that the specific areas pinpointed as presenting a selenium problem are well known to the agricultural advisory officers in the area who tailor their advice to the farmers involved accordingly.</P>
    <P>There is no formal programme of research on selenium poisoning at present but the subject has been dealt with at a number of scientific meetings and seminars in this country. The problem was researched in considerable depth in Meath, Limerick and Tipperary in the 1950's.</P>
    <P>Acute selenium poisoning has not been found to be amenable to treatment. The various forms of chronic selenium intoxication have been treated with a variety of substances with variable results.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised the Parliamentary Secretary has had only three cases referred to him.  Is the aware there are eight farms in County Meath which have had cases of selenium poisoning in the past two years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The information I have does not indicate that, but <Col N="1383" /> if the Deputy has any information on other affected farms he should submit them to the Department and we will investigate without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Is he aware that the disease usually occurs in areas which have been drained&mdash;that the poisoning shows itself in cattle and horses in such areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, there are no scientific findings that the dry summers in the past two years caused an increase in the risk of selenium poisoning, nor is there any reason to believe that the disturbance of shale or the spreading of spoil from the River Boyne increased the risk. Our contention is that shale or the spreading of spoil from the Boyne did not increase the risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>In the areas in which the eight farms I have mentioned are situated there were drainage operations either by the Bord of Works or the farmers themselves.  The few cases we have become aware of in the past 100 years have been always associated with drainage operations of one kind or another.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary examine that aspect of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, the Department would be only too pleased to examine all aspects of it and if the Deputy has additional information I will arrange for him to meet officers of the Department so that the matter can be discussed further.  We know it is a serious matter for the affected farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Since these cases came to light what research have the Department initiated to try to get a cure?  I understand there is no known cure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the problem.  A number of treatments have been tried and the Department will do everything possible to help in the eradication of the disease.</P>

      <P>I am referring to the buying out of land annuities and the Land Commission giving the option. The price of land is so high farmers cannot afford to buy out.  It is a simple question.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary's Department trying to get from the EEC some kind of cheap loan to enable farmers to buy out such lands?</P>

      <P>Such cheap loans are not available and, if a farmer wants to avail of the annuity to buy out land, then he must continue paying under the annuity system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the present position regarding the acquisition of the Cosgrave estate at Cuilnagleeragh, Kilmactranny, County Sligo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Proceedings for the compulsory acquisition of the property referred to have been held up due to a boundary difficulty which resulted from an exchange of part of the lands carried out prior to the institution of proceedings.  As it now appears that the present owners of the lands involved will not take the necessary steps to regularise the matter the Land Commission are considering what alternative course is open to them to enable the proceedings to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that this estate has been the subject of Land Commission inquiries over many years?  This estate straddles the border of two counties, Sligo and Roscommon.  The owner is a very substantial farmer and there are many smallholders who have been waiting for years for the division of this estate.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary ask the Land Commission to speed up the division of this estate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly will.  Proceedings were instituted in this case on 3rd September, 1974, and, as I indicated in the latter part of my reply, the Land Commission are considering what alternative course is open to them to enable the proceedings to continue.  That arises out of the difficulties over the boundary.  The Deputy can be assured these lands will be acquired and made available to local congests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that an absentee landlord has bought an estate (details supplied) in south Sligo and that this estate would make economic holdings for adjoining farmers; and if he will state the action he intends to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission have decided to carry out an inspection of the property referred to with a view to determining whether <Col N="1392" /> acquisition proceedings should be instituted and the requisite notice to this effect has just been served.  Until such time as the inspection has been completed it is not possible to indicate what action may follow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware this land is being bought up by an absentee landlord, together with others?  He has masked a big estate in south Sligo by buying up small holdings privately, small holdings sorely needed by local congests. Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that this man should go into County Meath where land is available at £1,000 per acre instead of snapping it up in the west at £500 an acre?</P>

Tá tuairimí mhuintir na Gaeltachta agam ó Dhún na nGall go Corcaigh agus na hoileáin chomh maith agus tuigim na fadhbanna i bhfad níos <Col N="1395" /> soiléire anois.

      <P>My responsibility as Minister for Transport and Power relates particularly to the activities of Bord na Móna. The role which Bord na Móna cut-away bog development might have in maximising the production potential of the area lies in the medium to long term.  The board, in co-operation with other agencies such as An Foras Talúntais, have been investigating the problem associated with the development and management of cut-away bogs.  The board have established some centres of pilot commercial operations on grassland, and in horticulture as a result of experimental work done to date.  It would be premature to base conclusions on the work done to date and further experience must be accumulated before the optimum use of these cut-away areas can be determined.</P>

      <P>A resolution requesting a joint study of the agricultural and tourist potential of the Erne catchment area has been communicated to the Minister and also, he understands, to the British Government, by the local authorities in the area concerned.  The question was one of a number of aspects of economic co-operation discussed with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Mason, during his recent visit to Dublin.  Following that meeting, discussions have begun with officials in Northern Ireland and the Minister is hopeful that rapid progress can be made towards a joint submission by the two Governments to the EEC on a study of the area.</P>

I have explained to the Deputy on several occasions and I am sure the Minister has too, what exactly is at stake here and what are the things that prevent more rapid progress being made, but in regard to the requests from the authorities concerned, I think the first of them was received on 11th October last and the other ones were all subsequent to that. The matter was raised with the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland during his visit some weeks ago to Dublin, and if the matter has already been taken up at official level, I would not consider that bad going by any standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 33 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September, 1974, the British Government designated areas off the <Col N="1408" /> west coast of Scotland comprising 52,000 square miles within which they claimed that rights with respect to the sea-bed, the subsoil and their natural resources might be exercised.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government in a Note referring to the designation order stated categorically that they did not accept that the British Government could acquire jurisdiction over areas rightfully within the jurisdiction of the Government of Ireland or was entitled to designate areas off the Rockall Plateau or other areas on the Irish side of our proposed line of division. We proposed a meeting of representatives of the two Governments to discuss the matter.  Several meetings have taken place and since agreement could not be reached a Note was sent in April last year to the British conveying a proposal from the Government that an arbitration tribunal be established to adjudicate in the matter.  No reply has yet been received to the proposal but the Minister understands that a decision in principle in favour of arbitration will be received from the British authorities before the end of the week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>While welcoming the information the Parliamentary Secretary has conveyed in the last part of his reply, I think he will note that whereas the British Government did indicate their intentions to protest to our Government, our Government apparently took no such steps to protest to the British Government when they took an action of that sort over three years ago.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary note that our Government should take a stronger line in the event of such designation on the part of this Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The British Government have been informed by word of mouth at official level and also by an official protest in such a way that they could not possibly be in any doubt nor could the international Community be in any doubt about our view in regard to the status of Rockall.  Only in the last few hours this confirmation has arrived, and we will be hearing from them before the end of this week in regard to accepting arbitration. <Col N="1409" /> This is something for which we have been pushing since last April.  Even before that at official level we were pushing for a friendly settlement which would have avoided the expense and trouble of arbitration.  It is by no means the case, as the Deputy may suspect, that at official or political level, the Government have not been following this matter with urgent attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary indicate the terms of the proposed friendly settlement which was not acceptable to the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We never got to the stage of a draft settlement.  The situation was that the basis on which the British wanted to draw a line was completely different from that on which we wanted to draw a line.  The essence of the difference was that the British wanted to regard all islands, however small or uninhabitable, as generating a maritime zone of their own, and we were prepared to recognise for that purpose only inhabited islands within three miles of the mainland.</P>
      <P>The proposed lines were so far apart that nothing remained for it but arbitration. We had hoped we might be able, by the conventional methods of negotiations, to bring the sides together, but repeated meetings failed to achieve that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Parliamentary Secretary any indication as to when this arbitration might get under way, in view of the fact that at the moment it is an arbitration of the British and that, until such time as that is resolved, we are still in the weaker position?  In other words, they are the ones who have made a claim and we are simply resisting their claim.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate&mdash;and this is the substance of the advice we have been getting, which is <Col N="1410" /> based on experience of arbitrations of the other countries; we have not had one so far&mdash;that excessively aggressive or provocative behaviour is not the best record to have behind you when going into an arbitration, and that a State which is able to say: &ldquo;We behaved all along reasonably and moderately&rdquo;, will impress an arbitration tribunal more than one which has behaved provocatively.  I am not saying that had we taken Deputy O'Kennedy's line it would have been provocative but the advice we got was that the best line was to be vigilant and moderate.</P>

I understand that the substance of the regulation will be that boats of more than 110 feet will not be allowed within an area designated by reference to base lines but no part of which is less than 50 miles from the mainland.</P>

      <P>In the interest of the recognition of this House, I should point out that I have a question down on precisely this point.  This question was directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but it has been transferred to the Minister for Fisheries. The question has been down for at least four or five days.  I must protest at the absolute contempt shown for this House and for the Members by reason of the Minister making the announcement outside on the issue concerned.  If this is the way in which the Government wish to behave, they cannot expect support from this side.</P>

    <Title>Bula Limited (Acquisition of Shares) Bill, 1977: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 2:</P>
    <P>In page 2, subsection (1), line 18, after &ldquo;acquire&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, after full and final planning permission has been obtained for a partly opencast lead/zinc mine at Nevinstown, Navan, County Meath, by the Company&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy O'Malley.)</P>
    <Col N="1432" />
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In this amendment we are seeking the provision merely that payment be postponed until after planning permission has been granted, that is, if it is to be granted, to Bula Limited.  This is normal procedure in the case of any company or concern buying property for development.  It is usual to insert a clause in any contract of sale between the two parties concerned stating that the contract is subject to planning permission being granted by the planning authority.  We see no reason for the amendment not being acceptable to the Minister or for his adopting the unusual course of paying out £9.54 million of public money to the shareholders concerned, in the absence of planning permission.</P>
      <P>During his contribution the Minister said that the arbitrators, at the date of valuation&mdash;the 12th December, 1975&mdash;took into account the position of planning.  Are we to assume from that that the arbitrators considered that no planning application was necessary?  Certainly no planning application was submitted at that time.  In view of the information that is now common knowledge in relation to relevant dates&mdash;October 20th, 1976, having been the last date for submissions and the 12th November, 1976, being the date of the arbitrator's decision&mdash;are we to assume that during a period of 22 or 23 days the arbitrators were able to consider the complexities of the valuations and at the same time to adjudicate on the decision, not only of the Meath planning authority but also, possibly, of the Minister for Local Government in respect of a planning permission submitted subsequently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must have regard to the fact that there is no mention of a river diversion in the planning application before the local authority.  These are some of the reasons for our maintaining that the Minister should accept the amendment.  He should accept our proposal in the interest of the public who are footing the bill to the tune of £9.54 million.  The Minister has no control in relation to the length of time it will take for the planning application to be considered.  He referred on the last occassion to the case of Schering-Plough in Clonmel.  He knows <Col N="1433" /> that many people may appeal against the granting of permission in relation to the Bula venture.  For instance, members of An Taisce and residents of the area as well as other interests may make their voices heard.  We recall the length of time that elapsed before a decision was reached in relation to an application in respect of the Dublin Bay oil refinery.  After a few years of protest from the interests concerned, the case was heard orally, the hearing being conducted during a fairly considerable period of time. Afterwards there was a delay until the Minister's decision was given.  Apart from this instance there are many reasons that can be cited for asking the Minister to accept Deputy O'Malley's amendment.  It is normal practice in relation to contracts, particularly those concerning development, that no payment is made until such time as planning permission has been obtained.  At least only the minimal deposits would be paid in such cases and these are returnable to the potential purchaser in the event of the permission not being granted.</P>
    <P>The least the Minister can do in the interest of the public is to afford them the protection we are seeking for them in this amendment and not to subject them to a long delay such as the lengthy delays that have been experienced in regard to many planning applications during the past few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had replied on the last occasion to the previous speakers on this question.  There is no point in my repeating that reply at length but, for the Deputy's information, I might tell him that, essentially what I said was that the question of the planning permission was raised extensively at an early stage with the arbitration board.  The relationship of that valuation was argued extensively and was taken into consideration in their final valuation.  I pointed out that the chairman of the arbitration board had a specialist knowledge in this area and that, had we waited for a time when the planning permission would have been final, such a delay would have been reflected in the arbitrator's <Col N="1434" /> price.  We have had a leisurely debate on this but I am making it clear that I am not prepared to accept the amendment because to do so would have the effect of putting the whole issue back into the melting pot.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that this mine was acquired five-and-a-half years ago by the people who now constitute Bula Ltd., and it has not even got preliminary or outline planning permission, I am with the Minister in his endeavour to try to bring it to a conclusion, but I am afraid it is being brought to the wrong conclusion at the expense of the taxpayers.  I put a number of specific points to the Minister when I last spoke here on this question, in relation to planning, which is fundamental to the whole of this operation, and the Minister did not answer any of them.  Instead the Minister gave us a lecture on how iniquitous it was for certain people to have objected to Schering-Plough. That is no good to us in this situation. We know that there are a large number of people objecting very strenuously to this application for permission, probably more in numbers than ever objected to Schering-Plough, and on the face of it they seem to have infinitely better grounds for objection. The planning application that has been made, and has been sent back by the Meath County Council, because their queries have not been answered, leaves out what is probably the most important single physical factor in the whole thing, the diversion of a river for two miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Patrick Delaney, one of the leading planning consultants in Ireland in the advice that he had to give to Lazards in a very short time when they were advising the Minister, pointed out that in his opinion this <Col N="1435" /> company would have to provide a cash deposit or a bond for at least £½ million, and probably more.  They are Mr. Delaney's exact words.  While in theory a company such as this or any company could provide a bond to cover this sort of contingency of repairing the damage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We should get back to the amendment which <Col N="1436" /> deals specifically with the matter of planning permission for the mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in full agreement with the Chair.  In relation to planning permission it will be necessary in this case for the company to give a bond of not less than £½ million, or if they cannot provide a bond they will have to make a cash deposit of not less than £½ million.  In practice I am informed by those who are familiar with the bond market, it is virtually impossible to get a bond of this kind from an insurance company today, particularly for a very large sum of this kind.</P>
      <P>In the view of one of the leading planning consultants in the country this will be one of the conditions of the planning permission if it is ever given. We discovered last week that this company have no cash subscription at all to their capital and have borrowings of about £4 million, and they will have to put down at least £½ million in cash. This is not impossible but it will create considerable difficulties and it is one of the many aspects of planning generally and the obtaining of planning permission which has not been taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The acceptance of my amendment would avoid these enormous difficulties for the Minister and the taxpayer.  The Minister refuses to accept the amendment in regard to a matter that any normal prudent businessman would regard as a matter of course before he committed any substantial amount of money.  Even the most unsophisticated inexperienced person buying a house would, through his solicitor, ensure that there was planning permission before he committed himself. Even the most unsophisticated purchaser would insist on seeing the planning permission or would at least make it a term of the contract before committing himself.  The Minister is paying out £9½ million of the taxpayers' money.  Despite advice which he has received to the effect that the planning difficulties here are very considerable, the Minister blandly and blindly goes ahead with this proposal.  I am entitled to ask where this £½ million is to come from.  Will it be borrowed, if and when the planning permission is given?  This <Col N="1437" /> is not a question of the likelihood or otherwise of this being made a condition. It is certain that it will be a condition.  It has already been imposed, I understand, in relation to the Tara mine by the Minister for Local Government when he gave planning permission on appeal some time ago to the Tara operation.</P>
    <P>The environmental problems that are created by the Bechtel proposed plans for Bula are infinitely greater that the environmental problems that are created by Tara, because Bechtel bank their whole planning on the fact that planning permission will be forthcoming to take out at least 50 per cent of the Bula ore by open-cast mining.  In the last few days we have seen a picket placed on the Tara operation because of noise and excessive traffic in the area of the mine and because of the way the roads are being cut up as a result of this traffic.  The noise problem must be fairly serious if the local residents saw fit to block the road in protest.  Whatever noise or other environmental difficulties there are at present will be infinitely worse when we come to open-cast mining.  The Meath County Council, as befits them, are very well aware of these difficulties.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister realise the difficulties that are created by proposals for widespread open-cast mining a half mile from a fairly sizeable town and only 100 yards from houses?  The planning authority will have to take this type of thing into account and the period of extraction will also have to be taken into account.  If 50 per cent is to be taken out by open-cast mining, and the mine has a life of 12 years, does this mean that this will go on for six years plus the preparatory period before that?  The hours of working will also have to be taken into account.  I went into these matters the last day but the Minister totally ignored them.  The hours of working matter greatly in this operation.  The open-cast lead and zinc mines in the Australian desert, for example, work 24 hours a day.  Obviously this mine if it is going to be open-cast cannot work 24 hours a day because of the noise, dirt and everything else.  These are matters that are so imponderable that <Col N="1438" /> anybody who would blindly walk into buying that situation before he knows the approximate answers to these is acting in a way that borders on financial lunacy.</P>
    <P>The other important question is that of rationalisation of blasting.  It is not a question of doing damage to the 300 or 350 houses in the immediate vicinity of this orebody.  A very important question that has not been adverted to by the Minister is that this blasting which is an inevitable part of open-cast mining will have to go on within a few hundred yards, perhaps as few as 200 yards, of an underground mine in which there are hundreds of miners working.  Obviously the planning authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is regrettable, not for me personally but for the standing of this House, that a charge of that kind can be made and allowed to stand. The very first words I uttered on Second Reading in this debate were, and I quote now from memory: &ldquo;I hold no brief in this matter for anybody&rdquo;. Those words were true then and they are true now and they will be true until the day, in a month or two or three, whenever it is that this Bill is passed through this House.  I make no apology to anybody for doing my duty in this House.  My duty I am doing and my duty I will continue to do and I will not be diverted from doing my duty by mean, petty, vindictive and spiteful attacks that have been made on me, today by Deputy Esmonde and on television recently by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when the very weakness of his own case leaves him no option but to seek to take advantage and to twist the fact that I alone was honourable enough to stand up in this House and say that I once had a paltry interest in a mine that is not the subject of this debate.</P>
      <P>Efforts were made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce because of the weakness of his own case to try to cast doubts on me personally.  I am not going to fall for that trap. I do not want to continue on that line because there is nothing that the Government, and in particular the Minister for Industry and Commerce, would like better than a diversion of this kind.  I am taking advice about my rights in this matter, but whatever rights I may be advised I have and which I may exercise as a result of that advice, I will not exercise them until this debate is concluded in order that no diversion will be allowed from the merits of the proposal that the Minister put before this House and the details of which he will not reveal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am entitled in the circumstances to place some facts before the House.  I said in my foolish honesty that I had bought, I understood, in 1972 100 shares in Tara at about £5.  For his own purposes the Minister <Col N="1442" /> attempted to turn that into 1,500 dollars to make it sound more impressive. In fact, as a result of a search by my wife the other night, I found the contract note for the shares in question.  They are dated 17th January, 1972.  The number of shares bought was 50.  The price was £7.95, not £5 as I had erroneously thought.  The consideration was the princely sum of £397.50.</P>
    <P>This is the sum out of which I was supposed to make my fortune.  In fact, I lost more than one-third of that sum. I inquired from my colleague, Deputy Lalor, as to the giving of an undertaking by him.  An undertaking of which I have a copy was given, as a result of a public request by Tara Exploration and Development Company Limited, by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, not by the Government, to that company in order to enable them to try to start getting their mine into operation and to try to arrange the financing of it.  That undertaking was given on 1st April, 1971, about eight months before I bought these shares.  The fact that it was given was publicised&mdash;I do not know whether or not by the Department&mdash;by Tara within a day or two of getting it.  It was their duty as a public company officially quoted on two stock exchanges to give this information which was very relevant to the value of the shares.  It was also necessary for them to publicise it so that they could approach the banks with whom they had been negotiating to try to get finance.</P>
    <P>The undertaking was simply an undertaking in principle to give a mining lease.  I think the signature is C.A. Barry, an officer authorised in this behalf by the said Minister.  The last sentence reads that the lease will be granted on terms and subject to any covenants, conditions and subsidiary agreements the Minister may consider proper or desirable in the public interest. A more detailed undertaking so far as the names of townlands and things like that were concerned was given subsequently on 20th August, 1971, about four or five months before I purchased this miserable holding of <Col N="1443" /> shares, 50 miserable shares, as a result of advice from a member of my family who, as far as I recall, advised me at the time to buy a few thousand, but 50 were all I was able to rise to. Having regard to the way things turned out, it was very fortunate for me that I was not able to take the advice I was given in full because, instead of losing about £100, if I had been able to buy a few thousand shares presumably I would have lost a few thousand pounds.</P>
    <P>These two undertakings of which I have no recollection of their coming before the Government and which Deputy Lalor says did not come before the Government were given months before I purchased this miserable little holding for £397.  They had no bearing on the matter and, in fact, I did not even know they were given other than what I read in the daily newspapers.</P>
    <P>I am putting these facts on the record of this House so that this diversionary tactic by the Minister and some of his ill-advised cohorts might once and for all come to an end, and we might get back to dealing with the merits and demerits which seem to far outweigh the merits of this proposed agreement.  I hope that is the end of it so far as the Minister and any of his supporters are concerned.</P>
    <P>The other factor involved, and the final one to which I want to make reference, is that when I pointed out that I voluntarily gave this information in the House when I was under no obligation to do so, the Minister in his sly fashion said: &ldquo;Oh yes, but you knew I would find out about it&rdquo;.  I knew perfectly well that the Minister or anybody else could not find out about it.  No register of shareholders is kept in Ireland for this company.  In fact, I was never registered as a shareholder and I never actually became a shareholder.  There is no way the Minister or anyone else could prove that I or anybody else was a shareholder. I knew that perfectly well.</P>

      <P>The fact is that we are now dealing with a smear, a deliberate, baseless smear, produced primarily by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Stretching the situation very far, one could forgive the Minister for having done so in this House.  What I cannot forgive him for is that cold bloodedly and with premediatation, he went on television and repeated this baseless smear.  Deputy O'Malley disclosed in this House without any obligation to do so the fact that he had purchased 50 shares in Tara.  I think he said 100 at the time.  He had no obligation to do so.  When Deputy O'Malley pointed out that he had disclosed this fact <Col N="1445" /> voluntarily, the Minister pretended he had information which would have enabled him to-disclose this fact.  I say &ldquo;pretended&rdquo; because, on the face of it, the Minister could not have that information.</P>
      <P>If he had that information, then presumably, he has information about the purchase of shares in that same company by colleagues of his in the Government, or close relatives of such colleagues.  Those purchases, if made by members of the Government or close relatives of theirs, were made by members of a Government who were in negotiation with Tara in regard to the terms of their lease, unlike Deputy O'Malley who was a member of a Government who were never in negotiation with Tara in regard to the terms of their lease.</P>
      <P>The undertaking referred to by Deputy O'Malley was given by Deputy Lalor as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It was an undertaking to grant a lease.  No company I am aware of who had a licence to explore for minerals and discovered minerals were ever refused a lease.  So, they were getting an undertaking to do what had been done in every other company.  As quoted by Deputy O'Malley, that undertaking contained the paragraph which clearly left the Minister for Industry and Commerce, whoever he might be, totally free as to what terms he would impose on Tara.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, since no mining lease had been granted for many years prior to this, the fact is that the Fianna Fáil Government set up an inter-departmental committee to advise on the kind of terms which would be appropriate in the new situation where Ireland was now a recognised centre for mineral development.  There is no way in which not only Deputy O'Malley but even Deputy Lalor as Minister for Industry and Commerce could have any knowledge of what terms would finally emerge in regard to a lease with Tara but members of the present Government were involved in negotiations with Tara and in fixing the terms of the lease and I think we are entitled to ask for a categoric assurance that no member of this Government and no close relative of <Col N="1446" /> a member of it has purchased any shares in that company.</P>
    <P>I recognise, as do most people, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce produces this as a diversionary tactic, that he was cornered and that he is covering up something in regard to Bula and that he wanted at all costs to divert attention from it.  I could make some unkind comments on that reaction but I shall not.  It would be possible perhaps by stretching one's charity a very long distance to forgive the Minister for doing that in the heat of debate here but I cannot forgive him for cold-bloodedly and with premeditation repeating that baseless smear on television.  I marvel at the enormous restraint of Deputy O'Malley in the face of this provocation by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I marvel at it particularly because there is no Deputy, on this side of the House certainly, who has a greater knowledge than Deputy O'Malley of the contents of the reports he received as Minister for Justice of the necessary surveillance of the activities of Mr. Justin Keating in his communist activities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this matter has now been travelled for some time by the Opposition I should like to make a few observations.  First, let me make the gravamen of my criticism of Deputy O'Malley absolutely clear.  It is not a matter of one share, 50 or 100 shares; it is a matter of a Minister purchasing shares in a company about which collectively, he might be required to make a decision or had made a decision.  I think that is a conflict of interest situation and it is very foolish, if no worse, for any Minister to have done that.  I believe it to have been an improper thing to do.  But it is the purchasing by a Minister that I think is the fault.  That Deputies own shares is, I think, perfectly normal and that Deputies will buy and sell shares is perfectly normal.  Indeed, if Ministers are appointed when they own shares, personally I do not think they should buy or sell any shares while they are Ministers but in my view they should certainly not buy or sell any about which they might be required to exercise judgment.  I think that is a fairly clearly understood position; it is fairly clear in other countries and I think it ought be clearer here.  I think it was a piece of foolishness, if no worse, on the part of Deputy O'Malley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I did.  I have the record of the files of my Department which say that prior to the granting of the undertaking that the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lalor, deferred a decision at his departmental conference until the matter went to Government.  I believe <Col N="1448" /> on the basis of these departmental files that the matter was discussed in Government. Deputy Colley understands perhaps better than most people that there is collective responsibility.  I want to make this perfectly clear: I think it is improper for any Minister to buy even one share in any company, or to sell it, or to make any decision about its acquisition or disposal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I can speak for myself with absolute clarity; I have had absolutely no share dealings of any kind while a Minister in foreign shares, Irish shares, mining shares or any other shares.  I cannot give the sort of blanket assurance Deputy Colley asks for and he knows I cannot because he is an experienced lawyer and therefore he knows that is a lawyer's question.  I am assailed with great passion for descending from the proprieties of debate when I reproach a former Minister for having done something which I think, if it is discussed in the country and if the attitudes in this country and in other countries are taken into consideration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going through some of the difficulties that arise in relation to open-cast mining from an environmental point of view.  I was pointing out the cost, which is likely to be very high, of complying with the likely conditions that would be imposed. Because those costs are unknown at the moment it is impossible to make any investment in respect of the shares in this private company, particularly for a minority holding at this figure, and say with even approximate certainty that one is doing the right thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel I am entitled to ask what consultants advised the Minister in relation to the environmental effects of the proposed open-cast mine.  I understand a firm from Surrey were advising him for some time, but were found, for some reason, to be unsatisfactory and an Irish semi-State body, the IIRS, were brought in in August, 1976.  They gave certain advice <Col N="1453" /> regarding noise from the open-cast mine which was somewhat fundamentally at variance with the advice already given.  The first advice was given to the Department.  Then they were consulted by Bula Ltd. and a preliminary meeting was held with them in the middle of December, 1976, on various environmental matters.  In February, 1977, the IIRS accepted a commission to act as consultants for Bula Ltd.  This was agreed after discussion with the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>In his Second Reading speech the Minister gave a list of people who had advised the Department from various points of view.  One of them was the IIRS.  We assumed, until I made this discovery as a result of my more recent inquiries, that they were acting in an independent capacity, as a semi-State body, acting in the public interest, worried about the environment and anxious to preserve the environment as best they could.  I now discover they are private consultants to the company concerned, which is a different situation.  One of the strangest things of all, I understand, is that one of the Minister's directorsdesignate of Bula Ltd. is the head of the section in IIRS that deal with the environment.  The Minister should be frank about this matter because the IIRS have made inquiries from various State and planning bodies as to whether they would be required in this matter.  They were told &ldquo;no&rdquo; and that there was no objection to their giving advice to the Department.  Now they end up as consultants to Bula and one of their senior officials is proposed by the Minister as a director of Bula. To put it mildly, this creates a difficult situation for the public at large because the semi-State body which we had assumed, from what the Minister said, was looking after our environmental interests as a whole, now have, on the nomination of the Minister, one of their senior officials as a director-designate of the company. This is not a trivial matter.  It requires full explanation and is causing a great deal of heart-searching within the IIRS as to exactly where they <Col N="1454" /> stand and what their loyalties are in this situation at this time.</P>
    <P>I understand that the appointment has not been made because it has to be ratified by the board of the IIRS. For some reason that I cannot fathom but which must be known to the Minister there has been no board of the IIRS up to quite recently.  As far as I know there was an interval of several months between the expiration of the period of office of the last board and the appointment within the last few weeks of this new board.  The newspapers commented on the fact that anybody, no matter how able, who had even the faintest taint of Fianna Fáil about him was removed from the IIRS board.</P>

        <i>Hibernia</i> some weeks ago gave a list of people who had been removed from State boards whose qualifications would appear to have warranted their retention.  The <i>Sunday Independent</i> had some similar comments to offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have the situation where the IIRS are installed as environmental advisers or consultants to Bula and apparently also to the Minister.  It is only now that these environmental problems which are major and basic in this affair are being fully tackled by the IIRS.  It is beyond me how the Minister can suggest that either he or the arbitrators were able to take into account planning conditions and difficulties as of 12th December, 1975 or even how they could have done so in respect of 20th October, 1976, which was the last date for the receipt of submissions to the board of arbitrators. I have the names and qualifications of the arbitrators and none of them, as far as I know, has any planning or mining qualifications.  We are entitled <Col N="1455" /> to ask if the Minister received any reports from anyone other than Bechtel which were not as optimistic as Bechtel's report on the question of the possibility of widespread open-cast mining.  My belief is that he did. He got a preliminary report in September from the IIRS when they were advising him, as opposed to Bula.  They expressed considerably less optimism than Bechtel about the environmental question.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should now publish the report of the IIRS on the question of the feasibility of widespread open-cast mining from the environmental point of view.  The precedent I would suggest for the publication of this report is the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce published the report of An Foras Forbartha on the location of oil refineries during the hearing of the appeal on the planning application for an oil refinery in Dublin Bay.  In fact, the publication took place while the public oral hearing was in progress.  It seems to me that what the IIRS have to say on this matter is very similar to what An Foras Forbartha would have had to say.  The content may not be the same but the principle and the circumstances are the same.</P>
    <P>I quote now not from the Lazard report, which is offensive, apparently, to some people, but from one of the numerous newspaper accounts we have had of it in which they, the newspapers, quote Lazards as saying in relation to planning permission generally:</P>
    <P>Bula's initial application to the planning authority does not include application for consent to divert the river.  This diversion is critical to the overall profitability of Bula's undertaking.  We are advised that the planning authority may not be prepared to consider these applications separately.  At the least, delays beyond those included in our cash flow are therefore probable.  Alternatively, there is the risk if Bula is allowed to proceed with initial development that consent to the river diversion may subsequently be refused.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1456" /> In the light of that statement, is the Minister really serious when he says that the arbitrators took the planning problems into account?  How could they have taken such problems into account?  How could they allow for such enormous imponderables as Lazards mention there?  It is not possible to do so.</P>
    <P>I regret that I am forced to repeat many of the questions I asked previously which were not answered by the Minister.  I repeat them in the hope that they might be answered today. The question of planning is not just one of the minor hurdles along the way.  The question of planning permission and conditions attached to it is fundamental to the resolution of every one of the investment or financial criteria which I set out here at length and in detail in my speech on Second Reading and which I summarised towards the end of that speech in 20 points.  The Minister said two of the points were true and 18 were untrue.  He said it was true that planning permission had not been obtained and that permission to divert the river had not been even applied for.  Those points were numbers one and ten but numbers two to nine could not be answered by anybody unless number one had been complied with.  Numbers two to nine were fundamental criteria for the valuation of this company and those criteria could not be complied with and the necessary knowledge could not be there unless point number one, the granting of planning permission, was already complied with. The obtaining of planning permission and knowledge of the conditions attached to it are fundamental to the whole concept of this rather ill-fated investment.  Without this, it is a leap in the dark.</P>
    <P>By agreeing to pay this money the Minister has put himself in a position into which no prudent person would put himself.  He has been outmanoeuvred and out-negotiated by four very fortunate people.  I am not denigrating them or their company but I am critising the Minister who has put the taxpayer in this position and put the four surviving shareholders and the representatives of its <Col N="1457" /> deceased one in a happy personal position.  They have got a vast amount of money.  As I have said repeatedly, it is their good luck that they were able to out-manoeuvre and out-negotiate the Minister so successfully.  I am entitled to criticise the Minister who has allowed himself to be walked into this situation.</P>

      <P>We are really having a repetition today of the debate the last day.  We had a repetition the last day of some of the debates we had on the Second Stage.  We are going round and round in circles.  I said on the Second Stage and on the last day we discussed the matter that everybody who is not striving to be mischievous is seeking the best possible trade-off between the protection of the environment on the one hand and the exploitation of the ore on the other hand.  It is not for me or for any other Deputy to offer expert or pseudo-expert opinion as to where that best trade-off is.  That is to be determined by the responsible people under our planning mechanism.</P>
      <P>Those people should be able to do their task without interference and without coercion from any of us and without either pooh-poohing difficulties or generating this hysteria.  I believe they will do that task.  I believe that the best trade-off will be found.  Our planning mechanism exists to protect the environment, on the one hand, and to enable economic life to go on, on the other.  If our planning mechanism is allowed to function uninhibited, if people are not terrified and if hysteria is not generated, it will reach a decision. That is its job, which I believe it will do well and fairly.  That is all I seek.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come back to the essential point of the people in this House, or our expert advisers, trying to be wiser than the people who are experts and who have given advice to a board of arbitrators, where I understand the chairman was a planning expert, where they went to visit the site on the ground and where it is quite a normal procedure to arbitrate before things <Col N="1458" /> are settled in a definitive way.  I am repeating myself.  I believe that is their job.  I believe they will do it.  I believe all the relevant considerations were properly put before the arbitrators.  I believe those considerations were looked at by the arbitrators.  I believe the balancing of those considerations came out in the amount settled by the arbitrators.  Now I believe that if the mechanism is not hindered in its operation it will do what it is designed to do, that is, to give us the best balance of environmental protection and economic development.  I do not believe it will do other than that by going to extremes in either direction.  I believe it will find that trade-off.  It is not for me to say where that is and I will not try to influence them.</P>

      <P>The last day&mdash;volume 296, column 1219 of the Official Report&mdash;the Minister said:</P>
      <P>The board consisted of three people, one a lawyer and an engineer, a rare combination in those important skills, a man who had considerable experience of planning because he had been involved in planning applications and planning permissions; another an accountant with money skills, and the third an engineer with technological skills.</P>
      <P>The three members of the board were three Englishmen.  The main argument put forward by the Minister for not accepting Deputy O'Malley's amendment is that they were experts in planning. He said last Wednesday, and he repeated it again today, that he was satisfied that they had planning ability and experience.  As far as we are aware they had no knowledge whatsoever of our Planning Acts or the planning applications in this country. We do not know if they had such experience of English planning laws. The Minister's argument for not accepting Deputy O'Malley's amendment is that they had knowledge of Planning Acts and planning applications, according to his own statement.  We feel that is not an argument for refusing to accept Deputy O'Malley's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <P>I said the chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The chairman was Cedric Barclay, electrical engineer and shipping owner.  The other two members were Michael H. Hinton, an accountant in Cork, Gully, chartered accountants and liquidators, and Richard J. Soper, an engineer and a barrister.  It may be suggested that the barrister had some planning experience in that he took part in applications for planning permission or in CPOs but so did Deputy Barrett, Deputy Colley and I during our time and we would not hold ourselves out as experts.  Of those three gentlemen one dissented, I am told, but under the terms of the agreement of 12th December, 1975, the three of them signed the report on the basis that it would appear to be unanimous.  I do not think it would be right to speculate or to say which of them dissented.  One of them apparently was of the opinion that the valuation was far too high.</P>
      <P>It is absolutely idiotic for the Minister to say that those three men were capable of taking into account all the planning considerations and valuing the property accordingly.  It may well be that the barrister is familiar with English planning law.  His practice may have to do with planning or he may have experience in planning.  But English planning laws are completely different from Irish planning laws. Planning law is not the accumulated common law of centuries.  It is a wholly statutory and modern thing. Each country has its own type of planning law and that law in England is quite fundamentally different from what it is here.  Even if they had some experience of English planning law I do not think it could be claimed by the Minister that any of them had any experience or knowledge of Irish planning law or Irish planning permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that these men, while very good men in their own respective fields, had no great knowledge of mining and no particular knowledge in this specific field.  That was one of the criticisms made by Mr. Fraser of Lazard Brothers.  He said that in England they had given up this type of arbitration and described it as a <Col N="1461" /> kind of a hit-and-miss thing.  He said they now concentrated on arbitration by very skilled men, expert evaluation, and that was much better than three distinguished arbitrators who were tending, only because of the enormous conflict of evidence, to pick a kind of middle figure that seemed to them to be reasonable in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister locked himself into that outdated system of arbitration. I should like to remind him, when he runs behind the skirts of these arbitrators at every possible moment to try and defend himself, of the fact that the State has habitually refused to lock itself into an arbitration where it may be suited by the result.  A classical example&mdash;it is one that is in use daily&mdash;is the Land Commission. Anybody who knows how the Land Commission operate is aware that, if there is disagreement about the price of land the commission are trying to acquire, the landowner from whom it is being acquired can appeal to the judicial commissioner on the question of price.  The judicial commissioner, having heard the evidence, fixes a price.  If the Land Commission or the State do not like that they need not go ahead with it.</P>
    <P>That has been the position for many years, and properly so, because the Land Commission do not wish to get locked into situations where the land would be too expensive for them. Because land is so expensive, and consequential annuities on the division of land are so high, the Land Commission find it hard in some of the more prosperous parts of the country from the agricultural point of view to get people to take land.  They are now using their power to get out of the arbitration decision.  They are going back to owners, as they can do within weeks of the judicial commissioner giving his decision, telling them the land is too dear and they do not want it.  It is causing a lot of difficulty and upset for the landowners, some of whom have sold their stock in the belief that the land would be taken from them.  They have to restock at a higher price, but from the State's point of view it is a reasonable and wise precaution.  If the Land Commission are prepared to do that in <Col N="1462" /> respect of small farms valued at £20,000 or £30,000, why is the Minister not prepared to do it in respect of something which has now-been valued, to his cost and to ours, at £40 million? He is not even going to buy the mine for the figure; he will have a minority interest and can be outvoted daily on every topic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not made a good argument against accepting this amendment.  He has told us that he has expert advice.  It appears that he is preparing his defence against the possibility of this project failing. He is anxious to be able to show that it would not be his mistake if that happened, that the mistake would be the fault of the experts.  That is a longterm defence by the Minister.  The Minister has accused us of asking questions which were put at an earlier stage of the debate.  On 2nd February, replying to Deputy O'Malley, the Minister criticised the figures he put forward as the amount needed for developing the mine.  He said that Deputy O'Malley gave a range of figures between £35 million and £45 million for preproduction capital investment and continued, as reported at column 703 of the Official Report of that date:</P>
      <P>In my view the lower figure he suggested would be the upper figure of the expert estimates I have received, and estimates substantially lower have been made by reputable experts after detailed studies.</P>
      <P>We have heard a lot of talk since the debate on this Bill began about scales of estimates.  I understand that at arbitration Bula covered a field from something more than £60 million up to £104 million as their expert estimate of the value of the mine.  However, the Minister accepted the figure of £35 million as a preproduction capital investment figure and the upper limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been endeavouring to extract from the Minister a figure or a range of figures which would be the upper limit cost on the assumption that the planners would specify that a list of precautions would need to be taken in connection with the mine. It should be remembered that every precaution that has to be taken costs <Col N="1463" /> money.  The Minister made great play of the fact that he is worried about the environment and listening to him on one occasion I got the impression that he invented the environment.  If planning permission is obtained in relation to opencast mining the company may be involved in expensive investment. The Minister should give us some projection in relation to costs. He has told us that he is satisfied, on the advice given to him by experts, that planning permission will be granted and that it will not lay down conditions that will prove too prohibitive.  He is confident that they will be able to fulfil the most stringent conditions and at the same time be in a position to provide <Col N="1464" /> the capital required for the overall development.  The amendment would build in necessary safeguards in respect of which we have a national responsibility. We want to protect the interests of those who will put money into the enterprise.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), line 18, before &ldquo;shares&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;not less than forty-nine per cent of the issued&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is simply to spell out&mdash;unfortunately it is not spelled out in the Bill&mdash;what the Minister has told us he is acquiring, namely, 24 per cent by purchase and 25 per cent by gift.  The total number of shares at the moment would come to 449,000 on the basis that there are 1,000,000 shares issued, all incidentally for a consideration other than cash, and if this represents what is happening, and we have to some extent to take this on faith because we have not seen the agreement, then there is no reason at all why the Minister should not accept this amendment. It is plain and straightforward and simply puts into words what the Minister himself has told us.</P>
      <P>There are very significant words in this subsection: &ldquo;The Minister may acquire shares of the Company in accordance with the Agreement....&rdquo; This is not just an ordinary straightforward buying of shares.  It is buying in accordance with the agreement, the agreement being the agreement of 12th December, 1975.  We have not seen the agreement.  We made a valiant effort to try to get it and the Minister refuses to disclose it for reasons that only give rise to suspicion in the public mind.  These particular shares covered by this subsection are not being acquired in the open market, or anything like that, because this is a private company.  They are not even being acquired openly in the private company, <i>pari passu,</i> or with equal rights in other shares.  They are being acquired &ldquo;in accordance with the Agreement&rdquo;.  We have not seen that agreement and, not having seen the agreement, how can this House, if it is doing its job conscientiously, vote to acquire shares in accordance with an agreement it has not seen?  It may well be that the Minister may end up with less than 49 per cent.  There may well be contingencies provided for in this agreement whereby he will end up with less than 49 per cent.  We want to be told if that is right and, if it is right, then the Minister will accept the amendment.  If it is not right he may have to take certain other courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These words &ldquo;in accordance with the Agreement&rdquo; are enormously important because there could be ten or 20 clauses in that agreement covering the rights of acquisition of shares, the right to dividends, the right to vote and various other rights.  I have demonstrated already&mdash;the Minister by his silence has agreed&mdash;that although he is purchasing 49 per cent of the shares and even if he were to get the 10 per cent <Col N="1467" /> Wright holding to vote with him, that combined total of 59 per cent of the shares would in certain circumstances be outvoted at a general meeting by the 41 per cent held by the Roche, Wymes and Woods shareholders.  This is a monstrous situation.  Not alone is the State in a minority but it has built itself into a permanent minority even if it acquires a majority holding in terms of shares, by virtue of the Wright family voting with the State or selling their shares to the State, it will still be in a minority position when it comes to voting.  We pay £9½ million at the very least for that.  That situation is covered by the words in the subsection &ldquo;in accordance with the Agreement&rdquo;. If the Minister has been telling us the truth in relation to the shareholding, let us at least put in the words concerned. This is in accordance with what the Minister has stated and, for that reason, I shall be very surprised if he fails to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>As is obvious from the newspapers in the last few days, there is every possibility of additional shares coming on the market.  I do not mean on the open market but on the very limited market that is available for shares of a private limited company, particularly in a minority holding.  I am referring to the Wright family shares.  They may want to sell as a result of the death of Mr. Patrick Wright; in certain circumstances they may have to sell in order to raise cash to pay capital acquisitions tax for which they will be liable.  Incidentally, I want to make it clear that the liability for this tax arises only because unfortunately Mr. Wright died.  If he had not died there would be no liability for tax of any kind. There is no liability on the other four individuals concerned.  It arises in relation to the Wright holding only because Mr. Wright died last April.  Some of the family may want to sell because they may not want to be involved in this rather messy operation.  They may need to sell in order to pay the tax and presumably the only person to whom they can go to sell the shares is the Minister because he is the only one in the market with unlimited funds. As it was rather nicely put the other day, he is almost in the position of <Col N="1468" /> an institutional investor; this phrase was used in the form of what I presume to be a kind of mock advertisement. He is almost an institutional investor with unlimited taxpayers' funds, ready to invest large sums in speculative undertakings.  He is available to take up the Wright shares and such other shares as come on the market.  There is nobody else.</P>
    <P>It is very unlikely that the 41 per cent block will buy the Wright shares. I do not know where they will get the cash unless they borrow more.  However, the Minister has unlimited institutional taxpayers' funds available. For example, he might buy all the Wright shares, he might go up to 59 per cent and, because of the words &ldquo;in accordance with the Agreement&rdquo; he would be in the same position as if he had 40 per cent because he would be outvoted by the 41 per cent. I cannot guard against this.  All I can do is to try to ensure by way of amendment that at least the Minister does not end up with less than 49 per cent.  That is the purpose of the amendment.  It is in accordance with what the Minister has said and I can only assume that he will accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 4, which is simple in terms of figures at least even if it is not simple in anything else, is to reduce the amount payable from £9.54 million to £1 million.  There is no particular sanctity so far as we are concerned about £1 million.  It is a figure taken roughly to represent the value of 24 per cent of the shares in this company on the basis that the most prestigious valuation, that of Lazard Brothers, was £7.75 million for the entire value of the undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1469" /> Throughout the debate there has been a misapprehension among many speakers that 24 per cent of the shares of the company are worth 24 per cent of what the company is worth.  At the outset I wish to make it clear that that is not so.  They are not worth 24 per cent of what the company is worth, or anything like it.  It is noteworthy that Lazards did not value the 24 per cent which the Minister was purchasing at 24 per cent of their valuation of the entire undertaking.  They just said that for the purposes of the arbitration their valuation of the entire undertaking was £7.75 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what they were asked to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not go on to say that 24 per cent of the shares in the undertaking was worth 24 per cent of that figure.  I assume they were not asked to but they did not volunteer the information in any event.  I want to make it clear that 24 per cent of the shares of Bula Limited are not worth 24 per cent of what Bula Limited is worth.</P>
      <P>Let us leave aside the question of its value at the moment.  Accept any value at all, even the valuation of £106 million or some of the other rather extraordinary figures.  That does not matter.  The point is that a minority holding in a private limited company has very little rights.  It is quite different in a public company because shares can be bought and sold on the stock exchange and a large block in a public company, such as 49 per cent or even 24 per cent, would be a very significant and powerful holding.  It would enable the holder to wield enormous influence in the company.  If a person had 49 per cent he would be virtually in control because, generally speaking, there would not be any fully organised combination of votes against him.  In particular, in the memorandum and articles of a public company or in any agreement that it would sign and subsequently have to publish, there would not be anything that would prevent him wielding the power that 24 per cent or 49 per cent would give him. However, a private company is totally different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1470" /> In this company there are only three sets of shareholders, there are only three blocks.  There is the 41 per cent Roche-Wymes block, the 10 per cent Wright block and there is now the 49 per cent, the Minister's block.  We are dealing with only three entities in practice. It does not matter if some of the blocks are split up among a number of people almost invariably they will act together and the whole set-up seems to envisage this.</P>
    <P>Because there are three blocks and because it is a private limited company, anyone who has not got 51 per cent of the shares and <i>pari passu</i> with unfettered voting rights or, alternatively, a smaller amount that allows him to exercise total control over the company&mdash;in this case it is the 41 per cent, the Roche-Wymes-Woods block&mdash;has no say in the company and no control over its affairs.  Anybody with 25 per cent or more would be able to block a special resolution of the company and that is a limited power. Outside of that they would not have any powers of control.  Therefore, while the Minister is advised by an eminent merchant bank that the whole undertaking is worth £7.75 million, it is clear that 24 per cent of £7.75 million.  What the 24 per cent would be worth is a substantial discount of what 24 per cent would be.  Twenty-four per cent of £7¾ million would be close to £2 million, about £1.8 million or £1.9 million.</P>
    <P>To put a figure of £1 million on the shares in these circumstances is generous, bearing in mind that the £1 million is not being invested in the company.  It is a tax-free payment or handout to four individuals.  It is not helping Bula Ltd.  We have demonstrated that Bula Ltd. needs help because it is starved for cash.  It has heavy borrowings and no cash subscribed capital, or cash assets of any significance.  This money will not create a single job or bring the company nearer production by one day.  If I appear to denigrate the company I am sorry.  I am simply commenting on the objective facts as gleaned from the file in the Companies Office.  I am not to be taken as accepting the principle that the Minister should seek to buy <Col N="1471" /> a minority shareholding in a private limited company because I propose an amendment of this kind.  I would have no objection to his buying a minority shareholding in a public company where he would not be caught in the same way.  I have no objection to his buying a majority shareholding in a private company.  He has the worst of both worlds in that he is paying a vast amount of money to four individuals for their use and benefit without a penny of it going to the company.  The fact that I am proposing an alternative figure does not mean that I agree with the principle. I am faced with the problem on Committee Stage that the principle has presumably been accepted by the House and I could not put down an amendment that would be in conflict with that principle.</P>
    <P>I have gone into great detail in regard to the valuation of this company.  If the Minister was prepared to be more forthcoming about it and tried to justify what he has done, rather than hiding behind the coat tails of the arbitrators, I would not have to go into it again.  If he is going to continue his previous posture I will have to go through the details again.  I will have to show the extreme wastefulness of the proposal.  There has been a lot of talk about the Lazard valuation.  The reason for the talk is that Lazards are a firm of distinction in this field and have great ability and experience.  I imagine they charge high fees for work of this kind. I have a question down to the Minister in regard to the fee.  It would be worth knowing what the fee is in view of the fact that their advice was disregarded.</P>
    <P>At the Minister's request another company made a valuation of £960,000, which is less than the amended figure for 24 per cent.  That company is a subsidiary of the Industrial Credit Company and they might be expected to have the public interest in mind.  They might not be as experienced or as renowned as Lazards but they have experience in this field and would be prudent in their valuation.  Their valuation for the <Col N="1472" /> entire undertaking, was approximately 10 per cent of what the Minister is paying for 24 per cent.  The Minister will probably tell us, as he did in relation to Lazards, that they were not told to make a proper valuation, that they were only told to make a negotiating figure.  Incidentally, Lazards have denied that they got that brief and their denials have been reported in the newspapers and have not been denied by the Minister.  From my limited knowledge of Mergers Limited.  I am sure that they were not making a fake valuation for the purpose of trying to cod the arbitrators.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to &ldquo;negotiating values&rdquo;.  Since Mr. Fraser of Lazards took the gravest exception to these references to negotiating values, I can only assume that, like Lazards, Mergers Ltd. did not produce a negotiating value; they produced what they genuinely thought 100 per cent of the undertaking was worth.  In any other country it would be regarded as incredible that a Minister could pay ten times more for 24 per cent of something that his own semi-State advisers told him 100 per cent of it was worth and that he would try to brazen it out and say: &ldquo;The arbitrators fixed the price.  There is nothing I can do about it,&rdquo; after leaving it wide open to a very unfavourable and unsuitable figure, as, in fact, he ended up with.  If it becomes necessary I will go into the detailed question of valuation of this company.  I have a lot of notes here on it.  I do not want to go through it all now at this juncture, in the hope that it may not be necessary to do it and that the Minister may be somewhat more forthcoming than he has been hitherto on the whole question of this evaluation.  This £9.54 million, most of which it is proposed apparently to pay now and the rest <Col N="1473" /> next year and in two years from now, will earn no return for eight years at least.  I do not think that is disputed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is common case that the borrowings cannot be repaid for eight years, and since they have first claim on everything, it is very hard to see how a dividend can be expected within eight years or how tax on profits can be expected within eight years if it is a question of repaying borrowing and making allowance in the accounts for the extraordinarily generous write-offs there are in the 1974 Mining Taxation Act.</P>
      <P>I have good reason to assume I am right in saying that it would be eight years at least before a dividend would be seen.  Therefore, if that £9.54 million were invested&mdash;and I express this in two ways, positively and negatively &mdash;at the going rate, say, at 15 per cent, and that were compounded, at the end of eight years, one would have a figure of £29.18 million.  That is expressing it in the positive sense.  Express that in the negative sense&mdash;the other way around.  The Minister will have to borrow this money for capital investment&mdash;this is not an investment at all, it is only a purchase, but I presume it will be classified as capital, coming under the capital budget&mdash;and pay interest on it at approximately 15 per cent, which is roughly the going rate for money now, for eight years.  Compounding that interest&mdash;because, remember, he will have to pay interest in year two on the interest he paid in year one&mdash;gives you the same figure reversed, £29.18 million.  What appears here as an innocent, insignificant, we are led to believe, £9.54 million ends up with a payment, assuming there are no rights issues, guarantees or anything else necessary, of £29.18 million.</P>
      <P>That is, in fact, what the taxpayer is paying, because he has to repay the borrowing and repay the interest, and there will be interest on the interest as we go along until such time as a dividend is earned, and it is impossible, in my view, to see a dividend arriving within eight years in the particular circumstances of an undercapitalised company such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1474" /> There is one other figure I want to refer to briefly.  I do not want to go into the personal affairs of the family, but this is blazoned over the papers for the last few days, that is, the figure which the Revenue Commissioners have put on the late Mr. Wright's estate, which, I assume, consists almost entirely of his holding of shares in Bula Ltd.  When the calculation is made it is found that the Revenue Commissioners' valuation of Mr. Wright's shares in Bula Ltd. is almost identical with the calculation I made for the purpose of speaking about this valuation in my Second Stage speech.</P>
    <P>I stated there that by doing what he was doing the Minister was, in effect, creating a post-tax amount of capitalised profit or available profit for the shareholders in Bula of a little over £29 million.  That figure was pooh-poohed by the Minister.  He sneered at it and when I asked him to prove how it was wrong he told me he could not be bothered with that sort of thing, that it would give the financial journalists an evening's entertainment working out how it was wrong.</P>
    <P>It is significant that nobody worked but how it was wrong.  Deputy Staunton rushed in one day to say it was wrong. That is not quite the same thing as working out that it was wrong.  Deputy Staunton, unfortunately, did not give us the benefit of his calculations to disprove my figure, nor did he suggest any alternative figure for the concept on which I was speaking.  We merely have the statement of the Minister and Deputy Staunton that it was wrong. There has been nothing from anybody else to state that it was wrong.  However, very significantly, there is a valuation placed by the Revenue Commissioners at Dublin Castle on the holding of the late Mr. Wright which is almost entirely on all fours with my calculation of the creation of tax-free profit in respect of those shares.</P>
    <P>I would give the calculations as follows.  I do not know anything about the late Mr. Wright's affairs, but it is clear from the circumstances of this whole episode that the great bulk of his estate would have consisted of his shares in Bula Ltd., the money he was paid in respect of his land, and <Col N="1475" /> the contingent value of the further sum which is to be paid if and when the mine goes into production.  If one accepts that his shares which are being sold to the Minister would make £1.8 million, which is my calculation of his share, 20 per cent of £9.54 million &mdash;and that was presumably the figure accepted by the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;that leaves a balance from an estate of £6 million of £4.2 million. Deducting, say, £200,000&mdash;and I think that would probably be generous&mdash; for assets that were not connected with Bula Ltd., leaves a balance of £4 million in respect of his 10 per cent holding in Bula Ltd., or his prospective 10 per cent holding when the Minister would buy up the 24 per cent and take the 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>That values Bula, from a profit point of view, at £40 million.  Ten per cent of its shares have now acquired, as a result of the Minister's action, a value of £4 million, in the view of the Revenue Commissioners.  Therefore, 51 per cent of the shares acquire a value of just fractionally over £20 million; in fact, £20.23 million was the figure I gave on Second Stage.  This was borne out precisely by the Revenue Commissioners.  In the other case the 24 per cent sold to the Minister and the 51 per cent retained by the two blocks of existing shareholders amounts to 75 per cent.  I said that the Minister, in what he had done, had put a valuation in terms of post-tax profit on those holdings of £29.8 million.  I was told that I was mad in this regard.  I then grossed that to give the pre-tax figure on which that would have to be based but I was told that I was mad in that regard also.  At least I have the satisfaction of knowing that the Revenue Commissioners agree with my figures. I find the Commissioners a methodical group of men in matters of valuing shares.  They are not a group who can be codded easily.  They are extremely experienced in delving into realities. They do not skim the surfaces, as Deputy Staunton or, indeed, the Minister might do.  Give or take £100,000 they bore out exactly what I said the figures were.  They bore out also my <Col N="1476" /> assertion that the gross tax value had been created by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I shall be interested to know whether either the Minister or Deputy Staunton will take on the Revenue Commissioners and tell them that their calculations were wrong, that their valuation of the Wrights' shares was wrong.  They had a perfect yardstick. In one sense I am sorry for the Wrights.  They had no escape so far as this matter was concerned.  The Minister had bought 24 per cent and this immediately put an extraordinarily high price on the rest of the shares. It would be interesting to see what anybody who might wish to buy one or two per cent of the shares would be asked to pay.  But the Minister or the 41 per cent group might have the right to veto anyone coming forward to purchase shares.</P>
    <P>These, then, are a few observations I wish to make on the question of this valuation generally in the light of recent developments and even since I spoke on the Second Stage.  I can go into this question in greater detail, should that be required, after I have heard what the Minister and other Deputies have to say in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of scattered points that I would make first.  Deputy O'Malley has been making reference to two allegations that have appeared in newspapers but which have not been contradicted by me.  I do not take the lack of contradiction as affirmation.  Anybody who has been in the position of being a Minister knows that lots of allegations have been made which do not conform with the facts and that one sometimes contradicts but, on other occasions chooses to remain silent, having regard sometimes to such questions as, for instance, the importance of the place and the seriousness of the allegation and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lest the technique be used that because something has not been contradicted it must be true and at the risk of giving more importance than I consider should be given to some newspaper report, I wish to comment first on certain figures which appeared both in the Official Report <Col N="1477" /> and in some of the newspapers.  There are two figures in the Dáil record which, I think, any examination of the record would show, were <i>bona fide</i> misprints.  I had not the opportunity of reading the rough script in time to have these misprints corrected immediately.  One of them relates to the appearance of the figure 40 instead of 14.  What I said and what I meant was £14 million.  I was talking of the lower end of the spectrum of the valuation but it appeared as £40 million and some reports in the media have suggested that I gave a figure of between £40 million and £63 million.</P>
    <P>The other misprint related to the question of the amount of royalties per ton for the more than 25 million tons of ore taken out during an 11-year period.  The figure was 10 pence per ton and not £10 as the record shows.  However, the sentence that followed made clear what the correct figure was.  I am happy to correct the record now in that regard.</P>
    <P>The other group of areas I wish to correct relates to an on-going series of articles which have been written in the <i>Irish Independent</i> by Mr. Bruce Arnold and in which he claimed a number of inaccuracies on my part. On the question of how many Lazards reports or documents there were&mdash;it is important to note that the words attributed to me correctly are document or report&mdash;there is a Lazards valuation which is a single document and a single value was given but there is also the sensitivity report, a Lazards document presented to the arbitrators and which has been referred to in print by others.  This gave a whole grid of valuations.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should endeavour to give the reason for the cause of genuine misunderstanding rather than any wish for obfuscation on the part of anybody. Some of the confusion in the reporting of this matter has arisen in the following way: people know now that there were Bechtel, that there were a number of Carsbergs, that there were Lazards, that there were Mergers and so on but the original understanding on the part of the journalists was that there was only one of Lazards on our side and that was the one to which a great deal <Col N="1478" /> of prominence was given.  When I talked of a number of reports I was talking in the general sense and when I talked about there being more than one Lazards document, I had in mind the sensitivities analysis to which I made reference but it is correct that there was only one valuation, to use that specific word.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It was during the period that Lazards were covering.  It was approximately contemporaneous but I am not certain of the date.  Just a short while ago I disagreed with Deputy O'Malley when he counterposed two thoughts&mdash;that a valuation which on the one hand was honest and objective and a valuation which on the other hand was for the purpose of negotiation were neutrally exclusive.</P>
      <P>Valuations are undertaken for a variety of reasons.  There are valuations for probate, for insurance, valuations made by a purchaser, and by a vendor. Nobody suggests that the techniques are in any way reprehensible or improper or that there is anything bogus about any of those valuations.  They are perfectly well understood.  Perfectly clear techniques are used which are perfectly correct.  But the valuations do not come out the same.  For example, in the practice of a court, those who appear for prosecution and defence have access to the same laws and are both honourable people in good standing with the court.  Yet their pleas, using the same knowledge and the same court of law, come out rather differently very often, and there is nothing peculiar, dishonest or abnormal in that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We made it clear to Lazards that there was an arbitration procedure, that they were one of our advisers in this and that we wanted a valuation for the purpose of an arbitration proceeding. It is quite clear from the mandate <Col N="1479" /> that their job was to advise us in the valuation of Bula for use on our behalf in the arbitration proceedings for the acquisition of equity.  Arbitration and acquisition come into that, so they were on our side of an arbitration proceeding in which we were purchasers.  To call that a negotiating valuation is not to imply any impropriety on the part of Lazards, but neither were Bechtels, Carsbergs or Sykes valuations improper. These are all people, with Lazards, of very high standing.  Anyone who is concerned to look at arbitration proceedings and at the submissions made to them in any sort of neutral spirit, knows that what I am saying describes the situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley has indicated that he may go into a vast amount of detail, if I do not do certain things, but if that is necessary so be it.  Notwithstanding the assaults on me, I must indicate that the arbitrators were competent, reputable, of international standing and were widely used, that this is a normal procedure, that they did their work competently and fairly and have produced a result.  I will put that result into the context of a number of valuations that emerged from a number of reputable sources.  The Bechtel valuation was £94.364 million and 49 per cent of that is approximately £46¼ million.  There were two valuations from Sykes, a valuation of the whole orebody of £63.1 million, and £61.6 million.  Correspondingly, 49 per cent of those would be £30.9 million and £30.2 million.</P>

I affirmed earlier that they were not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of Mergers they did not advise the Department of the valuation the Deputy quotes, but the figure he gives was included in the submissions to the board as a figure to indicate the sensitivity of the valuation to various factors.  It would be as fair to quote any one figure out of other submitted sensitivity analyses as being the valuation.  I could pick one figure from Lazards sensitivity analyses and say that that was their valuation, but I have not done that.  It is not fair for the Deputy to take one of the sensitivity analyses from Mergers and say that that was their valuation.  That figure was produced as part of a range to show the sensitivities of the valuation to a number of factors.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If this was the sensitivity figure for Mergers, what was the actual valuation for Mergers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a range of submissions from Mergers because Mergers were in from the beginning and were in a position of commenting, and I would have to give a long list rather than a single figure, whereas there is a clear single figure from <Col N="1482" /> Lazards.  There was no single figure from Mergers.  However, I would like to proceed with the comments I wish to make.</P>
      <P>We can agree that there is a very wide range of factors in making any valuation of a mine or of other things. We can agree that the amount of precision that can be obtained varies, obviously, with the circumstances.  In the Second Stage speech I talked about sighting shots.  That any one expert could distil all the relevant information and reach any sort of infallible judgment on all the subjective issues to come up with a valuation that should be regarded as holy writ is impossible. But over the period of the valuation proceedings each of the two sides made a number of submissions to the board some of which dealt with valuation, some of which dealt with particular aspects.  Each side had the right, which was invariably availed of, to submit written comments on submissions made by the other side.  The reports from various experts, as is now accepted, were submitted to the board in support of the two sides.  The board of consultants were free in their own judgment to accept or to disregard any submissions or report made, and they had recourse to independent expert advice of their own choosing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I chose the process of valuation by an independent board as the best method of determining the issue and if the debate over recent days has done anything it has confirmed the impossibility of reaching a settlement on the question by any other method. I believe therefore that it was a normal method, a correct method, with reputable people, meticulously carried out, and therefore a great deal of the exercise of fine and interesting detail that we have been engaged in is irrelevant. We could all do exercises, and I mentioned what people like Bechtel and Carsberg and Sykes did as well as people like Lazards.  In an Oireachtas it is reasonable to question the approach certainly and people are free to go on saying that arbitration was the wrong method, but once we have settled on the method of arbitration and once it has been accepted, then the numbers games that we could all play seem to be irrelevant because it is <Col N="1483" /> not for us to do so.  It is for the neutral persons who exercise this function in situations where it is desirable to get a solution to make that decision.</P>
    <P>I want to comment also on one aspect that has come up in Deputy O'Malley's denials, and again let me put this precisely.  I noted him saying that he had no desire to do damage to any company or individual and that is something very much embedded in the traditions of the House and in the rulings of the Chair, Standing Orders and so on.  However, willy-nilly a very odd situation indeed developed in regard to persons with whom we have set up an agreed mechanism which has provided a fair outcome because in the most fundamental aspects of their economic life they have been put through the wringer in a way that is pretty well unprecedented in the annals of this Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry but it was in an effort to criticise the Minister. He bought his way in or tried to and it is hard to dissociate him from them.  The Government have tried to associate themselves with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I note what the Deputy says, but in the effort to criticise me it is important to make a distinction that in the effort to mount whatever sort of criticism of the Deputy O'Malley thinks proper very fundamental aspects of the economic wellbeing of private citizens are being put into question.  It is an aspect of this debate that I have not previously referred to.  I may have occasion to refer to it later.</P>
      <P>In regard to the agreement between the two sides it is also essential to mention the other objectives that it was necessary to attain.  It seems that the Opposition do not object to the idea of a shareholding in a company, public or private, and that they do not object to putting money into mining, because the amount of money that has been lost beyond redemption by the State of things like Avoca far exceeds in current terms this investment.  The point about this investment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1484" />
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not an investment. We are putting money into mining to give it to four men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The point about this investment is that it is secured by an orebody of remarkable quality and of a very defined and known extent which is quite unusual in the matter of the State putting money, whether by grant or investment, into companies.  It is necessary to point out in the matter of valuation that we have achieved a number of objects which are extremely desirable from the point of view of the State and of the people at large.  Under the arrangement the financial returns to the State from this orebody will be vastly in excess of anything which would have been achieved by the application of the policies of the previous Government.</P>
      <P>However, there are other objectives which are crucial to the development or exploitation of an important national asset.  We have secured rights which enable me, in my ministerial sense, to exercise a degree of control over the depletion of the orebody.  We have secured an assurance of supplies of concentrates for the Irish smelter which will be built.  I am in a position to exercise influence that the orebody as a whole is developed in the most valuable way in the national interest. I have concluded arrangements to ensure that the situation as regards the River Blackwater will not reduce the exploitation of the vast quantity of valuable ore which, as I said in other speeches, is put at £200 million in gross terms.</P>
      <P>I have established the principle that the Irish people must have a say in and an adequate share of the profits from the development of resources on land in our Continental Shelf.  All of those were extremely desirable objectives.  As I say, while Deputies may reasonably query the procedures, the calculating machine sort of exercises we could all go through are irrelevant to the basic issue.  Indeed, those exercises involve doing something which is assailing private individuals and also assailing arbitrators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To the extent that one picks on particular reports from particular experts to be lauded and taken <Col N="1485" /> seriously while one contemptuously dismisses the reports of other equally reputable experts, one is making the sort of value judgements which perhaps, are right among experts but which are not within the competence of Deputies to have expert opinions on. It is continuously tainted with the possibility that it is malicious and that it is for the sake of making a partisan argument.  I think for the moment at this stage of the debate I have said enough about the matter of valuation except to say that the arbitration was properly entered into, properly conducted and produced a result.  I accept that result and, therefore, I cannot accept Deputy O'Malley's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister finished up by saying he thought he had said enough about the valuation and the method by which it was arrived at. Of course, he said a great deal more than that.  He dragged in his usual record&mdash;it is almost a 78 by now&mdash; in which he set out all the great things he has achieved in his policy in regard to mining and offshore oil.  Presumably we are meant to look at this deal before the House now as evidence of that.</P>
      <P>I was interested in a number of things he said which seemed to me to be contrary to the facts.  He said if one compares the return the State will get from this deal with the return which would have been got under the policy of the previous Government, one will see there is a great advantage in this deal.  The Minister knows just as well as I do what the facts are, and yet he says that.  Earlier today I referred to the facts.  I want to refer briefly again to the same position because continued repetition of this&mdash;with deference to the Rules of Order&mdash;inaccuracy does not make it true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts are that no mining lease had been granted in this country for many, many years until Tara.  The last one before that was the one in Avoca which was really an amendment of an existing mining lease.  For that reason when this orebody was discovered the previous Government set up an inter-departmental committee to study and report on the terms which would be appropriate in a mining lease for this <Col N="1486" /> orebody or any subsequent discoveries which might be made.  The basic difference was that, when previous mining leases were granted many years ago, Ireland was endeavouring to establish itself as a suitable base for mining and to attract people with expertise to explore for minerals.  By the time we reached the stage where this orebody was discovered, quite a new situation had been created.  It was in recognition of that fact that the inter-departmental committee was set up.</P>
    <P>It was quite clear to everybody that the kind of terms which would be granted in a new mining lease in respect of the orebody in Navan would be very different from those granted in mining leases many years earlier.  The mere setting up of that inter-departmental committee, of itself, is evidence of that.  The Minister knows that.  Yet he says you can reasonably compare the returns which he says will be got from this operation with the returns which would have been got from the policies of the previous Government.</P>
    <P>To which policies is he referring?  Is he referring to the policy adopted many years ago in the granting of early mining leases, or is he referring to the policy which would have been adopted if this party had remained in power and had received the report of the inter-departmental committee as the Minister did in April, 1973, and had then decided on their policy?  Surely he can only be referring to his version of the policy adopted which led to the granting of earlier mining leases many years ago.  It must surely be clear, even to the Minister, that that comparison is false and without foundation.</P>
    <P>He is also aware of the fact that, when he entered into negotiation for the granting of a mining lease in respect of this orebody, there was no restriction whatever on him in regard to the kind of terms he could impose in that mining lease, none whatever.  It was open to him to get whatever return he thought (a) was appropriate and (b) the traffic could bear, and to get that return in whatever way he thought was appropriate whether by way of royalty, or tax, or in any other way he thought appropriate.  His hands were not tied.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1487" /> We have differing views as to the method that should be used to get the return.  I have never made any secret of my view that what is important is the return obtained, not the method. There is no ideology attached to this so far as I am concerned.  The question is: what do you get out of it? What you get out of it includes such things as spin-offs.  Do you get a smelter?  Do you get many other spin-offs coming from smelter and other aspects of mining?  These are the important things which determine what you are getting out of it, not ideology.  The Minister was not constrained in any way in how he could approach this.  I want to suggest his repeated alleged comparison between the alleged return from this deal and the return he says would have been got under the policies of the previous Government does not stand up.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the fact that in his view damage was being done from this side of the House to Bula Limited and the individuals concerned in a way he said was unprecedented. First of all, he has not attempted to spell out in what way damage is being done to Bula or the individuals concerned.  Secondly, it should be clear to anybody who has been paying attention to this debate that there is no intention on this side of the House of damaging either Bula or any of the individuals concerned. The concern on this side of the House is the proper one of a parliamentary Opposition, that is, to examine and, if necessary, to criticise vigorously the performance of his duty by the Minister.</P>
    <P>If as a result of our performance of our duty Bula Limited or the private individuals connected with it are suffering&mdash;and that has not been demonstrated&mdash;the Minister should examine his conscience.  He used the word &ldquo;unprecedented&rdquo;.  I wonder did that ring a bell with him?  Did he recall that the Bill before the House is unprecedented?  The very fact that the Minister has come in and placed that company and those associated with it in the position where this House is being asked to endorse an agreement <Col N="1488" /> of which it has no knowledge was almost inevitably bound if there is damage being done to any of the people concerned, to produce that damage.  I am not aware of the damage being done and until I am told in what way it is being done I cannot accept that it is true but if damage is being done the responsibility lies on the Minister in the way he has approached this matter and not on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, among other things, that as a result of this deal he will now control the development of this mine.  Will the Minister tell us in what way has he control over this development?  It is one thing for him to say that but will he please demonstrate to the House how he has got that control?  We have dealt in debates on other amendments or sections&mdash; and presumably the matter will come up again&mdash;with the question of the shares the Minister has and what control they give him.  One thing that is common ground between the Minister and ourselves is that whatever the value of the shares he is taking and whatever control in the company that gives him, it does not give him majority control.  How, therefore, does the Minister say that as a result of this deal he has control over the development of this ore mine?</P>
    <P>He mentioned other forms of control that he claimed to have acquired because of this deal.  The same question arises: how has he got that control?  It is clearly not on the basis of his shareholding&mdash;and that is leaving aside the whole question that has been raised by Deputy O'Malley as to whether even that shareholding has a control that is commensurate with its trade value, which is 49 per cent.  But even if one accepts that is the control involved, how does that give him the control he is talking about?  If the Minister's fellow shareholders in the company were to decide that for various reasons they did not want to develop the mine how does the Minister ensure that development does go ahead?</P>
    <P>I think these are legitimate questions to ask and questions to which the public is entitled to answers.  In the circumstances of the Minister <Col N="1489" /> coming in with a deal where he is taking a minority interest in a private company these are obvious questions to which the House and the public are entitled to have answers.  It is no use for the Minister to suggest that in asking those questions one is trying to damage the company or the individuals concerned.  One is not; one is simply asking the ordinary, reasonable, obvious questions that arise on the basis of the deal which the Minister has announced in the House.</P>
    <P>At this stage at least I shall not pursue the various possible variations that the Minister and Deputy O'Malley were talking about but I will ask the Minister: taking the arbitration figure for the purpose of the argument to be the correct value of the company and having regard to an interjection by the Minister earlier in relation to Lazards, when he said that they were not asked to advise on the value of the shareholding that he was acquiring but merely on the whole company&mdash; I think I am correct in saying that was the effect of the Minister's interjection&mdash;how was the figure of £9.54 million arrived at?  Does it represent a certain proportion of the arbitrator's valuation?  If so, what proportion does it represent?  Does it take any account of the point being made by Deputy O'Malley as regards the valuation of a minority shareholding in a private company?  Or does it ignore that?  Is it a purely mathematical formula?  If it is a mathematical formula, what is it related to?  How was the figure of £9.54 million arrived at and by whom? I take it from the Minister's interjection in regard to that, that all he got from the arbitrator was a valuation of the company as a whole.  If that is so, who arrived at the figure of £9.54 million and how did they arrive at it?</P>

      <P>We may take it then that the Minister contends that a 24 <Col N="1490" /> per cent shareholding in a private company is worth 24 per cent of the total value of the company.  That seems to follow from what he has just said.  If that is so, would the Minister please deal with the contention put forward by Deputy O'Malley&mdash;with which most of us including the Minister I am sure are quite familiar&mdash;and would he explain why in the circumstances of this case, as distinct from almost any other private company one can think of, a 24 per cent shareholding should be worth 24 per cent of the total value of the company, when it is obvious that in any other case one can think of that is not so?</P>

      <P>We are going around and around.  The margin built in was a margin of a free 25 per cent.  There was a free 25 per cent with a purchase of 24 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister elaborate on that, in justice to himself? I do not think many people will understand the point he is making.  He is saying that he was getting 25 per cent of shares free.  If so, one can set that on one side and say: &ldquo;I am buying 24 per cent.  What should I pay for them?&rdquo;  That is the problem the Minister was faced with.  And the question put to him was this: if he accepts that the arbitrator's valuation is the value of the company why does he apply in this case the proposition that a 24 per cent shareholding is worth 24 per cent of the value of the company when it is a private company?  I presume I do not have to spell out all that Deputy O'Malley has pointed out already about the difference when one has a minority shareholding in a private company as regards arriving at a valuation.  My question is: why does the Minister accept the proposition that 24 per cent in a private company is the equivalent of 24 per cent of the total value or, why does he reject the commonly held view that in a private company 24 per cent of the shareholding is not valued at 24 per cent of the total value of the company?</P>

      <P>The Minister is as much confused as the Deputy.  I understand as little as the Deputy behind me. We have had this debate now for three or four weeks.  I do not understand the significance of Deputy Colley's observations in the context of a very lengthy debate on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was endeavouring to shorten the debate by not going over again the ground that has been covered in some detail by Deputy O'Malley.  Now the Minister tells us he does not understand it.  I am somewhat at a loss in this regard because I thought he would, as Deputy O'Malley implied, know about this anyway and if he did not that he would know about it having listened to Deputy O'Malley.</P>
      <P>I do not want to prolong the debate and I will put it in as simple terms as possible.  A minority shareholding in a private company does not give one proportionate power, that is power proportionate to the amount of the shareholding, and would not normally be valued, as in this case where a 24 per cent shareholding equals 24 per cent of the total value of the company.  That is not a normal way to approach it although there may be a good reason for it in this case.  What I am doing is inviting the Minister to explain why this abnormal approach is being taken in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said over and over why there was a built-in margin of more than 100 per cent and why it <Col N="1492" /> was an attractive proposition.  My difficulty is not with what the question seems to mean because the Deputy must know the answer and I wish he would tell me what he really wants&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If I knew the answer I would not ask the question.  I am totally mystified as to what the answer is.  There is, of course, one possibility and it occured to me a few times when listening to the Minister. I have a feeling the Minister has a 25 per cent shareholding claim and a 24 per cent shareholding for which he is paying.  Sometimes he gives the impression, when he is under pressure about what he is paying that the 25 per cent is brought over and it suddenly ceases to be free, that he is really getting 49 per cent for the £9.54 million.  Perhaps that is the cause of my confusion.  If it is, it is not a very satisfactory explanation but at least it is some kind of explanation. We have not been able to get any from the Minister.  He can have it one way or the other.  Either he got 25 per cent free and he is entitled to boast about it, as he does, or he has not.  If he wants to lump it in with the 24 per cent to justify the deal, then he should not tell us it was free because it was not.  If, on the other hand, it was free, the question again arises why pay 24 per cent of the total value of the company for a 24 per cent shareholding in a private company when nobody else I can think of in any remotely similar circumstances, would do so?</P>
      <P>I would have thought that the Minister would feel in his own interests that he should give some kind of an answer to that question because, on the face of it, he is doing something for which there is no precedent.  As I said, there may be particular circumstances in this case to justify it, but in all fairness to himself he should give the House some indication of what those circumstances are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is not going to reply to Deputy Colley perhaps we could deal with another of his fixations.  In his opening statement he compared the whole operation to a horse dealing operation.  I do not know if he has ever been to a horse fair but perhaps he used the horse trading comparison because the name of the company is Bula Ltd. and it reminded him of a very fine racehorse called &ldquo;Bula&rdquo;.  I do not think you can compare the performance of the racehorse with that of this company to date with regard to winning races and producing the goods.  Bula Ltd. do not even have a jockey; they have never even been out of their own yard.  They have a long way to go to reach the peak reached by the racehorse.</P>
      <P>I have often been to horse fairs.  If the Minister was comparing the deal with a horse trading deal, there was no need to have arbitration.  He could have gone out on a horse fair basis to the four people concerned and asked them what they were given, even though both sides already had their valuations.  They would probably have asked for the top figure of £104 million to £106 million for the whole mine.  The normal procedure in horse trading is to make your opening bid. The Minister had guidelines on this occasion&mdash;Lazards valuation.  For 24 per cent he should have been bidding under £2 million instead of £40 million.  He need not have jumped up to that figure&mdash;£9.54 million is based on a figure of £40 million&mdash;because nobody else was bidding against him. It was a closed shop.  He was the only buyer.  He could have stuck hard and done a very good deal instead of what has happened, that is, giving away £10 million of the taxpayers' money. The reason he did this, he said, was because of the arbitration hearing. As I said, he should have stuck to the horse trading deal because there was no other horse trader operating against him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned earlier all he had achieved in this deal and the commitments he had got from Bula. He mentioned one very interesting point.  He said the company had committed the ore to an Irish smelter.  The <Col N="1494" /> only commitment he did not spell out was that he had one job under way at the moment.  By committing the ore from Bula to an Irish smelter does he realise that the ore will not be going into a smelter for at least five years?  It takes more than four years to build a smelter.  Even at this stage he has no financial backing to build a smelter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another matter.  I am anxious that the Deputy relate his remarks more closely to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, the Minister mentioned that he had committed the ore to a smelter.  We are giving £9.54 million for 24 per cent of this mine and we would like to see it going into operation in the minimum of time in order to give the taxpayer a chance to get back his money and, more important still, to provide jobs for the 120,000 unemployed. Now we find, on the Minister's own admission, that the mine will not go into operation for five years because the ore is committed to an Irish smelter which cannot be in operation for five years.  There is nothing to boast about here.  That is no achievement. What we all want to achieve by the utilisation of the orebody in this mine and the adjoining mine is more jobs for the people who are now unemployed.  Boasts about commitment will not help to put people back to work.  This is something the Minister should have refrained from boasting about.  Deputy O'Malley proved earlier this evening that it would be eight years before any return could come from the £9.54 million invested. The Minister said that was all wrong but now he says that it will be five years before any of the ore will be utilised.  The Minister should clarify his statement on this matter in the interests of proving to us that some good will come from the large amount of money invested and that at least some jobs will accrue to help the unemployed within the next five years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <P>What I said was that the production is available for an Irish smelter when we call for it but there is no question of holding up production <Col N="1495" /> until a smelter is built.  It seems a sensible thing to let production go ahead and earn what is possible and there is plenty of ore there for a smelter to use.  We are not saying that there can be no production until a smelter is ready.  This is simply a clarification of what I said already.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Minister is still unable to explain why he is paying 24 per cent mathematically of the arbitrator's valuation when even the most simple investor knows perfectly well that when one takes up a minority position in a private company the value of the minority shares is only a fraction of their mathematical <Col N="1496" /> proportion to the entire valuation.  The Minister's inability to explain that away and the fact that he has got himself into that position or was put into it by the able negotiators who got the better of him is proof of his inability to perform the necessary functions of the post which he holds and it demonstrates in a more dramatic way than we normally see why there has been this incredible failure to do anything worthwhile in Industry and Commerce and why both industry and commerce have declined as they have during the past four years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the recently published survey of the Educational Sub-Committee of the Ballyfermot Community Association and requests the Government to initiate as a matter of urgency a special programme to provide employment and educational opportunities in Ballyfermot and in other areas of Dublin city where a similar need exists.</P>
      <P>This motion was put down to stimulate discussion and to ensure that the valuable document produced by the Educational Sub-Committee of the Ballyfermot Community Association would get an airing in the House.  This document deserves widespread discussion to ensure that the Government and the various institutions are made aware of the development problems not alone in Ballyfermot but in other Dublin areas.  This motion was worded in a way that there would be no division. The Government amendment makes it a political matter.  The amendment states:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Association&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and notes the Government measures in the recent Budget, including employment premiums, the premium scheme for school-leavers and youth training and employment schemes, all of which will be of particular benefit in areas in Dublin such as those covered by the Association's survey.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It was not my intention to participate in this as a budget debate.  I was concerned to stimulate discussion on this important document, but because of the terms of the Government amendment I must deal with the amendment in conjunction with the document.  It is unfortunate that the Government did not allow unhindered discussion on this important document and sought to have another budget debate to force a division on this issue.  It was not my wish to force a division because I am sure Members of other parties are concerned about the problems in Ballyfermot and other Dublin areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The survey was a comprehensive one and a great deal of time and energy went into the preparation of it.  A special sub-committee of the Ballyfermot Community Association dealt effectively and efficiently with this matter in order to ensure that they had factual information.  I should like to compliment the Chairman, Mr. Tommy Phelan, Pam O'Reilly and other members of the committee who participated in the preparation of the survey.  Their report deals with the lack of assistance and understanding of the many problems that confront <Col N="1499" /> the teachers and parents in areas such as Ballyfermot.  A pilot scheme was introduced for the purpose of preparing a suitable questionnaire and the survey was carried out by students from the Statistical and Sociological Department of TCD.  The information was computerised.  The interviewers came from outside the area and the system adopted was acceptable to McGrail who carried out a survey of Dublin city previously.  The results were checked before this excellent report was produced.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from the McGrail report in an effort to indicate the type of problems the committee face in relation to this survey.  That report states:</P>
    <P>The educational imbalance of Dublin adults revealed in this report will, if not energetically corrected, lead to a critical state of injustice within the next two decades. Future planning to correct the present situation will require interdisciplinary and inter-departmental co-operation.  Pre-school compensatory education alone, no matter how extensively it is organised, will not be adequate for the task of providing equality of educational opportunity for future generations living in Dublin.  There is need, it would seem, for a more extensive and radical change in the social structure and attitudes which are contributing to the present inequality of educational opportunities in Dublin.</P>
    <P>This sets the pattern and indicates that the course adopted and the findings of the subcommittee were in accord with the developing pattern as seen by the McGrail report.</P>
    <P>We must view Ballyfermot as it exists, an area with a population of approximately 36,000 people who live in 5,000 dwellings.  Approximately 15,000 of those are young people under the age of 14 years.  When we take into consideration that the registered number of unemployed for Ballyfermot is 1,300 males and 380 females we can see the extent of the problem from the unemployment point of view.  While education is related to <Col N="1500" /> this and to housing, it has been covered in detail in the report.  An immense problem faces those who seek solutions to the difficulties in that area. Statistics are frequently supplied to Members of this House and those who seek them but they, by their nature, do not reflect the true position; they are averages.  Governments operate on the basis of averages, not on the basis of conditions in a particular area. Geographical areas are seldom, if ever, taken into consideration.  The same type of pattern is applied to education in Dublin city, Galway, the midlands and elsewhere.  There is no consideration for the fact that the problems vary.</P>
    <P>I should like to give some indication of the confusion in the mind of the Government in relation to the present statistical set up.  Some time ago I inquired from the Taoiseach the number of persons unemployed in the Ballyfermot area and I was told that the information was not available. Apparently, the Central Statistics Office do not have the statistics necessary to ensure that communities anxious to examine in depth the problems in their area can have this type of information.  Later I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare the number of people unemployed in that area and he was able to give me the information I required.  He told me there were 1,300 males on the unemployment register at Werburgh Street and 380 females on the register at Victoria Street.  The Taoiseach did not know this and apparently, the Government did not know.  A co-ordination of effort is necessary within the Government irrespective of the Government in power.  I do not blame one Government more than another because the whole set-up is wrong.  We need such information if we are to have long-term planning.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that the census has been postponed.  It is possible that the Government do not wish to know what the problems are, that they do not want to be identified in case reports similar to the one I have referred to are compiled by people in other areas.  It was wrong to postpone the <Col N="1501" /> census because we need authentic figures to prepare a long-term plan. Government statistics do not record the lack of social or employment opportunities.  That weakness must be corrected.  We must ensure that the developing pattern outlined in the McGrail report is corrected.  In Ballyfermot there are people who want education and employment but they are being denied both through no fault of their own.</P>
    <P>I have been quoting an in-depth report on the situation there but we are being forced to discuss it on a political basis.  It indicates the position in regard to employment and how that is related to the educational process, and <i>vice versa.</i>  The survey gives a clear indication of the problems facing teachers and the community association there.  Of the number of people interviewed, 23 per cent were unemployed at a time when we are told by official Government figures that the national average is 12.1 per cent.  Therefore, there is an abnormal situation in this respect in Ballyfermot. It is double the national rate, and this is an alarming situation.</P>
    <P>The survey reveals that 24 per cent of the fathers of those interviewed were unemployed, a situation which affects Ballyfermot more than any other area.  I am told that Members from the Government side are anxious to participate in this debate and I am sure they also have become alarmed by the figures in the report, which goes on to tell us that 20 per cent of the mothers of those interviewed were working through necessity.  That, in turn, must be reflected in the households, where children are deprived severely.  It is an alarming siuation that 23 per cent of those interviewed are unemployed and that 24 per cent of their fathers are unemployed.  Is it not a terrible situation where you have entire families unemployed as well as parents?</P>
    <P>We have a Government amendment to this motion and we must ask, in the light of it, about the remedial efforts being made by the Government. The amendment is only a whitewashing effort.  We must have a look at the job opportunities for Ballyfermot people and for other areas and at the <Col N="1502" /> Government's contribution in this year's budget.  Through the premium employment scheme, £4.1 million is being made available through which the Government say they hope to give jobs to 11,000 adults and 5,000 school leavers, but this must be juxtaposed with the situation in the budget where job opportunities are being denied because of cutbacks in the capital programme.  A motivating force in economic life here is the house construction programme.  Here we find that in the 1976 budget £119 million was provided for this industry, but in 1977 there is a cutback to £101 million, a reduction of £18 million.  This must be taken in conjunction with the galloping inflation rate which cuts back the value of the programme by £40 million.  Most of the jobs provided in the building industry are of an unskilled nature and in Ballyfermot many of those interviewed in the survery I have mentioned required unskilled work because of educational deprivation.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that employment will be reduced as a result of the cutbacks in the construction sector on which so many Dublin people rely for employment.  This can only cause further hardship.  The employment premium scheme does not apply to the building industry.  I challenge the Minister to say that an effort is made to offset this cutback of £40 million. The building industry is the second largest in the country, the driving force in the fields of employment and the economy generally.  It employs 54,000 people directly and 83,000 indirectly.  At the moment 24,000 people are out of jobs in that industry. I mentioned this only because of the Government's amendment.</P>
    <P>I will return to the general unemployment situation.  In the report I have referred to, it is stated that 85 per cent of the mothers employed were in unskilled work.  This is as a result of educational problems down through the years.  The educational programme, particularly at primary level, was designed to treat all children equally but that cannot apply in the extreme overcrowded conditions in Ballyfermot where there is hardship and sickness.  Because of lack of employment <Col N="1503" /> opportunities for parents the children suffer.  Many people from that area have reached great heights academically and in industrial employment. They are only too willing to avail of any opportunities that may arise but these are very few.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government now to set up as a matter of urgency an independent committee to examine the contents of this survey, with special attention to education, employment and housing, and to make the necessary financial assistance available to meet the needs of the community and solve the problem of distress in the area, in conjunction with the Ballyfermot Association and with the other groups operating in the area, the trade unions, the employers, the school management committee, the school managers, the teachers, the clergy and all the other groups anxious and willing to assist.</P>
    <P>Co-ordination of effort was never more desired and stimulation of Government thought in relation to forgotten areas was never more important.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to convey to the Government the necessity to identify and dig deeper into the evolving problems here and elsewhere.  When we look at Dublin city, taking it as a whole and going outside the perimeter of Ballyfermot, we find a total of 33,000 unemployed.  As I said earlier, figures obtainable from one source were not obtainable from another source.  I shall not deal in depth with the unemployment figures. While they are important, there are other even more important aspects covered in the report.  These will be dealt with in a more comprehensive way by other contributors to this debate.</P>
    <P>I sought information from Manpower and the information I received in relation to personnel registered there was very far from the reality of the situation in the particular area.  This is an area in which job opportunities are not available.  The survey indicates that over 65 per cent of those interviewed worked outside the Ballyfermot area.  The establishment of industry there and in contiguous <Col N="1504" /> areas is absolutely essential in order to relieve the pressures and solve the problems developing in the area.  The planners must be convicted on the score of the type of development laid out.  Correct attitudes were not adopted and people were left on their own to meet the demands that arise in such areas.</P>
    <P>The survey indicates that job location is important and so are job opportunities.  I took this matter up recently with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I wanted to find out the position with regard to industrial development in the area and I was told by the Minister that the IDA have informed him that, while a number of industrialists had been brought to visit the area in recent months, there was no firm proposal in the pipeline to establish any new project.  It will be a long time then before the people in that area will have job opportunities in the area. This must be highlighted and brought to the attention of those planning the location of industrial estates.  In the development of all housing estates job opportunities must be available and the Department of Industry and Commerce must pay particular attention to that aspect.  Commuting to the other side of the city is a costly process.  Those who would be willing to commute are not prepared to see their wages eroded by ever-increasing transport charges.  Job location must go hand in hand with job opportunity in every area.</P>
    <P>The relationship between education and employment is clearly outlined in the survey.  The percentages are given and so is the type of employment people enter as a result of leaving certificate and intermediate certificate and the number who had the opportunity of going forward to third-level education in university.  It is vitally important to ensure that the young people in the area will have equal opportunities.  The whole system is geared against females. Women and young girls are victimised by the system.  Corrective action must be taken.  The statistics in the group certificate are interesting&mdash;66 per cent of males and 2.8 per cent of females. There is no proper vocational school <Col N="1505" /> for females.  Where they are streamed into the vocational school there are immense problems.  I was in a college in Ballyfermot last Saturday and it was indicated to me that people in the vocational school lose a class before and after because they have to commute from a considerable distance. That is certainly not in the student's interests.  The system where university grants are concerned is farcical.  Unless one has the necessary finances one is in a very difficult position indeed.</P>

      <P>It is imperative that the Minister should raise the income limit so that people will not be defeated at the start in the educational process. We must be realistic and we must make every effort to ensure the end result and ensure that that result is achievable. We know the difficulties in the case of a student who obtains a grant as against the student who can loaf around on his father's dough.  The young people in Ballyfermot and other areas have not got any financial backing for third-level education.  Where does the student with three honours come in?  The student with two honours is out in the cold.  It is a sorry state of affairs.  As Deputy Wilson pointed out last week, the grave defects that exist need immediate remedial action to ensure that students wishing to avail of educational opportunities will be enabled to do so.</P>
      <P>We know the amount of preliminary work that has gone into the question of development of a community college in the area.  While the survey may not be accepted in its totality, nevertheless, it is a basis for discussion.  It contains factual information as a result of a realistic assessment of the area.  Those who carried out the survey were experts and the survey is now presented to the Government and to the various authorities throughout the country which can in any way assist.  These can now draw up their programmes on factual information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we take the housing problem and relate it to the educational process, we find that in 5,000 dwellings there are families of seven in two-or <Col N="1506" /> three-bedroomed houses.  We find there is a substantial movement of families because of lack of job opportunities or because of other problems in the area and, because people leave, the tendency is for the area to become unsettled.  It must be difficult for associations that deal with day to day problems to keep up with this movement and with the problems that develop as a result of the type of housing construction planned for this area.  The planners have a lot to answer for when one considers the monotonous design of houses.  I know what it is like to live in a local authority house.  I know the problems of a father living in such a house and I know of the problems faced by a child who wishes to study in such a house.  When visitors come, he is put outside or else must go to a cold bedroom.  The planners do not give any thought to children in these house-holds.</P>
    <P>The design of the houses and the planning of the area are matters that have not received any attention.  With the development in the Cherry Orchard area I had hoped that adequate notice would have been taken of the grave defects in the housing schemes in that area but the position is even worse there.</P>
    <P>The survey also draws attention to the problem of overcrowding and sets out how it affects the family and educational opportunities of young people.  Not only are children overcrowded in their own homes, they are overcrowded in their classrooms. For far too long the matter of pupil/ teacher ratio has been mentioned in this House and last week Deputy Wilson spoke at length about this urgent problem.  The factory-type educational system we have must be dispensed with and something on a more realistic basis, suitable to the needs of the community, must be put in its place.  We must ensure that young people are not retarded by the system.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out to me recently that many of the parents cannot question the system because they do not know enough about it.  Many people do not feel they have a right <Col N="1507" /> to do this as they consider it is something that can only be dealt with by the professionals.  I am glad to say that the community association in Ballyfermot do not hold that view. They have shown clearly that they have an interest, that they consider they should have an opportunity of spelling out the defects in the system and of seeking remedies so that opportunities will be made available for the young people.</P>

      <P>There is also the matter of the community college which is of considerable importance. I hope that the Government will take note of the comments of the survey in relation to this college, of how the people interested in educational matters see the communication and other problems in the Ballyfermot area.  This must affect other areas also.  For that reason I hope the college will commence soon and that the needs of the people will be met in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to congratulate the personnel who have assisted in the survey.  Last Saturday I was in one of the colleges and it was pointed out to me that demands were made to the Department during the years to expendite provision of the necessary buildings.  I was told that an art class was now held in a redundant prefab and that those studying in that class had to carry buckets of water to the prefab for their class.  I am sure that is unheard of elsewhere but it highlights the problem in this area.  I challenge the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Education to go to Ballyfermot and other areas and to discuss these matters with people who are interested in the problem.  Let them go to the institutions and colleges and see how all these matters have been neglected for years.  Let them see how the building programmes have been delayed because of incompetence and delay on the part either of civil servants or Ministers or a combination of both.  I hope that the shackles that <Col N="1508" /> bind the Department of Education will be taken away.</P>
    <P>I will meet the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister with the other Deputies for the area.  I will take them to the areas and to the schools where the problems exist so that they will get some factual information on which to base a reply.  Turning a motion of this kind into a budget debate is too sad when one considers its importance in the lives of the people in the area who have been subjected to the pressures outlined in the report and which I have mentioned briefly.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of the report will be dealt with more competently by others. I have outlined the situation.  A device was operated tonight to ensure a division of attention by Dublin Deputies. Three special meetings of the city council were called for tonight although they had been scheduled for last night so that we could not be in force at either place.  This is all too appalling.

      <P>I move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Association&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and notes the Government measures in the recent Budget, including employment premiums, the premium scheme for school-leavers and youth training and employment schemes, all of which will be of particular benefit in areas in Dublin such as those covered by the Association's survey.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1509" /> I wish to join with Deputy Dowling in congratulating the Ballyfermot Community Association and the people involved in the survey on the trouble they have taken.  The community association in the survey are addressing themselves to what everybody must recognise is a very real and serious problem.  It affects not just Ballyfermot but many other parts of the country.  In fact, the problem of youth unemployment affects many parts of Europe.  I have preliminary, as yet unpublished, figures from the labour force sample survey of 1975 which indicate that the youth content of the total number of unemployed is as high as it is here and in some cases higher in many other Common Market countries.  This affects places like Ballyfermot because they have a large number of people in the late teenage bracket.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dowling acknowledged, there are possible grounds for criticism of the survey from a scientific basis but that does not take from its general relevance.  For instance, a random sample of 72 people out of a total population of 35,000 is a small sample upon which to base scientifically justified conclusions.  There is a need for greater elaboration of the methodology in the study.  These are passing criticisms and I do not wish them to be taken as denigrating the work which has been done.  The employment problem is a general one but the east coast has been badly hit and this is reflected in the survey.  While the areas outside Leinster have had new industry attracted into them during the past 15 years, industry which has a technical base and which is better able to resist the current recession and the onset of the new economic order, the older type of industry which is prevalent in the Dublin area has been more vulnerable in this situation.  One cannot isolate the employment problems of Ballyfermot. While there may not be as many factories as we would like in Ballyfermot, it has access to factories on its boundary. As the survey recognises, Ballyfermot is surrounded by industrial estates such as Naas Road, Walkinstown, Long Mile Road, and so on.</P>
    <P>To counteract the general problem of unemployment in the eastern region the <Col N="1510" /> Government have asked the Industrial Development Authority to promote Dublin as a location for large and medium-sized industry.  Prior to this the promotional accent had been on areas outside Dublin.  The small industries programme has also been extended to cover the Dublin region in sectors such as engineering, plastics and pharmaceuticals.  I heard a politician of the other party criticising this decision of the Government during the by-election campaign in West Mayo. He complained that Dublin was getting this extension of a programme which had previously been confined to areas outside Dublin.  Because of the severity of the problem in Dublin, everybody will agree that the Government's decision to extend the small industries programme was a wise one.</P>

      <P>Career guidance is also referred to in the survey and the problem for young people of finding jobs.  In this context the National Manpower Service has an important role to play.  A recent development has been the opening of a manpower service clinic in the Ballyfermot Community Association's premises.  I understand it is intended to upgrade the manpower service in that area by increasing the number of people involved there. There is a large AnCO training centre catering for 400 trainees at any given time in Ballyfermot.</P>

      <P>The increased provision of training places, which has been unprecedented in the period of office of the present Government, will enable greater attention to be paid to the needs of areas such as Ballyfermot. A recent initiative has been the employment incentive scheme which follows the employment premium scheme.  This scheme will be extended to unemployed school-leavers who are of concern to the Ballyfermot Community Association.  Extra funds, including funds from the European Social Fund, will be made available to the community youth training programme which is sponsored by AnCO.  This will expand activity in the area by providing transitional employment for young people.  It will also enable them to gain valuable skills.  As part of the programme, they will be supervised in useful community work by skilled craftsmen. This programme is already active in the Ballyfermot area.  Three projects are being undertaken.  Work has commenced on the Ballyfermot Sports and Social Club, at Stewart's Hospital and Cherry Orchard Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position regarding educational facilities in Ballyfermot has been receiving attention for many years. The advisory council, which was established in 1966 to advise on the need for post-primary education in the Greater Dublin area, gave special <Col N="1512" /> consideration to Ballyfermot from the beginning of its operations.  That sub-committee met school authorities and teachers in the area, and discussed the problems with them at several meeting. They also met the Ballyfermot Community Association.</P>
    <P>The meetings showed clearly that the traditional type of secondary education was not seen as being relevant to the needs of this area.  Children started post-primary schooling somewhat later than in most areas.  It was also stressed that a high percentage of the pupils in the schools were in need of remedial education.  There was a tradition in the district of going to work at an early age.  There was need for greater cooperation between the two post-primary schools for boys.  One of the girls' schools provided some typewriting&mdash;a half hour a week to first years&mdash;and the other had a &ldquo;needlework&rdquo; group which included three hours of needlework and cookery.  The nuns in Caritas College stated that they would be willing to work as teachers in a larger establishment which would be capable of catering for the educational needs of the area.</P>
    <P>At the meeting with the representatives of the community association the report of that association's educational sub-committee was presented to the sub-committee.  This report commented on the absence of a vocational school for girls in the area.  It also referred to the large drop-out at junior cycle level.  One of the suggestions contained in the report was that a junior polytechnical college for the area should be set up under a managerial committee established under section 21 of the Vocational Education Act.  The college would provide (a) traditional senior cycle courses; (b) courses with a strong technical vocational bias; (c) apprenticeship training courses; (d) commercial and junior management courses; (e) courses in social service; (f) inservice and induction courses for all teachers working in the area.  It was pointed out by the association that this would still leave four separate junior cycle schools.  The managerial set-up proposed for the community schools <Col N="1513" /> in Tallaght and Blanchardstown was also explained to the association representative.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee has also considered the possibility of the Caritas College and the VEC combining to operate a co-educational school to cater for the western side of Ballyfermot.  It was stated that the De La Salle school should be used as a senior cycle centre with a reduced junior cycle on the vocational school site.  A combined management structure would be envisaged. Generally the sub-committee felt that there were sufficient places to match junior cycle requirements but that the distribution of those places and the type of facility available were not satisfactory.  The main problem was curriculum.  Some type of joint managerial arrangement was envisaged. It was felt also that there was need for a post-junior cycle college which would serve the vocational needs of the children of the area and that this institution should have a form of relatively autonomous local control.  A governing committee set up under section 21 of the Vocational Education Act would be one means of achieving this aim.</P>
    <P>These were deliberations that took place between 1966 and 1973, and while the problems were well adumbrated, nothing had been done which was meeting them to a sufficient degree. The logical development of the deliberations was the setting up of a sub-committee in February, 1973, by the City of Dublin VEC.  That sub-committee involved all local interests.  It had representatives of the VEC, the Ballyfermot Community Association, all the schools in the area, primary and post-primary, teachers, social workers, trade unions, AnCO and the Federated Union of Employers.  This was a truly fully informed and fully representative body, and it set out to develop the concept of vocational education in a relevant and meaningful way to the Ballyfermot community and to involve the Ballvfermot Community in wider and more responsible participation in its own education.</P>
    <P>The outcome of this subsequent examination of the problems in the period from 1973 on, involving numberous <Col N="1514" /> meetings with Department officials and with the predecessor of the present Minister was a decision which, though long-awaited and long discussed, was taken by Deputy Burke as then Minister for Education and it is something which I think will prove to be of considerable long-term significance to the Ballyfermot area and one for which Mr. Burke is to be congratulated.  The details of the decision were as follows: (a) a senior cycle college for 500 pupils would be provided; (b) it would be operated by a board of management responsible to the VEC; (c) the two convents, the VEC and the community association would be represented on the board; (d) the two convents would continue to operate but would cater for junior cycle only; (e) the new college to provide training for employment as well as the normal senior cycle courses. that is, leaving certificate, for 15 to 19 year olds, and also to provide adult education.  This senior cycle college will be additional to the existing schools, which are two convents, one operated by the Dominican Sisters and one operated by the Daughters of Charity, a large boys' school operated by the De La Salle Brothers, and a large junior cycle boys' school operated by the VEC.  It may be said that few other areas can boast such a comprehensive range of school facilities.</P>
    <P>There are two points to which I would like specifically to refer in relation to what I have just told the House.  One is the special type of curriculum which is to be provided in this new community college which, as I say, is being set up as a result of a decision by the then Minister for Education in 1975.  The ordinary group certificate, inter certificate and leaving certificate will be provided plus special training for employment.  The precise nature of this training for employment is now being decided in discussions with industry, with the Ballyfermot Community Association, trade union representatives and AnCO, who are on the school board.  Therefore it will be meeting the very particular employment-oriented needs of education in Ballyfermot.</P>
    <P>There is another point which needs to be high-lighted, that is, the management <Col N="1515" /> structure of this new community college, and it is something which I think is referred to in this study where they say the parents should be involved and should have an opportunity of contributing to the decision-making in education.  The study referred to the need for teachers and parents to come together to discuss course content and the relevance of education.  The fact that parents will now be among the representatives along with trade union representatives and the community association on the board of management of the new college&mdash;the community association will have three representatives&mdash;will enable them to have a direct input into the type of course which will be taught in the school and the way in which the school is managed.  This is a novel provision, the involvement of a community association.  It is a recognition of the work which the body which referred this report has been doing through the years and shows flexibility in the exercise of the powers reposed in the Minister for Education under the Vocational Education Act of 1930.</P>
    <P>There is another point I wish to mention in relation to the basic decision made by the Minister, that is, that he accepted advice which is again remarked on in a complimentary fashion in the conclusion to this report in selecting the Harp site in Ballyfermot for the new community college. It was definitely the opinion of the local people expressed through the community association that that site rather than the alternative should be chosen, and the Minister accepted that advice.</P>
    <P>Schedules of accommodation for the new 500 pupil senior cycle college have been completed and the remaining stages of planning and building processes are being expedited as much as possible.  The basic decisions have been taken and we are now proceeding to build the college.  I should mention also the problem of higher education grants and the need to improve them. Some Deputies opposite in their contributions to this debate have referred to them also.  Everybody would <Col N="1516" /> recognise that higher education grants as well as many other services could be improved if more financial resources were available to the Government from the community in the form of taxation but it is clear that the best policy for improving economic expansion is one of providing tax reliefs designed to encourage incentive to work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government got that idea from us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>However, that policy would be counterproductive if, at the same time, the Government were to proceed to increase public expenditure holus-bolus in such areas as higher education, without having regard to where the resources were coming from. The distinctive feature of the Opposition in relation to the economy seems to be that of increasing spending while at the same time cutting taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that there were only 75 grants for the whole city of Dublin, the Parliamentary Secretary ought to be ashamed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The only way in which these improvements could be effected would be by a massive increase in the national debt but that is something which would be likely to have very serious effects on the credibility of our economy.  That is a policy in respect of which this Government are not prepared to follow the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy referred specifically to the question of higher education grants and seemed to suggest that the availability of such grants in so far as the Ballyfermot area is concerned would be an important contribution to the employment situation in that area.  I have no doubt that there are many people in Ballyfermot who would benefit from the availability of such grants but the question is simply one of priorities.  If the overriding problem in the area concerns the finding of employment for young people, one must ask seriously which road one should take if one has a choice between <Col N="1517" /> spending the money available in a community college which will provide more woodwork rooms, better rooms in which to teach building construction and better rooms for industrial training&mdash;all of which development is of the type sought by the people of Ballyfermot&mdash;or of pouring more money into higher education.  We know that many people who have had the benefit of higher education are experiencing difficulty in finding jobs.  In these circumstances are we to encourage more people into the higher education sector rather than to provide, as the Government are providing, improved resources, not at third level, but at first and second levels where it can be related more specifically to the problems being experienced by the broad mass of people in Ballyfermot?  The road we are following is the correct one and I believe it will be endorsed by the people of the area concerned when they have an opportunity of expressing their views.</P>
    <P>The Government have shown themselves to be very concerned with the problem of unemployment.  They have announced a wide range of new measures aimed at dealing with this problem.  For instance, the employment premium scheme is an innovation in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <P>Regarding the motion before us, there are many aspects that concern any Deputy representing the Dublin constituencies.  I have the privilege of representing a south-Dublin <Col N="1519" /> constituency so my contribution will be in the context, not only of the Ballyfermot situation, but of the whole Dublin city and county situation. I shall be referring to the conditions, particularly in primary schools, in which both children and teachers find themselves.</P>
      <P>The resolution deals with such questions as education, employment, housing, the economy and youth, all of which are inextricably interwined. Consequently, during this debate we must consider these various headings. Last week, while the Parliamentary Secretary was absent on State business, the question of a youth policy was put to the Minister for Education and he took the opportunity of the occasion to sing the praises of the Parliamentary Secretary for his involvement in youth organisations and for his wonderful efforts on behalf of youth. However, the crunch question came from Deputy Wyse, a Deputy who has done so much for youth and who has made public the Government's lack of a youth policy.  The Minister had to reply by referring to a youth policy which, he said, we would have in three months time but this is the same policy that we were told about three years ago.  It is symptomatic of the disease from which the Parliamentary Secretary is suffering that he is not producing the goods.  He is talking now of a phantom senior cycle college for the good people of Ballyfermot.  On hearing this the people of that area will be likely to go to the site concerned and to search for this college but they will not find it since there is no such establishment. Neither is there a youth policy nor as a sports policy for Ballyfermot. At this stage I should make it clear that I am not in any way personalising the debate.  It is not my practice to do that.  We are talking about performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has blandly outlined plans for a very worthy senior cycle college.  Performance is what counts.  It reminds me of the Minister for the Gaeltacht who goes down to the west of Ireland and puts up wooden notices to indicate that a factory will be built here in the near <Col N="1520" /> future.  As the people in the west of Ireland know, wooden notices are no substitute for factories.  Equally promises are no substitute for colleges.  I recommend that the Parliamentary Secretary get his facts right in relation to the reading of the report prepared by the Ballyfermot Community Association. The reference to the Harp site was at the beginning of the report not at the end.  The Parliamentary Secretary has been badly caught out in this motion before the House.</P>
    <P>It is a pity the Parliamentary Secretary cannot take it and that he must leave the House.</P>
    <P>In some areas of the city and county of Dublin, in the primary schools there are classes of from 35 to 45 students.  That is an appalling commentary on education in this country in 1977.  One can imagine the problems created by 45 pupils in one class room with one teacher attempting to control and teach them.  I have the deepest sympathy for any teacher who is foisted with 45 children in a class room.  This is one of the tragedies in the Ballyfermot area.  I do not pretend to have a special knowledge of the Ballyfermot area, and I am sure the people in the Ballyfermot area do not wish me to patronise them.  I reflect my own experience into the Ballyfermot area from my knowledge of other areas.  Apart from the very high student-teacher ratio in these primary schools, one must consider the conditions prevailing in a local authority house in the Ballyfermot area where you have a family of ten for instance.  I am again drawing from my experience in my own constituency. There could be a family of ten with eight children ranging in ages from six to 17, living in a two-bed-roomed house.  How in these circumstances can the children coming from overcrowded classrooms and living in overcrowded conditions be treated to one of the fundamental entitlements provided by our Constitution, which is a decent education.  The Parliamentary Secretary talks about premiums for this, that and the other.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary living in cloud cuckoo land?  There are 119,000 people officially unemployed at present <Col N="1521" /> and the figure is going up.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows that the probability is that the unemployed in this country is somewhere in the region of 175,000 to 200,000 people.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary's schemes are successful in the national interest, but the Parliamentary Secretary should descend from his cloud, and talk about realities rather than promises.  The Parliamentary Secretary will then be dealing responsibly with this very proper and reasonable motion before the House.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that at the end of October last year 108,000 people were unemployed?  About 14,000 of these were not eligible for any payment, and 42,000 received unemployment assistance at maximum rates.  The most significant aspect in relation to the 42,000 receiving unemployment assistance at the maximum rates was that there were 60,000 children dependent on them.  This is a social tragedy.  If the Parliamentary Secretary wants the <Col N="1522" /> House to accept and share responsibility and concern for this he should treat the House in the decent manner, to which the House is entitled.  The Parliamentary Secretary did not do so on this occasion.  Although I would like to say much more on this subject I am constrained by the time limit and the rules of the House.  The reason for this debate stems from the very excellent survey produced by the Ballyfermot Community Association.  I would like to join with Deputy Dowling and the other Deputies who put down this motion in congratulating the Ballyfermot Community Association for getting this discussion going.  The return to the so-called youth policy which we have been waiting for the last three or four years is symptomatic of the malaise from which this Government suffers.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid unemployment benefit up to the 20th October, 1976.  Subsequently a deciding officer disallowed his claim for a period of six weeks from 27th September, 1976, on the statutory ground that he had left his employment voluntarily without just cause. He also decided that his decision should only have effect as from the 21st October, 1976, thus allowing the payment of unemployment benefit already made in the case.  The person concerned was notified of this decision and of his right to appeal against it if he was dissatisfied.  He did not do so, however.</P>
      <P>On the expiration of the six weeks' period of disqualification he again became entitled to unemployment benefit.

In the course of normal investigation, however, it was found that his household consisted of his wife, his married daughter, his son-in-law and two grandchildren.  As his son-in-law does not come within the expected category he does not satisfy this condition.

      <P>The service in question was withdrawn with effect from the closing of the school for the 1976 summer vacation because the number of eligible children had fallen below the minimum number required to maintain the service.  It has been represented to the Department that additional eligible children have become available and the matter is being investigated. I will let the Deputy know the outcome in due course.</P>
