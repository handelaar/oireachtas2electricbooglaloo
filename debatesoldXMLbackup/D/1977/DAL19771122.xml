      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education which sectors of the educational system will be included in the Government's proposed White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question 30 of 15th November, 1977.  It would be my intention to refer to all sectors of education in the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell the House whether he is in favour of decentralising the administration of education and, if he does, whether he will take the principle of public accountability into full account when drawing up the White Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Education will not be starting to take that principle into account.  There is considerable decentralisation already and practically total decentralisation as far as vocational education is concerned. A certain amount of decentralisation has already occurred in regard to the office.  As the Deputy knows, the examinations branch has been transferred to Athlone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that the authorities of University College, Galway, have decided to employ a public relations firm to act on behalf <Col N="1345" /> of the college; if such expenditure by the college requires to be authorised by his Department or by the Higher Education Authority; and if such expenditure has been authorised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of formal authorisation does not normally arise in relation to detailed items within the budget of a university college and it did not arise in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we have the benefit of the Minister's opinion as to whether he believes that such practices should be encouraged or discouraged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not part of my duty to say whether it should be encouraged or discouraged.  As the Deputy knows, the Higher Education Authority make demands on the Department of Education and make allocations to the various universities and university colleges.  The accounts are subject to the inspection of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

    <P>5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware of research into selection procedures in secondary schools carried out in University College, Dublin for the secretariat of Catholic secondary schools; if he will comment on the research findings; and if he will make a statement on selection procedures in secondary schools generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the survey entitled &ldquo;Access to Secondary Education&rdquo; carried out by the Department of Social Science of University College, Dublin at the instance of the secretariat of secondary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The findings of the survey indicate that the incidence of non-acceptance by schools of all first-year applicants is relatively small, at 16 per cent of all schools and that the schools concerned are concentrated mainly in the large urban areas, particularly Dublin.  It is also indicated that the reason given by most of these schools for non-acceptance <Col N="1346" /> of all first-year applicants is lack of space or places.</P>
    <P>While I am pleased to note that this problem of non-acceptance of all first-year applicants by secondary schools would appear to be of smaller dimensions than may have been assumed, I would prefer to see even greater inroads being made into this area of selectivity so that all post-primary schools would bear their fair share of the burden of remedial education.</P>
    <P>Secondary schools are, of course, private institutions and I have no power to interfere in their enrolment procedures.  My responsibility as Minister is to ensure that all pupils who seek free post-primary education under the scheme are enabled to receive it.  From the inception of the scheme, no pupil seeking free post-primary education has ever been denied it and I shall ensure that this will continue to be the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of another finding of the survey, that approximately three-quarters of boys' secondary schools in Dublin practise some form of selection of pupils, of the considerable public disquiet about this practice in Dublin and other urban areas, and does he feel he has any responsibility, as the Minister in charge of giving substantial sums of money to these schools, to do something about the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already covered both points raised by the Deputy in my answer, namely, that it is in Dublin that the highest percentage concentration is and that I am not satisfied that the situation is a healthy one and would push for less selectivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, even though the question may be a minor one in the country as a whole, it is a major one, perhaps even reaching crisis proportions, in some of our cities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is a serious problem.  In my reply to the Deputy, I have indicated how it can be dealt with.  The <Col N="1347" /> most important single factor is a place for a student in a post-primary school. This I am going to guarantee as my predecessors did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to pupils who live adjacent to schools and who have been refused entry, does the Minister intend to establish some type of appeal system to ensure that there is no bias against such students?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving an example.  Would the Minister not consider establishing an appeal system in view of the nature of the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle has ruled that it is a separate question. If the Deputy would like to put down a specific question on that point we will deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister not at least ensure that schools which are in the free scheme do not give priority in their entrance procedures to pupils from private fee-paying primary schools which are run by the same order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In noting the Minister's concern about some of these practices, has he any suggestions as to how progress can be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason people were not admitted was lack of space or places.  There was a distinction made in my answer between space and places.  The solution should be along the line of providing plenty of places.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">

      <P>The Minister said the problem was particularly acute in Dublin.  I understood the Minister to say that 16 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it was more acute in Dublin.  I did not say it was particularly acute in Dublin.  It is more <Col N="1348" /> acute in Dublin as 16 per cent of all schools are involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the question of designation is one of allotting the responsibility for the assessment of expenditure to the Higher Education Authority.  I do not think that has anything to do with capital expenditure on the colleges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had any official communication at all from Cork County Council on the matter. I want to reiterate what I said to them, that the scheme made provision for adjacent and non-adjacent grants and that their scheme would have to conform to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education (i) if he is aware that the pick-up point for collection of children attending the national school in the Presentation Convent, Rahan, County Offaly, has been changed from the top of Pullough Road to Kelly's Gate at Derrycooley, Rahan, which means that the children have to walk over two miles to this new pick-up point; (ii) the reasons for changing the collection point; and (iii) if he intends to restore the former collection arrangement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>School transport routes are organised to meet the needs of children who are eligible for free transport.  Since there are no children eligible for free school transport residing west of Kelly's Cross, Derrycooley, the route of the service has been curtailed to that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary in a position to explain how these children were provided with school transport for many years in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from inquiries in respect of a scheme by public representative or others, it happens quite often that children who have been beneficiaries under that scheme may find themselves in the position that the original permission given is no longer tenable.  That is what happened in respect of the students about whom the Deputies inquired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am aware none of the parents was in communication with any public representatives prior to the change in the route.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the new route has the following effects on the children: first, they have to leave their homes about 7.45 a.m. and do not return until after 5 p.m.&mdash;and one of these children is aged about four years; second, is he aware that the new pick-up point is extremely dangerous <Col N="1369" /> and that the parents fear that this could result in serious accidents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking it that the Deputy is expressing concern for the Bracken, Rosney, Byrne and Kelly children&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>That point was not mentioned in the question, but I had it examined.  Apart from Deputy Enright, I had representations from other Deputies in the area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard of this problem before Deputy Enright put down his question.  I am examining the position. The <i>de jure</i> position is that those children are not entitled to free transport or fare-paying concessions, but having regard to the fact that they had this for some years I am looking at this matter in detail and will give it sympathetic consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Department made a mistake and gave transport to children to which they were not entitled, is it not a hardship on the children to remove the transport facility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not necessarily follow that the Department made the mistake; it could have been made locally.  When mistakes for which the children were not responsible have been made I would like to have permission to counter that by allowing those children to carry on as they had done in the past.  Unfortunately the rules at the moment would seem to prohibit me from doing that.  I am looking at the position and hope to be able to resolve the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 to 26 together.  I <Col N="1371" /> am at present preparing for the implementation of my Government's policy for youth and sport.  Aspects of <i>A Policy for Youth and Sport</i> of May, 1977, which conform to my Government's policy will be included. In this regard, (a) the continuance of the existing grant-in-aid scheme for voluntary youth and sport organisations, which has been in operation since 1969-70; (b) the provision of additional funds to vocational education committees for assistance to youth and sport; (c) the introduction of an in-service training scheme for full-time youth workers; and (d) the establishment of a sports council&mdash;will be included.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that the Government's youth and sport policy be implemented as soon as possible.  I have not yet decided on the question of community animateurs and the the interest subsidy schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the Parliamentary Secretary's first day at answering questions and he is inexperienced, but if he had had more time to think about it he would have realised that he should not have answered the six questions together.  Could he tell me how the list he has read out in answer to all the questions, even though he spoke of his Government's policy, was in <i>A Policy for Youth and Sport</i> published in April, 1977? Every one of those which has been implemented now was, moryah, this Government's proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  Before the policy was announced there was already a sports council which had been disbanded by the previous Government. There was already financial assistance to vocational education committees and a scheme for youth workers.  Practically everything that was recorded in the policy was already in existence.  Therefore I cannot understand how Deputy Barry would say to me that they occurred <i>de novo</i> from the policy scheme in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary point out the difference between what he has read out in reply to Questions Nos. 21 to 26 and <i>A <Col N="1372" /> Policy for Youth and Sport</i> which was published in April, 1977?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated that, in so far as the policy statement in question represents but the recording of that which already existed and which was my Government's policy at the time, that obviously will be retained. In respect of the animateurs, as they are called&mdash;which I see as an attempt at imitating the French style but which is not at all applicable to the circumstances here&mdash;I have reservations. In respect of the subsidy scheme, I am not too sure about it.  They are the two new aspects and I do not fully agree with the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The questions should not have been taken together.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary realise the tremendous responsibility which rests upon his shoulders with respect to youth? What exactly are his priorities in relation to youth and sport? Does he intend to implement those priorities through the Government youth policy and can he give us any indication of when he intends to introduce that policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated that I am hopeful that I will introduce what would be regarded as my Government's policy very shortly.  If the Deputy puts down a specific question as to what would be in it I shall answer him.  The questions put down by him refer to a policy document and not necessarily to my Government's policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, there are six enumerated items here which seem likely to be included in the Government's policy document.  Could I ask the Parliamentary Secretary what are his priorities in relation to youth affairs and sport?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>What are my priorities? The whole field of youth and <Col N="1373" /> sport is a priority with me and I am hoping that I will be in a position to redress the retrogression that occurred during the last four years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am indeed very happy to be in a position to bring this Bill before the House, a Bill that when enacted into law will end once and for all the creation of future ground rents on ordinary dwelling-houses.  The next instalment of landlord and tenant legislation that I will be promoting will tackle the problem of existing residential ground rents.  Meanwhile. what we are concerned with in this Bill is to put a stop to the creation of such rents.  It is a question of putting first things first, of doing first the most <Col N="1400" /> urgent job and then turning to the next most urgent job.</P>
    <P>The first question to be asked concerning this Bill is whether it is justifiable inasmuch as it proposes to restrict in a certain way an owner's freedom to dispose as he wishes of one particular kind of property, that is, residential building land.  I do not think this is a question that need be argued at length nowadays.  The situation that this Bill proposes to change is a situation where a house purchaser having paid a considerable sum for the site of his house &mdash;either as a component of the price of that house or as a separate transaction &mdash;is thereafter required to make further annual payments by way of ground rent.  That is a system that is no longer defended by a representative section of the community.</P>
    <P>In the past, before the enactment of the 1963 Planning Act, there may have been a case to be made for the system of selling dwelling-houses on the basis of long leases that reserved ground rents and imposed restrictive covenants on the owner occupiers so as to preserve the amenities of the neighbourhood. The necessity nowadays to get planning permission for new building and for alterations of a kind that could affect the amenities renders the leasehold system obsolete.  Its only real significance nowadays is a financial one for the landlord, but for the tenant it is more than that.  It is a system which denies him full ownership of the home which he has bought or is buying&mdash;a system which has given rise to understandable emotional objections in an era when the concept of full home ownership is regarded as a social ideal by all sections of the community and one which is actively supported by the State.</P>
    <P>Another question which may be asked is: what will be the cost of this prohibition?  In particular, will it make new houses more expensive for young people?  The answer to this is of some importance to me because the increased cost involved in making developers sell houses in fee simple rather than by way of a lease was given as the main reason for not going ahead with a prohibition on the <Col N="1401" /> creation of ground rents when the Bill for the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967, was before this House.  Indeed, my predecessor of the time, Deputy Lenihan, was very keen to introduce a prohibition but he was reluctantly forced to the view that the extra cost at that time might, as it were, be the straw to break the camel's back for many young people who were buying a home for the first time.  It must be remembered that around that time the purchase price of a £20 ground rent would have been at least £250 and that the same sum would then represent the deposit on a typical Small Dwellings Act house.</P>
    <P>It would be too easy for me to say we should have grasped the nettle in 1967 and, despite the possible hardship, introduced the prohibition.  Be that as it may, it is clear that things are very different now from what they then were.  I am fully satisfied that today the grant of a fee simple instead of a lease reserving a ground rent will not have any appreciable effect on the price of new houses.  The new system will certainly have no ill effect as regards the total repayments which a typical house purchaser has to meet following purchase subject to a mortgage or loan.</P>
    <P>On the positive side the prohibition proposed in this Bill will be an important step in the termination of a system of property ownership which is particularly offensive to many people.  It will also&mdash;in good time&mdash; help to create a system of legal title based on ownership in fee simple. This will be far clearer and less expensive to deal with than the present morass of leasehold titles with its resultant &ldquo;pyramid of interests&rdquo; which has been so rightly criticised in the past.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might now deal with the actual provisions of the Bill.  What the Bill proposes in the private sector is that apart from renewals of existing ground leases any future attempted ground lease of an ordinary dwelling will be void.  This means that apart from the special provision in section 2 (4), which I will discuss in a moment, any such attempted lease will simply be a nullity.  As far as the public <Col N="1402" /> sector is concerned, the prohibition on the creation of future ground rents on dwelling-houses is, by section 4 of the Bill, being extended to local housing authorities.  I shall also come back to this provision later on.</P>
    <P>Renewals of existing ground leases are excluded from the prohibition under section 2 (2).  The right of a ground lessee to obtain a renewed lease, known as a reversionary lease, as an alternative to acquiring the fee simple under the 1967 Ground Rents Act, is an important right in itself.  I think it is important to preserve this right.  This is in keeping with the general principle enshrined in the existing ground rents legislation that the tenant is given the right to terminate his liability to pay ground rent but is not forced to do so.  Even if it were decided to abolish this right in the future on the ground that the grant of a fee simple on termination of a lease is a better alternative, it would not be appropriate to do so in the context of this Bill.  Such a change would be better dealt with in the context of any future changes in the law relating to renewal rights.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not extend to multiple-dwelling buildings, as the definition of &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; in section 1 of the Bill makes clear.  I am aware that newly-constructed self-contained flats are nowadays sold under arrangements that can involve payment of rent.  However, transactions involving the sale and purchase of such flats are in a special category where different considerations apply and they are accordingly outside the scope of the Bill which I am bringing in for the benefit of owner-occupiers of ordinary dwelling-houses.</P>
    <P>It may be useful to mention at this point that after the Bill has become law any attempted creation of a fee farm grant of a dwelling-house will be void, as well as any attempted ground lease in the ordinary sense of that term. I am aware that over recent years the ancient form of conveyancing by way of fee farm grant has become more popular.  However, it is a form of title which does not give the tenant full ownership.  It is not a fee simple&mdash;the <Col N="1403" /> legal estate which most closely reflects full ownership.  What this Bill is all about is ensuring that houseowners will be full owners of their homes.</P>
    <P>The prohibition on giving fee farm grants is achieved by providing in section 5 that the Bill when enacted into law shall be construed as one Act with the preceding Landlord and Tenant Acts.  In the preceding Acts the expression &ldquo;lease&rdquo; is defined as including a fee farm grant.  Consequently references to a &ldquo;lease&rdquo; in this Bill include where appropriate a reference to a fee farm grant.  That means that in effect the proposed prohibition will extend to every known kind of arrangement that could be availed of to create a ground rent in the future.</P>
    <P>As to the means by which this is done I must say that, unfortunately, it is not possible simply to prohibit &ldquo;ground rents&rdquo; as such.  If this were possible the text of the Bill would be a lot more simple.  But it is not possible because there is no legal definition of the term &ldquo;ground rent&rdquo;. Ground rents can be described as rents reserved by particular types of leases which may vary quite a lot but all of which record a landlord and tenant relationship in which the tenant can be seen to own the &ldquo;bricks and mortar&rdquo; interest.</P>
    <P>These categories of leases have been identified at different times and described in various enactments, particularly in the Landlord and Tenant Acts of 1931, 1958 and 1967.  The most extensive existing description of the kinds of leases concerned is in section 3 of the 1967 Act and it is by reference to this that section 2 (1) of the Bill sets out the proposed prohibition.  These are the kinds of leases under which the lessees have the right to purchase the fee simple under the 1967 Ground Rents Act.</P>
    <P>There is one addition to this list provided for in the Bill.  The Landlord and Tenant Commission furnished a report&mdash;their second report&mdash;in which they identified further classes of ground leases in addition to those covered by the Act of 1967.  However, in practice only one of these further types of ground leases could <Col N="1404" /> give rise to the creation of a ground rent in the future.  This one type of ground lease&mdash;with which section 3 deals&mdash;can arise where the housebuilder or developer is himself the owner in fee simple of the lands involved, where the house is already built or partly-built at the time of purchase, and where the builder or developer sells the house by way of a long lease usually with a substantial fine and reserving a ground rent.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the means proposed in this Bill to prohibit the creation of future ground rents is to declare void any leases of the kind which are known to reserve such rents.  I have had examined exhaustively all the possible effects of this mechanism and the provisions in subsections (3) to (6) of section 2 have been inserted to deal either with possible loopholes or with practical difficulties which might arise.</P>
    <P>It will not be possible, for example, to circumvent the proposed prohibition by giving a long lease of a vacant site and building a house on the site afterwards.  Leases of vacant land as such are not being prohibited nor is anyone suggesting they should be. However, if a long lease of land is made in the future and if that land has a house built on it subsequently and the total area of the land is such that all of the land is subsidiary and ancillary to the house, then that lease will be rendered void by section 2 (3) of the Bill.  It will be clear from what I have said that the scope of this provision is restricted to house sites.  In effect, if a lease of a vacant site is given after the passing of the legislation and the lessee wants to put a dwelling on it afterwards he will, like any other developer, have to get in the fee simple.</P>
    <P>This brings me to section 2 (4).  This provision is designed to protect house purchasers in future who might find that having made substantial payments to secure their new houses they have simply been given a void lease.  The proposal to give the house purchaser in such a case the right to acquire the fee simple at the expense of the purported lessor is intentionally draconian and it serves to warn <Col N="1405" /> builders, developers and others concerned that, after this Bill has become law, they must take due care not to give void leases.  On the other hand, section 2 (5) of the Bill protects developers who may find themselves saddled currently with leasehold land in course of residential building development.  Such a developer would be unable to sell his houses otherwise than in fee simple because of the prohibition in this Bill.  At the same time, he could find himself in the position of being unable to acquire the fee simple at any reasonable price or indeed at any price.  Section 2 (5) proposes to give him the right, for a period of one year, to acquire the fee simple in the land under the 1967 Ground Rents Act.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (6) of the Bill is a provision of a somewhat technical nature to cater for the difficulty the Bill poses for the trustees of a charitable housing trust who under the terms of the trust are not empowered to sell the houses to their tenants in fee simple and who yet would be unable to sell by way of ground lease once the Bill had become law.  Section 2 (6) proposes to give the trustees the necessary power to sell to their tenants in fee simple.</P>
    <P>I now come to the provision of the Bill dealing with the public sector. Dwellings provided by housing authorities have been excluded from the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Code by section 3 of the 1931 Act and purchasers of such dwellings have not had a statutory right to acquire the fee simple interest in their dwellings under the 1967 Act.  However, under section 4 (1) of this Bill the prohibition on the creation of future ground rents will be extended to sales of local authority dwellings.</P>
    <P>A new dwelling can be sold by a housing authority to a person other than the existing tenant, as, for example, to the first occupier when he takes up occupation.  In this case the dwelling is sold at cost less the equivalent of any grants payable for new private houses.  As those sales are analogous to sales of private houses, it is intended that the fee simple interest should in future vest in the purchaser.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> Where a dwelling is sold to the local authority tenant, however, the terms of sale under section 90 of the Housing Act, 1966, are heavily subsidised from public funds as compared with the financial assistance available to private householders.  It is necessary therefore for housing authorities to ensure that in the case of a resale of such a dwelling the vendor and his dependants are not left without adequate alternative housing accommodation and also that the intended purchaser is in need of housing.  To meet the situation the Bill provides that, while the disposal of such a dwelling will be in fee simple, some special conditions will apply. These will operate for 25 years from the date of sale and will stipulate that the dwelling shall be used as the normal place of residence by the purchaser or his successor in title and that the dwelling cannot be resold without the consent of the housing authority.</P>
    <P>I must point out that special conditions, including those I have mentioned, apply to sales of all local authority dwellings at present and extend to the full period of the lease, which is normally 99 years.  Under the Bill, tenant purchasers of local authority dwellings will in every case acquire title to their dwelling in fee simple, free of any ground rent, but subject to the two conditions specified in section 4 (2) for a period of 25 years.</P>
    <P>Local authority tenant purchasers have never heretofore had the statutory right to enlarge their leasehold interest to a fee simple interest or to obtain a reversionary lease.  However, under this Bill the benefits accruing to owner occupiers in general will also extend to future tenant purchasers, subject to the conditions which are designed to ensure that housing accommodation provided at a heavy cost to public funds continues to be used at least for a reasonable period for the basic purposes for which it was provided.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a constructive debate on the proposals in the Bill.  I believe both sides of the House are united in agreeing with the purpose of the Bill.  Since this is so it may well be that much of our discussion may be appropriate to the examination which <Col N="1407" /> the detailed provisions will get during the Committee Stage of the Bill.  However, before I conclude there is one point I should like to make about these provisions.  It would be most unfortunate if we were to deal with this Bill as if it were an unimportant and preliminary adjunct to the task which still faces this House in relation to existing ground rents.</P>
    <P>I say this not only because this Bill is designed essentially to stop the creation of ground rents and so, from a practical point of view, it will substantially affect the number of existing ground rents which will fall to be dealt with in future legislation.  I say it also because from a technical point of view this Bill will bring about what is probably the biggest change in conveyancing practice ever introduced in this country or which this country is ever likely to experience in the future. From now on all new houses will have to be conveyed in fee simple rather than by way of the normal long lease. This is a matter of extreme importance not only for the legal profession but also for developers and prospective houseowners.  For that reason the provisions themselves have to be approached with very great responsibility. I know that this is the approach which all Members will adopt.  I assure the House that I will welcome constructive criticism in this regard.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Bill meets with the approval of the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. My only criticism is not what is in the Bill but what is not in the Bill.  I say this in the context of the manifesto of the Minister's Government.  I shall explain my remarks in that regard in more detail later.  The major criticism I have to make of the Minister's most comprehensive statement is that he did not trace the source of this Bill, the authorship of this Bill. It must be made clear to the House and to the public that this is in fact a Coalition measure, and it would be totally misleading to have it seen as anything else but that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1408" /> The last Government introduced the Landlord and Tenant Bill in February last and section 108 of that Bill provided the very restriction now covered in this measure.  That cannot be overemphasised since people might be misled into believing that this measure in any way meets the Fianna Fáil commitment in regard to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.</P>
    <P>We welcome the Bill.  It is a development in landlord and tenant law.  Since 1967 ground rent tenants have had the right to purchase their freeholds.  It was envisaged, and it is important to mention this, that under the National Coalition Bill this right would be extended to other classes of tenants.  That Bill fell with the dissolution of the Dáil and that particular reform is not included in this measure.  Another important reform which is omitted was that aimed at making it easier and much less expensive for ground rent tenants to purchase their freeholds.  A system had been devised whereby this could be done very easily by the payment of the purchase money to the county registrar.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals solely with a restriction on the right to create new ground rents.  That was covered, as I said, by section 108 of the National Coalition Bill.  That Bill contained no fewer than 122 sections and many of those introduced considerable reforms in the landlord and tenant code and a considerable amelioration of the lot of the tenants.  I urge the Minister not to be dilatory in dealing with these aspects.  These are aspects that should be dealt with as a matter of urgency and he could do that by reintroducing the National Coalition Bill, excluding section 8.</P>
    <P>There are some areas in this Bill in which I would not see eye to eye with the Minister from the point of view of draftsmanship.  These are matters, however, which can be discussed at length on Committee Stage. I imagine there are various bodies&mdash; tenant organisations, landlord organisations, if there are such, the Bar Council, the Incorporated Law Society&mdash;which would be interested in studying the provisions of this Bill to <Col N="1409" /> ensure that the object the Bill seeks to achieve is achieved.  I trust that in addition there are no side-effects, as it were, which will work against the interests of the tenants.</P>
    <P>I shall not go into details which I understand would not be in order at this stage.  There is disappointment that acceptance of the principle of the abolition of existing ground rents is not in the Bill.  That sentence does not come from my own mouth; I found it in the contribution of the present Minister on the National Coalition's Landlord and Tenant Bill, 1977, last February.  These being the Minister's own words, at this stage he must accept the sense of urgency on this side of the House to see something being done about existing residential ground rents.  There was a clear commitment by the Minister and his colleagues in their manifesto to provide a scheme which would lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.  This Bill does nothing to implement that commitment.  Why do we not have such a Bill before the House?  Why not have one Bill covering the two points? It is because the Minister at the time of the commitment or even at this stage has not decided how this commitment can be honoured?</P>
    <P>There may be reasons for dealing with the abolition of future ground rents in a separate Bill and, if so, I presume the Minister will explain them.  It would not be very important if, in fact, a second Bill were being introduced to deal with existing ground rents.  What worries me&mdash;and it is a legitimate worry&mdash;is that the Minister has now produced a Bill dealing with future ground rents, and, as far as the House and the country are concerned, that may be the end of it for a considerable time.  For that reason it is very important that stress should be laid on the fact that this Bill was a Coalition measure which is re-introduced and even now, with the present Government five or six months in power, nothing has been done in respect of the commitment made to existing ground rent tenants.</P>
    <P>Subject to points that may be raised <Col N="1410" /> on the Committee Stage the principle in the Bill is welcomed by my party. It is a good development in the whole social structure to have householders owning the freehold of their own houses.  This principle was accepted by my party in the past and this very provision was included in the Bill introduced last February by the National Coalition.  The Minister will receive, I believe, the total co-operation of the House in getting the Bill through but at the same time it is necessary to voice the anxious demands of tenants to the Minister to get on with the job of implementing the commitment he made to the electorate to abolish existing ground rents.  My major criticism of the Minister is that we have not seen such a Bill and we and the country are waiting for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill on behalf of the Labour Party as we would welcome any measure directed towards ending the ground rents system.  This Bill is very much overdue and indeed all the actions of both Governments in the past 12 months have been overdue.</P>
      <P>In 1964 the Conroy Commission set up to inquire into and report on the whole question of ground rents reported. They recommended that tenants be given full rights to buy out their ground rents and recommended means of achieving this.  It also advised that creation of future ground rents should be prohibited.  The lapse of 13 years since that report reflects no great urgency on the part of any Government to remedy the situation.  We have reached a position, however, where there is no disagreement in principle: we all hold that the ground rents system in respect of residential property, ordinary dwellings, as they are described in the explanatory memorandum to this Bill, is an archaic system that is a relic of feudal days creating a great deal of hardship for a great number of people and that it should go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We agree that the benefits of the system in the main go to landlords, their heirs or successors, people who draw large unearned incomes from the basic primary need of less fortunate human beings.  There may be exceptions <Col N="1411" /> to that, people whose sole income comes from ground rents.  There are probably some of those, but in the main there is no sympathy for those who derive a large, unearned income from ground rents.  As the Minister said, it is an emotive subject because very often these are people who have little or no moral claim and very often less interest in the source of this income. It is a system crowded with anomalies.  In bygone days leases were so short that householders had a very precarious existence.  With the growth of more enlightened attitudes through the years, progress has been made resulting in a huge volume of legislation in the area of land and land tenure.  One could read all 900-odd pages of Wylie's Irish Land Law into the record.  There are people who would have the stamina to do it and obviously there are people on both sides of the House who could do it with more effect and with more familiarity with the text than I have.</P>
    <P>This is not the point.  We must look at matters as they are now and do our best to improve them in the interests of overburdened householders.  From my experience I believe that the 1967 Act was not of any great benefit to the people whom it was meant to help because of the difficulty in tracking down titles, because of the protracted nature of some of these dealings and because of the heavy legal costs. Householders very often knew in advance that the sum demanded would be substantial and many of them could not get it together.  Even if they could get it together they very often needed the money for something else.</P>
    <P>A great number of householders were not covered under that Act also. There are still areas where landlords or their heirs cannot be traced and where in some cases the last known heirs are presumed to be dead.  All over the country there are whole sides of streets where people cannot get title to their property.  Some of these properties are residential dwellings and some are residences combined with a small business.  People who want to buy out their property are frustrated by the difficulties which surround this <Col N="1412" /> matter at present.  Progress made up to now has not been to anyone's great credit and we will not serve any great purpose if we start haggling amongst ourselves about who did the most in the past.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduced in 1977 by the previous Minister for Justice was a big, complicated and very far-reaching step forward.  It was geared to implement the provisions of the Conroy Commission.  It would have been law now had the general election not intervened. The case put forward for whatever delay existed was good.  There were over 100 sections and there were many amendments.  In the nature of things these matters take time to sort out and we could not have a Committee Stage of that magnitude in a matter of a week or two.</P>
    <P>In the intervening time we had valuable legislation.  We had legislation in the whole area of social welfare, women's rights and workers' rights and the last few months of the last Dáil were devoted to very useful purposes.  While I would have liked to have seen the 1977 Bill become law, there is no question but that the legislation which took precedence over it in the time schedule of the previous Government was very important legislation. The present Minister, very understandably and very legitimately at the time, took advantage of the lapse and, it being election time, came in and announced the intentions of his party to abolish ground rents completely or at least to introduce a scheme which would lead to the abolition of ground rents completely.</P>
    <P>A lot of the debate that has taken place since then has hinged around that promise.  I have doubts about election time promises, but in this situation the Minister repeated very firmly last week that it was his intention to introduce a scheme that would lead to the abolition of ground rents within six months.  I was very sorry not to have been in a position, due to circumstances beyond my control, to be present during the debate last week. In view of that election promise and in view of last week's repetition of that promise, most of us can be forgiven for wondering why the Minister <Col N="1413" /> chose to implement this promise in two stages and why we do not have one Bill catering for the whole thing.  From the Minister's statements it appears that it is his intention to fulfil the promise within the six months he allocated to himself, but we are almost five months into that period now.  Why this period should be split into two phases within a period of one month is something I do not understand.</P>
    <P>We can be forgiven for eagerly awaiting the details of the second Bill. We have been told that the Constitution will not be changed.  We understand from statements made by ACRA, by the Minister and by speakers on behalf of his party that there may well be no question of compensation.  I do not know whether these speakers know something that we on this side of the House do not know.  I cannot conceive of a situation where the Minister would elaborate on his views to anybody outside the House, no matter how interested they are, before elaborating on them for us in the House.  We wonder whether the terms of the second Bill will lead to the abolition of ground rents or a scheme leading to the total abolition of ground rents. The Minister may increase the incentives, he may reduce the multiplier, he may, through aids of various kinds, make it easier for the lessee to buy out the ground rent.  No matter what the Minister does the initiative will be with the lessee, and I do not know how the Minister could guarantee that this would of necessity lead to the abolition of ground rents.  Will the second Bill merely streamline and improve the provision of the 1967 Act, or will it do what the Minister has promised it will?  I sincerely hope that the Bill will do what the Minister promises.  A lot of people are looking forward to that, and expect nothing less.</P>
    <P>We welcome this legislation in so far as it prohibits the creation of future ground rents.  The Minister in his speech said that the ground rents system as it existed denied the householder full ownership of his house and that it was a system which could not be accepted by the community today.  I fully agree.  I am happy that the Minister is satisfied from his inquiries that a situation where the creation of future <Col N="1414" /> ground rents is prohibited will not result in houses being more expensive for young people.  A lot of the aims intended by Parliament to make houses more accessible to young people often result in houses being more expensive. The Bill covers most aspects of the situation where a long term lease might be granted and a house built afterwards, and it covers the position of local authority tenants.  I might have some reservation here.  I agree it may improve the position for some local authority tenants.  A number of local authorities impose restrictions on the outright sale of houses to new tenants &mdash;there is an imposition of 25 years residence in some cases.</P>
    <P>My complaint is that we appear to have a separate attitude to local authority tenants.  Undoubtedly they are subsidised, but we subsidise private houses as well; we subsidise business people and farmers, but we seem to preserve a special hold on local authority tenants.  That is not to say that I object totally to what is in the Bill but I will reflect between now and Committee Stage on what is proposed in the Bill in regard to local authority tenants.  I repeat that I welcome the Bill as a major step forward and I look forward to a follow-up Bill in the coming months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, like the bulk of the legislative work which the House has been engaged in since 12th October, is the product of the work of the National Coalition Government. It might have been expecting a superhuman display of virtue, of generosity, from the Minister to expect him to admit as much in his opening statement, but so much of the time of the House is being spent considering work done by the National Coalition that I am inclined to think that some indication of the truth in this regard in common decency might be expected from members of the Government who, on being elected to office, found a rich array of valuable work waiting for them to be completed, quite apart from the record number of measures which the 20th Dáil passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is yet another piece of National Coalition legislation and it makes me wonder whether we shall ever see the <Col N="1415" /> end of National Coalition legislation during the 20th Dáil.  This Dáil is being run still by the National Coalition&mdash;that is the simple truth of the matter.  Only three Fianna Fáil measures of the faintest substance have been seen in this House since the resumption on 12th October, and I must tell the House what they were.</P>

      <P>I do not like to interrupt the Deputy but we are dealing with a particular Bill, not with other measures which either have come before the House or will be coming before the House.  Would the Deputy deal with the Bill before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>During the four-and-a-half years of the National Coalition Government a lot of the time was spent listening to Fianna Fáil Deputies foaming at the mouths because this or that was not being done, and they used the most trivial excuses to get that on the record.  No matter what the measure before the House was, it was used as an excuse to drag in a whole lot of extraneous matter about which the then Government were alleged to be indifferent.</P>
      <P>I do not want to trespass or tread on the Chair's indulgence, but I want to put on record that this House has been doing nearly nothing but National Coalition work since 12th October.  Apart from the European Assembly Bill and the two Ministers and Secretaries Bill, which could be boiled down to the proposition that the Government members were not sufficiently distinguished by their titles and needed to be decorated a little more&mdash;they needed to pin a few more decorations on themselves of a verbal kind&mdash;we have seen nothing worth talking about before the House in the past six weeks that was not already there when the Government arrived in office, all provided by the sweat and efforts of the National Coalition and of the devoted public servants who stood behind them.  I am sure the present Minister for Justice is having the same impartial devotion from his officials, and I foresee that we will appreciate that as this debate progresses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1416" /> As Deputy O'Keeffe succinctly told the House, this Bill is a re-enactment of part of the Landlord and Tenant Bill of early this year.  The guts of this Bill propose to re-enact section 108 of the earlier Bill.  There are other ancillary provisions which did not appear in the earlier Bill.  In regard to that earlier Bill, a large number of amendments were put in by both sides, fair play to Fianna Fáil in that regard, after the Second Stage.  That measure was introduced by Long Title, or if not it was promised, by the previous Minister for Justice nearly two years before the Dáil was dissolved, and I spent a lot of time trying to ensure that it would not be caught in a legislative bottleneck.  I pressed the then Minister for Justice repeatedly about that legislation and it was only after I had made myself a nuisance to him that he told me the whole story about the Bill's complexities, the large number of tricky points which made it necessary to have the Bill sent back and forth between the Department, the draftsman, the Attorney General and so on, and having seen the Bill that emerged, I understood that.</P>
    <P>Because the present Minister has chosen to take only a small part out of that Bill, the same considerations of delay do not apply.  The main problem which I see was adverted to by Deputies Desmond and O'Keeffe.  It is the effect of this measure on the price of houses.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that we as politicians have not been honest with the people when discussing topics like ground rents with them.  &ldquo;Ground rent&rdquo; has a nice feudal ring about it, something that is an easy target for agitators, but money invested in a ground rent is not any different from money put in the Post Office Savings Bank, into Government securities, into a commercial company, into house property or into a farm or any other form of investment in which the person investing does not ally with that money his own sweat.  There is no essential difference between a ground rent and those other forms of investment.  I admit that its connection with landlordism and all the other paraphernalia and junk of an unhappy national past gives the <Col N="1417" /> thing an overtone which makes it an easy and convenient target, but politicians should not be in the business of egging people on to attack easy and convenient targets.  They should be trying to call halt, trying to lead the people to a true version of what is going on.</P>
    <P>Ground rents are a form of investment protected, like any other form of investment, by the Constitution, as the Minister admits because I have heard him put it on the record of the House. Ground rents are not in any way a legitimate target for propagandists or agitators, even when the recipient of a ground rent is an absentee.  Somebody living in Dublin and drawing money from an investment in an English company, in ICI or some such company&mdash;there are many small investors of that kind, humble people&mdash; are absentee investors every bit as much as the owner of a ground rent. They have not the faintest interest in what happens to the workers in ICI. They have not the faintest interest in the kind of business the company may be doing, good or bad.  They are drawing their money out of an enterprise which is worldwide, but which is centred outside this country and which has got its capital and its workforce outside the country.  The only interest which the Dublin investor has is to get a dividend and possibly to see his capital appreciate.  I have to say that in justice and fair play to people, many of whom are perfectly reasonable people in no way deserving of the obloquy which has been heaped on them in consequence of this agitation about ground rents.</P>
    <P>A large proportion of building speculators go to the wall because they cannot do their sums or because they are not experienced enough in the business, but a builder who minds his business will calculate his outlay, his likely profit and so on; and it may suit him to lay out his money in such a way that he gets a large proportion now but a certain amount remains outstanding in the form of a rent which he will receive over the years.  If the law permits him to use the second part of that investment package it will be reflected in relative modesty in the first part.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1418" /> This is naturally so.  If I can raise capital and venture that capital by building houses or by becoming the type of entrepreneur so often talked about by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and the Minister for Finance, building a factory to make insoles and exporting them to Taiwan, that is an investment too, admittedly in this case allied with more of my own sweat.  In a case like that I equally make calculations about the length of time before my capital will return with interest and when there will be a surplus. If I am prevented from calculating any return after a certain date, I will look for a certain return before that date.  I am certain that the Minister's advisers are more versed in the realities of this than I am.  I am surprised that the Minister sheered away so quickly from that topic.  He did say that in 1967 a £20 ground rent could not be bought for less than about £250, but that nowadays it is not such a problem.  I wish that he would have spelled out the size of the problem. At what figure does he estimate its true dimension?  That is the figure by which the cost of houses such as attract a £20 ground rent conventionally will be increased in the price of the fee simple.</P>
    <P>It does not suit the politicians to tell the people that.  I would be very surprised if any of the ACRA deputations have heard those cold facts.  Although I mention politicians, I blame the Minister's party&mdash;and will continue to blame them until they change their spots&mdash;for being ten times worse in this than the rest of us.  It does not suit them to tell the people the truth; it suits them to tell the people what is easy and what is soft.  In the late election they threw to the people every cheap sop, every soft option they could think of, ones that had been asked for sectionally and ones that had not been asked for.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance made a speech last week which did not get the attention it deserved.  I did my best to publicise it subsequently by attacking it, but the Press and the public did not take any notice of that either.  The Minister said last week that he was a bit depressed at the way we were becoming <Col N="1419" /> a society of &ldquo;lobby-power&rdquo; and sectional interests.</P>

      <P>Everybody knows this Bill would not be here today were it not for persistent agitation, fomented or at least acquiesced in by politicians of all sides over several years.  Other parts of the previous Minister's important and valuable Landlord and Tenant Bill would be here, but this particular Bill might not have been here.  It is here in consequence of a lobby, and of the very same use of power about which the Minister for Finance was warning and scolding us last week.  He was scolding us for going around in lobbies, although his is the party who have drawn lobbies out of the ground like dragons' teeth.  By their invitation to every softie in the country to demand that he be let off any obligation, the Minister's party have encouraged, fomented and fertilised the growth of these lobbies.  I will not listen to the Minister at one moment standing behind an advertisement such as appeared in the national newspapers last June, being elected on it and ending up as Tánaiste and Minister for Finance in consequence of it, and in the next breath ticking us off because we are a nation of lobbies, because sectional power is coming to the top.  That is not my idea of a straight man or a straight party.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil manifesto <Col N="1420" /> was described as &ldquo;an action plan for national recovery&rdquo;.  In regard to ground rent the Taoiseach said he would &ldquo;provide for the abolition of existing residential ground rents&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I am quoting from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 4th June.  It was a stereotyped advertisement and was to be found in every paper.  The Taoiseach leads a party who were always great verbal acrobats.  The history of that party goes back to Document No. 2, which is the greatest monument in verbal acrobatics in this country this century.  At the same time I do not think that even the author of Document No. 2 would have done anything except stare in bewildered admiration at an advertisement which could describe as an &ldquo;abolition&rdquo; a mere mechanical improvement in the mode of buying out ground rents.  He would instantly have promoted the young man who had thought of such a simple way to describe a complicated legal process.</P>
      <P>I have to live on the flat of the earth like everyone else, and I have transactions every week in housekeeping and otherwise in which I buy things and pay for them.  I suppose my grocery transactions next week may include a pound of rashers or a can of gas.  Once these things are handed to me I have &ldquo;abolished&rdquo; the ownership of the grocer.  His ownership is &ldquo;abolished&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the English language usage which the Government are sponsoring, I demand to say that I am &ldquo;abolishing&rdquo; my grocer's interest in these groceries&mdash;though of course I am paying for them.  This is a fair and accurate description of what is happening; I describe it as an &ldquo;abolition&rdquo; of property.  As long as <Col N="1421" /> I have life and breath and am a Member of this House I will not let that party away with this.  They promised the people that existing ground rents&mdash; not future ones because the Coalition had already half done that&mdash;would be abolished.  I do not care what friends they may have in the ACRA court, but I am damned if any rank and file member of ACRA, or the ordinary secretary chairman of a residents' association, will regard his ground rent as &ldquo;abolished&rdquo; if he is merely given a simplified mechanism for buying it out.</P>
      <P>Mind you, Sir, it will have to be a very simplified mechanism indeed, because a simplified mechanism was provided eight months ago by Senator Pat Cooney.  It was a simplified and cheap mechanism, whereby the fee simple would be vested in the person entitled to acquire it by a transaction in the office of the county registrar with only the most limited necessity for incurring court and legal fees.  It will need to be a very simple procedure to overtake that one.  It is going to be a procedure so simple that it could be carried out by an unlettered tribesman in the Gobi desert&mdash;although I would not put it past the Government to try to take lessons out of the book of such a tribesman if they thought they would get away with it. I doubt if they will surpass section 73 of the former Minister's Bill for simplicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they are not going to do it that way, how are they going to do it?  As the Minister's predecessor said, there are only two ways of abolishing ground rent, which is a form of property indistinguishable in essence from an investment in the common or garden local post office, whatever its social overtones may be.  There are only two ways of doing it, by confiscation or by compensation. Confiscation is ruled out.  They cannot be confiscated, because our Constitution, so far, does not permit the outright confiscation of a form of property.  The best that can be done is compulsory acquisition with compensation, analogous to the compulsory acquisitions which we already have in some areas, and which have <Col N="1422" /> never been successfully challenged. That can be done.  Now, there are only two thinkable sources for compensation if existing ground rents are to be bought out.  Either the tenants are going to buy them out; or the State is going to buy them out; or a mixture of the two.  It is no use talking about buying out for a few years' purchase.  There is no point in talking about a &ldquo;reduced multiplier&rdquo;.  If the implication of a &ldquo;reduced multiplier&rdquo; is that the ground landlord will be forced to take substantially less than the market value of the ground rent, it will run up against the same constitutional difficulty as an outright confiscation.  In so far as it is a partial confiscation, it will run up against the same difficulty.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows this perfectly well.  He also knows that time is running out for him.  He made this promise, which is reflected in his Taoiseach's national statement, and backed it up with a specific promise &mdash;which he was man enough to brandish last week during Private Members' Business&mdash;when he spoke about the six-month time limit which he had allotted himself.  Sir, that six months will expire on 5th January; which leaves the Minister six weeks in which to produce a scheme.  He cannot produce a confiscatory scheme; he cannot produce a scheme which is half confiscatory.  Therefore he must produce a compensatory scheme.  If it is to be completely compensatory, paid for by the ground lessee, he will say to the Minister &ldquo;Thanks for nothing. The National Coalition gave us that much.&rdquo;</P>

If it is compensatory and is to be paid for by the tenant, the tenant will not thank the Government, and I will make use of my political prerogative to make hay out of that tenant's displeasure. If it is intended that the State should compensate the ground landlord, the Minister will have to find not £65 <Col N="1423" /> million, which is the figure allotted to the replacement of residential rates, but £165 million.</P>

      <P>I am coming to that. The Minister for the Environment told the people in a recent broadcast that the Government would find the £65 million on what they would save from social welfare through the creation of 20,000 instant jobs.  I cannot see 20,000 instant jobs, and I certainly cannot see 20,000 off the social welfare, let alone a sum which would pay for the abolition of residential rates.  What would that task be compared with the task of buying out the ground landlords? I am trying to put in simple terms the difficulties that face the Minister. The Minister is a decent and likeable sort of man, and I do not wish him to be in greater difficulties than I would wish on one of my own side. On the other hand, I do not have great sympathy for him, because he has wished this crisis on himself.  He and his party, with their reckless issuing of promises, their soft-soaping and rubbing-up-the-rightway of every little lobby group in the country have brought this on themselves&mdash;and they are only seeing the beginning of it.

The Minister has reached into it and taken from its entrails the provision <Col N="1424" /> which deals with the future situation of ground rent.  That is only one section.  What will happen to the other sections of the Bill?  I have no particular interest in it, and it is not my spokesmanship to inquire about it, but in his reply the Minister should tell the House what he proposes to do in regard to Part Three, which is an amending addition to the Landlord and Tenant Acts, Part Four, which refers to reversionary leases, Part Five, which refers to sporting leases, Part Six, which refers to other provisions in regard to the purchase of the fee simple, and Part Seven, which refers to the apportionment of rent, and the Part that relates to covenants and leases.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. The Minister has fulfilled his promise of last week that he would introduce a Bill to abolish future ground rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Deputy O'Keeffe's remarks, I should like to remind him that the National Coalition made a promise in June, 1974, to take measures similar to those the Minister is taking today.  At their meeting on 6th June, 1974, the Government decided that legislation should be prepared on the basis of proposals submitted by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Patrick Cooney, TD, on the subject of ground rents.  A statement was issued after that meeting to the <Col N="1425" /> effect that the Minister intended introducing legislation as soon as possible and that it would contain a provision to prohibit the creation of future ground rents.  It is easy to confuse the issue by raising matters before and since that date, but it is significant that a clearcut statement was made on 6th June, 1974, on behalf of the Government, and that a Bill has not been introduced until now.  The Minister has been criticised for not going far enough and not doing enough but at least he has taken action.</P>
    <P>The second point I should like to make relates to the statement by Deputy O'Keeffe that a Bill dealing with landlords and tenants was introduced in February but had not achieved anything before the Dáil was dissolved in mid-May.  From February to mid-May is a long period for such inaction.  Certainly, there is no indication of any great sense of urgency on the part of the last Government about the Bill or in relation to the prohibition of the creation of future ground rents.  The National Coalition boasted that during their term in office 100,000 new houses were built and it must be stated that a simple measure like that being introduced by the Minister today would have benefited those who purchased or occupied those houses.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to Deputy Desmond's contribution.  I realise that the provisions in the Bill are the same as those which apply currently under the transfer order which applies to local authority houses so that in effect the same measures will be used to ensure that local authority houses are not speculated upon.  I share Deputy Desmond's point of view in relation to local authority tenants and I am sure she will agree that in a number of cases those living in such accommodation are subjected to the kind of speculation which this measure was designed originally to do away with. Deputy Kelly made a heated contribution to this subject.  He told us that the National Coalition promised two years before the last Dáil was dissolved to introduce a Bill similar to this.  He also told us that there were complexities which delayed such an <Col N="1426" /> introduction.  The Deputy told us that the National Coalition had gone half way towards abolishing ground rents at that time.  In my view the National Coalition made promises earlier than 1974.  To tell us that the National Coalition succeeded in half abolishing ground rent is a new aspect to this question.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly also asked a question about the price of new houses in future if ground rents are abolished but the Minister has told us if this did not have any effect in 1964 and 1967 it would hardly be of any significance at this stage.  The removal of a ground rent amounting to £15 or £20 annually will not have any effect on the price of a new house.  It can only be regarded as a device to have a hold on a householder. I do not accept the point he made in that regard.  I was amazed at the scathing attack and the insinuations made by Deputy Kelly against those who have pressed for years for a change in this law.  His contribution in this regard surprised and disappointed me because I would regard this as the age of responsible lobbying. There are many lobbies here other than the ACRA lobby and they all press their own points of view.  I accept that it is the prerogative of a government to decide between the points of view but it is also the responsibility of such organisations to responsibly represent the views of their members.  I was horrified at the view taken by Deputy Kelly of such organised lobbies and the campaigns they undertake, particularly in view of the fact that in the context of the EEC we must be an effective lobby or few people will give attention to us.  ACRA is not the only lobby here. We also have the IFA, ICMSA, NATO and a variety of medical, teachers and community organisations involved in this useful and rewarding method of representing the views of the people concerned.</P>
    <P>At their annual general meeting in 1973 ACRA passed a resolution calling for the abolition of ground rents.  That was an indication that people were convinced that it was time to do away with ground rents.  That was not the first occasion the question of ground <Col N="1427" /> rents was discussed by ACRA but it was the first time a resolution was passed at an annual general meeting.  On 7th May, 1973, ACRA set up a special ground rents sub-committee to investigate all aspects of ground rents and advise the general body on the best means of abolishing them.  The Chair may think that this is not relevant but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not entirely relevant because we are dealing with the creation of ground rents in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the question of ground rents was discussed in 1973 is an indication that there was a need then for the introduction of legislation to deal with this matter. On 12th June, 1973, 11 residents of an estate in Cabinteely faced ejectment proceedings for withholding ground rents.  I mention those matters to indicate that this was a serious problem as far back as 1973.  I understand that currently in the region of 3,000 families have been served with civil bills.  Rather than denigrating the efforts of those who work voluntarily to bring about the changes dealt with in the Bill we should be giving them every credit for the responsible way they have acted in the last few years.</P>
      <P>The Minister has included many detailed provisions in the Bill.  I was impressed by the detailed considerations brought out in his speech by the efforts he made to ensure that no legal device will be found readily to offset the clear intention of the Minister, of the House and of the people in bringing this Bill into being at present.  The Minister has succeeded in giving us what was requested and what is desired in relation to future ground rents, that is, ownership in fee simple.  It is the first step in his promised measures and I merely want to welcome it at this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I shall not delay the House very long.  We had a debate here last week on ground rents and their abolition.  It emerged clearly from that debate that in 1975 the present <Col N="1428" /> Minister put down a motion urging that future ground rents be prohibited, that the procedure for the buying out of existing ones be enlarged and that the whole question of their prohibition be considered.  The Minister's predecessor introduced a Bill known as the Landlord and Tenant Bill, 1977 in January, 1977.  That Bill received a Second Reading in February, 1977.  The House then, through the Opposition and Government parties, set about following up that Second Reading debate by putting down amendments to that Bill.  Somewhere between 100 and 120 amendments were put down between the end of February and 20th May, 1977 by the present Minister for Health and Social Welfare, Deputy Haughey.  That Bill was working its way through the House as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the debate we had on ground rents the Minister said at some length that his predecessor introduced the Bill in 1977, then placed it in cold storage, did nothing about it, killed it and implied that he never intended to proceed with it.  I admit the Minister did that partly in reply to interruptions and remarks from this side of the House.  However, I should like the Minister now, on reflection, to concede that what he said then was not correct, that the Bill of 1977 was being processed through the House as quickly as was reasonably possible between its Second Reading in February, 1977 and the dissolution of the Dáil in May, 1977.  I put it to the Minister that it was unfair and that he misled the House in saying that that Bill was delayed, that it was killed by his predecessor, put in cold storage and that he never intended to proceed with it.  The point I am making is that that Bill did all that this Bill now proposes doing.  It prevented the creation of future ground rents. It enlarged substantially the category of persons entitled to buy out existing ground rents.  In that respect it went further than does this Bill; it conferred further rights on existing ground rent tenants than does this one.  This Bill does not extend at all the category of people entitled to buy out their ground rents whereas section 66 of the Minister's predecessor's Bill did.  I should <Col N="1429" /> like the Minister to explain why he did not introduce that portion of the former Minister's Bill and confer on many people the right to buy out their ground rents, a right they have not now got, that they have been demanding for quite a while and that the Minister said they should get in his private motion debate in 1975.  The Minister proposed then to confer that additional right on those existing ground rent lessees which he is not now doing.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not abolish ground rents.  The Minister in his election manifesto said he would do that. There is no doubt that the Minister undertook in that manifesto to abolish them but even in plainer and more direct language in a newspaper advertisement before the election he said he would abolish existing ground rents.</P>
    <P>This Bill actually provides for the renewal of ground rents.  He admits that when he says that renewals of existing ground leases are excluded from the prohibition of section 2 (2). That means that ground rents will continue to be created because everybody knows that when the long lease of 99 years expires, as many of them are doing, there is provision for their renewal and for substantially increasing them.  I admit that the current market value is not charged.  I speak subject to correction, but it is something like one-fourth or one-sixth of the market value&mdash;I have not the papers with me.  That means that ground rents could be increased under the provisions of this Bill from a paltry £5 to perhaps £100 or £150 if the percentage of market value is to be taken into account.  I want to know why the Minister was unable to find some way of preventing people having to buy out ground rents of £100 or £150 instead of £5 or £20.  Not alone does the Minister do nothing in easement of people who will have their ground rents renewed and substantially increased but he writes into the Bill in black and white that he will not do anything about them, that these renewals and increases will take place.</P>
    <P>I wonder do the ground rent tenants who, through their organisations are so grateful to the Minister for introducing <Col N="1430" /> this Bill, realise that many, perhaps hundreds of their members, will, month in and month out, be confronted with the renewal of their existing ground rent leases and also substantial increases in their annual ground rents.</P>
    <P>It is the business of this side of the House to spell out the meaning of legislation going through the House. With regard to a person who is in occupation of a house that is subject to a lease containing a ground rent, when that lease expires&mdash;whether next week or next year&mdash;so far as this measure is concerned the lease will be reviewed and the rent will be increased. That is a shabby going back on an election promise.  It is the duty of this side of the House to study Bills and to tell the people what they are about.  It is particularly our duty to do that now in view of the solemn promise in written form given by the Minister and his party only six months ago that they would put an end to ground rents.</P>
    <P>Another category of people are not dealt with in this Bill.  More and more people are purchasing flats; this is becoming much more common in view of the cost of houses.  Many of the flats are comfortable, even luxurious, while others are good or just average.  The Minister is telling all and sundry that ground rent landlords can go merrily along; they can continue to impose ground rents on flats and he will not do anything about it.  That is what the Minister said in his opening speech today and the Bill specifically excludes flats.  Whether it is a block of 100 flats or simply two flats in a building, there is nothing to prevent the creation of new ground rents.</P>
    <P>I would ask those Members sitting behind the Minister what is the difference between a person who builds a house for which he can obtain a grant, one that comes within the 1,250 sq. ft. regulation, and who is asked to pay a ground rent and the person who gets accommodation in a block of flats and who is asked to pay a ground rent.  I cannot see any difference. Blocks of flats are being built throughout this city and in towns in rural Ireland; whether the blocks contain <Col N="1431" /> four flats or 104 flats does not matter. For the people concerned their flats are their homes.  It is not a question of a person taking a bedsitter in a converted house.  People are buying self-contained flats which contain a number of bedrooms, kitchen, lounge and bathroom.  I cannot see any difference between that and a house.</P>
    <P>The Minister is going to permit the creation of ground rents in respect of these buildings.  I cannot see any difference between a semi-detached house containing three bedrooms and a two-bedroomed flat, other than that one has three bedrooms and the other has two bedrooms.  Nevertheless the Minister has seen fit to find a difference and he has permitted the creation of new ground rents for flats. If one were looking for an argument one might come down in favour of flats because the semi-detached house has some ground but the owner of a flat is using very little ground.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to deal with the points I have raised.  First, he should concede he was unfair when he accused Senator Cooney the other day of being dishonest&mdash;that was what it boiled down to&mdash;in introducing the 1977 Bill.  All the facts show that Senator Cooney was processing the Bill as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to deal with the question of renewal of ground rents.  With all the advisers and machinery he has at his disposal he should prevent bad from getting worse.  In the future people will be dealing with the situation of buying out ground rents not only of £20 but of £50 or even £100.  I want the Minister to explain why flats will continue to be subject to ground rents and why new ground rents may be imposed on flats.</P>
    <P>I am curious to know why the Minister did not introduce <i>in toto</i> Senator Cooney's Bill in 1977.  The Minister agreed with it in principle because he put down amendments to it.  Why did he not introduce the portions of the Bill with which he agreed? In reply to a question I put to the Taoiseach today he intimated he proposes <Col N="1432" /> to reintroduce the Road Traffic Bill, 1976.  As Deputy Kelly has pointed out, it is true that to date this Dáil is living on the work of the National Coalition Ministers and it looks as if that will continue for some time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill and to congratulate the Minister in putting it before the House so speedily.  It is important that we do not cloud the issues in this debate.  This is very straightforward legislation and, of necessity, it cannot be all-embracing.  It is not intended to cover existing ground rents.  One could debate at great length about the validity of legislation that would embrace existing ground rents and also new ground rents but this legislation directs its attention to the prevention of any new ground rents and in essence is welcomed by everybody.  I see this as a measure that puts the brakes on. It is a forward progressive step which prevents new ground rents.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to what I think is a very pertinent question, that is, the purchase of new flats.  He wanted to know how the Minister would tackle this problem.  The Minister will give it very sympathetic consideration. This is a new departure and in his reply I am sure he will explain his reasons for not including flats.</P>
      <P>Existing ground rents were referred to by many Deputies and, with the patience of the Ceann Comhairle, I feel it will clear the air if I refer briefly to them once more.  With existing ground rents the great problems have been the covenants which people have found impossible to wrangle out of. Everyone realises that the immense complexity of leases which vary from 20 to 900 years cannot be dealt with in one fell swoop.  The Minister is forward-thinking in that he is tackling one aspect of this complex problem, and is fulfilling a very serious commitment given to the electorate earlier this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fairness to others who may wish to speak I will conclude my comments. I congratulate the Minister and welcome this legislation which will be <Col N="1433" /> welcomed across the land and will be seen for what it is: a solution to one aspect of the problem.  I urge the Minister to address his attention to tackling the other more complex part that is of existing ground rents.  However, this has to be kept in perspective. It is a separate issue and does not come within the framework of this legislation.</P>

He raised the question of lobbying or pressure being exerted by lobbyists on parliamentarians.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kelly should know that his party leader and fellow spokesman on agriculture only this week met members of a particular lobby group and had discussions with them.  The Deputy should also know that his leader is on public record as saying that they might not be in Opposition if they had kept in touch with the people and their representatives throughout the country while they were in Government.  I do not want to say anything further on that point because I am not interested in making any political points.  Perhaps better communication between the Deputy and the Leader of his party might be helpful when the Deputy is contributing in this House.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe and other Members of his party were most anxious that this Bill should be labelled a Coalition Bill.  At no stage during my introductory remarks did I claim it was my Bill or their Bill.  If it helps any Members of the Fine Gael Party to think that this is their Bill, then they are at liberty to do so.  It is a question of political lollipops.  I do not mind who gets the first or second suck as long as we get this legislation passed.  That is all I am interested in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad of the welcome given to this legislation, especially by Deputy Eileen Desmond.  She was prepared to <Col N="1434" /> recognise this for what it is and what it meant, not for what is not in it nor what might be in a Bill relating to existing ground rents and the problems arising therefrom that will appear at a later stage.  As I said last week during a Private Members' Motion, this Bill will be introduced later.  If the Opposition, and Fine Gael in particular, want to create an atmosphere or say that the Bill will not appear, they are free to do so; but they could be making trouble for themselves at some future date.  If they want to knock the Bill even before it appears, good luck to them but I say they should wait and debate it when the time comes.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe was extremely annoyed&mdash;I think that was the phrase he used&mdash;that I did not trace the source of the Bill.  I kept my introductory remarks reasonably short because we had a three-hour debate on ground rents last week.  He also expressed disappointment at the omission of any mention of existing ground rents.  I recognise the fact that he eventually welcomed the Bill and I am thankful for that.</P>
    <P>There are some differences in this Bill from that introduced by Senator Cooney in February, 1977.  I have already spelt out the four main differences.  Two points were raised by one of the shrewdest politicians in this House, Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick (<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>).  Those points are the same in this Bill as they were in the Bill introduced by Senator Cooney.</P>

      <P>However, on the question of the manifesto, Deputy Kelly was talking about the business of the House and saying that he wanted it on the record that this was a Coalition Bill.  He wants an admission, as it were, that what we are now doing was already half done by the Coalition when they were in Government. The actions of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties while in Government were reasonably well described last Wednesday night here in this House by Deputy P.

      <P>I cannot hear what the Deputy is saying.  He is out of order anyway, so I had better not rise to that. The phrase used by Deputy Kelly was &ldquo;All support on the occasion is on this side of the House&rdquo;.  I do not know if the man is as serious as he should be. I have nothing but regard for Deputy Kelly, Professor, and it is a pity he went off, as he did, at a tangent and talked about everything except what was in the Bill.  If he wished to believe that the Coalition still rule this House and went on to say &ldquo;Long may it last&rdquo;, so long as he is doing it from that side of the House I will not be the least bit worried about upsetting him.</P>
      <P>On the question of the blocks of flats which Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned, the Bill does not extend to multiple dwellings.  The definition of &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; in the Bill makes that clear.  I am well aware that self-contained flats are sold under arrangements that would involve payment of rent.  However, transactions involving the sale of such flats are in a different category where different considerations apply and are accordingly outside the scope of the Bill which I am bringing in for the benefit of owner-occupiers of dwellings. I fully accept that this was what was in the mind of my predecessor, Senator Cooney, when he was bringing in the Landlord and Tenant Bill, 1977. I understand that there would be a number of difficulties with regard to flats because different considerations apply.  Generally rents in such cases cover services and maintenance of common areas and things like that and these are not generally regarded as ground rents.  However, I will not close the door on it.  I will give the matter further consideration and we can talk about it on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to have a look at the suggestions there and, if there is something in them, when we come to Committee Stage I am prepared to discuss the matter further.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick went to some pains tonight and last week when he spoke on the Private Members' Motion about the length of time the previous Government had this Bill before them.  Deputy Fitzpatrick is inclined to get a little bit hot under the collar with regard to what I said. I cannot find it now because I have not the Official Report, but I believe that the Bill was introduced in early February, we had a Second Reading on the Bill and it went through reasonably quickly.  I admit there were well over 100 amendments.  I accept that a number of them were from my party and quite a large number from the Deputy's.  I think that at least 70 of the 100 plus amendments were drafting amendments.  I say that they were official amendments tabled by the Minister of the day.  I certainly did say that.</P>
      <P>It is difficult for me to know the inner workings of the Chief Whip's Office of the Coalition Government at the end of their four-year period in Government.  It is difficult for a person like me to know the pressures that would be on them with regard to the workload and to what is and what is not to come before the House.  Deputy Fitzpatrick said a lot during the course of his contribution about the question that came up which he wanted to be advised on by the Government of the day.  Perhaps they were very much delayed.  The Bill did not come to the question before Committee Stage, and that is what my assessment of the situation was on 5th July.  I do not want to waste the five minutes that I have to find out the exact words I used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned last week I had travelled some distance in trying to put forward suggestions and ideas which arise in looking at the Bill before the House. I do not intend to go over that ground again but I should like to mention very briefly the principal areas leading up to the continuation of my basic argument.</P>
      <P>I do not believe anybody disagrees with the need for the Bill.  It was in relation to the increased exigencies of the future which will face the IDA that we were concerned, the social implications of the unemployment problem and the degree to which the IDA, even with the new powers, will be in a position to cope with those. I pointed out, in passing, the implications which I do not think should go unmentioned, of our traditional policy in relation to employment creation which, in a nutshell, has been to encourage and to invite industrial investment from the private sector and hope that the operation of free market forces will result in the creation of the necessary number of jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1440" /> There has always been a low profile in relation to State involvement, in relation to the degree to which the Government will take an initiating role in regard to creating their own type of employment.  We are, perhaps, seeing the beginning of a change in that because the Government have clearly committed themselves to getting directly involved in creating jobs.  I have no doubt that they will tackle that in due course.</P>
    <P>I also mentioned the traditional role of the IDA.  Some speakers were rather critical in that area.  I tried to point out that although the effectiveness of the IDA had resulted in merely retaining an existing reservoir of numbers of jobs there had not been in real terms a quantitative increase in the number of jobs created during the seventies.  Nevertheless, without the efforts and the dedication of the IDA the position would have been catastrophic. In this context and in the context of a discussion on jobs generally regard should be had not merely for numbers of jobs, with which politicians understandably tend to get bogged down, but also with the type of jobs. It is a matter of increasing concern to some of us, particularly those representing fairly dense urban areas, that although the existing reservoir of jobs has been maintained by the IDA the nature of the jobs they are creating to replace the jobs that have gone out of existence is significantly different from the needs of the unemployed. There is an increasing need for useful, socially and personally fulfilling employment for people who are semi-skilled or unskilled.</P>
    <P>Many of the new jobs being created are of a clerical, an administrative and a management nature and are what might loosely be called largely white-collar jobs.  The problems facing people who will not fit into that new job creation dimension are very real and I do not think they are getting the attention they should be getting.  I also mentioned the other day that the predictions and the projections of the IDA have rarely been met because, particularly over the last four years, they had to compete in a very tough international market and in the face of an <Col N="1441" /> economic recession which made their job very difficult.  The type of achievement they have had by any standards, has been reasonable.</P>
    <P>I suggest that perhaps it is time, while hoping that the new powers being entrusted to the IDA will help them to cope better with the position that exists now, for us to show a wider sense of vision in relation to the creation of employment.  I mentioned last week in relation to areas in which the IDA are expanding and hoping to introduce new types of industry, certain developments in the heavy industries and the small industries.  This is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The IDA have had an excellent record in regard to ecology.  Although they have had to fight very hard for jobs it appears that they have always been able to sustain a high concern for the quality of the physical and social environment.  They have not thrown caution to the winds in the pursuit of jobs.  It is to be hoped that the local authorities who have the statutory responsibility for such protection, will, to say the least of it, keep pace with the record of the IDA in this area.  There is some evidence, however, to indicate that there is some disquiet about the way some local authorities do not measure up to the requirements.</P>
    <P>I tried to delineate the dimension of the problem, the need in generally accepted statistical terms to create approximately 30,000 new jobs every year.  I also mentioned that the traditional safety valve of emigration is no longer there.  In fact, we have a small trickle of immigration which underlines the fact again that the old solutions will no longer work.  At the heart of this matter, for me at least, is the increasing threat of millions of young people who are without jobs or without the prospect of jobs.  There are nearly six million under the age of 25 unemployed in the seven largest OECD countries.  There are almost four million young people who have left schools and universities in the countries of the EEC who are still unplaced. The Community calculate that in 1982 there will be some 3.3 million 16-year olds while the number <Col N="1442" /> of people reaching 65 years will only reach two million, which leaves a net surplus on the job market of around 2.3 million.</P>
    <P>In some countries youth unemployment has doubled, in others it has trebled while in others it has quadrupled. There is a particular cause of concern about young girls under 20 years of age.  This difficulty is an international one and I do not expect that any set of politicians in this Chamber will have instant answers to it.  I would like to think that all sides of the House would combine to try to ensure that practical measures are proposed and genuinely fight to create useful and socially fulfilling roles for our young people and our not so young people.  That is about where we were when the debate was adjourned.</P>
    <P>I want to point to the background to unemployment.  Sometimes when we talk across the floor of the House we talk about figures, reports from consultative committees, and percentage increases.  The job facing the IDA of unemployment and job creation is essentially a human one.  Any organisation such as the IDA who set out to do the job will have to do so, not as an isolated unit of policy, but in the context of a whole social philosophy with implications for all sections of society.  Normally the debate tends to be about numbers of jobs but there are other issues which are of legitimate concern and deserve our legitimate interests.  They are related not only to the numbers of jobs but to the quality of jobs.</P>
    <P>Recorded figures do not reveal the whole problem.  Many young people are looking for jobs which are more stable and more satisfactory.  Many young people who are relatively better qualified and skilled, in the traditional and accepted sense of those words, are looking for outlets for advancement. They are no longer willing to accept standards which were acceptable to some degree in the past, perhaps. Undoubtedly, this will create social tensions and social problems unless it is tackled.  It will not be tackled merely by a topographical survey of numbers of jobs.  There is a question here of personal self-fulfilment in the nature <Col N="1443" /> of the opportunities presented to people.</P>
    <P>In some countries there is evidence that some young people do not even apply for employment because they are without hope that suitable employment will be forthcoming.  There is the paradox that a higher level of unemployment amongst young people in one country than in another may, to some extent, reflect the fact that the labour market co-operates better there, or that there are more opportunities for young people.  In 1975 10 per cent of the young people were unemployed in the United States, 55 per cent were working and 50 per cent were in fulltime education.  These types of percentages are reflected in other countries such as Italy and some other European countries.</P>
    <P>There is the very serious demographic problem that young people aged 15 to 24 years comprise an enormous and growing number of people for whom the future does not look too bright.  There are many causes for that.  We should face up to those causes.  First, there is the deficit of new jobs, partly due to the fact that our economy and the larger economic environment in which our economy finds itself have policies based on the objective of a moderate but sustained recovery.  This implies a relatively slow recovery of employment over a number of years rather than major actions by Governments or groups of Governments acting in a very determined and dynamic way.</P>
    <P>The trend towards more capital intensive production places a premium on high levels of skills and experience. In other words, the day is coming when people will have to have some technical expertise if they are to have any hope of becoming employed quickly and at a sufficiently high level. Ironically, the increasing emphasis on technology will mean that fewer people will be employed in areas where they used be employed.</P>
    <P>For example, approximately one dozen dockers are moving 20,000 tons of goods every week in one area of the port of Dublin, due to containerisation. This is the type of thing which will <Col N="1444" /> increase.  There is also growing competition for jobs, complicated undoubtedly by major and unusual changes in the age composition of the labour force.  The educational and preparatory years before one begins to work should also come in for scrutiny.  Traditionally, the educational system was structured in such a way that it did not necessarily have any relevance or reference to working life, which is an astonishing statement if you think about it.</P>
    <P>Obviously, rethinking is going on now in that regard.  I certainly would oppose a total swing of the pendulum in the opposite direction where in effect, we would be educating only for technology and producing only technocrats. Education is a good and useful thing in itself, but there is greater room for bringing into education a dimension and an increasing awareness of the world which young people have to face.  Much of the curricula in our schools, particularly in our secondary schools, has not had the requisite reference to that, although there is some evidence of change there but perhaps not as much as there should be.</P>
    <P>The reason for this is that it reflects class values, and so on, and not that anybody was holding it back deliberately. Traditionally, there was a rather unusual social chasm between parts of the educational sector and some people felt certain types of jobs were beneath them, that one should get a nice clean job as opposed to a job which would involve manual work or physical labour.  Those attributes are dying, and not before time.</P>
    <P>There is also the increasing difficulty that, in the context of large and growing numbers of unemployed, firms may be more selective.  In many cases they prefer older workers because of their accumulated skills, experience and work discipline.  Quite conceivably, an employer may be able to pick up from the unfortunate pool of the unemployed, people with skills and experience. This would have been unheard of years ago.  This makes it still more difficult for young people to get involved.</P>
    <P>Conversely, many young people are hard to employ or train because they <Col N="1445" /> lack the basic skills of literacy, arithmetic and the ability to communicate. Perhaps it is only laterally, with the training facilities and the training authorities which were encouraged and set up, that these difficulties have been recognised.  The basic point is, if you have a choice between a young person who is untried and untested and a person who is unemployed but has a good record in work, obviously it is difficult to opt for the younger person.  That is a genuine problem besetting young people.</P>
    <P>Many young people who are replying to advertisements are asked what experience they have.  I am sure there are few Deputies who have not members of their families, or brothers, or sisters, or relatives, or constituents, in that position.  They have to reply that they have no experience because no one has given them a start.  That is another reason why young people find themselves in this very difficult position.</P>
    <P>The consequences of all this are very serious.  There will not be an increasing pool of unemployed people who will remain unco-ordinated and inarticulate and who will simply go away if we do not think about them. The contrary is probably true.  Every new generation entering the labour force provides the skill and the educational basis on which the future depends. Therefore, to an extent, we are undermining the future.  That is a point which could be developed at some length.  I do not intend to do so except to say the way we manage the existing resources of people will have major implications for the future.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the social integration of young people, their attitude to society, their belief in the democratic system, their hope in the future, their aspirations, their confidence that the democratic system can give them their right to work, will be at risk of being undermined unless major steps are taken.</P>
    <P>In urban areas there is what I would call a certain amount of harmful feedback to younger children in homes where there are unemployed people. We should not neglect to consider these matters.  An organisation such as the <Col N="1446" /> IDA primarily involved in creating jobs must have reference to the social implications of what they are doing.</P>
    <P>Homes that have within them people who are not in jobs undoubtedly will suffer tensions.  Youths and children seeing the increasing problems presented by the spectre of a parent out of work, or a brother or sister alienated from society due to that, will undoubtedly have a different attitude from the traditional one.  It worries me that there might be what I call a ratchet effect&mdash;in other words, the more this disease spreads the more corrosive its effects on the family and the more discontented, unsettled and disgruntled society as a whole becomes as a result.</P>
    <P>The question is will this new proposal answer many of these problems. As the cliché has it, it is obviously a step in the right direction, or perhaps a number of steps, but I do not believe it will answer the problems and I do not think it is intended to answer them.  Perhaps the proposed consortium is expected to answer the problems but from the little information one has in the context of the Official Report I do not believe it will have that result.  One wishes it the best but, frankly speaking, it seems little more at this stage&mdash;it may take structure and form later on&mdash;than a meeting of representatives of organisations, all of whom are already in difficulties in relation to the role they play in terms of creating jobs.  If this is the primary initiative and the major frontal onslaught of the Government I do not think it augurs that well.  However, it is early days yet and I would not really judge it because obviously we will have an opportunity again of looking at it but I would like to put forward one or two ideas.</P>
    <P>Much more basic re-thinking is essential if we are to cope genuinely with the widest possible range of implications of the unemployment problem, as it is called.  Before I deal with this I want to make one point about the IDA's projections and the degree to which they have failed in certain areas.  It should be underlined that the degree to which the heart of <Col N="1447" /> the eastern region has traditionally been starved of funds, of a land bank and so on, is unfortunately producing the most detrimental results.  I do not know who was responsible and I do not care but, looking back, it was a shameful attitude to take when you had the population of Dublin increasing, not alone in terms of its own natural birth rate but also by migration from other countries and you had in effect a planned policy of encouraging industrial growth and job creation only in areas outside Dublin.  I know the IDA are staging a sort of late recovery in that regard and doing their best but the fact remains that, unlike other parts of the country, there is no land bank here despite the fact that the total number of acres purchased by the IDA, according to their 75th report, numbers 4,175 at a cost of £8.75 million.  Apparently, not one acre is in the inner Dublin area and only a few in the greater Dublin area as a whole, and these very much by way of an attempt at latter day recovery.</P>
    <P>Unemployment in Dublin since 1974 has risen by 60 per cent and there are just under 40,000 people on the dole. Much of that must stem from the policy of saying to the Dublin area: &ldquo;You are healthy.  You will look after yourself.  We must try to build and create industry and employment in other areas.&rdquo;  I wish these areas the best but, looking back, it is almost incomprehensible how that policy was allowed to develop and carried on remembering that we have practically half the population of the entire country living in the city and its environs and increasing all the time. The Minister might consider some way of encouraging the other counties which distil population into Dublin to contribute in a positive way, not necessarily financially, to the recovery Dublin needs to make.  It is fair that people should be entitled to move wherever they wish but, if substantial numbers come into Dublin, then a little of the back-up, expertise and the finance should also come with them.</P>
    <P>The Government should consider deflecting <Col N="1448" /> funds to meet the need which exists in Dublin.  The number of jobs created would appear to imply that all is not that bad because we have retained a reservoir of jobs but that is not as comforting as it should be because of the plight of the semi-skilled and unskilled worker.  The IDA type job is not the job usually which suits these people and we are, therefore, having job creation at the expense to some degree of people who are semi-skilled or unskilled.  Strides have been made in regard to training and undoubtedly that should help but the nub of the problem is those people who are not qualified to cope with employment competition particularly when you have, as I said earlier on, people in the employment market at the moment who are highly qualified.</P>
    <P>The question is what to do and how to tackle this problem.  We should have a totally new vision of the whole nature of employment.  The traditional policy of the State and, indeed, of west European states generally is that you allow free market forces to operate, you encourage them, you invite them and you incite them to invest and that will probably work out all right on the day, but it has not worked out all right and it will not work out all right.  We have an enormous and growing unemployment problem in the west European economy.  With the increasing improvement in technology, with the dramatic implications of computer technology and the increasing involvement in industry and commerce of what might be described generally as the fruits of scientific progress, the trend will be for fewer people, relatively speaking, to be employed rather than more.</P>
    <P>Politicians should ask themselves honestly is full employment, as we talk about it, a myth?  It has never existed.  It usually crops up like a clarion call in the election manifestoes of political parties.  This is a disservice to the unemployed and to the young who hope for employment in the future.  If politicians look into their hearts they will, I think, accept that it is perhaps time to consider the alternative to the full employment situation.  There is a possibility that <Col N="1449" /> the jobs simply are not there and never will be there and that a whole new definition of employment is necessary if we want to stave off the traumatic social effects of increasing degradation and stigma which attaches to people who are unemployed. Secondly, if we want to tap this totally unused resource of people who are unemployed and who can give that most valuable social contribution, which is themselves as people, then it is time that the State and the IDA thought about the implications of this.  One of the stumbling blocks is that we think in terms of output, productivity and commercial profit and all that is linked inevitably with jobs.</P>
    <P>Now many of the top global companies have admitted and demonstrated that providing for the whole human family no longer provides a major technical problem.  That can be done and it can be done fairly easily and in an orderly and acceptable fashion but this possibility poses an overwhelming question which is at the root of the whole unemployment problem. To take a figure, when 50,000,000 people are more than adequate to provide for all what will you then do with the other 2,950,000,000?  Can you continue to offer them full employment when employment is daily diminishing? Can you still offer them the old deceitful, dishonest political ploys?  It simply will not work.  I know I leave myself open to the accusation of not being wholehearted and enthusiastic about creating new jobs.  I deny that emphatically.  There will always be a need to create new jobs and I want every resource of the State directed to doing just that but that does not mean we, and particularly honest politicians, should exclude the possibility that the numbers of jobs will never again be created because science, population explosion, demographic trends and technology indicate that it is just not on.  I am asking for an honest acceptance that this could be considered as a possibility.</P>
    <P>What are the prospects, then? First, we should make a clear distinction between work and toil.  Ideally, work is something a worker wants to do, is useful and fulfilling to himself <Col N="1450" /> and makes a social contribution as well as satisfying the need of the organisation with which he is associated.  Toil is work which diminishes the human being as such.  It is toil which is essentially exploiting because it treats man as a unit, a number, tosses him on the scrap heap when it has squeezed dry the best years of his life and has no further use for him.  It is degrading.  I do not particularly relish the fact of massive Government-subsidised attempts to create toil, as opposed to useful work.</P>
    <P>One of the most exciting prospects facing us is the great benefit science and technology are bringing us as release from that toil and the usefulness and the great social contribution which people can make to society, given the opportunity to express themselves in this way rather than being squeezed dry by jobs that are essentially toilsome.  The IDA may have to think along these lines in the future.  A quotation from a previous General Secretary of the United Nations, U Thant, might be in order since it hints at this when he said that the central stupendous truth about the developed economies today is that they can have, in anything but the shortest run, the kind and scale of resources they may decide to have. It is no longer resources that limit decisions; it is the decision that makes the resources.  This is a fundamental revolutionary change, perhaps the most revolutionary man has ever known&mdash;the point being that we are into a new situation, not a job problem but a new human problem and that is how we must face it.</P>
    <P>In our last debate I was struck by the announcement of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy in regard to new projects which were being created and which, hopefully, would mean about 1,500 new jobs in the Dublin area.  I trust the number is right; we welcome the news.  One of the proposed projects involves a computer systems company and the irony is that in creating new jobs here we are sign-posting the way to the eventual elimination of other jobs because the whole science of computers and micro-technology has major implications for employment which have not yet been <Col N="1451" /> fully accepted or considered, probably by many people in this House and in industry also.  We shall find a large amount of work in storing, recording, passing information and so on being done by machines which is now being done by people.</P>
    <P>What is the new definition of employment about and what must the IDA do if the IDA are the proper organisation, if a whole new structure is not necessary?  First, there must be the realisation that the great global social challenges of today's world, the inhabitants of two-thirds of which are still hungry, would provide enough employment for everybody.  One of the greatest needs of our cities is the need for companionship, people.  The needs exist but many of them do not have a profit and loss account and you cannot say at any stage: &ldquo;We made so much last year.&rdquo;  These are the areas that will be left to the State because, understandably, the private sector will look after the profitable end of things&mdash; I am not bemoaning that.  The areas of employment in the literal sense of the word&mdash;and I use it deliberately; people should think more about it when they use that word&mdash;are areas which have not had a high commercial profile.  The fulcrum on which employment in future will chiefly turn must be people rather than profit, what I would call socially-conscious, socially-oriented endeavour rather than wealth-accumulating jobs, as they are termed.</P>
    <P>Wealth is also an interesting word in regard to the creation of jobs because we have seen that many countries appear to become wealthier.  What does it mean?  Why does not increased production lead to increased wealth among the ordinary people?  Growth rates around the world&mdash;they are wobbling a little at present&mdash;are between 5 and 10 per cent.  In western countries the ordinary man in the street should be between one-tenth and one-twentieth wealthier each year. These countries should be at least twice as rich in 20 years.  Their output has doubled in less than that, in about 15 years, and doubling times are becoming shorter.  Therefore, you and I should be twice as rich every 15 years. Colleges and other institutions should <Col N="1452" /> be&mdash;not getting twice as much money&mdash; but twice as wealthy in real terms.  Are they?</P>
    <P>France is a very interesting example because she was slow in coming into industrial production.  Between 1910 and 1939 her industrial production rose by only 5 per cent.  But between 1948 and 1965 it rose by 220 per cent. In 17 years Frenchmen should have been visibly 220 per cent richer.  Were they?  To equate money with wealth is far too simplistic.  This points again to the nature of the enterprise which traditionally has been allowed to make up the totality of our job effort and it is no longer good enough.  We need a new effort.  It is difficult to introduce innovations in these areas.  I recall a quotation from Charles Dickens when he spoke about a savage mode of keeping accounts on notched sticks being introduced into the Court of the Exchequer.  In the reign of George III, an inquiry was made by some revolutionary spirit as to whether pens, ink and paper and so on being in existence at the time, this obstinate adherence to an obsolete custom might continue. All the red tape in the country grew redder at the bare mention of this bold and original conception and it took until 1826 to get those notched sticks abolished and replaced by pens and pencils.  Old ideas die hard and old traditions even harder.</P>
    <P>We are faced with an increasing number of people out of work despite everybody's best efforts.  When we talk about creating jobs&mdash;I mean work that is useful, not toil; work which is ennobling, enriching and fulfilling; is there anybody who denies that work should have these attributes?&mdash;we are talking about an enormous problem needing a whole new vision.  Other speakers quite rightly emphasised the creation of new jobs without, however, much regard to whether they should be toil or work, and so I think it fair that this emphasis should be put principally by me as opposed to dwelling at length on the need to create new jobs regardless of their nature.  These new opportunities will be vastly publicly subsidised and probably increasingly so, as we see from this Bill under which the IDA will find itself very committed and involved <Col N="1453" /> in companies.  That I welcome as an opportunity of ensuring public accountability.</P>
    <P>What does the unemployment problem really mean?  There is the fear arising from unemployment resulting from automation.  It may be exaggerated but it rests on a hitherto accepted natural law that if one does not work one does not eat.  That is the reason for the trauma which people out of work for long periods suffer.  Society makes them feel that they are less than their peers and there is more than a hint of a social stigma on a man or woman who has been out of work for a long time.  Why should a man suffer the stigma of unemployment if he has made every conceivable effort to employ himself usefully and if the traditional attitude of the State is not to get directly involved in the jobs situation, but to leave it to private enterprise to look after, and if that does not work, the State is just sorry about it?  That is not acceptable, and as a notion it is obsolete in the face of what I have been trying to portray as a totally new situation existing at the moment.</P>
    <P>If what I am saying is considered, it will be seen that perhaps there is a degree to which this obsession with ensuring that everybody is doing some sort of work every day is a symptom of what I would call social therapeutics&mdash;employing people merely to fill their days with drudgery.  That is not an objective in which the State should be interested.  The State should be interested in creating necessary employment. It should encourage people to get involved in jobs which arise due to the operation of free market forces but it should not compel people to feel that unless they are involved they are not equal to their fellowmen.  A number of unnecessary jobs have been created in the past, merely because we accept traditionally that people must be employed, without reference to the nature of the work or the benefit of it on those employed or on society.  Business consultants showed long ago that collecting dog licences costs a lot more than they bring in in revenue.  Since the abolition of the vast part of the car tax, I have no doubt that the cost of the car registration system is greater <Col N="1454" /> than the finances accruing from it. To be doing useless work diminishes one's human dignity.  This attitude to employment must be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>There will always be a need for job creation, but full employment is little more than a myth.  It has never existed and it will never exist.  It would be tragic if these implications were not honestly faced by the Government. Vast millions of people will be, in the traditional sense, unemployed. That does not mean that they will be unemployable if government are willing to get involved in the creation of structures where people will be involved in work which is useful and socially productive, not necessarily productive in money terms.  These structures must be created if we are to head off the inevitable demographically horrific implications which exist due to the enormous numbers of people unemployed in the world.  Some people might say that this is a lot of idealistic, utopian stuff, but as far as I am concerned it is the height of common sense.  Rather than carrying on lowering the price to foreign investment, let us accept that we cannot expect foreign investment and the investment of the domestic entrepreneur to make up for slack which is being created by advances in technology and science and by population development.</P>
    <P>If this vast pool of people is allowed to languish unemployed, the result will be increasing disgruntlement, increasing seediness in their lives, increasing tension in their homes, increasing lack of pride and confidence of children in their parents, increasing social tensions and eventually trouble, violence and revolution.  That is the prescription facing us.  Things are not bad at the moment in the sense that trouble has not spilled over as yet on to the streets.  The reason is that people are being bought off.  It is almost as costly now to have people out of work as to have them in work.  We recognise that a man who has tried to get a job and has failed should not suffer at least from the point of view of the deprivation of his basic needs and the needs of his family.  The first rung of the ladder about which I am talking is implicit in that recognition. <Col N="1455" /> No longer will it be economically as acceptable to allow people to be involved in work structured by the Government which does not have a profit and loss account but which is socially useful, and may not be productive in the usual sense of that word.</P>
    <P>The traditional response to that sort of work is that we cannot provide it because it would cost too much money.  It is costing money right now to have people unemployed and it will cost more because politicians being the people they are will want to buy off any signs of trouble and the unemployed will become an increasing pressure group.  The unemployed will become more conscious that by using pressure they will get action.  We can expect developments in that area.</P>
    <P>It is sad to see this vast potential of human resource going to waste.  As a representative for part of the inner city I am struck by one of the crying needs there, the need for people to socialise with others, the need for community work and social work, the involvement of people preserving, protecting and improving the lot of their community.  I consider that useful work; it is more useful than producing a new washing machine.  This type of work is worthy of the State's involvement and attention as a possible way of helping to heal the great problem of unemployment.  It is a legitimate area of concern and the State should at least think about it.  Maybe we need a much enlarged IDA type body to deal with the creation of coherent structures to humanise the lot of those who are no longer toiling through no fault of their own.  In overall terms I do not believe the cost would be much greater.  In the long term, the cost would be minimal compared with the cost of allowing the present situation to fester, and that is what is happening. Man is a social person whose social activities are not motivated by money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps my enthusiasm as a new Deputy has carried me beyond the bounds of relevancy, but the whole question of employment concerns me.  I want thought to be brought to bear on the role of the IDA, on the need to increase that role and to face up to the situation that confronts us, not to hide behind ploys of creating full employment and synchronising such ploys with five-year election cycles.  That is a disservice to the people.  Perhaps my thought has been slightly deflected by the exchange, and that is not anybody's fault but mine.  I do not think there is an honest facing up to the spectre of unemployment. <Col N="1457" /> This Bill will help the IDA substantially to carry out the role they have had and to extend it.  The Minister and his colleagues have a wonderful opportunity in the four or five year term they still have to begin to think about the challenge, the major part of which is the question of jobs.</P>
      <P>While encouraging the creation of jobs in the traditional sense of the word, in conjunction with the powers of the IDA and, hopefully, the increased success the IDA will have in creating more jobs, there is need to have a parallel concern and vision.  We have not faced up to the challenge of the unemployed, of what they do with their time.  This is not far removed from the question of leisure, or idleness in the literal sense of the word. These are areas with which a Government should be concerned genuinely because of their social implications. Therefore, we should welcome the opportunity to reflect on the individual's commitment to society, individual self expression and so on, rather than to deplore unemployment as being a stigma, provided, of course, that people have made a genuine effort but that the market place has not afforded them an opportunity.</P>
      <P>Earlier I mentioned a social concern with utilising people.  There is a whole area of co-operative effort which has not been tried.  There are vast areas of development potential in the barren wastes of the country in terms of the many jobs that need to be done in both urban and rural areas which have not found a high place in the priority list because they have not had traditional profits attached to them.  It is therefore legitimate for a public representative to ask the Government and the IDA whether a new dimension is needed now in relation to efforts in this respect.  We are talking about dearth in the midst of plenty&mdash;people feeding butter to cows to keep profits up, and so on.  I am talking about such things as the production of a surplus in order to prop up certain substantial international conglomerates who do not have the concern which the Government and those on this side of the House have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major problem for the Government <Col N="1458" /> is whether the IDA, Córas Tráchtála and others can tackle the challenge, and whether the structures are available to them, and whether the Government's thinking in these matters is sufficient.  I have my doubts.  Even within the existing set-up things can be improved.  There has been an increasing dialogue about the need for work sharing, the need to take existing resources and divide them a little better, the need for a greater degree of meshing between the educational and employment scenes&mdash;I would hope that would not be taken too far&mdash;and so on. There is a great challenge there.</P>
    <P>I should like to direct my remarks for a few moments to the Minister's opening statement.  He spoke of the increased role of the IDA in relation to the Third World and he said the Bill proposes to empower the IDA to provide technical assistance to developing countries.  I do not regard that point in the Minister's statement as being particularly important in comparison with others, but I was not convinced by the Minister's presentation of it that there was serious intent behind it.  One got the impression that it was little more than a gesture. The impression was distinctly given that this would be relatively low in the priorities and that it would not get great attention.  I hope that will not be the case.  I am sure the Minister will agree there is a need for those with plenty to consider those who have not got plenty.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's reference to the increased emphasis on the cluster concept of industry which was introduced on a pilot basis some years ago. That is bound to improve the possibility of creating jobs.  All the provisions in the Bill are good ones and we hope they will have the expected effects.  On the proposed setting up of a consortium, leaving aside Deputy Kelly's concern about the propriety of introducing it at this stage.  I accepted the democratically expressed wish of the people last June when they rejected the Coalition Government and elected a new Government.  I would not seek for cheap political gain to exploit the difficulties facing them in the jobs area, but the perameters of the consortium <Col N="1459" /> do not impress me.  It seems to be little more initially than the assembly of representatives of a long litany of organisations and interests and appears to be open-ended.  I am not unduly impressed by the presence at those meetings of a Minister or Ministers.  The essential thinking behind the proposal is that we are to have a group of people who will get together and talk about the problem. If I am wrong about that I should like to be corrected.  Nowhere is it hinted that they will be there to carry out the decisions of the Government, decisions which they had a great deal of time to think about before they were committed to paper prior to last June. I see here a recipe for long-fingering the problem.  Obviously we will have to wait and see.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister if he is serious about this, and I am sure he is, whether this is not a little too close to a smoke screen.  He says he wishes to stress the flexibility of their approach to both the membership and the operating methods of the new body.  I would read this as meaning that they have an open mind about who is going to be in it, how openminded the membership is and even what it is going to do.  I know that months and years will slip by and in the meantime the problem exists and will continue to grow.  I look forward to progress in this area.  Despite the liberties I took in deviating slightly from the ideas of some people regarding this Bill, I would ask the Minister to accept my genuine concern for a broader vision that has been traditional and the need to consider the whole role of the IDA apart from these sections if we are really to tackle this major problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this belated opportunity&mdash;it is the first one I have had&mdash;to congratulate the Minister and wish him well in his job.  I shall be very interested in how he succeeds because the area of Dublin which I represent is possibly hit by unemployment to a greater extent than any other area in the country.  It would sadden me if politicians on any side of the House were willing to use people who might be inarticulate and without an <Col N="1460" /> organised voice for the purposes of political weaponry.  There is a suspicion in my mind that this is what happened in June; I hope I am wrong. I would ask the Minister to accept what I say and to give it a little thought.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome this Bill.  I see it as an incentive-charged Bill and a vote of confidence in the IDA.  At present a climate prevails which engenders confidence in industry and it is opportune that we address our attentions and energies in every possible direction to encourage employers to re-employ those people they let go over the past few years. This legislation, introduced by the previous administration, is welcomed throughout the land.  The main points refer to the provision of more finance to the IDA and there is provision for the acquisition of firms and the purchase by the IDA of share capital and majority shareholding in companies.</P>
      <P>It is to be welcomed that the IDA will be empowered to provide working capital for small industries to a limit of £150,000 without the consent of the Government.  Over the past few years small industry has been punch drunk with one trouble or another and so many firms have gone down in the economic storm and it is wonderful to see that the Minister is once again placing confidence in the IDA.  Their track record is impeccable.  As everyone knows, the IDA are regarded internationally as an example of the ideal vehicle for promoting industry. We have to turn our backs on the doom and gloom approach to job creation.  If we are to engender the right atmosphere for job creation it is very important that a feeling of confidence should emanate from this House.  It is opportune to call on employers once again to take a look at their operations to see where they can re-employ.  This is an area that can be developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the regrettable mistake made by the previous administration in cancelling the national census due to have taken place last year.  There will be a statistical gap and the ramifications of this error will <Col N="1461" /> be quite immense during the next few years in regard to population concentration and job planning.  The IDA will be without vital information in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 9 contains a new provision which allows the IDA to take share capital up to 100 per cent or £1 million and, indeed, a majority shareholding. I should like to see a provision in the Bill for more direct participation by officials of the IDA in proportion to their shareholding in companies.  It is very important to a small industry that they have the direct participation of IDA officials.  Apart from the fact that they can call on advice or counsel, they will be constantly kept in mind of the commitment of the IDA to their firms.</P>
    <P>The IDA will also be empowered to set up their own company or companies. This is of vital importance and is a new concept in Irish industry.  To take one example, there is a very pressing need for a wholly-owned Irish foundry capable of doing its own high-quality work as an alternative to farming out such work abroad at very high cost and involving very protracted delays.  This is a welcome provision.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is that the IDA will be empowered to hold shares in controlling companies and such companies might not necessarily be engaged in ground level manufacture.  This is important because the controlling company might be situated abroad.  It is essential that the IDA are seen as a promotional authority and in this role can go full out to promote industry and engender confidence.  If the climate for industrial expansion is hampered in any way by a feeling of industrial unrest we cannot possibly hope that the efforts of the IDA will become any easier.  It is important that a healthy industrial relations atmosphere prevails.  The IDA are certainly doing all in their power to encourage industry to develop but we must take all steps to create this healthy atmosphere if the IDA is to function at its best.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision to increase grants for research and development for £15,000 to £50,000.  With higher standards of education and more and <Col N="1462" /> more young people seeking employment there is a pressing need for them to be allowed to use their energies in research.</P>
    <P>I call on all Members of the House to unite in supporting the Bill, which is essential to job creation.  There is no point in having a pie-in-the-sky attitude towards job creation.  The IDA are more active now and they will be given more finance.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him well.  I believe he has courage and, like all good Munstermen, he has determination. However, he has a hard task before him.  I dislike gloomy predictions but we are facing 1978 and the prospect of 180,000 unemployed and should do all we can to strengthen every Government agency.  Our primary objective should be to strengthen the IDA because they are the principal creators of employment.</P>
      <P>Since the Bill was introduced I have listened with interest to the debate.  I have been amazed at the conversion of the Government, a conversion which has occurred within the last six months. It could be compared with St. Paul's conversion on the road to Damascus. For more than three years I listened to the Ministers for Industry, Commerce and Energy, Labour and Finance criticise and abuse the previous Government for their handling of the economy.  This continuous barrage led one to conclude that the recession was an Irish problem.  At a later stage I began to believe that the Government were to blame for the worldwide recession, that we made the Arabs increase the price of oil and that we were responsible for the increases in the price of coffee and tea.  Fianna Fáil now accept that it was world recession and their conversion at this late stage is remarkable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One Fianna Fáil Deputy referred to the IDA and its work in the sixties.  He said that it was not necessary for him to dwell on the sixties.  The inference is that the IDA did very well in those glorious years.  In the sixties, when we were enjoying a boom, the activities of the IDA were anything but noteworthy. I believe the IDA did more for the country during the recession.  It is easy <Col N="1463" /> to talk of creating employment in a healthy economy.  Despite all the job losses on our entry into the EEC and a world recession, the IDA were more successful between 1974 and 1976 than they were in the sixties.</P>
    <P>If the IDA are to be successful at a national level they must work in harmony with regional development agencies.  The objectives of the IDA must be viewed in relation to regional development.  I am concerned with events in my constituency.  I have been in public life for 21 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann expresses its concern at the increasing frequency of offences of armed robbery and similar offences of violence, and deplores the failure of the Government to check this trend.</P>
      <P>The problem of security has been the subject of political intrigue and accusations during the past few years. I hope my contribution will not place the blame at the door of the Minister for Justice.  The security of the State is of common interest and is not a political plaything.  Anything I have to say tonight will be frank and fair.</P>
      <P>In doing that I must put on record that, having searched the Official Report of this House, I could not help noticing that the Minister, when he was Opposition spokesman on Justice, accused the then Minister for Justice of cutting down for economic reasons the overtime which was allegedly taken from the gardaí.  That was his only contribution to the security of the State and in trying to help the Government of the day overcome the terrible difficulties of security.  Every parliamentary question, every supplementary asked in the House, on every Adjournment Debate in the House, every public statement and utterance of the present Minister, when Opposition spokesman, accused the Government of subscribing to the high rate in crime by reducing the amount of overtime paid to the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1464" /> I will allow any Member of the Opposition a certain permit to exploit and I must accept that any spokesman for an Opposition will put forward in a constructive way things which he sees as being basic to the issues being discussed.  However, when we turn back the pages and see that a former Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, adopted the same attitude as did Deputy Cooney we see with crystal clarity the political manoeuvring which Fianna Fáil were using during their last two years in Opposition.  I hope to be constructive and frank and fair.  I believe security is the basis of our society, the streets we walk upon, the homes we live in, the places we work in, the lives of our people, and the property we own.  We are so dependent on security that it is not proper for an Opposition spokes-man to castigate any Government for falling down on the job but it is my responsibility to illuminate the attitude of the Minister when he was spokesman for Fianna Fáil in Opposition.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been in office for six months and he has told us, through a good public relations exercise, that he is restoring overtime. The crime rate has increased and the detection rate has fallen in spite of the fact that the former Government presented the Minister for Justice with 1,000 extra gardaí.  What is the answer to the problem now?  Is the solution that which was put forward by Deputy O'Malley and the former Deputy Cooney when they held the office of Minister for Justice: that it was proper to treat the Garda properly and give them a living wage and not have some members of the force earning so much money that they were turning down promotions and in some cases earning as much as superintendents and chief superintendents? That was an unhealthy position but that was the extent of the contribution of the Minister when spokesman in Opposition.</P>
    <P>I do not know where one starts to lay the blame for the high rate of crime.  The system is wrong, but the former Minister for Justice had foresight, wisdom, ability and determination to see to it that a survey was <Col N="1465" /> carried out in relation to this.  He commissioned a survey and we know that the results of it have been in the Department for at least six months. Why all the fiddling around when we know from conversations with ordinary members of the force that they are waiting for the report to be presented?  We are all wondering what has happened to the report but the Minister, and his civil servants, insist on dilly-dallying unaware of the urgency of this matter.  The present system is wrong and must be changed soon.  We would be blind and less than adult if we did not recognise that there is unrest in the force, if we did not know that there is suspicion at all levels in the force, that for many years there has been political involvement, particularly when Fianna Fáil were in office, and we would be blind if we did not know that most of the gardaí voted for Fianna Fáil in the last election.  We would also be blind if we did not remark that so also did Provisional IRA supporters.  Why? Because the contribution to security during the term of office of Fianna Fáil was nothing short of irresponsible. They were only interested in the number of votes they could gather in their political basket.  That was the sole exercise of any contribution by the Minister when in Opposition.</P>
    <P>I should like to put a number of relevant quotations on the record.  On 9th March, 1976, in the course of a debate on the Castleblayney car bomb, Deputy Collins, as reported at column 1564, Volume 288, of the Official Report said:</P>
    <P>We have had an unbelievable frequency of bank and post office robberies in recent times.  Unfortunately, we have had two and three in one day.  Three or four years ago a bank robbery was given banner headlines on the front pages of our national newspapers but because of their frequency now they are hardly mentioned on the inside pages.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary to tell the House that those words were uttered by the Minister when in Opposition.  The Minister also said, as reported at column 650, volume 290, of the Official Report of 5th May, 1976:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1466" /> Is the Minister aware that the Garda themselves say that the basic principles of policing and fighting crime are being largely abandoned in the interests of economy?  Is he aware that the Garda are saying they could do much better in the fight against crime and violence if the resources were made available to them?  Can the Minister say if even the most generous resources which are available to him are being used as they should be?  If they were, normal policing would not be as neglected as it is.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on the record another quotation from the Castleblayney Car Bomb debate on 9th March, 1976 as reported at column 1562, volume 288, by Deputy Collins:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice is the person charged with responsibility in the area of security so the blame for there not being a Garda street patrol in Castleblayney during the hours I have mentioned must rest solely with him.</P>
    <P>If I am to take Deputy Collins' remarks on those occasions as being substantial and his total contribution to security am I not right in saying that every bank, post office, train and house robbery and every attack on people on the streets is the responsibility of the Minister? The remark made by Deputy Collins in Opposition was irresponsible because I could not hold any Minister for Justice responsible for having a garda outside a bank daily or at the other places mentioned.  I have put those quotations on the record to show that Deputy Collins was exploiting a very delicate position, a position which was a threat to the national security, for a hundred votes, as if it mattered a damn which party won a general election.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to go out of Government than use those tactics.  In many parts of this country security has meant things which are different to my meaning of the word.  In some parts it means putting in the jackboot, wrecking homes and arresting people at all hours of the night.  That is not the type of security I am talking about.</P>
    <P>The type of security about which I am speaking is where there is a police <Col N="1467" /> force doing their best, a force which is recognised, has the backing of Parliament, and are given the back-up support for all the things that good policing needs and not merely the lip service of politicans, while in Opposition, who do nothing about it or perhaps see the folly of their own ways when they come into Government.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said about the fall down of the National Coalition Government on security while in office. Nobody has yet mentioned that two years before the National Coalition Government took office I had the duty to ask the former Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, if he was satisfied with the things that were happening in Donegal.  Deputy O'Malley assured me that everything in the garden was rosy and that there was no need for more guards in Donegal.  He said that the modern technological apparatus available to the Garda meant that there was no need for extra guards and that we could close down rural Garda stations.  This young Minister was then, on a wave of emotion, going to change the whole of Irish society as fast as he could get out of his State car and into a bigger office. Deputy O'Malley denied that there was any need for increased garda numbers in County Donegal.  What was the position?  Two years before we came into office, I asked the former Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, about a robbery in Ballyshannon where a Garda patrol car&mdash;which had over 100,000 miles on its speedometer&mdash; broke down giving chase to a 1964 Ford Consul.  Not alone that, but the patrol car that took over from the broken down one also broke down. The Minister denied that despite the fact that I came into the House on a second occasion with another question. However, I will acknowledge that, on a later date, the Minister came into the House, as reported in volume 254, column 896 of the Official Report, and said amongst other things that he wished to express regret to the House and to Deputy Harte that, in replying to his supplementaries, he did not allow for the possibility that the information supplied to his Department was <Col N="1468" /> incorrect, as it turned out to be.  The full story behind that is this, that the guards in Donegal&mdash;and remember that was two years before the National Coalition assumed office&mdash;were being asked to use cars which had, in many cases over 100,000 miles done, which were in the local garage at least once a week, which in very many cases would not stand up to the normal test the Garda expected public vehicles to withstand, and which had no radios.</P>
    <P>That was the type of structure the Fianna Fáil party considered to be necessary, available and adequate to deal with the rising crime rate in Donegal.  It took us months to penetrate the ignorance or stubborness of the Minister to tell him that that was not good enough.  However, all of that changed.  Before I leave that point I should say it was common knowledge that gardaí on patrol duty in those bangers had to stop at public telephone kiosks, go to a local hotel or, if they knew a citizen sufficiently well, stop and ask if they could use his private telephone to make contact with the local barracks.  That was the type of security the Fianna Fáil party presented to the country less than two years before the National Coalition took office.</P>
    <P>We now have a very efficient, determined, skilled, anxious force to come to terms with the rise in crime.  What is the position?  The Minister is sitting on a survey that the National Coalition Government, through the then Deputy Cooney, commissioned, the first and only ever undertaken to examine the Garda force in greater detail.  The quicker that is commissioned the better because my contribution here will be to assist Deputy Collins while he is Minister for Justice.  I do not see any good reason for me to come into the House and play-act the way he playacted in Opposition.</P>
    <P>Despite all the things Deputy Collins in Opposition said could be done he is now six months in Government, and that might be a short enough time in which to achieve the things he said could be achieved&mdash;I cannot help remarking that last Friday evening, when I was otherwise engaged, or I would have been watching television, I was told by those people <Col N="1469" /> who saw the programme that the Minister came across to the general public with this phobia about the fact that the former Minister, Senator Cooney, reduced Garda overtime and that that was the cause of the increased crime.  In this year's budget £5 million extra was voted for Garda overtime; £450,000 was transferred from the Garda wages' heading to Garda overtime. I am told that nothing like that has yet been paid out.  Perhaps the Minister has the right attitude but he is continuously selling himself as the golden jewel of the security office, the highest office in the country, the Department of Justice.  I do not find fault with that.  I believe it is necessary also to have the right attitude.  It is not so long since the attitude to those people who were still gainfully employed robbing banks, post offices, filling stations, small business or anywhere a few bob could be rifled was &ldquo;observe but do not apprehend.&rdquo; Those same people might just misunderstand the Minister.  They might just think: well, when they were last in office there was a short period of &ldquo;observe but do not apprehend.&rdquo; Deputy Kelly is smiling but I remember that to be the position.  I remember guards approaching me in County Donegal, men who had come back into the county to do Border patrol, who said they were ashamed of the Donegal people because they were not exposing these people in their midst.  We developed the argument and said: &ldquo;Fair enough, do you expect the Donegal people to expose these people when they know that the guards know them and are not doing anything about it?&rdquo;  Any guard who was in agreement would say: &ldquo;Well, we are not doing too much about it ourselves.&rdquo;  That was the position in 1969, 1970 and possibly in 1971.  The position changed under Fianna Fáil.  Why did it change? It changed because then those people who were heroes north of the Border, who were doing as some would say, &ldquo;not a bad job up there,&rdquo; began to interfere with our ball-game down here. They began to be a force to be contended with by the Fianna Fáil Party. But the Fianna Fáil Party can say: &ldquo;We have been as severe on provisional Sinn Féin and suversives as any <Col N="1470" /> other party in the country.&rdquo;  That is also true.  That is true but it is only true when one takes into consideration that they came to that point of thinking when they were forced to do so too late.  That was a terrible attitude.</P>
    <P>The full meaning of it is that we would give consent to people who would go North of the Border to rob banks, shoot policemen and soldiers and burn and bomb buildings so long as it did not interfere with us.  The attitude was that there were so many other things up there that were wrong it did not matter much.  Nobody can point a finger in the direction of the previous Government and if anybody could have done I would not have been a backbencher supporting them.  The extension of the argument is that we would close our eyes to people who would cause bombs to go off that would kill innocent people&mdash;and those innocent people also happen to be Irish.  They may have come from families that did not have the same traditional background as we have but they were human beings and were part of a family unit.</P>
    <P>Lo and behold, bank robberies started here, as soon as the money was needed.  When the security position tightened in the North so that robberies could not be carried out so easily, when the money ran scarce for paying the boys, and when the NORAID money started slowing up, they started to rob banks here.  This pattern was repeated before.  Men of an older generation have told me that they have seen this happen before when the story was &ldquo;Ireland is not for the making, Ireland is for the taking&rdquo;. That happened before I was born.  All the stages of subversion, the breakdown of law and order, were not invented by this generation.  They happened during the lifetime of this State since 1922.</P>
    <P>We took strong measures but Fianna Fáil only saw the need for improved security measures, for more gardaí on the beat and for the need for protection whenever the breakdown of law and order in the North was imported to the South.  When it interfered with the political game of Fianna Fáil in the South, then there was a change <Col N="1471" /> of attitude.  There was a rush to buy more patrol cars, to install more two-way radios, there was a need for over-time. At the same time there was an attack on the very basis of our society by those people whom we were stopping from robbing our banks.  There was also a change of Government.</P>
    <P>In that change of Government the then Minister for Justice was in the most difficult seat of the entire Cabinet. He deserved the support of every Member of this House.  He deserved the support of every Member of his party and the party in Government with them and also the support of Members of Fianna Fáil.  Did he get it?  No, he did not get it.  The only thing he got from Deputy Collins was the accusation that if overtime was restored, the overtime which his Government took away, all of the crimes being committed could be stopped.</P>
    <P>We know that in those days there was a detection rate of 60 per cent in respect of crimes committed but now it is falling to below 40 per cent.  What is happening about this matter?  The former Minister for Justice was in almost daily contact with the Commissioner's office.  I want to ask the Minister if he has ever had to talk with the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  I do not want to be unfair to the Minister and he can correct me now if I am wrong.  He has been six months in office and he has not yet had a conversation with the chief of our police force despite the fact that the crime rate is escalating and the detection rate is falling even though there are an additional 1,000 gardaí at his disposal.  If this is true it is a terrible indictment of the Minister.  If I were Minister for Justice the first person I would communicate with would be the man in charge of the everyday working of our police force.  I hope the Minister will refer to this point in his reply.</P>
    <P>We have reached a stage where people in wheelchairs can mastermind robberies.  A neighbour of mine has been robbed four times in the last two years, twice in one week in the last three months, and another neighbour was robbed on two occasions in a fortnight.  All these robberies take a <Col N="1472" /> certain amount of planning.  Some of them are major jobs and we must assume that those planning them are skilled, experienced and intelligent. What have we done about them?</P>
    <P>During my lifetime since 1931, Fianna Fáil have been in office during an economic war, civil unrest, a world war, civil unrest and the last eight years of trouble in Northern Ireland. Security means a citizen can go to bed at night and know his front door will not be bashed in, that his house will not be robbed or that he will not be murdered during the night.  Security is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.  He has the responsibility to restructure the Garda Síochána, something I am not satisfied about at the moment.  Until such time as there is a proper restructuring and until the desirable points in the survey are implemented, the crime rate will continue to increase.  It will not make any difference what party are in office.  If there was a general election next week and if we took over it would not make one iota of difference. The crime rate would continue increasing unless we did something about it.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Justice commissioned a survey.  That survey has been in the Minister's office for the past six months and I want to know why it has not been made public. Although I am not in a position to know exactly, I believe there are revolutionary proposals in it.  Why is the Minister doing nothing about it? Why does he sit back and dilly-dally while the crime rate is increasing and the detection rate dropping?</P>
    <P>For the record the following is a litany of robberies that have been carried out since Friday, 28th October: Drogheda, £15,000; Sunday, 30th October, Enniskerry, £5,000; Ballybrack, £10,000; Rathgar £700; Monday, 31st October, Muff&mdash;in my own county&mdash;£1,500; Tuesday, 1st November, Capel Street, £20,000; Friday 4th November, Tallaght, £12,000, Artane £3,500, Cork £6,000; Monday 7th November James's Street £600, Dún Laoghaire £1,000; Tuesday, 8th November, Waterford £1,000; Wednesday, 9th November, Montague <Col N="1473" /> Street £2,000; Thursday, 10th November, Convoy, a local bank about three miles from me, £800; on Friday, 11th November, we had four robberies, Slane £3,300, Maynooth, we do not know how much was taken; Charlestown £200, Phibsboro' amount unknown; Saturday, 12th November, Nenagh £10; Thursday, 15th November, Cabra £3,000, Longford £3,000; Friday, 17th November, Finglas £2,000, Dún Laoghaire £1,000; Saturday, 19th November, Tallaght £10,000 and Merrion Row several thousand pounds.</P>
    <P>The irony of this is that during the time the Minister was on television last Friday night, accusing the former Minister for being responsible for the high rate of crime during the term of office of the National Coalition Government, four robberies took place including one in my country.  In view of all his statements in Opposition, I believe the Minister will not be doing credit to himself, and justice to his predecessor, if he does not say openly that the former Minister for Justice had a very difficult job to do and that he was doing it in the interests of the nation, including Deputy Collins and every member of his family circle and the Fianna Fáil Party.  It was also wrong for the Minister to say that the amount of money which the then Deputy Cooney and the Coalition took from overtime being paid to the Garda resulted in increased crime and a lower detection rate.  We all know after six months of Fianna Fáil being in office that that is not the case.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will put on record that he made a mistake.  As spokeman for this party and a Member of this House, I will co-operate with the Minister, with the Fianna Fáil Party, or any other party, who are doing a good security job.  At the same time I reserve the right to criticise.  I hope my criticism will be fair, honest and straightforward.  Tonight as part of that criticism I have to say something unpleasant about this Minister, a man for whom I have a great personal liking.  I would like to speak about the 1977 Fianna Fáil manifesto&mdash;a document called &ldquo;Action Plan for National Reconstruction&rdquo;.</P>

He put that on record time out of number and I am surprised this was never brought to the Garda's attention before now.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if required to combat the serious increase in urban crime will be provided as a matter of urgency.  To add a rider to that, it must be quoted in the same paragraph that the Fianna Fáil Party succeeded in almost the impossible.  They got the subversives and the law protectors to vote in the same ballot boxes for the <Col N="1475" /> same candidates.  We know that has happened.  We know that in certain areas which can be identified as strongholds of Provisional movements, there was strong support for Fianna Fáil candidates not because they were hardworking men, over-generous men or anything like that but because those people believed that the Fianna Fáil Government might again introduce their policy of &ldquo;observe but do not apprehend&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It might be unfair of me to put this on the record but I do not think it is, because Fianna Fáil have to be reminded that when they speak publicly they should be speaking deliberately and they should be conscious of what they are saying.  It is not good enough for a Minister of State to go to the United States of America and make a public statement ignoring in his brief criticism of the policies of the Provisional IRA, criticism of any organisation in America that collects money for the Provisional IRA and an acknowledgement of the changing attitude of politicians in the United States.  I want to ask such a Minister a very straightforward question.  What else could an Irish politician talk about to an Irish-American audience if he did not mention the present troubles in Ireland, the security here, or the relationship between the American and Irish peoples?  What the hell else could he be talking about but these three points which were overlooked? I accept that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Kennedy, genuinely forgot about them but my point is this: subconsciously the Minister for Foreign Affairs allowed that chance to slip by.  Like another member of his party, his memory failed him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short time available to me I hope I have been able to put before the House some of the views I believe this Government must face.  I do not believe in political bashing and I hope in my remarks that I have not been doing that.  I am conscious of the fact that the present system adopted by this and former Governments, and this was acknowledged by the last Government, and present arrangements in the Garda <Col N="1476" /> and the present attack on crime are not adequate to meet present day needs.  A whole new think must take place.  If it does, it will call on the Minister in this emergency to bring in with the utmost haste the report of the survey which was initiated by the Coalition Government and implement every part of it.  The Garda want it. This House wants it.  The people want it.  Everybody wants it.  The quicker the Minister can get this done the better and he should stop dilly-dallying.</P>

      <P>Having listened to Deputy Harte saying on more than <Col N="1477" /> one occasion how much he was trying to be frank and fair and how he believed that this was the only possible way that a debate of this nature could be approached, I must confess that I had every hope that he would approach the debate in such a manner. I confess disappointment because if a debate like this is to be as Deputy Harte said he would like it to be&mdash; non-political&mdash;then I respectfully remind him that the number of political jibes used by him certainly would not help to keep the temperature down.</P>
      <P>If he professes to be as frank and fair as he wants to be it was not at all necessary to compare what happened to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in America with what happened to another colleague of mine who, I quote from my note, was described by Deputy Harte as &ldquo;like another member of his party&rdquo; whose memory failed.  If we want to mix it let us mix it; if we want to be honest and fair let us make a sincere effort at being honest and fair.  I would have every reason to approach this debate in the way that Deputy Harte would have wanted to and I will do my best not to be sidetracked along the way as he was.  It is very easy for him in making his case to go through the Official Report as he did when a motion of this type was put down on the Order Paper by me when I was in Opposition.  If Deputy Harte wants to take me to task for what I said then I would respectfully suggest to him that the time to trim me, as it were, was then and not now.  There was ample opportunity ! for Deputy Harte and his colleague, who was in Justice then, and members of his party who could have been present at that debate, to come along and make their contributions then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say to Deputy Harte that during the 40 minutes he had at his disposal I found it difficult to determine the number of minutes which he used to talk about the ever-increasing number of bank raids and armed robberies which we are having and which nobody in this House condones in any shape or form.  Every Member of this House would want to see that number of armed robberies decrease as rapidly as possible.  Let me say to Deputy <Col N="1478" /> Harte and members of his party that the increase which we are having in bank robberies at present, big as it is, did not come about overnight.  I am open to correction, and if I am proved wrong I will apologise humbly to the House and the Members present, but I believe that the increase in bank robberies in 1974 over 1973 was something approaching 50 per cent.  I believe that 1976 was something in the region of 100 per cent over 1975.  I would say that so far 1977 is approaching a 50 per cent increase over 1976. This is something that should bring the reality of the situation home to each one of us.  It would be reasonable for me to get lost in kicking the political footballs that were tossed about, but I will try to deal with the facts first.  If I have time then I will try to kick an odd one back into the court of the Opposition and I will be forgiven for that.</P>
    <P>There are a number of things wrong at present with regard to bank robberies that we must all look at.  We have seen a considerable increase in armed robberies and it is easy to take the members of the Garda Síochána to task for supposedly not doing their job.  In fairness to them they have had successes in capturing in a most organised fashion a number of gangs involved in armed robberies.  I am talking of armed robberies in the Deputy's own county and the neighbouring county of Sligo.  Armed robbery gangs are operating in counties Cork and Waterford.  We were all pleased, to say the least of it, on late Friday night or early Saturday morning to learn that another gang had been picked up here in town.  We welcome the day when the Garda can come to grips with whatever gangs are operating at present.  I have said publicly more than once that whatever resources are requested by the Garda authority and whatever means are required by them to combat this ever-increasing armed robbery trend that we are living with, I will see to it that they get them.  I am prepared to live up to that assurance.</P>
    <P>I also say to those who seemingly have the idea that the Garda are going to offer and provide protection for <Col N="1479" /> everybody who holds money, that a lot more can and must be done by the banks, hotels, petrol filling stations, supermarket owners and the like, who now too must see clearly that there cannot be a garda present at all times when money is being kept by these people.  I was advised recently that £5,000 was taken from an isolated petrol filling station.  A person who owns an isolated petrol filling station should think more than twice before having that sort of money on his person. Every one of us would like to see a situation in which we could all have as much money on our persons as we wanted to, at all times of the day and night, without fear of being robbed.  That does not hold, unfortunately.</P>
    <P>Companies also have an obligation and a responsibility to make it as awkward as they can for people who want to lift their payrolls from them. I mentioned recently the factory on the south side of Dublin which had something like £20,000 stolen from it.  It appeared that armed gentlemen were able to drive right in to the front door unchecked, get into the building and tell a receptionist to lie on the floor, and then move without any great difficulty into the payroll office and take £20,000 from three young girls who were dividing that money into pay packets for the employees.  Companies must do far more than they are doing to prevent this sort of thing.</P>
    <P>A percentage of the moneys being lifted is finding its way into the hands of people engaged in subversive activities, and we must remember the amount of that money that is being used for unlawful purposes.  That makes the crime worse, if one can use that phrase in ordinary layman's English.  It is bad enough to steal, but when the money is being used as it is we have to push more strongly and mightily to see that that does not continue.  Before I go on to the fair political game of Deputy Harte&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I read in a daily newspaper recently that it was the opinion of somebody involved in provision of security on a commercial basis for firms, that even the firms that believe they have protection never bother to check to see if their alarm systems are working.  It was believed by the author of the particular article that many of the systems involved would not be up to scratch.  The banks must also do far more, but in fairness to them we must recognise that they have done a lot.  Much more needs to be done.  In the litany of robberies read to us by Deputy Harte he gave one in Listowel, County Kerry, where £36,000, an extremely large sum of money was taken by armed robbers who simply had to remove an ordinary pane of glass from a back window to gain access to that bank and wait for the staff to arrive.</P>
      <P>There is great room for improvement here.  I am sorry that Deputy Harte did not get the opportunity last Friday night to watch the programme dealing with armed robberies, not that he would have agreed with much of what I said but there were professionals on that programme who had some interesting ideas which I believe merit considerable consideration.</P>

      <P>I should like to think that the Garda Síochána, who are presently reviewing the situation with regard to what is required of them and what is needed by them to combat <Col N="1481" /> the increasing number of armed robberies, will be able to come up with the answers.  We all want to see that happening as quickly as possible for the reasons I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>When I mentioned a few minutes ago that I would say something resulting from Deputy Harte's contribution, Deputy Kelly seemingly did not think that I should.  Let me correct a few impressions that Deputy Harte seems to have, which are probably shared by other Members of his party.  I want to say that Deputy Harte is very wrong if he believes that my predecessor presented the new Government with 1,000 extra gardaí.  That statement could not be further from the truth.  I might say, very briefly, for the Deputy's information that from the time the first announcement was made about increasing the strength of the Garda Síochána by 500 members it took over 18 months before the first of the raw recruits went into the training centre in Templemore.  When I took office on July 5th there were approximately 40 trainee raw recruits starting the course of training, which is 22 weeks.  I also want to say, in reply to Deputy Harte, that there was never at any time a decision made by the Government he supported prior to the 5th July to have 1,000 extra members added to the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>I am telling the truth.  If I am wrong then I am guilty of something serious in misleading the House.  There was no decision made by the previous Government to increase the Garda strength by 1,000 men.  I repeat that at the time I took office there were approximately 40 raw recruits in the training centre at Templemore and no more than that. It is very easy to say, as Deputy Harte said, &ldquo;You are there six months, what have you done?&rdquo;  We have increased the capacity of the training centre to its maximum and, <Col N="1482" /> please God, the first of the gardaí we were waiting 18 months for, from the time it was first announced by my predecessor will be on the streets before Christmas.  There was no decision by the previous Government to put 1,000 extra garda on the streets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister.  The fact is that there was a 25 per cent increase in the number of gardaí since 1972 and the Coalition were in power for some of those years.  Were those extra gardaí all provided by Fianna Fáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has 15 minutes in which to reply to this debate.  He can, between now and tomorrow night, check if what I am saying is the truth and he will have the opportunity of telling the House tomorrow night.  Deputy Harte spoke for a long time about speeches I made when I was in Opposition and said that some of my statements were irresponsible.  He accused me of playing with security.  He went on from there to say that all good policemen need are backup services.  I accept the latter part of that statement but I refute the other observation made by the Deputy because it is far from the truth.</P>
      <P>With regard to backup services for good policemen, let me say to the Deputy that the accusations I made against my predecessor were accusations made against the Government by the gardaí at that time.  I could quote chapter and verse from the Official Report if I had more than 20 minutes at my disposal.  It was the Garda who said that they had not the resources and that they were being denied them by the Government.  It was the Garda who said that squad cars were grounded at the time because the men to drive the cars were not being paid. It was the Garda who said that the criminals were not being caught because there was not sufficient manpower. If Deputy Harte wants to check what I am saying he can find the truth of the matter not alone in the Official Report but in editorials in the Garda magazines.</P>

Might I further say that the accusations made against me of having a phobia about the Garda is far from the truth.  What I argued at all times from those benches was that, because of the shortage of Garda and the availability of Garda manpower in our urban areas where two-thirds of these robberies take place, the then Government and Minister should provide the money to enable the existing manpower of the Garda to work additional hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to be fair he should let me make my contribution.  It is so easy for Deputy Harte to go back to a situation which existed in 1969 or 1970.  If he wants to make accusations of the type he made, I have not time to deal with them in this debate except by rejecting out of hand any suggestion that as Minister for Justice I gave the impression that they may observe but do not apprehend.  As spokesman for his party with responsibility in this area, the Deputy is not doing justice to anybody by uttering such remarks and, indeed, he is doing himself far less than justice.</P>
      <P>I did not take away in any way from Deputy Cooney as Minister for Justice in the previous Government.  I sympathised with him in that seemingly he was unable to convince his colleagues in Government that more money should be made available to him.  That is on record.  Basically, the then Minister understood that you cannot tell a policeman who is investigating an armed robbery at 5 o'clock on a Friday evening: &ldquo;Lay off until 9 o'clock or 9.15 on Monday morning because we will not pay you overtime to continue your investigation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree the then Minister had a very difficult task.  He might have been <Col N="1484" /> more successful if his colleagues around the Cabinet table had given him a little more help in getting the resources he needed to combat crime. I cannot be castigated in any way by Deputy Harte for not backing up the then Minister.  I urged him to do the things I have done since I became Minister for Justice.  It was not my role in Opposition which prevented the then Deputy Cooney from regaining his seat in this Assembly.  I wish he did in recognition of his efforts.  It was not Fianna Fáil, it was not the Garda who prevented him from regaining his seat.  If the truth were known.  I am afraid it was the members and supporters of his own parliamentary party who had the choice and their choice, seemingly, was not Deputy Cooney in his constituency.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Fianna Fáil election manifesto, it was interesting to hear it being described today for the first time as &ldquo;The Funnies&rdquo;.  Funnies or no funnies it is there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It was accepted by the people.  It will continue to be there despite efforts by the Opposition to ridicule it or trample it into the ground. With regard to off-the-cuff remarks which might be interpreted by people who wanted to do so to the effect that I, as Minister for Justice, have not met the Commissioner of the Garda, let me say to Deputy Harte that, if the rest of his contribution is as reliable as that part of it, he would want to do his homework because nothing could be further from the truth.  If the Deputy wants to fulfil his role as spokesman for his party in this area in a fair and frank manner, he should research his contributions.  Research is necessary particularly before accusations of the type I have just dealt with &mdash;wild accusations without any foundation&mdash;are made by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More than once Deputy Harte mentioned the fact that the Coalition Government commissioned a consultancy report.  That is no secret.  We had discussions on that consultancy effort in this House during the period <Col N="1485" /> of office of the previous Government. I am not sure whether we have had questions on this matter in the four or five weeks since this Dáil met.  The report is in the Department of Justice. Certain final contributions on the report have still to come from the consultants. I have asked to have them submitted as quickly as possible.  There is no desire on my part, or on the part of anybody in my Department, to delay or postpone action on this report.  I have to await the final report before I make whatever decisions have to be made on it.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are fully aware of the concern of the Government about the increasing number of armed robberies.  They are fully aware that the Government are prepared to give generously of whatever resources are required to combat armed robberies.  This is the situation as I have found it during my short term as Minister for Justice, a situation which did not exist during a good deal of the time my predecessor was in office when the resources he sought from his Government were not given to him by his colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject matter of this debate is so serious that it should be debated as dispassionately as possible.  It is important that this motion should be debated just now. It reflects growing public concern about crimes of violence of all kinds in our society and, in particular, about the recent extraordinary increase in the number of armed robberies.  That is what the motion is all about.</P>
      <P>If we are to deal with the problem of increasing violent crime, it is important that we should be clear about the nature of that crime.  Only if we are clear about its nature can we develop suitable means of dealing with the situation.  The figures available to us show that the recent increase in the number of robberies offers the most serious immediate cause for concern.  The number of such robberies has increased annually.  It has built up over a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1969, there were 12 such armed robberies in the State.  In 1970, the figure increased to 17.  In 1971, it was <Col N="1486" /> 30.  In 1972, it jumped to 132.  In 1973, there was a slight decrease to 123.  In 1974, it was 127.  In 1975, it went up to 153.  In 1976, it was 186.  The estimated figure for September of this year is 213.  Therefore, there is cause for concern and alarm.  We must note that in the period armed robberies increased by 1,800 per cent.  A senior Garda officer indicated recently that, of these armed robberies, 70 per cent approximately were carried out by ordinary criminals and the remaining 30 per cent by para-military groups. That percentage is important.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that para-military groups were engaged in armed robberies to finance their terrorist activities and often, I suppose, to finance their own personal activities and their standard of living, but we were not aware until recent years that armed robberies by gangs of criminals have increased and continue to increase quite dramatically.  I do not propose to deal at length with the problem of armed robberies by para-military groups but I would hope that security forces activities against such groups both North and South can be intensified. While security forces must continue to act vigorously against subversive organisations ultimately the ending of their activities will depend on the ending of the political backing in Northern Ireland.  We must face that reality while we continue to do all in our power to control their activities in the meantime.  The fact remains, and this is on the admission of the Garda authorities, that 70 per cent of all armed robberies are carried out not by terrorist groups but by armed criminal gangs.  That is a cause for grave concern particularly as such activity is a relatively new phenomenon in this country.  It is difficult to understand why this should happen at this time. One might suggest that the activities of the para-military groups have contributed in the sense of providing an example of how armed robberies can be carried out or committed or in the sense that their activities may have led to a greater availability of weapons with which to carry out such robberies. But I think that is too simple an explanation.</P>
    <P>International experience has indicated <Col N="1487" /> that armed criminal activity has increased in most countries since the early 1960s.  I suppose it can be considered a new and easy method of robbery. Its growth in all countries was most dramatic in the period before the police force and the institutions of state plus those institutions holding money had developed new techniques to combat the problem.  In other words, the growth was most dramatic in the period before the police forces, banks and businesses generally devised new techniques to combat the new approach of the criminal and his new techniques. As the police and financial institutions developed new methods in other countries we find that such crimes as robberies with violence tended to decrease. We here are at the point in the scale where the gardaí and financial institutions have not as yet developed techniques to combat this new approach of armed criminals and, until they do so, armed robberies will continue to increase.  That is no reflection on the Garda authorities.  The gardaí are doing a fine job within the limits of the resources available.  Their task is an extremely difficult one.  However, the fact is armed criminals have found it profitable to rob since the forces of the law have not developed techniques designed to combat this relatively new approach to crime by criminals.</P>
    <P>The Minister is responsible in this area and the motion is, therefore, well directed to him.  While the somewhat sudden growth in armed robbery was, as I said, common in many countries in recent years, we must express concern at the fact that it has taken the State and the relevant institutions a long time to come to grips with the problem here.  It has existed at a pretty high level since 1972 when the figures jumped dramatically from 30 to 132 crimes annually.  The detection rate is unfortunately very low.  It is in the order of some 30 per cent and the rate of recovery of the money involved is still lower, something in the order of only 9 per cent.</P>
    <P>I find myself in agreement with the Minister.  We must face the fact that firms and institutions likely to be the objects of armed robbery do not <Col N="1488" /> appear to be taking adequate precautionary measures and the steps necessary to protect themselves against the activities of these criminals.  There is no point in thinking that this will just go away, that armed robbery will cease of its own accord.  Protective steps must be taken by those likely to be robbed.  One-sixth of all such robberies take place in banks and, while banks should not adopt measures that would place their staff and customers at risk, it has been shown in other countries that protective measures which do not have this effect can be taken.  I agree with the Minister these steps should be taken.  There can be no argument that banks have not sufficient resources to take these measures and serious consideration should be given by banks to the installation of such protective measures as screens, video cameras and other devices which would make armed robberies more difficult to accomplish and detection easier without placing staff or customers at risk.</P>
    <P>It would appear to me no serious effort has been made by banks to date to deal with the situation.  They should now be told by the Minister to do so. He is on record on a number of occasions complaining that these institutions do not take adequate care. The onus is on him now to ensure that, if these institutions do not voluntarily take adequate protective steps, they will be compelled to do so.  By failing to take appropriate measures these institutions are making the lives of the members of the Garda Síochána very difficult indeed and contributing to an escalating level of armed robberies affecting the lives of all of us.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned other institutions which have the resources to protect themselves.  Any institutions which may rank as potential victims should take appropriate protective measures.  Business firms should use some of their resources towards this end.  To date, they do not seem to have done so and the rest of society is paying the bill in one way or another.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Garda Síochána are far from satisfied with the present scale of the problem and the low level of detection.  The demands of national <Col N="1489" /> security have placed an enormous burden on our police force leaving too few available for normal police duties.  Is there need for a review, I wonder, of police methods and organisation in regard to the problem of armed robbery at this stage?  It has been at a high level now for some five years and it seems clear from the level of activity and the low detection rate that something is wrong somewhere.</P>
    <P>I shall not enter into the haggling as to which Government was responsible for increasing the strength of the force but certainly the gradual increase in numbers on the beat during the current year has been welcome and it will certainly pay a dividend.  More gardaí on the beat are a deterrent.  However, that is not the whole answer.  It seems clear that the level of intelligence gathering in regard to armed robberies is minimal.  The development of intelligence gathering techniques in other countries has played a crucial role in helping to reduce such crimes as armed robberies.  It is essential that the Minister and the Commissioner should urgently review the approach to this development. In this kind of unwelcome activity intelligence gathering is of very great importance.  Our police force do not seem to have developed this technique adequately to date.  They do not seem to be in a position to do so.  In many countries it has been found necessary to create a special anti-armed robbery unit to deal with the problem.  In Britain this special unit has been highly effective.</P>
    <P>Another crucial question is: where do the weapons come from for armed robberies by hard core criminals? Paramilitary groups have their own source of supply but it is unlikely that ordinary criminals would have access to their own special requirements. It has been asserted, and this is important, that there are guns for hire in Dublin for criminal purposes and if the order of speaking had been reversed I would have asked the Minister to comment on that and indicate if he believes it is true and if so, what steps are being taken to apprehend those who are hiring such weapons for criminal purposes.  The situation is serious and is worsening and some steps along the lines I have indicated must <Col N="1490" /> be taken both by institutions with potential risk of being robbed and by the Minister in particular if the present level of armed robbery is to be drastically reduced.</P>
    <P>I might expand the debate to deal with some of the long-term causes of criminal activity which are within the competence of the State and the Government to eliminate or at least to begin a programme of work towards their elimination.  Certain steps have been taken to date but these are not nearly adequate to deal with the background to violence of this kind and its contributing factors.  On the list are unemployment, deprivation of some people, particularly young people, bad housing, bad schooling, bad environment, lack of rehabilitation facilities inside and outside prison.  But perhaps I should confine myself to the debate on armed robbery only and I would hope that the points I have made will be borne in mind by the Minister or by his representative in the House and that they will have some effect.</P>

      <P>The problem which the Minister has this evening is one which is not shared in such matters by all his colleagues in Government inasmuch as he is one of the limited number of Ministers who is occupying the same slot of responsibility that he occupied as Opposition spokesman. That is probably comfortable for him in that he knows the material fairly well.  I am sure he will realise that I am saying this in no condescending way when I say that I admired the way in which he, as a non-lawyer, got to grips with tricky legal matters during the year-and-a-half or so while he was spokesman.  On the other hand, this situation must provide problems for his staff because in drawing up a brief for him this evening they were faced with the very acute problem not only of giving him the facts in regard to armed robberies and crimes of violence but in also making sure that the form in which he got the facts would not lead him into saying something completely contrary to many things he said here while spokesman. Not only had they to give the Minister a sensible brief but they had the almost impossible task of making sure <Col N="1491" /> that nothing in that brief would be incapable of reconciliation with the somewhat lighthearted observations with which he entertained the House when he was spokesman on Justice and his somewhat ready-made and facile approach to serious problems of law and order.</P>
      <P>The Minister said something about Deputy Harte's contribution not being well researched.  If a research worker in the future were to search through the Minister's speech this evening in order to find out what he had done to combat the growth of armed robberies and general savagery and violence, he would be absolutely stumped.  I defy any Ph.D student or humbler researcher, an ordinary layman or politician, going through the Minister's speech, to come up with a positive answer.  It was clear that he was taken short, that he had not expected to speak, that he thought somebody else would speak before him, that he could move the amendment technically; nevertheless he is expected to know his job, to be acquainted with its problems and be familiar with the workings of his Department but he spoke in an impassioned way&mdash;I make allowance for a man who has had no tea, who has been sitting in the same seat since 3.30 without getting out&mdash; for a full 30 minutes and we did not hear a word from him regarding what had been done to step up Garda strength, redistribute patrols, increase the overtime he was shouting about a year ago; what has been done to re-equip the Garda or improve the physical equipment they have which can be bought and paid for.  There was not a word in his speech from which it would be possible to see what he had done to cure the defects and glaring faults which were to be seen, according to him, a year ago in Garda operations, not because of the Garda at all, as he put it, but because of the Government, because the Government was miserly and would not hand out the few pounds necessary to let the Garda get on with the job of tracking down bank robbers, patrolling areas adequately, getting out and doing a sufficient number of foot beats in urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1492" /> The House is as wise now as it was at 7 o'clock in regard to the vital question; what has this Minister, or the Government which was to get us all moving again, done?  There is not a word about that.  If we were to go only by his speech, the answer is &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;. Instead we got a scolding lecture to owners of banks, post-offices, shops, supermarkets, filling stations and companies handling pay-rolls. I should like to ask the Minister what he would have said a year ago if the then Minister for Justice had shrugged his responsibility in the matter of law and order and put it on the shoulders of the suffering shopkeepers, not only owners but employees also because it is they who are at physical risk in bank robberies, the responsibility for keeping a better eye out, having a better security system.  The present Minister would have brought the House down, but the Minister for Justice for whom I was proud to work would never have stooped to the level reached tonight of pushing the risk back on others.</P>
    <P>This is what is meant by getting the country moving again.  The real message hidden in the Minister's attitude is: &ldquo;You are on your own.&rdquo;  That was the message that came loud and clear from the Minister for Justice this evening to the owners of shops, supermarkets, filling stations and companies with payrolls: you are on your own: do not look to the Garda or to the Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The question was No. 564 addressed to the Minister for Education:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Education if his Department offer any advice to national, vocational, community, comprehensive and private secondary schools and third level <Col N="1493" /> colleges and universities as to where they can purchase Irish made teaching and administrative materials.</P>
    <P>The reply I received from the Minister was: &ldquo;My Department do not offer any such advice&rdquo;.  I rarely raise matters on the Adjournment but in view of the nature of this reply I did not think it should be allowed to pass. Whether it was intentional or otherwise I regard this reply as being almost contentious: it made no effort to answer what I regard as a reasonable question.  Members of this House, whether they are in Opposition or in Government, are entitled to a reasonably detailed reply and, above all, they are entitled to a courteous reply to any parliamentary question.  It has been the tradition of the House that when a Deputy puts down a question for written reply and voluntarily foregoes an opportunity to ask supplementary questions, the reply is usually reasonably extended.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply was not only rude but it was also rather inaccurate. My understanding is that as a general rule the Department issue annually to teachers in virtually every school a circular in relation to school books asking that where possible they should purchase Irish-made products.  Apart from that my question was in respect of the very wide range of educational and administrative materials and services, asking that a comprehensive list of Irish suppliers should be made available to schools and that the Department should do their utmost to ensure that all purchases, or the vast bulk of such purchases, be made from the suppliers of Irish-made teaching and administrative materials.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate the difficulty that arises in relation to tendering, particularly in relation to capital requirements, but there is now a multi-million purchase each year of educational and administrative materials and services and it is a sorry day indeed when one is offered in response to an inquiry of the nature I made, a one line reply&mdash;&ldquo;My Department do not offer any such advice&rdquo;.  The Minister should have been more considerate in his response.  If one takes the current public expenditure on various non-salary <Col N="1494" /> items in the Estimate for the Department of Education, it includes several subheads and it covers the State contribution towards the cost of educational and administrative materials in schools, such as school books, class materials, maintenance and so on. I did a quick calculation this afternoon and it would appear that for national schools alone £1.3 million in 1973-74 and up to £4 million in the current year arises under various subheads in the Estimate.  This is not an inconsequential sum even in relation to national schools.  In relation to secondary and vocational schools the figure for 1973-74, if one adds together the general subheads of the voted Estimate, is £5.6 million.  This year's Estimate will be in the region of £16 million.  On a broad basis the State would allocate the best part of £20 million a year for expenditure on materials in schools.  That does not include the various grants towards the capital building costs.  Even if one breaks it down further, for example, taking just science equipment alone, in the current years something like £300,000 will go to secondary schools and something in the region of £600 will be spent for school books for secondary schools.  I will not go into other aspects such as service contracts, like heating and so on, where the Department would have a direct interest.</P>
    <P>One must also consider the Minister's reply in the context of the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  I had thought that even in the Department of Education there would have been by now a circular from the Taoiseach to each Minister asking him to make a special effort to ensure that Irish-made administrative materials were used in his Department, since there is a great deal of taxpayers' money involved. The manifesto on page 8 said that a campaign would be launched by the Government to buy Irish, which would switch from imports to home products.  The manifesto also said that there was a need for the Government to think and to act Irish by getting rid of some tax practices and by other administrative arrangements which put Irish goods at an unfair disadvantage against imports.  All I inquired about was particular administrative <Col N="1495" /> practices within the Department of Education.  I wanted to know if there was any new thinking in that regard.  I would remind my colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Tunney, that one of his esteemed Ministers who was wont to set the tone with a great deal of travelling round the country attending functions, said in Dáil Éireann about a month ago that Fianna Fáil preferred to make their own innovations and to set about modernising our structures in their own way.  There is no evidence of that in the reply from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am raising this matter by way of protest against a reply which I consider to be grossly inaccurate and coming from the Minister for Education, Deputy Wilson I regard it as being particularly inadequate because we have had a flood of classical quotations here from the Minister in the last few months on virtually every conceivable topic.  I almost feel like nominating him as a kind of poor man's Pericles and of giving him an opportunity of expanding perhaps in relation to a reply of this nature.  If the Minister is so loquacious he should extend his knowledge of the classics at least to providing a detailed reply in relation to a question of this nature.</P>
    <P>There is a time honoured way in this House of curing those who give inadequate replies or who display no involvement or interest in the question, and that is that one can raise matters of this nature <i>ad nauseam</i> on the adjournment, at relatively short notice, and the Government of the day are obliged to reply.  Not in any carping or badgering way.  I want to say to the Minister that if I receive replies of this nature in future from either him or the Department, acting on the assumption that the Minister reads replies drafted for him, I intend to raise them on the adjournment, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle.  I will raise them each evening, if necessary, even if it means bringing in the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary at the end of the business of the House.  I have no desire to do that.  I think it is a waste of parliamentary time, but it is one way of curing people who give replies of this nature.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1496" /> Again I protest against the content of the reply and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will elaborate further as to whether this is Departmental policy.  I should like him to say if he is prepared to ask the Minister to have a fresh look at the way in which advice is conveyed to the various education authorities in relation to the purchase of material originating in Ireland or being assembled in substantial part in Ireland which would help us to create greater employment and which would be helpful in relation to our balance of payments.  There is a very substantial sum of taxpayers' money involved each year and as custodians of that money for the time being we must ensure that it is spent to the best possible advantage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the basic over-simplification that has taken place in the reply.  Though I can accept that the answer is an accurate reply to the question, it is not by any means an adequate one and it seems to be quite unnecessary to invoke such brevity in a matter in which, as Deputy Desmond has pointed out, reasonable and repeated practice in the Department of Education would seem to have given the Minister grounds for a fuller reply which would not cast him in such a bad light.</P>
      <P>The question asked if the Minister had indicated to schools, colleges and other institutions where they might purchase Irish equipment for their institutions. The question was not asked if he had indicated to them whether they should purchase such equipment. I contend that you cannot answer the &ldquo;where&rdquo; question without also answering the &ldquo;whether&rdquo; question. Obviously, if the Minister is to require that institutions wherever possible should buy Irish-made goods, it is a natural corollary that he should facilitate the institutions by providing them with lists of suppliers, not necessarily approved suppliers, from whom such equipment can be acquired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be objected that this might create discrimination, that the Department might be seen to be singling out some suppliers and ignoring others, and <Col N="1497" /> that charges of political patronage and the like would arise.  However, I do not think the task of compiling such lists in a fair and adequate way is beyond the wit of the Department's administrators.  It is a very small thing to ask them to do and I am surprised the Minister has not asked them to do it.  Perhaps he will do so after this debate.</P>
    <P>A comparatively small proportion of the educational budget is spent on materials, equipment and so on.  When you compare that proportion with the total expenditure on education you will realise it is small.  Particularly by comparison with the amounts spent on books, equipment and so on in other countries, it is a very parsimonious proportion indeed.  In education here, the huge majority of the Education Vote goes on salaries and this is why it is all the more important that the small proportion of the vote for equipment will wherever possible be spent on Irish supplies, and that the Department should actively facilitate and promote such purchases.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Desmond, I have been through some of the recent figures, including those in the most recent Estimate, and it occurred to me that this Government still are offering up silent prayers of gratitude for the Estimates passed here earlier in the year.  On education in particular, this seems to me to be a freewheeling Government whose only momentum so far is based either on the Estimates we have passed or the commitments made before the election.</P>
    <P>In the Estimates there is a clear indication of the kind of figures we are talking about, not least for the Office of the Minister for Education which is to spend £125,000 on office machinery and supplies and £200,000 on technological aid.  There is another area in that office connected with grants-in-aid. Can we have an assurance from the Minister that the same policy will apply to recipients of grants-in-aid&mdash; that they, too, will, wherever possible, be required to spend their grants-in-aid on Irish equipment?</P>
    <P>Look at the figures for higher education: equipment and furniture, UCD, £115,000; UCC, £65,000; UCG, <Col N="1498" /> £60,000; Maynooth, £8,000&mdash;the Minister's <i>alma mater</i> has not been doing so well&mdash;and TCD, £65,000.  We all know that when architects are commissioned, especially in the high status area of higher education, to design new buildings, there is a grave danger they may occasionally let their imagination run away with them and prescribe equipment and furniture which may harmonise with a certain aesthetic sense they have regardless of whether it has been manufactured in this country.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of area where perhaps it is not always entirely wise to leave sole discretion to the individual institutions in the matter of the spending of large amounts of money.  One of the things that has been highlighted by the question and the inadequate response to it has been the lack of local buying authorities for local schools and colleges which would be much more sensitive to the democratic needs we have been talking about.  We have the fastest growing youth population in Europe and it is about time we did something about using this as a basis for the further expansion of Irish industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. Tunney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the two Deputies for their contributions if for no other reason than that it serves to clarify what was in the mind of Deputy Desmond when he first tabled the question.  He has seen fit to comment on the laconic nature of the reply.  I suggest that he is demonstrating a new sensitivity, the existence of which I have not been aware during my years in the House.  He is also endeavouring to establish a principle with which I personally would take serious issue.  He seems to be suggesting that because a reply is given in few words, notwithstanding that it is the truth, it is <i>ipso facto</i> contemptuous.  I do not think Deputy Desmond believes that from what I know of him in the House over the years.  Perhaps the real reason for his raising the question is, on his own admission, for the purpose of teaching the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary the salutary lesson that where answers given are not in accord with what the Deputy considers appropriate or correct he has the right <Col N="1499" /> of bringing the Minister or Parliamentary Secretary back and suffering whatever inconvenience one attaches to being here for an adjournment debate.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I propose to indicate to Deputy Desmond how true the answer was and how difficult it would have been for the Minister to have said anything other than that which appeared in that sentence.  I have listened to Deputy Desmond and Deputy Horgan and I am not convinced that the extent and nature of the information they required is yet any clearer.  As they know, national schools, comprehensive and community schools are administered by boards of management.  Vocational schools are administered by vocational educational committees.  Secondary schools are administered as private institutions.  Deputy Desmond knows as well as I do that on all those boards and committees there is already representation of people who, to say the least of them, have an interest in what is good for the Irish people and in all aspects of Irish life whether social, economic or educational. There is an implied reflection on those people if we remind them day in day out of the reasons why they should buy Irish goods when acquiring materials for teaching and administrative purposes.  I do not think that Deputy Desmond would want to sustain that point.  He knows the calibre, the integrity and the sense of patriotism of the people who constitute these management boards and vocational educational committees and he knows that he can entrust to them the overall interest of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is that the variety of goods to be purchased would represent a fairly comprehensive list.  It is not obvious to me how the Department of Education could take the steps which would be necessary to furnish a catalogue of those items to every school or institution in the country. Deputy Horgan asked about the attitude of the Department and their position in exhorting boards of management <Col N="1500" /> and vocational educational committees to do business with one firm as against another.  Presumably Deputy Horgan knew that the Minister would refer to this point in his defence.  How would one decide which firm should be included and which firm should be excluded when making recommendations to the purchasing authorities?  If Deputy Desmond were Minister for Education, as could happen some day, I do not think he would like to have imposed upon him a requirement by which he would inhibit those agencies I have mentioned from purchasing whatever they regarded as being right and proper, in all cases giving pride of place to the Irish-made article which was suitable for the purpose.</P>
    <P>In the few moments available to me I will refer to the main area to which the Buy Irish campaign relates and that is the Department's capital programme in the building of schools.  Bearing in mind certain constraints that exist in respect of EEC regulations and World Bank considerations, I can tell the Deputies that before any building is commenced the consultants are required to bring together all the interested parties and to indicate to them that where desirable preference should be given to Irish products.  They are reminded, too, of the need of the adherence to that advice, Deputy Desmond was speaking about advice. In so far as that represents an amount of the annual expenditure, Deputies can be happy that the interest of Irish industry and the workers is being satisfied.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that, bearing in mind the reminder which the Minister has obtained from the Deputies in this matter, he will&mdash;perhaps earlier than he might have done normally&mdash; remind all these agencies of his interest in the matter and where necessary exhort them to buy Irish.</P>

    <P>By 31st August, 1977, the number of candidates who had been rejected by the interview board as distinct from being rejected on medical grounds was much higher than at any previous competition and this was the cause of complaint not only from candidates but from Deputies of all parties.

      <P>Relations in the field of social security between this country and the eight other member states of the EEC are governed by the regulations of the EEC concerning the application of social security schemes to employed persons and their families moving within the Community.  The regulations provide that, where a worker has worked in more than one member state, periods of insurance or periods of employment or residence are aggregated where this is necessary for the purpose of establishing entitlement to benefit.  In this way the migrant worker's entire working career may be taken into account for social security purposes and he is at no loss by virtue of the fact that he moves from one country to another within the Community.  The regulations also guarantee equality of treatment to the nationals of member states who reside in other member states with the nationals of these states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The benefits covered are the normal benefits of the social security system and embrace the following branches: Sickness and maternity benefits, invalidity benefits, old age benefits, survivors' benefits, benefits in respect of accidents at work and occupational <Col N="1382" /> diseases, death grants, unemployment benefits, family benefits.</P>
    <P>In view of the entitlements provided by the regulations to the nationals of member states of the EEC, reciprocal arrangements with individual member states covering these nationals are not necessary.  The principal EEC Regulations referred to are Regulation 1408/71 and Regulation 574/72.</P>

      <P>The position of Irish persons who return here from other member states of the EEC where they have been covered by social security schemes is explained in reply to Question No. 378 today.</P>
      <P>Emigrants returning home from other EEC member states who were not so covered or from other countries usually cannot qualify for the various social insurance benefits under the Social Welfare Acts because they cannot satisfy the necessary qualifying contribution conditions.  If, however, sufficient contributions had been paid in respect of them before they emigrated to satisfy the conditions for benefit and the absence from the State was for a short period only, they may qualify for benefit.  In the case of retirement and old age (contributory) pensions, it would be possible for them to qualify for reduced rate pensions when they attain the appropriate age unless their absence had been unduly prolonged.</P>
      <P>To provide benefits in a social insurance scheme for persons in respect of whom contributions had not been paid would be in conflict with the principles of insurance and I do not propose to amend the Social Welfare Acts to provide such cover for returned emigrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Emigrants who return home are entitled to the various social assistance services administered by my Department <Col N="1383" /> provided that they satisfy the relevant means and residence tests. Details of these are set out in the booklet <i>Summary of the Social Insurance and Social Assistance Services</i> issued by my Department.</P>

      <P>I assume that the question has reference to industrial action by the Irish Post Office Engineering Union.  I made a statement on some aspects of it during the Adjournment Debate on Wednesday, 2nd November, 1977.  Since then the executive council of the union undertook that their members would cease industrial action and carry out instructions in accordance with the arrangements for a return to work formulated during my discussions on 3rd and 4th November with representatives of the Executive Council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Regrettably, all industrial action has not yet ceased: instructions are not being carried out at certain centres and some staff who were suspended and who could have had their suspensions lifted on the basis of the union executive's undertaking that they would carry out instructions have not yet resumed work.  Pending developments, I would prefer not to make any further comment for the present except to say that I assured the union publicly some time ago that on cessation of industrial action and the resumption of normal <Col N="1385" /> work whatever problems they had would be dealt with speedily and sympathetically.</P>

    <P>RTE have devoted a considerable amount of effort to identifying the extent of the problem and to devising ways of avoiding it.  As a result, special equipment designed to minimise the interference has been installed at the <Col N="1386" /> transmitters.  There will also be extended test transmissions from the new transmitters before they are brought into service during which any interference experienced will be monitored. When these tests have been completed, RTE will determine what further steps, if any, need to be taken to deal with any residual problem.  The Deputy may be assured that everything possible will be done to avoid the situation he refers to.</P>

      <P>The statistics available relate to the number of offences in respect of which prosecutions were brought. which is not necessarily identical with the number of persons prosecuted.  In 1976 the Garda brought prosecutions in relation to 1,184 offences.</P>
      <P>An annual grant of £2,000 from the Garda Síochána Vote is paid to the Dublin Branch of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals for relieving the garda in the Dublin Metropolitan Area of their duties under the Dogs Act, 1906.  As regards the question of having dogs put down, this is a matter for the authorities in the home and I have no function in the matter.</P>
      <P>The role of the Garda Síochána in the enforcement of the law relating to dogs as provided in the Dogs Act, 1906, is an anachronism in present day conditions.  This has been recognised by the Oireachtas by the powers they have given in this matter to planning authorities in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976.</P>

      <P>Statistics are not readily available which would enable an exact calculation of the figures requested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Estimates of the number of house purchase loans issued in the categories <Col N="1391" /> of fixed interest rates specified in the question are as follows:&mdash; (i) 11,800; (ii) 5,200; (iii) 21,400.  The annual cost to the Exchequer of reducing the rate of interest on these loans to 9.5 per cent is estimated at £3 million.</P>
    <P>The estimates are based upon the only available statistics which are those furnished by local authorities for the quarterly bulletin of housing statistics, the latest edition of which is in respect of the quarter ended 30th September, 1977.  They do not enable the relatively small number of loans which may have been redeemed to be excluded from the calculation of the cost to the Exchequer. This calculation also assumes that all loans are repayable over the maximum repayment period.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if, in relation to Kilbrittain national school, County Cork, he is aware that (a) there is a teacher with remedial qualifications on the staff, (b) no remedial tuition is being given, (c) the board of management is anxious to have remedial tuition carried on in the school where there is a number of pupils requiring this and (d) if he will take steps to ensure that the wishes of the board of management are observed.</P>

      <P>Remedial education is primarily a matter for the child's class teacher and all national teachers are trained to deal with this aspect of their work.</P>
      <P>All the staff in Kilbrittain national school are fully trained and, with an average class size of 28, any remedial education necessary should be well within their capability.  The deployment of this staff is a matter for the board of management itself, but my Department's inspector will be available to furnish any advice or assistance the board may require.</P>
