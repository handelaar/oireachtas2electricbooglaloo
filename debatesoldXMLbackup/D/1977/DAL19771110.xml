      <P>Unfortunately I was not here yesterday morning when the Taoiseach made a personal explanation regarding a question on the floating of the £.  I would like to thank him for his explanation and to say that naturally I accept it without reservation. Could I ask him if he would not consider it advisable to try to ensure, when an action such as the floating of the £ is contemplated by the British Government, that prior consultation takes place in a matter which can have serious repercussions on our economy and particularly regarding employment?</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 4:</P>
    <P>In page 2, subsection (2), to delete lines 19 to 37, and substitute:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a) to prepare and publish general estimates of public expenditure, <Col N="692" /> both capital and current, and to relate such estimates to the growth of national resources and to the estimated growth of Government revenue; to describe the policies by which the Government's economic and social objectives can be achieved, and to indicate the expected impact on the growth of national output and employment of Government economic and social policies, over the next five years,</P>
    <P>(b) to identify in consultation with other Departments of State the policies it considers necessary for the attainment of the Government's economic and social policies, to integrate these policies with a national and social plan to be submitted to the Government; and to review the implementation of any economic and social plan adopted by the Government and to lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas the results of this review; and</P>
    <P>(c) to promote and co-ordinate economic and social planning for the development of the economy both generally and as respects different sectors thereof and different regions of the country.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing yesterday with some of the points which were raised on this amendment and on the associated amendments, Nos. 5, 6 and 7.  I was pointing out that Deputy Pattison must have misunderstood what I was saying or perhaps I did not make it clear enough.  I want to reiterate that what is visualised and I think what is essential and without which no planning will occur, is that the various interests in the economy will be consulted primarily by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development before the preparation of a plan for economic and social development. That would be part of the process of preparation of a plan and, thereafter, when the proposals for the plan were fully formulated, the matter would go to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would only be when the Government <Col N="693" /> had made a decision to adopt the plan either in the form put forward or in some amended form that the question of its implementation would arise. At that point&mdash;I think this is one of the matters the Deputies were concerned about&mdash;Deputy Barry and Deputy Pattison seemed to fear that the Oireachtas might have no opportunity to discuss the plan.  I got the impression, not perhaps wrongly, that Deputy Pattison seemed to think the matter should come before the Houses of the Oireachtas before the Government made a decision on it.  I do not think, quite frankly, that that is a workable approach to this problem.</P>
    <P>The Houses of the Oireachtas have a particular role to play in regard to the dissemination of the terms of a national plan, a role to play in comment and, if necessary, criticism of certain proposals but I cannot see it being workable that proposals would be put forward in the House and that the Houses of the Oireachtas, having contributed their views, the final decision would then be made by the Government.  I see that, in terms of a complete national plan having been produced.  When I say that I am not, of course, precluding the possibility of the production of a green paper in respect of which there would be a debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas and in respect of which views would be expressed.</P>
    <P>I must, however, say that a green paper of that kind would start life under considerable difficulties having regard to the content and history of the green paper issued by the previous Government.  I am not precluding the possibility of the production of a green paper which would form the basis for a plan but it could not be, by definition, in such a case the complete proposals for a plan, which is primarily I think what is envisaged in these amendments.</P>
    <P>I have tried to illustrate the manner in which the proposals for a plan are brought forward by any Government. I believe that they must come before this House.  Indeed it would be in the interests of the Government concerned to ensure that they did.  I also tried to indicate, if for any reason a Government <Col N="694" /> wanted to avoid that, how the Opposition could highlight the Government's efforts to prevent the matter coming before the House.  The circumstances in which a Government would want to prevent that coming before the House are almost inconceivable so far as I am concerned.  It would not make any sense at all for a Government to produce a national plan for economic and social development and then try to hide its light under a bushel.  It is self-defeating for a Government to approach the whole problem in that way.</P>
    <P>In connection with Deputy Pattison's amendment designed to make it mandatory by statutory provision that consultation would take place with the parties constituting the National Economic and Social Council as of the date of the passing of the Act, I have already pointed out that this could lead to very considerable difficulties.  I am not saying, as I think Deputy Pattison thought I was saying, that it would preclude consultation with other groups.  I am saying that it is certainly conceivable that the bodies concerned could change and there could be considerable difficulty in identifying that this body or bodies was the lawful successor of one of the bodies at present constituting part of the National Economic and Social Council.  A statutory provision of this kind would lead us into far more trouble than the absence of such a provision, especially having regard to the fact that consultation with such bodies would be axiomatic in the preparation of a plan for economic and social development.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter in regard to the NESC I should mention, that is, that the term of the present council is coming to an end.  In fact, certain provisions are being made in regard to its extension.  I draw attention to that fact to illustrate that it is conceivable that, at some time in the future, there might be no NESC.  There could be a different body and then we could be in the same kind of difficulty as the one I have tried to outline in regard to the individual bodies constituting it. On balance, I do not think there is anything to be gained, and there is a <Col N="695" /> considerable amount to be lost, by specifying the bodies concerned and providing statutorily that they must be consulted.</P>
    <P>While I sympathise with one of the points made by Deputy Barry, I am not sure there is a great deal of validity in it but, in an effort to meet the point he is making, I would suggest that we consider an amendment on these lines. I refer the Deputy to section 2 (2) (c) which begins:</P>
    <P>to review and appraise the plans and activities of Departments of State ...</P>
    <P>If that were to read:</P>
    <P>to identify in consultation with Departments of State and to review and appraise the plans and activities of such Departments ...</P>
    <P>I wonder would that go anywhere towards meeting Deputy Barry's point of view?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Minister will bring this in on Report Stage and I will have a further chance to look at it.  Is that correct?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped we might get all Stages now, but I appreciate the Deputy's difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying, to identify&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point made by the Minister that it is the Government's job to adopt and to bring it forward.  I am seeking to have that plan brought back here for review afterwards.  A green paper would provide an opportunity for the House to offer opinions.  The actual plan is the Government's business and it is our job to point out to them afterwards where they failed to achieve targets in that plan.  I do not know whether that could be incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said last night, it is nearly inconceivable, although not completely <Col N="696" /> inconceivable, that a Government would not be willing to debate that plan in this House.  I am trying to make it obligatory that the Minister concerned would appear here once a year to account for what he had been doing so that we could point out in what way the plan needed to be readjusted or where it had fallen short of the targets set out in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Economic Planning and Development (Professor O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much appreciate the point about wanting the House to debate plans but I find it very difficult to formulate some satisfactory set of words to meet that point.  Frankly, once you start getting into that area, can you envisage circumstances in which a Government would not want to have their own plans debated?  If you can envisage such circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That could be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;almost certainly what would happen is that, if there was a mandatory requirement in legislation to bring anything called a plan before the House, you would be back to the old Shakesperian problem of calling a rose by some other name.  You would probably call it a green paper, or maybe we would even discover other colours for papers. The line I took was that the essential functions which have to be established and authorised by the House were the functions spelling out the relation of the Department and the Minister to the Government, and making sure all decisions were Government decisions, and that the Government had proper control and direction over anything which purported to be done in their name.  The relationship between the Government of the day and the Houses of the Oireachtas is very difficult to tease out in any legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but it is part of my duty to ensure that the rights of Members of the House and of the public are protected.  That is what I am seeking to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking for myself, I can assure the Deputy I <Col N="697" /> would welcome the maximum publicity and discussion.  It is right that there should be the fullest possible awareness on the part of the public at large, and all interested parties, of any plan. The Minister made that point yesterday. I recognise that in legislation we are laying down a framework which should apply for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in that context I see the difficulty of trying to write into the Bill as a mandatory function something governing publication and debate.  Quite frankly I do not think it is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister identify the section of the Bill as it stands which makes it a statutory requirement that any plan must be produced? As I see it, there is no provision in the Bill whereby a plan must be produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>This is it.  At the moment we are discussing how we should deal with a plan but, in fact, the Bill does not make it mandatory that the plan must be produced.  I pointed out the weaknesses in the Bill and I tried to put them right.  Once the Department are set up, under the provisions of this Bill there is no statutory obligation on them to produce any plan.  That is one of the big weaknesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The weaknesses in the Bill were referred to on Second Stage and it appeared to myself and many other speakers that what is contained in the Bill represents what other Departments, and in particular the Department of Finance, were prepared to give way on.  We said that was very little, if anything.  Even after Committee Stage, the Bill will be almost the same. I do not think there will be any change in section 2 where the teeth of the Bill should be.  My amendments were designed to put teeth into it particularly in relation to the obligation to publish a plan and have it debated in this House and to have other people involved in it.  There is still no provision in the Bill setting up the Department <Col N="698" /> for Economic Planning and Development that the Department must produce a plan.  That is the weakness in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I sat here all yesterday evening listening to the debate on Committee Stage of this Bill.  I agree with the Minister and Deputies on the other side of the House that, in debating the Committee Stage of Bills, politics should be forgotten.  I listened to the Committee Stage of many Bills being debated over the past four years and I saw many improvements made to Bills on Committee Stage.  Even though, as the former Deputy Thornley once said, Deputies have to drag their feet to vote for something they do not agree with, they should give their opinion.  The democracy of this country depends on the success of this new Department that is being set up, because its aim is to create employment, and if the unemployment situation continues as it is over the next ten years, there is danger to democracy.</P>
      <P>The person who is taking charge of this Department, Deputy O'Donoghue, has a responsibility I would not like to have.  He must have ideas and must consult with everyone who is relevant to the plan.  However, if he is tied up in a straitjacket now, it is as well not to set up the Department at all. Naturally, the Minister must go to the Government before he comes here.  He has to convince them first of the plan. He has to convince the Minister for Finance to give him money for the plan, and he has to convince his own officials.  If a Minister is not strong enough when he goes in to his Department, it is the Department that will run him.  Therefore, he has to take command there as well, and say: &ldquo;I will accept all the advice you can give me but what I say is law.&rdquo;  The Minister who does not do that should not be a Minister.  Unfortunately for democracy, that does not always happen; the Department runs the Minister instead of the Minister running the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, will run this Department and that he will consult with every person who has anything to offer in this regard.  On his success depends the success of the Government of which he is <Col N="699" /> a member, and there is a day of reckoning coming in that respect too. The people will ask the Government to give an account of their stewardship in a few years' time.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Colley, pointed out the various ways in which the Opposition can inquire into the running of this new Department.  I can understand the Opposition's anxiety to see that nothing would be done that this House would not know of, but this is a new planning Department.  As Deputy Pattison said, there might be no plan; there might be occasions when it would be very difficult to bring in a plan because of changing world conditions. I would ask the House to let this Bill go through as quickly as possible, leave it to the new Minister, who has to come in here with his Estimate and give an account of his stewardship. The Government will have to do the same and keep check on this Department. If we tie this up too much we will be back to square one, and there will be no opportunity for the head of this Department to do the planning which is urgently required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with a great deal of what Deputy Callanan has said.  I have no doubt that the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue will run his Department, but what about &ldquo;Minister McDonagh&rdquo; in a hundred years' time? He will operate under this legislation, and what will he do?  We must see that this legislation stands up for all time, not just for the term of this Government or this Minister.  When we come to Committee Stage on Bills, we can find words that seek to protect all the points of view of this House, and that is merely what I am trying to do.  I am not sure about procedure and, perhaps, you would guide me, a Cheann Comhairle. The Minister obviously wants to get this Bill as quickly as possible.  I do not want to hinder that unnecessarily. Could we adjourn this debate for a few hours so that I could have a look at that amendment in writing?  Is that procedurally possible?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>To follow up on this point that if the legislation proposed is passed there will still be no requirement on the part of the Department to publish a plan and so forth, I agree with that, but again I see that question as a further extension of the point that Deputy Barry was raising.  Suppose we wrote into the legislation &ldquo;and the Department must produce a plan each year and lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;, any time the Government of the day did not want to publish things of a substantive or potentially controversial nature, then you would get a document called a plan and it would be a lot of old waffle.  It would offend my sense of economy to have people wasting their time producing large <Col N="701" /> tomes of what is usually referred to as cotton wool or gobbledegook, and I think all of us have experienced and suffered such documents in our time in our respective walks of life.  I do not see that it is helpful to leave oneself open to that charge, that one is simply making sure that there will always be documents.  Documents by themselves do not tell anything about effective planning and effective policy making. I have to keep emphasising that there is this important connection between policy making and policy analysis in relation to planning.  The actual procedures gone through in drawing up a plan involves, perhaps, people going off and writing up nice proposals sticking them all together and having exercises in targetry, as somebody calls it; and at the end of the day many people have spent a lot of time but they may not necessarily have done a thing that would help to create a more effective economy, or a more systematic use of the public purse, or more sensible policy-making on the part of the Government.</P>
      <P>Frankly, I do not want to see these documents and experience cotton wool types of plans prepared by just anybody and that is why I would rather have the legislation in a form in which we could deal with it in a realistic manner.  As I see it, a realistic manner is where the Government of the day have some idea of the kind of policies they want to implement and face the technical problems all Governments face in having ideas and discovering how to translate those ideas into effective action.  This is at the heart of preparing an effective plan and formulating effective policies. That is the approach any Government should adopt.  When the Government have done that, then they will want to publish their plan and have it debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without trying to anticipate the future let us go back for a moment through history.  We all know either from living through recent history, or reading further back, that at different times, for variety of reasons, Governments go through periods when the last thing they want to do is commit <Col N="702" /> themselves to any clearcut set of policies for the years ahead or spell out in detail the nature of the policies they are contemplating.  In these periods, if there is insistence through legislation that documents must be prepared, all that will happen is a cotton wool exercise. That is why I have no particular enthusiasm for writing in mandatory requirements to publish documents because documents, I repeat, are not the essence of effective planning and effective policy making.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what the Minister has just said makes the case for not setting up this Department rather than setting it up.  He says that there may very well be periods&mdash;long periods, perhaps, possibly the full duration of this Dáil&mdash;in which it may not be possible to produce any plan.  I understood the purpose in setting up the Department was to enable the Department to live up to its name as the Department of Economic Planning and Development.  As such, one would naturally assume its function would be to produce plans but judging by what the Minister has just said, that is not really its function at all. According to the Minister, its function is possibly to produce a plan if circumstances lend themselves to such a situation.  At other times plans might not be produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>May I come in for a moment?  I am not saying it is not the function of the Department to produce a plan.  I am saying I do not want it mandatory that it should publish.  I want to draw a distinction as clearly as I can between doing the work and publishing it.  Take a very simple example: at the moment we are running into a period in which a great many people want to know what is going to happen on the pay front and what are the Government's intentions.  Does any Government seriously begin by announcing the various policy steps contemplated or the manner in which it is proposed to implement policy in an area such as I have mentioned?  One formulates a policy and works out a plan and waits then until the various groups involved have an opportunity to work through their particular positions <Col N="703" /> and then seeks to take the appropriate steps to implement policy in such manner as time and circumstances dictate.</P>
      <P>A much more homely analysis is a game of chess.  If one is going to play a game of chess the last thing one does is announce to one's opponent the moves one contemplates.  A chess player can have a number of plans, a set of policies, if you like, and he will modify his plan in the light of his opponent's moves.</P>
      <P>Is that not frequently the case with Government in its dealing with business? Almost by definition, the most important and the most complex items of business are the ones where you do not publish everything in advance. If we were to commit ourselves to publishing annually a plan setting out the Government's taxation and expenditure policies in detail for the next four or five years, how could one seriously expect that to prove accurate or, indeed, proper in a democracy? For that kind of exercise one would need dictatorial powers.  It is argued that at the end of a year the plan could be revised but then one would be committing oneself to saying in some detail what the policies are for the next four years and there could be many periods in which the nature of the detail and the policy the Government would want to spell out would vary with circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crucial requirement is not to publish.  The crucial requirement is to carry out the work on behalf of the Government, put the policy options together, having identified the various options, and construct some sort of coherent set of policies which would constitute a plan.  What the Government do then with that plan is a matter for the Government.  If it is appropriate they may publish it <i>in toto.</i>  We may as well allow for the possibility that there will be times when the Government will not want to publish their plans at all.  If a mandatory requirement is written in, then there will be a variety of documents over the years because, when it suits the Government to publish, they will publish realistically and, when it does <Col N="704" /> not suit, they will publish cotton wool. That is my point.  I do not think a legislative requirement to publish adds one iota to the effectiveness of planning or policy making and analysis.  Perhaps I am wrong in that and, if anyone can indicate the way in which publication would assist, I will certainly consider that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal reason why I put down this amendment was to ensure there would be as much public discussion and involvement as possible in the plan.  That is a crucial requirement if the plan is to succeed. It must have the wholehearted involvement of all sections and, without publication, I cannot see how that can be achieved.  Again, we have a plan that most of the sectoral interests will regard as being handed down to them rather than one in which they have a feeling of involvement.  This amendment, like the others, is not putting a straitjacket either on the Department or the Minister or tying anybody in knots.  The basic motivation for it was to help rather than hinder.</P>
      <P>Because planning is particularly about social needs, particularly in the area of employment, people must be involved.  It must not be something far removed from them and decided at a different level.  It should help the Minister and the Department if this kind of facility were provided.  It could be described as a public relations exercise and that is very essential to the success of any Department and in the case of this Department the public relations element would be particularly important because it has to bring along with the Department the various elements that make up society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps some other form of words could be used to achieve what I think should be in the Bill, provision for the greatest possible involvement of all sections of the population through the publication of an outline plan.  The amendment says &ldquo;annually&rdquo; but there is flexibility about the period. &ldquo;Annually&rdquo; was put in because the work for which the Department is set up is very urgent and demanding and it was intended to give that sense of urgency and importance to the Department which it should have.  The <Col N="705" /> basic purpose of the amendment was to get as many people as possible involved in order to help the Minister and the Department to achieve the aims that are so necessary to achieve.</P>

      <P>If I publish a plan, the general principle of the plan is known but the details of the plan may be altered from time to time.  Does the Deputy suggest that the details should be published?  I do not think so because various circumstances outside one's control may arise in which one may have to vary the plan or change the details of it.  If you go into details, you are tying yourself in knots completely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little worried about the Minister's last contribution&mdash; I intend to call one &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; and the other &ldquo;the Tánaiste&rdquo; so that I shall not be continually repeating their titles.  I fear he is going down a rather dangerous road when he says that the Government of the day would behave in what he inferred would be a secretive manner.  A Government is not a business.  When a business is run by a board of directors they are using their own capital and the results of their failures will rebound on their heads.  Politically, the results of a Governments's failures may rebound on them but economically and socially it is the country that suffers if the Government make wrong decisions. Of course, I fully understand the Minister's example of the pending wage negotiations in which, I presume from what he said, he will have a part.  Obviously, in a negotiating situation you do not display your cards beforehand.  But in the matter of planning the economy I think those in this House are entitled to know on what basis and in what direction the Government are moving.  When the Government have started out on that road the people are entitled to know at regular intervals what progress has been made and where they have fallen down.  At times the Government will seek to cover up failure by producing cotton wool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is done is more important than what is written or said but we are talking about something fundamental <Col N="706" /> here.  It is not like running a business, a federation of industries or a trade union.  We are talking of the people and their representatives, their right to know and participate.  This makes an enormous difference.  My amendment seeks (a) to get the Government to say on what basis and where they are going and (b) when they have done something&mdash;I recognise there is a Government decision in this&mdash;to come back here so that we can tell them where they have gone wrong and what they should have done.  They can explain why their plan has not come up to expectations or why in one sector the economy has expanded at a faster rate than was anticipated when the policy was first thought out or adopted.  But I consider the line the Minister is adopting could be for democracy a dangerous line, one I should not like to see followed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise and fully share Deputy Barry's concern. In very different contexts I am on record as arguing that it is necessary for a healthy and more effective democracy to have much more information and much more public awareness and discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is rather surprising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  In discussing this I want to come back to the question of being realistic and practical.  I share the Deputy's concern. That is the direction in which we must move and to that extent I welcome Deputy Pattison's remarks and agree with them.  His purpose is to bring about the maximum public involvement and awareness and so on.  I want that also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us also look at this in a realistic way.  Has there been, in fact, to date any adequate handling of Government business in that manner?  Are we accustomed to objective, detached, impartial analyses of policies and economic programmes and then revising them in the light of experience and going on to the next year?  The answer is, &ldquo;no&rdquo;; almost invariably what appears to have happened is that every event or episode was turned into <Col N="707" /> the usual party political football.  So, we are trying to do two things, first to set up the mechanism to introduce some sort of longer range, coherent and, I would hope, effective type of planned policy formation.  It would not be realistic to want to launch this and at the same time say that it must be launched with a specified form of publicity.  If it were to be done absolutely comprehensively we would be expecting an incredible leap forward in the whole attitude and approach of people not only in this House but outside, to the whole manner in which they discuss Government action and Government policy.  I would rather we made it possible to progress at whatever rate is tolerable.</P>
    <P>While I want to see us move in the direction of greater public awareness and greater information, we will not arrive at that happy state overnight; it will take time.  People will have to get a chance to get accustomed to planning documents and to talking in terms of reviewing this or that type of policy, and it will be a while before we settle into any sort of pattern.  As part of that evolutionary process in the public discussion and debate of policy, there is a need not only for much greater information but for much greater publicity.  I do not mean propaganda, but publicity in the best sense.  I do not see how one can cater adequately for that requirement in the context of a specific Bill for a specific Department.  It is a more general requirement which will be needed not only in relation to anything that might be called a plan, but in relation to all the other areas of Government business.  I would rather approach that problem in that more general context. That is my reason for not wanting to be saddled with a requirement for statutory information and statutory publicity.</P>
    <P>If this Bill had been passed in some previous term of Government and I now found myself as a Minister saddled with Deputy Pattison's requirement, it would depend on the present set of attitudes of public opinion whether or not I could afford to publish in detail what would be regarded as plans and <Col N="708" /> policies of Government.  Deputy Barry's point was that Government is not like a business, and while it is perfectly justifiable for a business to have its secrets it is not appropriate for a Government to have them.  I fully accept that, but as a matter of practical politics, at the present stage of democracy, I am not aware of any Government who do not try to hold at least some of their secrets.  We have to go through a period where we gradually build up a greater degree of information to the public and a greater degree of public understanding of the nature of the issues confronting any Government.  At the end of the day, no matter which way we look at it, the position is that there should always be dissent in a democracy and a wide range of opinion.  That means there will always be different schools of thought in relation to every issue that arises.  There will always be a temptation to reduce any issue or policy to an arena for party politics.  It would be unrealistic not to recognise and allow for that.</P>
    <P>At least for the immediate future I assume that no Government will find themselves in a position where all of their plans and policies can be launched without criticism on to the public stage.  Part of the reason for that is the manner in which this House among others commented on earlier attempts at economic planning here. Even yesterday Deputy Pattison talked about the failure and the abandonment of the second programme and the third programme.  Did they fail?  Were they abandoned?</P>
    <P>It is one of the great myths that the second programme failed.  The employment target failed.  The output target did not fail and a lot of the other targets did not fail.  The basic direction of getting a certain rate of industrial growth, of recognising that there would be a reduction in the size of the agricultural sector and so on, were justified by events.  In that sense it was quite a successful attempt at planning. If we had had a more mature and more experienced approach to planning at that stage we might have been able to get the sort of thing the Deputy is talking about.  We could <Col N="709" /> have come along and said that things were not working out exactly as envisaged in the original publication and that we now needed to revise it, update it and to publish an amended plan.  That is not what happened. Whether the growth rate was 4 per cent or 3½ per cent, whether employment was going up or down, became a party political football.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is really what democracy is about.  I realise that we are getting away from the Bill but this is interesting.  If a Government produce and publish a plan and if their expectations and judgments turn out to be wrong, they will try to cover up with a subsequent review of the plan. It is a very good thing that that coverup should be exposed in here because that reflects on the Government.  The Government attempt to stay in power and we try to regain power.  That is what it is all about.  It is our job to expose the weaknesses in plans and the shortfalls in the fulfilment of the plans.  It is an obvious human reaction when there are shortfalls for the Government to try to downplay them, and when the plans have succeeded or are above target to say: &ldquo;Are we not marvellous?&rdquo; and so on.  It is to try to have that process continue in public in this House that I am seeking to have amendment No. 4 adopted. There is a very obvious need for security.  Naturally a Government cannot reveal everything that is going on, such as in negotiations with trade unions which the Minister mentioned, but democracy will not continue if a Government continue to refuse to divulge to the people and to the elected representatives what they are doing, why, and what end result is expected.</P>

      <P>These remarks were related to the question of whether publication of a document to be labelled a plan would or would not strengthen or further the functions of planning and policy formulation of the new Department.  It was in that context that we were trying to tease out the extent to which publication of a plan would assist or not.  I take the point of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and I apologise if we appear to have strayed a little.</P>
      <P>I fully accept that a Government should publish their policies, that they should not be allowed to conceal them and so on.  I accept and recognise that point.  I am saying that, of course, a Government are going to want to publish and get publicity for anything which they believe is beneficial, not only beneficial but, at times, they may want to publicise things which may be painful or may give rise to adverse publicity in the short term because the Government of the day feel it necessary, in the national interest, to move in a new direction or introduce some new policy.  I am saying simply that those types of decisions, whether they be decisions to publicise popular or unpopular measures are not necessarily always best formulated in the context of any particular annual requirement. That is all.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about an annual requirement.  I want it laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and debated here.

I want the Minister in here giving all the news, good and bad.</P>
      <P>If the amendment is accepted I hope I will be the one affected by it in five years' time, that I will have to come in here and justify my plan or proposals for the economy.  I do not want unnecessarily to delay the House; I think we are now going around somewhat in circles.</P>

That is if I am satisfied that we have the full agreement of the three Whips.

      <P>When we adjourned this debate on 2nd November we had indicated that we were in favour of the proposal to expand the second tier of government.  Of course we made the point that obviously assistance is needed for a number of Minister particularly in the context of Europe. Anybody who saw the way Deputy Clinton operated as Minister for Agriculture in the last Government would not doubt that he should have had assistance.  He was attending meetings frequently until 3 a.m. or 5 a.m.  It seemed almost to be a rule of the Council of Agriculture Ministers that they could not rise before midnight. They could not decide anything except between midnight and five o'clock in the morning.  Obviously that is one area where assistance is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure if there is an appreciation on the part of the present Government side of the importance of ministerial attendance in Europe.  We had the example in July last, when the Regional Fund&mdash;a most important measure as far as this country is concerned&mdash;was being discussed at the Council.  The Minister for Finance did not go himself, nor did the Minister for Economic Planning and Development who was, at that time, a Minister of the Government without portfolio Perhaps the Minister for the <Col N="714" /> Public Service or somebody else could enlighten me on a point.  There are questions on the Order Paper to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development: does he exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wondered whether in fact he did exist.  At that time the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance went out and was arguing Ireland's case for an increase in the Regional Fund.  The term &ldquo;Parliamentary Secretary&rdquo; is known and understood because of its very unusualness in Europe.  It is a form of animal they do not have on the Continent.  It is understood in Europe to be somebody who is a junior Minister.  The implication of his attending that Council meeting&mdash;and arguing Ireland's case for increasing the Regional Fund, when the Minister for Finance, the person directly involved was not there&mdash;is that Ireland is not interested in the Regional Fund.</P>
      <P>That happened on another occasion about a month ago, at the time of the hi-jacking of the German plane. There was a meeting of the Council of Ministers in Europe.  The Minister for Finance, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development were out there.  The level of contribution to the EEC budget was being discussed. Very rightly, Ministers on that occasion did not insist on a conclusion being reached because the German Minister had to return to Germany urgently because of the hi-jacking. The Minister for Finance, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development then left because, according to newspaper reports&mdash;which is all we have to go on&mdash;there was fog in the Ardennes and they wanted to get back to Dublin.</P>

Did we get anything, or did we just row in behind them like a tug tied to a huge boat?  The point I am trying to make is that it is not actually what is said at meetings in Europe that counts.  It <Col N="716" /> is the general way one can influence people outside the Council chamber that is important.  The Government would have no experience of this.  I do not know what Council meetings were held in the first quarter of 1973&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy but he and a number of his colleagues have been repeatedly making that mistake.  The Fianna Fáil Government attended meetings throughout 1972 and early 1973.

      <P>Well, the Government have forgotten.  A number of Ministers in the previous Government, including the Leader of my party, could give the Government good advice on this matter.</P>
      <P>On 25th October, in reply to a parliamentary question by Deputy Bruton regarding the new Ministers of State, the Minister for the Public Service said that it was proposed shortly to introduce a further Bill dealing with the salaries of Ministers of State. On both sides of the House there are a number of people who have held the office of Parliamentary Secretary and now they, or their widows in the case of deceased members, are drawing benefits at the rate appropriate to Parliamentary Secretaries.  In fairness to these people, particularly the widows, I should like the Minister to ensure that they are not disadvantaged by any increase in salaries that the Ministers of State may get.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill.  It is time that the Government took the initiative to upgrade the role and title of Parliamentary Secretary.  This title was misinterpreted in Europe.  The Parliamentary Secretaries were not regarded as important enough to negotiate.  I am delighted the Government have introduced this Bill at such an early date in the Dáil session and I hope the new Ministers will take up office in the near future.</P>
      <P>The figure of ten has been mentioned. There is need for an expansion in this area.  The Ministers are overburdened with work, particularly those who have to work in the European context.  They have to attend in the Dáil and they must also attend meetings in Brussels and elsewhere. This imposes a considerable strain on any Minister.  The Ministers of State will represent Ministers in committee and on other occasions in the EEC.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry referred to the situation regarding attendance at meetings in Europe.  When Fianna Fáil left office in 1973 there was some debate then on the question of obtaining an executive jet.  I suggest to the Minister that we might reactivate that consideration. The question of transport is vital.  The National Coalition Government adopted a very petty approach to the tentative proposal to get the jet and they scrapped it.  That was a retrograde step.  If we cannot attend all the European meetings, if we have to rely on airline schedules with the possibility of strikes and so on, we will be at a disadvantage.  The Minister might consider this matter in the coming months and perhaps discuss it with the Department of Defence to obtain one or two executive jets to bring our representatives to Europe.  It could happen that we might miss a meeting in Europe where a matter of much concern to Ireland was being discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="718" /> I expect that some of the Ministers of State will be appointed to the areas in which they are presently working. The number proposed may not be adequate.  Ministers or Ministers of State acting in their Departments can play a very important role.  For instance, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance deals with the office of Public Works and other Parliamentary Secretaries are responsible for other specific areas.  Ministers are overburdened with work and they could do with the assistance of Ministers of State.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy has to deal with a number of complex portfolios and obviously it must be a very difficult task.</P>
    <P>The Opposition should not oppose this measure.  There is no question that the Taoiseach is setting up these offices to provide jobs for backbenchers. It is a matter of necessity that these appointments be made.  I am surprised that the National Coalition Government did not adopt a measure like this while they were in office.  It was obvious from the way the country was run that there was a need to assist the then Ministers in their jobs.  Certain sections were neglected but the Government did not seem to realise that.  However, the electorate did realise it when they decided to elect Fianna Fáil as the Government.</P>
    <P>The role and status of these Ministers of State will be very welcome throughout the country.  They will add to the general quality of the running of the State.  Calling them Ministers of State is an upgrading of their role. Having this new title will help them to assist the Minister in the work of his ministry.  Each Department will have a need for a Minister of State in time.</P>
    <P>This Bill is abolishing seven posts of Parliamentary Secretary and replacing them with ten Ministers of State and this is a step in the right direction.  Legislation is becoming so complex and departmental work so difficult and demanding that in years to come there will be an expansion of this type of ministry.  Different Departments, for example, Local Government, may have Ministers of State <Col N="719" /> dealing with physical planning and development or building and construction. These are areas where it is difficult for one Minister to deal with all the legislation needed and at the same time the running of those Departments. A Minister of State will be playing a very important role in the years ahead.  In bringing in this Bill the Minister has made a brilliant move and I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Colley) Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Colley)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion on this Bill has indicated a general welcome for the basic idea and an acknowledgement of the fact that something must be done to try to ease the burden which lies today on a number of Ministers. There is a widespread acknowledgment of the fact that the burden and complexity of government have grown enormously without any corresponding change in the structure and organisation of government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Garret FitzGerald, Leader of the Fine Gael Party, complained that the Taoiseach was not here to deal with this Bill.  It is a matter of opinion as to whether it required the attendance of the Taoiseach.  It seemed clear that Deputy Cluskey as Leader of the Labour Party did not consider that it required his attendance or participation. The Bill shows on its face that it was introduced by the Minister for the Public Service and I thought Deputy Garret FitzGerald rather overdid that point.</P>
      <P>I noticed that Deputy Garret FitzGerald and subsequently Deputy O'Leary urged that we should give consideration to the appointment of Parliamentary Private Secretaries, Deputies of this House who would assist the Minister but in an unpaid capacity.  I know that in Britain there is such an institution but I am not too sure how it has worked out in practice. I would certainly give consideration to this suggestion in conjunction with my colleagues to see if sufficient benefit could be derived from it to justify the change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Garret FitzGerald also referred to the Cabinet system.  I am not quite sure if he was urging us to adopt it.  I want to make it clear that <Col N="720" /> as far as we are concerned we have not adopted that system but neither are we closing the door on that prospect. Certain arrangements are in train which would not amount in any way to a Cabinet system but would amount to most Ministers having an adviser or an assistant who would be brought in temporarily from outside the civil service.  That is not, of course, a Cabinet system but I mention it because I want to make it clear that as far as we are concerned we are not tied to any particular line of approach in this regard.  I do not want at this stage, because I do not think it would be relevant on this Bill, to go into the arguments in favour of and against the Cabinet approach.  There are arguments on both sides and as far as I am concerned, the system that is best suited to meeting the problems that have to be faced will hopefully evolve as we get further into the problem.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear in regard to a point made by Deputy FitzGerald and others that the kind of duties that will be assigned to Ministers of State will be announced later, after the positions have been created. It is clear from the Bill that what is proposed is that the position of Parliamentary Secretaries are being abolished and they are becoming Ministers of State and instead of there being seven Parliamentary Secretaries, on the passage of this Bill, there will be ten Ministers of State.  There will be three net additional persons available to deal with the kind of burden we have been talking about. Whether three will be adequate is a matter of opinion.  However, after detailed consideration it was the Government's view that this would be sufficient.  A good deal depends, of course, on how they are deployed.</P>
    <P>As I indicated, it is intended to increase the scope and weight of duties of Ministers of State as compared with Parliamentary Secretaries.  In other words, it is intended to use them to a greater degree and in many cases they will have a more detailed and weighty responsibility.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary made a point that was made by Deputy Barry today.  A number of their arguments were based <Col N="721" /> on what is a false assumption and that is that it was the Coalition Government who had experienced the burdens of the EEC membership, attendance at Council meetings and all that that involved and that we did not know about this and were only finding out about it now and that was one of the reasons we are bringing in this Bill.  That is not so.  I attended quite a number of Council meetings and engaged in negotiations during 1972 before we formally joined the EEC.</P>
    <P>The Danes, the British and ourselves and also the Norwegians up to the time of their referendum participated fully in the various Council meetings.  Therefore, we had considerable experience of the pressures that arise as a result of conflict for a Minister between his obligation to attend Council meetings in Brussels or Luxembourg and his obligations at home in relation to business in this House, to Government meetings and to the various other duties he must perform.</P>
    <P>There is no satisfactory solution to this problem but the Bill is designed at least to ease the burden to some extent.  Regarding the suggestion that the Bill was introduced on foot of our recent experience in the EEC, I would remind the House that on the first day of the new Dáil, 5th July, the Taoiseach announced his proposal to appoint Ministers of State.  Consequently, there is no foundation in the argument that the Bill is a reaction by Fianna Fáil to their learning about the burdens of the EEC.  We were not unaware of these burdens when in Opposition and when our opposite members were slaving away on behalf of the country.  The burden is a heavy one but one should not make too much of it.  It is not an excuse for electoral defeat.  Some members of the Coalition tried to use it for that purpose. Indeed, there were people who tried to use a similar excuse in 1973. The burden is part of the way Government must be conducted so one must endeavour to gear the Government into running their business to the load placed on them.  Failure to do this is not an excuse for any government in the event of their losing an election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the matters that was referred to in the context of this discussion was the reform of Parliament in relation to the duties of Ministers. There was the usual reference to a greater use of the Committee system.  I suspect that members of the Opposition discovered some time ago that it is all very well to talk about the use of the committee system and, consequently, a better use of the talents, the abilities and the time of Deputies but that the reality is that the use of the committee system to the extent to which is was engaged in the last Dáil involves enormous pressure on the time of front bench members of the Opposition.  Regardless of how one tries to arrange otherwise, some of the committees meet simultaneously so that it is impossible physically for an Opposition to service the kind of committee system that is thought of generally when people talk in these terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential difference between what is the committee system as it operates in many European Parliaments and what has been tried here is that we try to operate it while the <Col N="723" /> House is in session, whereas, by and large, in the European scene the committees operate when the full parliament is not in session.  Matters are prepared by the committees for the plenary sessions.  If the Opposition have not found out already, they will find out that the committee system advocated for this House would not work because it would be dependent on operating while the House was in session and would require the attendance of many of the leading members of the front bench of the two Opposition parties.</P>
    <P>There were a number of comments from Deputy Kelly that I was tempted at the time to follow up but a little time has passed and I think I might be merely wasting my time by doing so.  However, the Deputy seems to be taking a rather different line from that of his party Leader and also from Deputy O'Leary.  He is entitled to do that.  He was talking in rather graphic terms about the burden placed on Ministers while, at the same time, he seemed to think that there was not any real necessity for Ministers of State, a view that did not seem to be expressed generally on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry Desmond took the opportunity of speaking on the Bill in an effort to compare the cost of the Government with the allowance to which the Opposition are entitled. Leaving aside the numerous fallacies involved in that comparison, I was very struck with the enormous concern of the Deputy and of a number of his colleagues also with the amount of the allowances paid to the Opposition compared with their attitude in his regard when the matter came up for discussion in the previous Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barry may not recall as vividly as I recall&mdash;I was here right in the middle of it&mdash;the very difficult and bitter debate which arose primarily because the previous Government as one of their first acts refused to increase the allowances to the Opposition in line with increases <Col N="724" /> being made to Deputies, Senators and so on in accordance with the national agreement.  There was a very difficult and bitter debate.  There were numerous amendments.  I think it was at the instance of the then Taoiseach, who saw that the whole situation was getting out of hand and that the then Minister for Finance was making the position far worse than it need have been, that proposals were brought forward to increase the allowance for the Opposition in line with the other increases, but it was accompanied by allowances which had up to then never existed for parties in Government.  It was very grudging acknowledgment of the need to pay any money to a party in Opposition.  I am contrasting that attitude with the great concern now being expressed by Deputy B. Desmond and others on this topic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I hesitate to be positive because I am not sure whether there was an increase which <Col N="725" /> was related to a national pay agreement. One would have to find out when was the last pay increase and when was the first national pay agreement. I think that was the right approach.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kelly made one point on which I must follow him up.  He said that when the Coalition Government came into office there was no Bill from the previous Dáil worth bringing forward and that the Coalition brought forward no previous legislation that had fallen with the Dáil.  I referred him to the Bill which set up the Department of the Public Service and he repeated that no Bill had been brought forward.  The Bill which set up the Department of the Public Service was technically a new Bill in the new Dáil of 1973.  However, it was an exact repeat of the Bill which had previously been introduced by me as Minister for Finance but it had one amendment; a subsection number which had appeared in error in one section was removed in the new Bill. That was the only change.  I mention that because Deputy Kelly made a great issue of this, and because of his former position as Whip one would be inclined to accept that he knew what he was talking about.  The only reason I interrupted him, as I said at the time, was that if he wanted to introduce this type of thing I wanted him to be factual and he was not being factual.</P>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald raised the question of the Council of Defence.  The Council of Defence does not meet frequently but it could be an important institution in certain events.  At the moment the post of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence is filled by the same person who is Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach. Of course, the same procedure can be followed in the case of Ministers of State.  Deputy FitzGerald raised the point of whether it is necessary to have this provision, that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach or his successor as Minister of State must be a member of the Council of State.  I will look into that point. I do not think it is of major importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald also asked why <Col N="726" /> we should make all existing Parliamentary Secretaries Ministers of State. Why not have three tiers, that is Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries and Ministers of State; or indeed four tiers in the sense that he talked about parliamentary private secretaries who would be on pay.  There is a strong case for avoiding over-elaborate structures in a small country.  If we were to create these various grades, which in effect would be three grades of junior Ministers, the whole thing would become very complicated in a small country and a small Parliament such as ours.  It seems simpler and more workable as a system to increase the number of junior Ministers and to increase the powers and responsibilities of each of them.  It has seemed to the Government that that balance is the best approach that can be taken to this problem.  The creation of a multiplicity of junior ministerial positions seems to be a complicating factor which is not going to help in solving the problem that we set out to solve.  The position can be reviewed in the future in the light of experience, as can any system.  I do not think that the appointment of parliamentary private secretaries would require legislation. This matter can be looked at, but we would hope that the proposals in this Bill will meet the problems we are trying to deal with.  We do not envisage changing the system in the short-term but I cannot rule out any possibility of change.  We think this should be sufficient to meet the problems we are tackling.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. Barry raised an interesting point in regard to section 6 of the Bill.  He raised the question of the repeal of section 8 of the Ministeries and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1939, which provided that a Parliamentary Secretary who was a Member of one House of the Oireachtas should have the right to attend and be heard in the other House.  In the case of members of the Government Article 28.8º provides:</P>
    <P> Every member of the Government shall have the right to attend and be heard in each House of the Oireachtas. </P>
    <P>The Constitution provides for a member <Col N="727" /> of the Government the right to attend and be heard in either House of the Oireachtas.  In the case of Parliamentary Secretaries, not only is no such right given by the Constitution but Article 15.10º specificially provides:</P>
    <P> Each House shall make its own rules and standing orders ....</P>
    <P>In fact, the Standing Orders of each House provide that a Parliamentary Secretary who is a member of the other House may be heard in that House.  It is Standing Order No. 56 of this House and Standing Order 45 in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that since the Constitution provides that each House may make its own rules and Standing Orders section 8 of the 1939 Act, which purported to give a Parliamentary Secretary a right of audience in the House of which he was not a member was in conflict with the Constitution since it would interfere with the right of that House to make its own rules and Standing Orders on the matter as provided for in Article 15 of the Constitution.  The parliamentary draftsman agrees that there is some substance in this argument, in other words, that section 8 of the 1939 Act may well have been unconstitutional and purported to give power which it could not give.</P>

While this is not a contentious Bill, nevertheless we should have a careful and close look at it when the opportunity presents itself.</P>
      <P>In section 1 which is the definition section, I see that &ldquo;member state&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;(except in Rule 47 (1) of the first Schedule) means a Member State of the European Communities.&rdquo; I have had a look at Rule 47 (1) and I am not entirely clear what the difference is in the definition of &ldquo;member state&rdquo; in section 1 and in Rule 47 (1).  It occurs to me that perhaps &ldquo;member state&rdquo; as defined in section 1 means any one of the nine member states, and that &ldquo;member state&rdquo; in Rule 47 (1) means any one of the nine member states with the exception of Ireland.  I am not exactly certain that is what it means, and I should like the Minister to tell me whether I am right or wrong in that assumption.</P>

I have given a little time to trying to find out what the difference is and, more particularly, I should like to know what the significance of the difference is.  I think the difference is that in the Bill in general &ldquo;member state&rdquo; means any one of the nine <Col N="731" /> member states, and in Rule 47 (1) it means any one of the eight member states, Ireland being excluded.

I want to go on record as saying I disagree with that system.  I believe it is wrong that the postal franchise should be extended wholesale to everybody who has any sort of reason for availing of it.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate that means a hardship for some people.  I fully appreciate that, by not extending the procedure for postal voting beyond the Garda and the Army, there will be some hard luck cases, and some perfectly <i>bona fide</i> people will find it impossible to vote.  On the other hand, the system which applied in the local government elections is so wide open to wholesale abuses, and is so blatantly abused, that it is highly undesirable.

Under the system applicable in local government elections at the moment, a person who is going away from home for any reason, or who thinks he may be away from home, can apply for a postal vote.

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): This section is difficult to follow in the sense that it applies certain sections of the Electoral Act of 1963 to this Bill.  I would like the Minister to confirm that I am right in thinking that section 3 is invoking the machinery of the 1963 Electoral Act to compile the electors' list for the purpose of this Act, and extending it. At the moment the electors' list contains the names of the people who are entitled to vote at Dáil elections and referenda.  They simply appear without any description after them; then there is another category in it who are entitled to vote at local government elections; and there used <Col N="734" /> to be a third category in it who were liable to serve on juries.  I think the Juries Act did away with the description of people who were liable to serve on juries.  Am I correct in thinking that the only difference that will appear in the Register of Electors which comes out on the 14th April each year is that we will now have a third category who will be described as European Assembly electors, with EAE or something like that after their names?  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  This section proposes that the registration procedures laid down in the Electoral Act, 1963, for domestic elections will also apply to the registration of electors for Assembly elections.  What will happen in practice is that there will not be a separate register, but the people entitled to vote at the Assembly elections will be identified on the existing register by means of a distinguishing letter.  In fact, for convenience it is proposed that the persons not entitled to vote at Assembly elections will be identified by having a letter or symbol placed opposite their names. There are about 12,000 electors on the register who are not Irish citizens.  It is expected that the bulk of these are nationals of one or other of the member states and will, therefore, be entitled to vote at Assembly elections.  It will not be necessary to compile a separate register.  It will be necessary to amend the existing regulations relating to registration of electors to provide for this and some other amendments arising from the Juries Act, 1976, and the Local Elections Act, 1972.  These regulations will have to be approved in draft by each House of the Oireachtas before they can be made.  The draft regulations will be brought before the House very shortly.</P>

    <P>I presume the polling station will be allotted to the person concerned by his name appearing on that portion of the register which applies to a certain polling station.  If, however, one looks at Rule 36, which deals with persons employed by the returning officer, one sees that these persons are entitled to vote in places other than the place where they would normally vote, provided they have a certificate from the returning officer.  If somebody raises this in a technical way there could be some confusion between section 5 (1) and Rule 36.  Since reference is made in section 4 to Rule 47 I think reference should be made in section 5 to Rule 36.  How is a polling station allotted to an elector?  Is it allotted by his name appearing on the relevant portion of the register or is it allotted to him by the returning officer giving him a certificate?  At worst, for the purpose of removing doubts or ambiguities section 5 should be referred to.

I am sure there is some machinery in the Bill whereby, if you link up with various sections, you will arrive indirectly at the minimum notice which must be given.  It would be much cleaner and tidier to specify in this section, notwithstanding what may have been written into previous sections dealing with other types of elections, the length of notice which must be given.  In other words, the order should specify that the election shall be held not sooner than such a date and not later than such a date.

Is it proposed to hold the count in the different constituencies in the normal places with which we are all familiar in local and general elections? Supposing the Government of the day decided this election would be held in conjunction with the local elections, the purpose being to make sure there would be a good turnout, there could be a mix-up of ballot papers and both elections would be invalidated if counting were going on in two different areas.  Has the Minister made any provision to prevent that kind of accident? There is, too, the question of the payment to the presiding officers, poll clerks, counting staff and so on.  Will funds be made available from Europe to carry on this election over the whole <Col N="740" /> Community?  If so, because of the interest shown in the Press and elsewhere in the salaries of European Deputies elected as a result of this election, I wonder will the people working on this election be paid proportionately higher than for the normal election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It is becoming clear to me now for the first time really why it is so difficult for anybody to say when a by-election will be held in relation to the order made for the moving of the writ.  It should be a simple date to establish but very few people can tell you right away.  The explanation lies in the weird type of language used in the sections to fix the date.  I suggest that if anybody were given section 6 of this measure, entitled &ldquo;Polling day and commencement of count,&rdquo; he would not know from reading the section when the election would be held.  One would think that the first thing you could ascertain from an order directing an election would be the period in which the election would be held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not blame the Minister for this because it follows precedent but frequently a time comes when it is well to depart from precedent and come back to simplicity.  The Minister referred me to section 24 of the <Col N="741" /> Electoral Act of 1963 which is really more complicated.  It says:</P>
    <P>A poll at a Dáil election&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) shall be taken on such day as shall be appointed by the Minister by order, being a day during the period which consists of the nine days (disregarding any excluded days) next following the period which consists of the seven days (disregarding any excluded days) next following the last day for receiving nominations, </P>
    <P>There must be some simpler language than that jargon for fixing a date and conveying the information to Members of the Oireachtas and the country.  I do not blame anybody because there is a habit of following precedents and perpetuating that sort of jargon.  Even section 20 here means nothing because you have to get other sections and study the lot together to find out what it means.  The section I have read is an appalling one.</P>
    <P>There is nothing contentious about this.  I know it was a section that was in the Bill which we circulated, that the Minister's predecessor circulated, but that does not excuse the formula laid down for fixing a date.  Doubtless there are people in the Department so skilled in this sort of language that they could take up the section and say: &ldquo;The election must be held between such and such dates.&rdquo;  Why not write into the section in plain language that the Minister shall make an order?  The formula I suggest is: The Minister shall make an order fixing a date which shall be not sooner than so many days after the order has appeared in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and not more than so many days after it.  Then anybody would know, whether an elector, a learned legal man or a mountainy attorney like myself, when the election would be held.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Deputy says about simplifying the language to make it more easily understood. But as I said already, it has worked well in the local elections and the people must have got what was meant from the working in a clear manner.  However, I am prepared to <Col N="742" /> consider this and see if it is possible, if there are no serious implications, to have the wording reconsidered.</P>

They accepted this as an act of faith and waited for the magic day to be announced in some publication or advertisement.  I am not disclosing any party secrets when I say that when a by-election occurs it is very hard to get anybody, even when the writ is moved, to tell you before the order is made when the election must be held.  It must be held within so many days of the writ being moved.  The reason nobody knows when is this type of jargon handed down from generation to generation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan</i>): In this section it is stated that a person who is not eligible to become a member of Dáil Éireann shall not be eligible for election under this measure to the Assembly.  That is perfectly clear.  And a person who shall be eligible for election to Dáil Éireann, as laid down in the Constitution, is every citizen without distinction of sex who has reached the age of 21 years and who is not placed under disability or incapacity by the Constitution or by law.  Therefore, we are determining that only a citizen of Ireland shall be eligible to be a candidate. I am not saying whether or not I agree with this, but that is what we are laying down.  The Constitution is <Col N="743" /> consistent.  Article 16 (2º) of the Constitution says that:</P>
      <P> Every citizen without distinction of sex who has reached the age of eighteen years who is not disqualified by law and complies with the provisions of the law relating to the election of members of Dáil Éireann, shall have the right to vote at an election for members of Dáil Éireann. </P>
      <P>Subject to correction, the position is that in Dáil elections one must be a citizen either to be a candidate or to vote.  In this Bill one must be a citizen to be a candidate, because it relates back to the Dáil qualification, but one need not be a citizen in order to vote. A person can vote if he is a citizen of this State or of any member state of the Community residing here.  There seems to be a conflict here and this needs to be teased out.  One relevant consideration is whether the other member states who have introduced legislation for the members, are proceeding on the same basis as we are.</P>

      <P> The Register of Political Parties for the purposes of section 13 of the Act of 1963 (in this section subsequently referred to as &ldquo;the Registrar&rdquo;) shall, subject to the subsequent provisions of this section, register in the Register of Political Parties as a party organised to contest an Assembly election, any political party which applies to him for registration and which is, in his opinion, a genuine political party and organised in the State to contest such an election. </P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) The Oireachtas shall revise the constituencies at least once in every twelve years with due regard to changes in the distribution of the population, but any alteration in the constituencies shall not take effect during the life of the Assembly sitting when such revision is made.</P>
      <P>In relation to Dáil elections the Constitution provides that the constituencies shall be revised by the Oireachtas at least once in every 12 years and that due regard shall be had to the changes in the distribution of population.  It also provides that any alterations in the constituencies shall not take effect during the life of the then current Dáil.  As has already been said, this Bill is non-contentious. It has been described as unique and unusual for one reason or another.  It is unique and unusual in that it is the first Bill to arrange constituencies which was introduced in this House that was not very contentious and that did not lead to a long controversial and angry debate ending in the application of a guillotine motion.  It is unusual and unique because the Second Schedule which arranges the constituencies is the result of the work of an independent commission set up to arrange the constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Compliments were paid to Mr. Justice Walshe and the other two members of the commission for the work they did and for the prompt and expeditious way in which they carried out that work.  I want again to compliment <Col N="746" /> Mr. Justice Walshe of the Supreme Court, the Clerk of the Seanad and the Secretary of the Department of the Environment for the way they tackled the job and for the expeditious manner in which they completed it.  They gave us one set of alternatives that was available.  I think there were at least five or six sets of alternatives that could have been used but the alternative put to the Government by the commission was accepted by the Government and unanimously by this House.  That is the greatest tribute that could have been paid to Mr. Justice Walshe and his two assistants.</P>
    <P>The Constitution provides that Dáil constituencies shall be revised every 12 years.  I assume that the procedure followed for this Bill, that is the handing over of the task to an independent commission, will be followed by all future Governments in regard to revising constituencies, that the days of the long, controversial, angry debate, with allegations and counter-allegations, are over and finished with.  I cannot help repeating that the Fianna Fáil Party were the proper party to set up the commission because they made better use, for their own purposes, of the old fashioned system obtaining over the last 50 years.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I did note&mdash;on reading the Bill we are now discussing in Committee&mdash;that no provision was made for the revision of these constituencies. Amendment No. 1 in my name reads:</P>
    <P> In page 8, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) The Oireachtas shall revise the constituencies at least once in every twelve years with due regard to changes in the distribution of the population, but any alterations in the constituencies shall not take effect during the life of the Assembly sitting when such revision is made&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>It is reasonable to write that provision into this Bill.  The provision in the Constitution for the revision of Dáil constituencies does not apply to these constituencies.  The Constitution is <Col N="747" /> silent on this type of election, just as it is silent on local Government elections. Of course, Europe was far from our thoughts in 1937 and preceding years when the Constitution was being written.  I concede, and the Minister will probably tell me, that the Dáil can revise these constituencies any time it sees fit to do so, or any time the Government see fit to initiate a Bill to amend them.  I appreciate that.  Nevertheless the normal procedure should be that these constituencies be revised every 12 years.  The abnormal thing would be to amend the law to avoid such revision.  Therefore, it is logical and affords protection to accept this amendment and write it into the Bill.</P>
    <P>My amendment also follows precedent&mdash;I know I was critical of precedent in relation to another section&mdash;but, when a precedent is good, I suggest it should be followed and, when it has been proved not to be good, it should be dropped.  We have the precedent of the compulsory revision of Dáil constituencies laid down in the Constitution. Therefore, the omission of this provision for revision in the Bill is an oversight, or perhaps it was omitted because the draftsman thought that it could be that the constituencies could be revised at any time.  If that is the explanation I do not consider it a good one.  The proper thing to do is to write into the Bill that the constituencies shall be revised.</P>

It needs no great argument to convince anybody that the expenses of the election should be borne by the funds which will be administered by the Assembly when it comes into existence. I do not know whether this has been brought up at European level. Certainly these expenses should be discharged by the Council of Europe, or the funds available to it.  When I first saw that the expenses would be <Col N="749" /> paid out of the Central Fund I thought I would have found, elsewhere in the Bill, some provision to the effect that the central fund would be reimbursed in due course.  But that is not so.  It may be something over which this House has no control but certainly it is something that should be raised at European level by our Minister for Foreign Affairs who should make the case that the expenses should be paid out of European funds.  I am speaking from memory and I hope the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I understand the elections cost about £250,000.  I am sure the cost of a general election is much more now.  I feel strongly that this is out of line, that we should not be asked to pay it. Europe should be asked to discharge the bill.</P>

This money is being made available to the information offices of the Commission and the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>In addition, large sums of money are made available to the various groupings to conduct their campaigns throughout the Community and it is reasonable to expect that money would be available to the national states to carry out the actual elections.  There are many expenses involved in holding elections and, as Deputy Fitzpatrick has pointed out, the total is a quite considerable sum.  It would be advisable for the Minister to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to raise this matter at a Council meeting to see if some amount could be got back from the central funds of the Community to go towards the cost of conducting the elections.</P>

He will be obliged to appoint a county registrar for one of the counties of Connacht and Ulster to act as returning officer for the entire constituency.  If the Bill remains as it stands, the person appointed constituency returning officer will also have to carry out the duties of local returning officer.  He will have to carry out the duties of returning officer for his own county.  For example, if the county registrar of Cavan is appointed returning officer for the constituency of Connacht-Ulster he will have to supervise and organise the entire election in the counties of Connacht and Ulster and he will also have local responsibility for Cavan. That is unreasonable.  I do not think the returning officer who acts for the whole constituency could reasonably be expected to act as local returning officer and make a good job of both.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister's amendment confers on a county registrar who is appointed constituency returning officer the right to appoint a deputy for his own constituency.  In other words, if a county registrar for one of the counties of Connacht or Ulster is appointed constituency returning officer, with the Minister's consent he may appoint a deputy returning officer to look after his county.</P>
    <P>That is not acceptable to me.  Under the Bill a county registrar will be asked to act as constituency returning officer and local returning officer.  It is more important to ensure that the duties of a constituency returning officer and a local returning officer are carried out efficiently so that the election is conducted efficiently.  We are all human.  None of us is inclined to underestimate our own ability or capacity for doing a number of jobs. If the Minister's amendment is accepted, we will be relying on the constituency returning officer to be <Col N="752" /> sensible and wise enough to say: &ldquo;It is not possible for me to act as constituency returning officer and local returning officer.  I am going to appoint a deputy&rdquo;.  You could easily get an individual who would take the view: &ldquo;I am going to act as constituency returning officer and I will not have anybody else meddling in my county and doing the work I should be doing or intruding on my preserves. I will act as constituency returning officer and local returning officer and I will see that both jobs are done well&rdquo;.  He might have the best intentions in the world in thinking like that but the results might be&mdash;and I think would be&mdash;that it would not be possible for that person to discharge the duties of constituency returning officer and local returning officer.  That is not done in the presidential election.</P>
    <P>At the presidential election we have the national returning officer, who is usually a senior official in the Department of the Environment, who directs operations from the Custom House. He has working for him a local returning officer in each county or county borough.  The prudent and sensible thing to do is to lay down&mdash;before individual names creep in or before we start dealing in personalities when the order has been made&mdash;that the person who is appointed constituency returning officer will be debarred from acting as local returning officer and that the Minister will appoint a suitably qualified person, as I suggested in the amendment, to be the local returning officer.  Such suitably qualified person could be the chief clerk in the county registrar's office or the secretary of the county council of the constituency.  If we leave it optional, as the Minister proposes, I fear that, and I would not be surprised if personalities would creep in and relations might not be just perfect between the chief clerk and the county registrar, or the secretary of the county council and the county registrar might not be seeing eye to eye.  You could end up with only one officer and perhaps he would not do a good job.  I suggest that the Minister should accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>It has always been the practice with regard to the conduct of elections that the Minister would get involved as little as possible at this level.  In the appointing of a returning officer for the entire constituency for the Assembly elections the Minister would always take into consideration the capacity and integrity of the returning officer and would ensure that the man appointed would be fully capable.</P>
      <P>Under Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment it is mandatory to make the returning officer for a particular county the returning officer for the entire constituency.  Under my amendment it is left to the man's good sense to appoint somebody, with my consent, to fulfil his obligations in his constituency. That is the difference as I see it between the two amendments. Could we reach a compromise on this point on Report Stage?  I would make it mandatory for the returning officer for the entire constituency to appoint a substitute in his own constituency but I would leave it to him, with my consent, to name the person to be appointed.  I would make it mandatory that a man be appointed to do the job in his absence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I think I know what the Minister is thinking.  I must confess I had not carefully read his amendment until now.  This amendment proposes that where a local returning officer is appointed under this section to be the returning officer for a constituency, it shall be lawful for him with the consent of the Minister to appoint a deputy local returning officer for the discharge of all or any particular part of his duties as local returning officer. I would be against giving the returning officer the right to appoint a deputy for all or part of his duties because you will get a conflict between the returning officer and the deputy. You are introducing the very thing I feared&mdash;a clash of personalities and the constituency returning officer giving <Col N="754" /> some of his duties to the deputy and then interfering.  This will make trouble.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is prepared to go as far as making it obligatory on the constituency returning officer to appoint a deputy after consultation with him but in my view it should be a full-blown local returning officer and not a Mickey Mouse one, as is provided in the Minister's amendment.  I concede that human beings, being what they are, the county registrar who becomes the constituency returning officer should have some say in the person to be appointed.  I would be prepared to think seriously about the Minister's suggestion that it should be done on the basis that the constituency returning officer would appoint a local returning officer for his own constituency after consultation with the Minister.  You can do it that way or the other way&mdash;that the Minister would appoint him after consultation with the county registrar concerned.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is prepared to have a serious think about this and that he sees the force of my argument.  I would be strongly of the opinion that whoever is appointed should be a local returning officer within the meaning of the Act.  The Minister's amendment is designed to give the returning officer the power to appoint a deputy for some duties. Therefore, there would be two local returning officers, the constituency returning officer discharging some of the duties of the local returning officer and the local returning officer discharging some of the duties also.  That would be disastrous and would create trouble even if there were not likely to be trouble.</P>

      <P>I have listened both to the Deputy and to the Minister but I should like someone to clarify for me what the section purports to do.  My understanding of the situation is that returning officers for Dáil elections will now become local returning officers for the various Dáil constituencies that comprise a European constituency and that it is intended to elevate one of those local returning officers to be returning officer <Col N="755" /> for the constituency.  What Deputy Fitzpatrick is suggesting is that the person elevated should be replaced by someone who would undertake all the duties in this regard in the Dáil constituency. That seems reasonable and I trust the Minister will accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The main reason for leaving the matter to the returning officer who would be appointed returning officer for the whole constituency is that it has always been considered good practice for the Minister not to get involved to that extent in the running of elections.  This has been an accepted principle in regard to the conduct of elections.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick makes the point that the person appointed should be responsible for all the duties concerned, that otherwise two people could be involved at that level. Assuming that no serious legal complication or anything of that nature arises, I would be prepared on Report Stage to consider seriously an amendment on the lines I have indicated, namely, that it would be mandatory or obligatory on that returning officer on further appointment to appoint, with my consent, a substitute to carry out all the duties concerned.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am obliged to the Minister for that.  He need not fear that a provision of this kind would involve him too deeply in the running of elections.  Under the Bill he is obliged to appoint a national returning officer and to appoint also a returning officer for each constituency.  That will impose on him the duty of selecting from among ten individuals in a constituency and deciding which should be appointed as constituency returning officer. This tiny step further of replacing the constituency returning officer by a local returning officer in his own constituency will not involve the Minister much further in the running of the elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): This is the section that provides for the filling of casual vacancies which occur by reason of the Assembly member finding that he is not eligible to take his seat or that he becomes disqualified during the currency of the term of the Assembly. The provision applies also to the filling of a vacancy in the event of the death of a member.  I agree with the proposal that such vacancies be filled by this House rather than by way of a by-election in the constituency concerned. It is proposed also that the person co-opted be from the same party as that of which the member who caused the vacancy belonged. However, I do not see the reason for the time limit for the party concerned to move within three months.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (b) of subsection (1) refers to &ldquo;the relevant representative&rdquo;.  Presumably he will be the person who dies or who becomes disqualified from holding his seat but &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; is not defined. Consequently, this could lead to argument so I would suggest that in the interest of the removal of doubt and of avoiding ambiguity the word &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; would be defined by saying that &ldquo;the relevant representative shall mean the representative whose death or disqualification caused the vacancy&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been pointed out, it is proposed under this section that casual vacancies be filled by the Dáil.  Where the seat was held by a member of a registered political party it is proposed that the appointment of a person to fill the vacancy will be by way of a nomination from the political party concerned but that where the seat was held by an independent or a non-party candidate, the vacancy will be filled by the Dáil.  In this case there is no provision for nomination by any group or party.  The reason for this is that it is impossible to predict and make provision for the different kinds of situations that could arise.  However, there is no reason for the Dáil, when filling a vacancy created <Col N="757" /> by the death or disqualification of an independent member, not to have regard to the wishes of the group or the interest that the member represented. It would be surprising if the Dáil were not to give some consideration to this aspect of the situation.</P>
      <P>On the other side, it is relatively easy for a group to secure registration as a political party.  Several parties have been registered although they do not attract sufficient support to have a Member elected to this House.  It is difficult to visualise a group who have enough support to win an Assembly seat failing to satisfy the conditions of registration.  If the group did not wish to become involved in domestic politics, they could seek registration in accordance with this Bill for Assembly elections only.  That is the position with regard to vacancies.  It is not unusual. I believe certain countries for a number of years have had this system.  If a by-election occurs because of the death of a member or somebody is absent from the European Parliament or certain international assemblies the party concerned can appoint a Deputy in his absence, but that may not be very good for a Deputy while he is still alive and absent because it might create difficulties.  I understand that something like this obtains in Norway. That is the way it is proposed under this section to fill vacancies and to deal with by-elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P> In Part II, page 29, rule 46, lines 43 to 45, to delete paragraph (4), and substitute the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) The local returning officer shall appoint a place within or convenient to the constituency as the place at which he will open the ballot boxes and arrange the ballot papers in parcels as hereinafter provided and shall at that place so appointed provide suitable accommodation and all furniture and equipment necessary for opening the ballot boxes and arranging of the ballot papers in parcels as aforesaid&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>Section 46 provides :</P>
      <P>At the time fixed for the close of the poll the presiding officer shall take steps to ensure that no further Assembly electors are admitted to the polling station, but any elector on the premises at that time shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be entitled to receive a ballot paper and to vote.</P>
      <P>It goes on to make provision for the closing of the poll and the safe custody of the ballot papers.  Later on in the section it is provided that the local returning officer shall deliver all the ballot papers to the constituency returning officer and that the constituency returning officer shall conduct the count for the entire constituency in one place provided by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of my amendment would be to provide that the local returning officer would retain custody of the ballot papers for his constituency in his constituency, and that he would provide a place within or convenient to that constituency for the opening of the ballot boxes, the checking of the ballot papers, and the arranging of the ballot papers in bundles on the <Col N="765" /> basis of the name of the candidate who received a No. 1 vote on each ballot paper.</P>
    <P>In a nutshell what I propose in my amendment is that the local returning officer in, say, County Cavan, would retain all the ballot boxes for County Cavan in a convenient place there, and he would open the ballot boxes at a time to be laid down in the Minister's order.  He would check the ballot papers against the ballot paper account.  He would then adjudicate on any doubtful papers and he would credit each paper to the candidate in whose favour a No. 1 vote appeared on that ballot paper.  Having done that, he would then forward the ballot papers, which would require only a few boxes, to the constituency returning officer.  The constituency returning officer would take up the count there from the first count on and complete the count.</P>
    <P>If the procedure proposed in the Bill is followed, it will mean that in the constituency of Connacht-Ulster all the ballot boxes will have to be taken from, say, Donegal to Galway or some other place, and every ballot box will have to be taken from each of the eight counties to one place.  There are, I think, about 140 boxes in Cavan.  I imagine there are over 100 in Monaghan, and I would not be surprised if there were 300 or 400 in Donegal.  I imagine there are 300 or 400 in Galway and Mayo, not to mention the other places.  The result will be that it will be necessary to transport over 1,000 ballot boxes from all over this huge constituency&mdash;and there are bigger ones&mdash;to one place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): An enormous staff will have to be recruited in this one place to deal with the first count.  It will not be possible, presumably, to get a trained or experienced staff from within the constituency where the counting will take place.  If not, this staff will have to be transported from long distances to work there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, we all know each county registrar's staff have their own <Col N="766" /> way of doing things, of course within the rules and regulations.  They have been working together for years, and they know how to do the work and they agree.  Now we will have strange staff from different parts of the huge constituency being brought in to work with people they do not know.</P>
    <P>A further point I will have to develop later is that, at the moment, there are at least 1,000 doubtful votes in a small constituency which have to be dealt with or adjudicated on. The county registrar in charge, who is appointed returning officer for this constituency, will have to deal with literally thousands upon thousands of doubtful votes, maybe up to 30,000, and that is a duty he cannot delegate because the same mind will have to give a decision on each vote.  I hate to think how long that will take.</P>
    <P>The method I propose is the method which has been in force for presidential elections here since 1937. It is a system which has worked well where up to the first count is concluded in the local constituency by the local returning officer and, after that, the papers are all sent to the national returning officer.  It may be said in regard to the presidential election that it is not very often that there is a second count because usually there are only two candidates but there has been a second count.  There was a case since 1937 where the issue was decided on the distribution of a third candidate's votes.  That is what I am suggesting here.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together. The Industrial Relations Acts, 1946 to 1976, already include provisions for the reference of disputes, including inter-union disputes, to arbitration. The procedures governing the transfer of members between trade unions and the resolution of disputes in this area are matters for the trade union movement itself.  I expect that the proposed review body on industrial relations will consider these matters.</P>

He gave a similar reply to a question yesterday. Does the Minister agree that the unofficial disputes which have taken place not only in the recent past but over the past number of years are the most serious strikes we have had and the strikes that do most damage?  If so, does he intend to take urgent action to diminish the likelihood of these strikes?</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy regarding the seriousness of such disputes.  In this connection, I want to endorse the recent statement of the Treasurer of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions when he encouraged the trade unions outside of congress to join or rejoin congress where there are laid-down procedures for dealing with such disputes.</P>

      <P>We all know there are procedures within congress.  The question here relates specifically to disputes where unions are not members of congress.  Unfortunately, in the Ferenka dispute this is the case.  There has been a similar experience with the NBU.  I am asking the Minister, is it good enough to say this is mainly for the trade unions themselves when the problem is manifestly one of a breakdown between trade unions and one, in particular, of certain unions feeling that they cannot belong to congress? Would the Minister therefore consider setting up some machinery to conciliate and arbitrate in this kind of dispute?</P>

      <P>The Minister is keeping an eye on the situation and it is under review like so much else with this Government, but as I have asked the Minister already, would he even seek the trade unions' views on setting up conciliation and arbitration machinery which could be used when inter-union unofficial disputes take place especially where such disputes involve unions which are not, for one reason or another, members of congress? As the Minister knows, in the Ferenka disputes there are no direct talks going on between the parties, and the strike is now five weeks old.  If there was conciliation and arbitration machinery perhaps talks could have started four weeks ago.</P>

I am sure he is also aware that the apprenticeship intake over the last three years averaged from 12 to 20.  This year it is up to about 35.  A number of years back it was in the region of 100.  The message I am conveying to the Deputy is that the decline in the number is indicative of the unemployment and redundancy in the printing trade and, consequently, trade unions in that trade like trade unions in other trades will be reluctant to consider applications for membership until such time as their out-or-work members are re-employed.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that these may not necessarily be as well qualified or as good in terms of doing the job as people looking for work and not being enabled to compete? Is he as concerned as I would be about ensuring the right of equal opportunity to compete?  I appreciate the unemployment position but what about equality of opportunity to compete?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, Which came into operation on 31st December 1975, gives women in all sectors of employment a legal entitlement to equal pay.  Explanatary leaflets for employers and employees giving gen eral guidance about the provisions of the legislation have been issued and given wide distribution by my Department.</P>
      <P>It is open to a woman who believes she is entitled under law to equal pay to make a claim on the employer, either directly or through her trade union.  Where a claim to equal pay is disputed the Act provides that the dispute may be referred by either party to an equality officer for investigation and recommendation.  Either party may appeal subsequently to they Labour Court against an equality officer's recommendation.</P>
      <P>An important function of the Employment Equality Agency.  which came into operation on 1st October last, is to keep under review the working of the 3equal pay legislation and, whenever it thinks it necessary, to make proposals to me for amending the Act.  I can assure that Deputy that any such proposals would be very carefully considered by me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of workers not protected by trade unions, there is provision which empowers the Employment Equality Agency themselves to refer cases to an equality officer for investigation where it might not be reasonable to expect the employee to make <Col N="774" /> the reference, for example, for fear of reprisal by an employer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Equality for women in employment is provided for in (a) The Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, which gives a legal entitlement to equal pay for like work, and (b) The Employment Equality Act, 1977, which makes it unlawful to discriminate on grounds of sex or marital status in regard to recruitment for employment, working conditions and in access to training and promotional opportunities.</P>
      <P>Under the 1977 Act the Employment Equality Agency have been established and came into operation on 1st October, 1977.  An important function of the agency is to keep under review the working of the Acts of 1974 to 1977 and, whenever they think it necessary, to make proposals to me for amending either or both of these Acts.  Any such proposals would be very carefully considered by me.</P>
      <P>There are provisions in existing legislation which restrict the employment of women&mdash;for example, night work in industrial employment is prohibited under the Conditions of Employment Acts, 1936.  I am empowered, under the Act of 1977, to repeal of amend by order such restrictive provisions on receipt of a recommendation from the Employment Equality Agency and following consultations with the employers' and workers' organisations.</P>

      <P>Provisions of the kind referred to by the Deputy are contained in the Condition Employment Act, 1936, the Shops (Conditions of Employment ) Act, 1938, The Factories Acts, 1955 and the Mines and Quarries Act, 1965.  Some of these are based on obligation entered into on the ratification of ILO conventions, for example, Convention No. 89 which forbids the employment of women on industrial work after midnight and before 5 a.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Employment Equality Act, 1977, I am empowered to repeal or amend by order any provision in certain protective legislation. The Act also provides that the Employment Equality Agency who came into operation on 1st October, may review, or if requested by me, shall review any provisions of such protective legislation In the course of such review the agency must consult with the employer and worker organisations concerned and <Col N="780" /> they may make recommendation for amendment.  I propose to await the arecommendations of the agency in the matter.</P>

      <P>The Equality officers have, to date, issued 17 recommendations under the Anti-Discriminations (Pay) Act, 1974.  They have so far not dealt with any cases under the Employment Equality Act, 1977.</P>
      <P>The Labour Court has heard nine appeals against the equality officers' recommendations in equal pay disputes and has made determinations in four or these nine cases.  In two of these determinations the court has upheld the equality officer's recommendations and in the other two it has upheld the appeals.  It has not yet made determinations in the other five cases.</P>
      <P>The hearing and determination of appeals from recommendations of the equality officers is a statutory function of the Labour court by virtue of section 8 of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and section 21 of the Employment Equality Act, 1977.  There is provision whereby such determinations may be appealed to the High Court on a point of law.</P>

It should be noted that the Act, which has been in operation since July last only, permits persons between 14 and 15 years to do a limited amount of light non-industrial work.

      <P>What sort of people make complaints?  If I may be allowed to explain, I ask that question because I believe the problem is much greater than is indicated in the reply due to many school children going to work of their own volition. They are not being exploited or do not see themselves being exploited by employers but they go before they are 15 years of age.  It is not the sort of thing that would be reported by many people.  Will the Minister take any action to see if there is an extensive problem and if he will then consider what action can be taken to remedy it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister is observing the implementation of the Act very closely but might I point out that there is an amazing social problem in the larger urban areas, not through the exploitation of youth but in cases where young lads previously could do certain work and now find they cannot do this?  As a result, they have nothing to do; they want money and they get it in other ways.  The Minister who initiated the <Col N="783" /> Act meant well as did all of us but it is having this amazing effect and causing a great social problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the extent of the problem or is he more concerned with making capital or scoring political points?  Is he going to do anything about this, about investigating the real extent of the problem or is he going to depend on individual reports which will obviously not be nearly as frequent as actual abuses of the Act?</P>

      <P>I am trying to be as helpful as possible.  It is not a very easy situation.  Problems have been raised that were not previously brought to my attention but any submissions made to me will be examined.  As regards the exploitation of the under-15 workers, it is my intention to examine closely the areas that are not covered at present by the industrial inspectorate. These areas will be my main concern as they are more open to abuse. The Deputies in this House have the duty to assist the Minister and the Department in that respect, if he receives any complaints.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of lthe Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 23  together. The Fianna Fáil election manifesto undertook to treat the reduction of the pupil/teacher ratio in primary schools as a top priority, particularly in disadvantaged areas, and immediately to set about reducing all classes to 40 with a final objective of 32.  The Deputies will be aware of the proposals which have already been made in this matter and the difficulties which have arisen.  I shall be making a further statements on this at an early date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty is that there are some later question in respect of the Minister's old plan.  Has the Minister an alternative plan to the emergency one he introduced in <Col N="791" /> respect of the attempt to provide courses for graduates so that they might help him in his attempts to reduce the size of classes?  Has he any other proposals?  Can he say when he will be in a position to make those proposals public?  When he says &ldquo;a short time&rdquo; what does he mean? Does he mean weeks, Months years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad the Deputy asked that supplementary question because a newspaper report indicated that I had not met any of those trainee graduates.  The report is wrong; I did meet them and I will have further contacts with them in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

Could he indicate what he means by within a few years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have more respect for the intelligence of the Deputy than to attribute to him that he does not understand the question he asked.  I was asked the question regarding the pupil/ teacher ratio in primary schools in each county and county borough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education the teacher/pupil ratio in (i) primary, (ii) secondary, and (iii) tertiary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The average teacher/ pupil ration in primary schools is 1 : 30.7.  The teacher/pupil ratio approved for secondary schools for the current school year is 1:19.  In the case of vocational schools the teaching staff are allocated to each vocational education committee on the basis of one teacher for every 16.5 pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the second-level schools the rations exclude the principal, vice-principal and guidance teacher, <Col N="796" /> in the schools where enrolment exceeds 250 pupils.  In tertiary education, there is no formal staff/student ration prescribed and having regard to the variety of institutions and courses involved the calculation of such a ratio would not be meaningful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain the difference between the ratios in secondary schools and in vocational schools?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister knows the reason why the ratios are different in those schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the reason the ratio is now one for every 16.5 pupils in the vocational schools.  It is because I reduced it to that.  I know also why it is 1:19 in secondary schools.  It is because I reduced it to that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course we will give credit to the Minister where he does good work.  That is not the question I asked.  I asked for his explanation for the difference in the ratio for secondary schools and for vocational schools.  It was a straigthforward question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It will get a straightforward answer.  The distinction was in existence before I reduced the ratio. I reduced by one in each case.  Now it stands at 16.5:1 and 19:1.  I imagine that originally the advantage went to vocational schools.  They probably had more difficulty in the actual teaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the mathematical differences; I can see them for myself.  Will the Minister not agree that as the vocational schools sector has expanded and is now on a par with secondary schools there should be more equilibrium in the two ratios at the lower level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting that I raise the ratio for vocational schools to 19:1?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, there are woodwork and metalwork subjects as well as other subjects taught in vocational schools so that classes have to be broken up into smaller units.  That is one part of the problem.  I said there was more difficulty in dealing with vocational teaching.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get it on the record that it was a previous Fianna Fáil Minister who did that. The Minister has told us that he reduced the ratio in both secondary and vocational schools since he took up office.  Can he tell the House how many graduates have been employed as a result?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will put down a question I will get the information for him.  I presume he means teachers in both sectors?  I do not think the statistics are compiled as yet but in any event it has nothing to do with this question.</P>

      <Col N="831" />&ldquo;(a)  to prepare and publish general estimates of public expenditure, both capital and current, and to relate such estimates to the growth of national resources and to the estimated growth of Government revenue; to describe the policies by which the Government's economic and social objectives can be achieved, and to indicate the expected impact on the growth of national output and employment of Government economic and social policies over the next five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Without being niggling about this, it partly contains what I suggested in paragraph (b) of my amendment, but it leaves out the kernel of the point we had been trying to make this morning, that is, the second part of paragraph (b):</P>
      <P>and to review the implementation of any economic and social plan adopted by the Government and to lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas the results of this review: </P>
      <P>This in essence is what we were trying to establish this morning.  Leaving aside personalities, if it is agreed on all sides that a Minister for Economic Planning and Development should be established, we are trying to make him answerable in this House at reasonably regular intervals.</P>
      <P>When the new Minister was here this morning he referred to the straitjacket. There is nothing in the wording of this amendment that would suggest a straitjacket.  All we are seeking to do is to have him establish a plan or a set of indicators, and the projections on which they are based, draw them up in the form of a document which will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and then debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's amendment is an improvement on section 2 as it stands, and for that reason I would support it.  Although it does not meet all I want in the Bill, it goes a short way towards satisfying me.  It gives this section the muscle it requires. If my amendments are accepted, I think they would improve the Bill still further.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry referred to my amendment No. 6 when he referred to laying the outline plan before the House of the Oireachtas.  This would carry the Minister's amendment a little further and would satisfy Deputy Barry and go a little further towards satisfying me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Pattison and Deputy Barry regard my amendment as an improvement.  We can deal with that procedurally before we conclude the debate on these amendments.  As regards going further, I am afraid I cannot do so.  I have <Col N="833" /> been over this ground at some length and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development also went over this ground at considerable length this morning.  He made a very reasonable case for not accepting the suggestion which in one form or another is being put forward by both Deputies.</P>
      <P>The practical political situation as outlined by the Minister suggests that it would not be any advantage to have this requirement included.  As he pointed out, if the material involved to be laid before the House was worth while, you can be pretty sure that any Government would want to lay it before the House.  If on the other hand it were not worth while and there was this statutory requirement, then something would be laid before the House and you would get what the Minister described as cottonwool.  I do not think this is any advantage as far as the House is concerned.</P>
      <P>It would not advance either the concept or practice of planning.  As the Minister said, what really counts is how the Minister and the Department go about their work and whether they do it effectively.  If they do it effectively there will be a worthwhile plan, or a review of the implementation of a plan will be available.  One can take it that in the normal way, whatever Government were in power, they would ensure that it came before the House.  If it is not worth while nothing is gained by this statutory requirement which of course would be complied with.  As I said, a report which the Minister called cotton wool will not help the House or the implementation of the planning process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies opposite are exaggerating the situation in which they visualise the possibility that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development would be virtually a fugitive from this House, will have nothing to say, nothing to put before the House and would be endeavouring to keep out of the way of Deputies.  As Deputy Barry said, we are not talking about particular personalities here but about the office of the Minister.  Any office holder of a position in which he had to do that would not last very long and would be one of the weakest links in <Col N="834" /> any Government.  The practical politics of the situation suggest that nothing is gained by having this mandatory statutory requirement.  On the other hand if the position transpired to be as the Deputies envisage&mdash;they admit that they are thinking of an extreme case&mdash;either the Minister concerned would be changed very quickly or the post would be abolished on the grounds that the effort at planning had not worked.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Deputies to consider the position in that light when I think they would conclude that what I am saying is an accurate representation of the practical position.  In those circumstances they should be able to find it possible to agree that the Bill as drafted will be adequate for the purpose assuming that the Minister and the Department are adequate for the purpose.  I am not speaking of the present Minister but of whichever Minister would be in the office at any time.  Consequently I consider the Bill as drafted to be far more suitable to the requirements we are trying to meet than the suggested amendment which would have the effect of imposing an obligation which would be carried out, regardless of whether the obligation is in the Bill.  If the obligation is in the Bill and if there is nothing worth while to report we would have a load of cotton wool before the House as a result of which nobody would be any better off.</P>

      <P>As the Minister's amendment is in the process of being printed I shall read, for the benefit of the Deputies, the copy I have here.  It is as follows:</P>
      <P> In page 2, subsection (2), lines 26 and 27, to delete from and including &ldquo;to review&rdquo; in line 26 down to and including &ldquo;State&rdquo; in line 27 and to substitute &ldquo;to identify in consultation with the Departments of State and to review and appraise the plans and activities of such Departments&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am agreeable to discussing it with the amendment before us.  But we are merely going over the same ground repeatedly.  I am not sure whether there is much benefit in continuing because the two Ministers have set their minds against coming in here for the purpose of having the plans discussed.  I do not mean that in any coat-trailing sense but they have decided that the Minister should not have to do this.  However, the more I hear from them on this issue, the more convinced I am of the necessity for such provision.  The Minister for the Public Service has just repeated an argument advanced by his colleague this morning who said that if the plan was good the Government would be <Col N="836" /> anxious to have it debated but that in the event of a plan turning out to be bad there would be nothing but cottonwool to be placed before the House.  That is the point.  I am anxious that the cottonwool situation, too, would be subject to the scrutiny of the House thereby giving us the opportunity of exposing the plan for what it was.</P>
      <P>Of course in the event of a plan being good there would be a rush of Ministers to the House to tell us the great boys they were and to point to whatever they had achieved.  In the event of a plan not working out the Minister would not be a fugitive from this House in the sense that he would be avoiding it deliberately but if responsibility for the failure of a plan rested primarily with errors of judgment on the part of the Minister in drawing up the plan, both he and the Government should be obliged to come here and account for their stewardship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept fully that the Minister should come into the House, that there should be discussion and debate on the various policies or plans that are formulated. As I made clear this morning, I favour as Deputy Barry favours, a greater flow of information and more informed debate both in this House and with the public generally on these matters but I am trying to distinguish between debate here and a commitment in legislation to publish documents known as plans or anything else.  I do not believe that a legislative requirement to publish what is contained in documents, specified or otherwise, at time intervals adds anything either to the effectiveness of the Department or to the powers of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in some disagreement with the Minister.  If there is not this provision, the House&mdash;I am speaking here of the Government backbenchers and all the Opposition&mdash; would not know on what basis the Government were operating.  How could they know what figures were involved unless the figures were published by the Government and laid before the House?  The amendment refers to a review of the plans and activities of the <Col N="837" /> Department but we shall want to know what these plans and activities are and to know what conclusions the Minister reaches in regard to them so that we will have an opportunity either of agreeing or disagreeing with them, as the case might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider the Minister to be doing himself a disservice by referring so frequently to the probability of nothing but cottonwool coming from the Department.  I am glad that it was the Minister who used the phrase first because he is liable to become known as the &ldquo;Minister for cottonwool&rdquo;.  We would hope that there would not be periods during which the Minister would have nothing but cottonwool to offer.  The Minister seems to be afraid that this will be the situation.  That should not happen, and one way of ensuring that it will not happen is to provide that plans be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas at least annually or at most at some interval which would not go far beyond 12 months.</P>
      <P>One point that the Ministers are missing is that there is an Opposition here consisting of two parties who may be able to help the Minister and the Government out of their cottonwool position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be any more necessary to have a debate in this House in a cottonwool situation than it would be in any other situation.  I ask that the amendment contested on these lines be accepted so that we can have a debate.  Without that the Ministers are inadvertently admitting that they have not full confidence in what they are about to do, that the task might defeat them, and they might not want to bring that out into the open. It would be a very good thing if that were brought out into the open because we would have to assume that when the Department would not have a plan or would not be up-to-date that would be a period of cottonwool, a period of silence.</P>

      <P>With respect to Deputy Pattison, I must distinguish between the concern for myself and for the Minister for the Public Service.  In our references to the draft legislation we have drawn rightly a distinction between any present office-holders and the laying down of a framework which will apply to all future office-holders.  I am happy about my own position.  I am not worried about being in the cottonwool position&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that I am not and that is why I made the point deliberately this morning. Since we cannot really envisage what will happen in the future, I said that, looking backwards over history&mdash; it does not matter whether it is relatively recent history or whether we are talking about this country or other countries&mdash;we all know there have been periods in the affairs of Government when for a variety of reasons they did not wish to have too much information or discussion about their then policies, plans and so forth.  I was then making the point that I did not see how trying to write in some sort of general requirement to publish specified documents&mdash; to be called for simplicity plans&mdash; would add one iota to the effectiveness of this House.  I have made it clear that I am interested in seeing this House become as effective as possible.  We all know that Governments are just like other organisations.  We know that business firms do it, that trade unions can do it, that the media themselves can do it, that any group is quite capable of putting out documents to meet any requirement of the day, whether the document is called an annual report, the report of a working party or a subcommittee, or anything else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It had an abrasive effect. I return to my point <Col N="839" /> again.  Looking at the question of how one brings about a more informed and effective consideration of Government policy-making and implementation of plans and so forth, I do not believe that the simple requirement to publish any bit of paper is going to add one iota to it.  I agree entirely that there should be the fullest, most effective debate of these matters in the House.  I said twice this morning that any proposals of that nature which were brought forward are worth valid consideration.  I ventured as my opinion that they were part of the more general conduct of the affairs of the House and did not apply only to debates on bits of paper called plans.</P>
      <P>We ought not to digress.  If there are any views as to how Opposition parties can be given a more effective role in debating the activities of Government, let us look at them.  If they can be made to apply specifically to the activities of my Department I would welcome them.  I see as a problem in its own right how this House organises its business and conducts it in a manner which ensures that the Opposition have, firstly adequate access to information, and secondly adequate opportunities to debate the activities of Government in the light of that information. I have lots of views on that but they are not altogether appropriate to this afternoon's discussion.  However I would like to see it looked at in that context, and hence I come back to my basic point that, if the affairs of the House are organised in such a way that Opposition parties have adequate opportunities, then we will be able to debate things effectively.  If they are not so organised then the Government of the day, whoever they may be, will be able to indulge in the cottonwool business as before.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(i)  To publish annually a comprehensive series of economic and social indicators relevant to economic and social planning.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effectiveness of this amendment is somewhat diminished by the defeat of amendment No.5 and amendment Nos. 6 and 7 not being moved. Nevertheless if this amendment is accepted it will help discussion on the overall situation and it will ensure that <Col N="841" /> up-to-date statistical and other information relevant to planning would be available as far as possible in a form suitable for Members of this House, other commentators and the public at large.  I think that public discussion and involvement in planning is ruled out by the rejection of the other amendments but nevertheless there is a need for this kind of information to be made available so that Members of this House and of the Seanad are up-to-date with all the information. All planning discussions require an element of agreed statistical data as a start.  The statistical information is increasingly being made available but is still far from satisfactory.  The kind of information which should be readily available and be compiled annually into some document is information under the headings of social economic trends, demographic trends, social indications and also comparative international data.  Those type of statistics are vital in the discussions which will be held in relation to planning.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance publish an annual review which should be incorporated in a planning document. That annual review is more appropriate to the Department of Economic Planning and Development.  The National Economic and Social Council in Report No. 17, &ldquo;Statistics for Social Policy&rdquo;, on page 73, chapter 10, paragraph 10.4 (vi) states:</P>
    <P> A report should be published at least annually, containing the main statistics concerned with social development. There are a number of models for this type of report in other countries.  Such a report would inevitably be somewhat patchy, at least in the beginning.  However, as more information becomes available the initial gaps could be filled.  The ultimate aim should be the publication of a report which catalogues in as comprehensive a manner as possible the progress being made by social policies and their cost and which interprets the statistics in a way which is easily understood by non-competitors. </P>
    <P>In Report No. 25 of the NESC, in page 5, paragraph 1.1 of Chapter I it states: <Col N="842" />  This country has no comprehensive set of social statistics.  There is no Government procedure for periodic stocktaking of the social state of the nation. </P>
    <P>This is the kind of vacuum my amendment intends to fill.  The various arguments which relate to the need for consultation and involvement are also applicable to the question of statistical information.  Understanding and appreciation of the facts are crucial ingredients in any planning system.</P>
    <P>It is essential that a special effort be made to tailor statistical data to the precise needs of the planning system. The question of public statistics, including the speed at which they are made available and their comparability to international data, should be looked at by the new Department.  This is a very important area for that Department. There should be a more speedy publication of the statistics relating to the various trends and indications that I have mentioned.  If that information is readily available and up-to-date it should be possible to have a greater appreciation and understanding of the decisions that will be made by the Department and the kind of influences that will motivate those decisions.  I hope the Minister will accept my amendment.  It does not materially change the other functions of the new Department.  It adds a little bit of strength to the functions and also improves what has not been a very perfect state of affairs as far as vital statistical information is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of economic and social statistics and indicators will be promoted by the new Department as part of its general functions to promote and co-ordinate economic and social planning for the economy.  However, the development of a comprehensive series of economic and social indicators is a very substantial task in which the new Department will have a promotional co-ordinating role so that it will not duplicate the activities proper to other Departments and public service institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Finance and the Central Statistics Office already compile <Col N="843" /> what has been described by the NESC as a reasonably comprehensive set of economic indicators widely acceptable as reliable.  In the report already referred to by Deputy Pattison, towards a Social Report, Report No. 25, the council have done valuable preliminary work on the development of social indicators.  It will be a task of the new Department to ensure that the statistical base for planning is adequate for the needs of the planning system.</P>
    <P>However, I want to suggest to the Deputy that it would be quite unwise at this stage to lay it down in legislation that the Department should produce and must produce a comprehensive series of indicators.  In the first place, since perfection cannot be obtained it would be difficult to produce any series which could not be challenged as not being fully comprehensive, and that is what the amendment is calling for.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the production of some of the indicators and statistical series may prove to be more appropriately and effectively done by other agencies, the Department of Finance, the Central Statistics Office and some of the social Department.  I do not think there is any doubt that the requirements of the planning process will cause the new Department to ensure that the statistical base for planning is equal to the needs of the situation, so far as that can be done.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear, if from no other source&mdash;it is clear when one thinks about it&mdash;in this very valuable report from the NESC that the whole question of producing adequate social indicators is a very difficult exercise. It is relatively easy&mdash;and I stress relatively&mdash;to collect statistics concerning particular social services, but it is much less easy to measure their effectiveness over time.  That is pointed out in the report.</P>
    <P>The report went on to produce a collection of statistics and policy developments in a number of social areas, and promised further work towards the development of a social report.  If one thing emerges clearly from the report, it is that the development <Col N="844" /> of reliable social indicators is a task of very great complexity and, indeed, intellectual difficulty.  There are all sorts of nuances which can be argued over for a long time in the production of reliable social indicators.</P>
    <P>I would regard acceptance of this amendment as imposing an obligation on the new Department which probably could never be complied with in the sense of being fully comprehensive, and certainly could not be complied with in the immediate future, because the information is not available and could not be assembled by the new Department in the short term. It is not merely a question of getting hold of the statistics.  There is much more to it than that, as I am sure the Deputy is aware.</P>
    <P>The collection of some of these statistics is already a matter for other Departments and institutions.  As I said, the new Department will have a role in co-ordinating the production of the statistics, but it is extremely doubtful that the actual work of collecting them would be more effectively done if taken out of the existing sources. There may be some cases where this should be done but, in general, it would be quite wrong to suggest they should all be transferred as a responsibility to the new Department.</P>
    <P>For these various reasons it would be very unwise of the House to insert this amendment, the purpose of which I must say I sympathise with.  I am in full agreement with the Deputy's aim in putting down the amendment but, for the reasons I have outlined, I do not think it is practicable and, even if it were, in the unlikely event that it were, I doubt that it would be wise.  Whether I am right or wrong about the wisdom of it, I am quite certain it is not practicable.</P>

      <P>In effect, what the Minister is saying is that it is like asking a builder to build a house without giving him the materials.  It is essential for the formulation of proper planning that the type of information I am seeking to make it mandatory for the Department to provide should be provided.  It is not a good excuse <Col N="845" /> to say that is difficult and to talk about other problems.  It is an essential ingredient and foundation for the development of any plan that this type of information should be made available. I fail to see how any plan can be developed without having the information my amendment seeks to have made available.</P>

      <P>If we pass this legislation today, or next week, or whenever it is, does that mean there is a legislative requirement on the new Department within 12 months to publish a comprehensive series?  I have to say I do not want to have that hung around my neck because it is not necessarily the most urgent priority. Surely the most urgent priority is to get started using such bricks or other building material as are available, to start doing some work, and then by all means we will be pushing ahead.</P>

      <P>I would be prepared to change my amendment to read from 1979 onwards they would be published annually.  The Minister said it would not be practicable to do that within 12 months from now.  We should hope to achieve that.  I would agree to change my amendment to provide that they would be published <Col N="846" /> annually from 1979 or 1980.  There is a necessity, as the saying is, to put the gun to somebody's head and to get this put right as soon as possible.  If we had it as a statutory requirement it could be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>We can distinguish two strands in it.  If there were any such requirement in legislation I have no doubt we could stick together something into a booklet or a paper and say: &ldquo;There you are.  There is a series of economic and social indicators&rdquo; or whatever you want to call it. You can always publish a document. If they are to be adequate social indicators there is a separate problem. There is still a whole research area there.  It is not just Ireland.  Other countries in the world are very conscious of that.  We do not really have satisfactory ways of measuring or assessing social progress.  Quite a number of research projects and activities are going on in this field.</P>
      <P>I have no way of telling the pace at which useful and usable results will flow from that type of activity.  That is why I am reluctant to have to contemplate publishing whether it is in 1979 or in 1980.  On this side of the House we are very much in sympathy with the aim or the spirit of the amendment and I can assure the House that whatever information or indicators are available in this field will be published in appropriate forms at appropriate times.  However, it does not help me at this stage to have a specific commitment to publish annually, even if the starting date is moved back.  The next difficulty is, to publish what annually? &ldquo;Fully comprehensive&rdquo;, how is that to be unravelled?  If that is watered down and the &ldquo;fully comprehensive&rdquo; bit taken out, there is the phrase &ldquo;to publish annually such economic and social indicators as are available.&rdquo;  That is fine.  Of course we can do that, but where does that lead in the sense that whatever is available will be published anyway?  Therefore, the gun is not being put to anybody's head to do anything that cannot already be done.</P>

      <P>Apart from that, I also have section 2 (3) and in that connection I wanted to point out to the Deputy that the creation of a new Department requires the creation of a new office of Minister having charge of that Department.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development is a member of the Government now having charge of a Department of State, who is therefore, under section 4 (2) of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1939 a Minister without portfolio.  His title is not derived from the title of a Department of which he is head, because it does not exist, but it is a title that has been assigned to him by the Government pursuant to section 4 (3) of the 1939 Act.</P>

      <P>It sounds fine.  It did not stop me asking questions, but it is just a point I was wondering about.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I had forgotten about that.  The point I want to make is that this is a Department about which all of us in this House, including the Minister, are sailing into the unknown. <Col N="849" /> It was for that reason that I was anxious that some formula should be devised either legislatively or by way of an assurance by the Minister&mdash; although that does not satisfy me either because the point I was making a number of times over the last few days is that we are not dealing with the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue or Deputy George Colley, but with Ministers in future&mdash;under which we could have an economic discussion or a discussion on this Department at regular intervals.  It does not seem likely that the Estimate will amount to more than a debate on staff, salaries and wages, or that there would be any legislation. However, I will not pursue that point any further, at the moment.</P>
      <P>The Minister will now, when this Bill passes Seanad Éireann, be a fullyfledged Minister for Economic Planning and Development, and what he does and the tone he sets in his Department for the next four years will virtually determine what happens in the Department <i>in saecula seculorum.</i> Every other Minister will either follow what he is doing or else be called to account in this House if he is not following it.  Would the Minister give me&mdash;I do not want a guarantee&mdash; a personal undertaking that, at reasonably regular intervals, he will find a device to come into this House and allow the Members of the Oireachtas to debate the working of his Department, to point out what they see as his shortcomings, and hopefully give him some praise for what he is doing well?</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 5:</P>
    <P>In Part II, page 20, rule 46, lines 43 to 45, to delete paragraph (4), and substitute the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  The local returning officer shall appoint a place within or convenient to the constituency as the place at which he will open the ballot boxes and arrange the ballot papers in parcels as hereinafter provided and shall at that place so appointed provide suitable accommodation and all furniture and equipment necessary for opening the ballot boxes and arranging of the ballot papers in parcels as afore-said&rdquo;.&mdash;(Deputy T. J. Fitzpatrick, <i>Cavan-Monaghan.</i>)</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Before we adjourned I was dealing with amendment No. 5, the object of which is to change the method of accounting as described in the Bill.  It is provided in the Bill that, on the conclusion of the poll, all ballot boxes from every part of the constituency comprising eight or ten counties, as the case may be, be forwarded to the constituency returning officer and that the count be conducted from beginning to end by him. The object of my amendment is to alter that and to provide that, instead of forwarding the ballot papers in their boxes to the constituency returning officer, these ballot boxes should be retained locally and the ballot boxes for each local constituency or each county or county borough should be opened by the local returning officer, checked by him, reconciled with the ballot paper counts and doubtful votes adjudicated on by him. The first count should be conducted by the local returning officer and the ballot papers then put into parcels according to the name of the candidate who got the first preferences and the ballot boxes should then be forwarded to the constituency returning <Col N="851" /> officer who would complete the count from that point.</P>
      <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that this amendment is tabled by me to afford me an opportunity of arguing in favour of this change, a change I think most desirable.  If the Minister accepts my argument and decides, as I hope he will, to revert to the presidential system of counting the votes, then he will have to return this Schedule to the draftsman who will have to get to work on it and redraft it in order to make it possible to implement in this Bill the presidential counting system.  I want to make that clear lest it may be said later on that what I propose is not workable.  I agree this is only a formula for providing me with an argument.  It would be a major job for an ordinary Deputy to sit down and redraft the whole Schedule.  The parliamentary draftsman will have to get to work on that.</P>
      <P>I am very serious in putting forward this amendment and, if it is not accepted and written into the Bill, the count will be virtually unworkable and we will be running a grave danger of having the election in one of the constituencies completely upset.  We will be running the risk of having to start the election from beginning to end all over again.  We will have to hold a new poll.  I am that serious about it and I think the arguments I have put forward will justify the fears I am expressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure written into the Bill involves the delivery of the ballot boxes to the local returning officer.  He will have to collect them and bring them to a point in his county or county borough&mdash;I will deal with counties because it is simpler than repeating county boroughs&mdash;and retain them there, satisfy himself that he has collected all the boxes from each polling station because there is an obligation on him to forward them to the constituency returning officer. First he will have to collect the boxes after the ballot closes at presumably 9 o'clock at night.  We know it takes a matter of hours to get the boxes into headquarters and presumably they will arrive in local headquarters at <Col N="852" /> midnight or later.  The local returning officer will then have to check them and ensure they are intact.  He will either keep them overnight or despatch them to constituency headquarters. There will be anything from 100 to 300 or perhaps 350 or 400 ballot boxes.  They will have to be despatched by lorry or other vehicle under, I presume, an armed escort.  The presidential ballot boxes are sent under military escort.  On the night of the count there will be a fleet of lorries converging on constituency headquarters in each constituency accompanied by an armed escort.  That will involve a great deal of work on the returning officer in providing the necessary transport.</P>
    <P>This will involve a considerable amount of work by the security quarters in providing an escort for each vehicle from each county to constituency headquarters.  There will be a real risk of a road accident.  There may be a big delay.  Some of the boxes could burst open and the ballot papers could be strewn all over the road. Furthermore, there are people who hold rather strong views about our participating in Europe.  Percentagewise the number may be small but they hold strong views and they are prepared to adopt extreme methods because they believe we sold our sovereignty and independence by going into Europe. There is a real risk that these people might think it their duty to attack the ballot boxes in order to invalidate the election and upset what they regard as a continuation of the sell-out of this country to Europe.  That would be a very real danger because in the constituency of Connacht-Ulster, if you have the constituency headquarters in Roscommon or Sligo&mdash;I suppose Roscommon would be fairly central&mdash;and if that were so, you would have to transport ballot boxes from Donegal, Galway, Roscommon, or very long journeys and subject to the risks I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The transport of boxes is a major task open to the risk of accident or attack.  These boxes will be conveyed overnight to the constituency headquarters or will be retained in the local headquarters until next day.  If that is done, most of the first day after the election will be spent in getting them to <Col N="853" /> the constituency headquarters, a source of considerable delay.  I have dealt with the number of lorries that will be required and the escorts.  The next big task will be for the constituency returning officer to find a suitable place to hold, not a couple of hundred ballot boxes as in an ordinary general election but, in the constituency of Munster thousands of ballot boxes.  The figures can be worked out by anybody, perhaps 3,000 or 4,000 boxes.  A suitable place must be found to store all these when they arive at constituency headquarters. There will be the work of moving them about which will entail an enormous amount of labour.</P>
    <P>One of the most important functions in a count, so as to ensure that everything goes right, is the checking of the ballot papers count with the ballot box and the number of votes in it.  If that goes wrong I understand it is not possible to have a proper check on the number of votes cast.  The boxes in each constituency are numbered consecutively and the ballot paper counts will also be numbered consecutively. There is a danger of the ballot paper counts and the boxes becoming mixed. I may be told that would be averted by putting the local constituency name on both the box and the ballot paper.  Perhaps so, but it is another risk.</P>
    <P>Having got the boxes to constituency headquarters, the next requirement is a suitable and experienced staff.  If the constituency returning officer is to rely on the staff of the county in which he conducts the count it would take a very long time; the count would drag on indefinitely.  That means an experienced staff will have to be got, which would involve drafting in staff from over many counties, staff not accustomed to working together, each conducting the count according to his own local way of doing it.  That could lead to difficulties, mistakes and delay.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of dealing with doubtful votes, a task reserved to the returning officer himself.  As far as I know, he cannot delegate it and the same man has to adjudicate on each doubtful vote.  The only appeal from him is on an election petition.  In the average county.  I suppose approximately 300 votes are spoiled but that <Col N="854" /> does not mean that only 300 papers have to be examined.  For every vote rejected, some five or six are scrutinised as doubtful to see if they should be accepted or rejected.  In an average county you will have between 1,000 and 1,500 votes to scrutinise.  If you apply that to Munster, where there are far more and larger counties, you will be dealing with between 20,000 and 30,000 doubtful votes.  That is an enormous task to entrust to one man and that also would delay the count enormously in each constituency.</P>
    <P>All these are very real difficulties. Every practical politician will find it hard to disagree with the case I am making because he has seen the counts being conducted and knows that what I say is substantially correct.  Many of these difficulties could be eliminated if we reverted to the presidential system of count which has been operated here since 1937.  I know that very often the presidential election involves only one count because there are seldom more than two candidates but we have had occasions when there were three or more.  We certainly had one occasion where the result depended not on the first count but, I think, on the distribution of the late Dr. McCartan's votes when he was eliminated.</P>
    <P>That system has been tried and has worked.  It is difficult to see why we have departed from it in this Bill.  I am asking the Minister to adopt the presidential system.  If that system is adopted, when the poll closes the ballot boxes from each county will be brought to the local courthouse or somewhere like that, where the counts are held for every election and referendum, and the presiding officers will know where the boxes must go, and the usual security precautions will be taken.  No matter which system is adopted these precautions will have to be taken.  If the presidential system is adopted the counts will commence presumably at 9 o'clock the morning after the election and the whole operation will finish the same day.  The boxes will be opened in the local offices and checked as they have been checked in the past, and the counts will be reconciled.  The doubtful votes thrown out by the checkers will be <Col N="855" /> adjudicated upon by the local returning officer.  The votes will be sorted and arranged in bundles for each candidate. The first preference votes will be counted and when that is over, instead of having 100 or 300 boxes to deal with, there will be perhaps six or seven bundles of ballot papers. They will be put into six or seven ballot boxes with a certificate from the local returning officer and sent off to the constituency headquarters from the local office.  That would mean that everything would be in readiness for a continuation of the count on the second day and in most cases if not in every case the count would be concluded on the second day.  If we go through this other nonsensical method proposed here, there is no way in which the count can be concluded in two days.</P>

      <P>I support what Deputy Fitzpatrick is saying.  The likelihood of there being a poor turnout in an election such as this was mentioned on many occasions.  In order that a larger turnout could be encouraged it has been suggested that another election could take place on the same day.  Since the local elections could occur at the same time, we could have an urban council election and a county <Col N="856" /> council election in a constituency along with the Assembly elections, the ballot papers for three elections being filled in in the same town hall.  This could result in a mix-up of ballot papers.  In those circumstances it would be necessary that the sorting stage should take place in the national constituency rather than in a central place in the European Assembly constituency.  If the two elections were to take place on the same day there could be distortions in both elections.  If votes for a small urban council found their way into the ballot boxes of the Assembly elections there would be a horrible mess in the counts at the end of the day.  There is also the possibility that the Government could take advantage of a national election, such as an Assembly election, to make changes in the Constitution, and thereby have a referendum. This would not be the first time this has happened.  At a presidential election we had a referendum taking place on the voting system.  If this were to happen the same problem could occur.  We could have the votes for the referendum counted in the Dáil constituencies, and according to this Bill we would have to count the votes for the European Assembly elections at a central point.  Once again we would have distortion and mixed ballot papers. There is no possibility that a presiding officer can ensure that the ballot papers go into the right boxes, or he would interfere perhaps with the secrecy of a person's ballot.</P>

      <P>: With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 356 and 357 together.</P>
      <P>Current Land Commission policy is aimed at providing family farms of 40 to 45 acres of good land or the equivalent in land of mixed quality. In particular circumstances, however, the Land Commission may consider for allotments farmers with acreages in excess of this standard.  The suitability of the standard in present-day conditions is currently being considered as part of the comprehensive review of land policy that is in progress. It should be kept in mind, however, that while increasing the present standard would benefit the owners of medium-sized holdings it would make it more difficult for smaller farmers to acquire the extra land they need.</P>
      <P>As a regards the situation in the Rahara area of South Roscommon, the Land Commission have eight properties in their possession there with a total area of 548 acres.  The necessary inquiries on the ground, preparatory to framing proposals for allocation, are at present in progress but it will be some time before the final decision on division can be taken. The Commissioners will undoubtedly be giving due consideration to the position of the local applicants to whom the Deputies refer in their questions.</P>

      <P>Special allocations for job creation purposes were made to the Office of Public Works and the Industrial Credit Company Limited with the following job-creation consequences:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  <i>Office of Public Works</i></P>
      <P>The number of new jobs created since 5th July is about 170 mainly on building and construction work undertaken by or on behalf of the Office of Public Works.  Eighty-six of these jobs were announced by the present Government and the balance arise from the allocation of £2 million made to the Office of Public Works in the January budget job-creation package.</P>
      <P>About two-thirds of the new jobs are permanent and the remainder will continue for some years.  The approximate overall average cost of each new job is about £80 per week.</P>
      <P>(b)  <i>Industrial Credit Company Limited</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i) £2 million was allocated to the Industrial Credit Company in the January budget job creation package. Portion of this allocation was made available to Shipping Finance Corporation to finance extra shipbuilding at Verolme Cork Dockyard thereby safeguarding the jobs of the workforce in the yard.  The balance was allocated to enable the Industrial Credit Company increase its lending to industry. Since July, loan facilities amounting to £5.8 million were provided to firms in respect of projects which, when completed will, it is expected, create about 1,500 permanent new jobs.  The cost <Col N="804" /> per week cannot be quantified at this stage.</P>

      <P>The number of new jobs approved since 5th July, 1977, is 900.  In the January budget it was announced that financial provision would be made available later to finance a programme of job creation.</P>
      <P>When I came to examine the position, I found that there was an expected under-expenditure of about £1.8 million as against the sum indicated in the budget.  This arose from delays in filling posts and other factors.  Because of this I was able to authorise the posts referred to above without seeking extra funds.</P>
      <P>A supplementary Estimate will, however be introduced shortly to cover, <i>inter alia</i>, the cost of the job creation programmes.</P>
      <P>With regard to the likely duration of the jobs, about 300 are of a temporary nature related to maintenance works in hospitals and homes.  It is not possible to say precisely how long these jobs will last.  A further 50 are related to hospital construction works and their duration will be influenced by the duration of the works on which the personnel are employed.  The remainder of the jobs are permanent in character.</P>
      <P>As regards the cost of providing each job this includes pay and non-pay elements and it not possible to allocate the latter between different classes with any degree of accuracy.  The overall cost per job is about £5,600 per annum or £107 per week.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="806" /> The information on job creation arising from these allocations since 5th July, 1977, is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A total of 58 new jobs were created for the purpose of dredging and drainage work undertaken by the Cork Harbour Commissioners.  Twenty-one of these jobs lasted for a period of ten weeks.  The remaining 37 jobs are estimated to last a total of 21 weeks.  A large proportion of the expenditure is related to the mobilisation of dredging equipment and it would not be possible to apportion the expenditure in a way that would enable a cost per job per week to be indicated.</P>
    <P>The allocation for CIE of £1.10 million, which was related to proposals for vehicle building, has not yet been utilised.</P>
    <P>Since 5th July, 1977, Bord Fáilte have spent £60,000 out of their allocation. In the process, 125 jobs were created, mainly in the category of unskilled labour.  The average duration of each job was 14 weeks at an average weekly cost to the Exchequer of approximately £34.</P>

      <P>(i) The following moneys were allocated in the January budget to assist job creation by agencies under the aegis of my Department:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industrial Development Authority&mdash; £4 million.  This money is being used to accelerate and expand the authority's programme of land acquisition and advance factory construction and thereby accelerate the pace of the industrial development programme.  It is not possible to estimate the number of permanent jobs which will be created in the industrial projects which will eventually occupy the factories built by the IDA, or factories built by industrial promoters on land purchased <Col N="808" /> by the IDA.  It is estimated however, that the additional factory construction by the IDA will give 510&mdash;570 jobs &mdash;of varying duration&mdash;in the building industry, over an average nine-month construction period.</P>
    <P>Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited&mdash;£250,000.  This money is being spent on the constrution of advance factories.  Again it is not possible to estimate the permanent job creation which will result.  There are about 110 persons at present engaged in construction work, rising to about 130 by the end of the year. Nítrigin Éireann Teorants-£8.1 million. An additional allocation of £8.1 millions (non-Exchequer) was made to Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta under the public capital programme.  This extra allocation was intended to meet the increased cost to Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta of its development programme at Marino Point, cobh.  Employment on construction work at Marino was gradually increased during the year to a peak of 1,250.  When the development is completed and production commences-in-1978-permanent employment for 350 people will be available. Bord na Móna-£1.5 million.  I am informed by Bord na Móna that arising from the additional allocation of £1.5 million in the January budget, 173 additional people had been employed by 30th September, 1977.</P>
    <P>(ii) It is not possible to give a figure for new job creation arising from the moneys voted by the Dáil in respect of the 1977 financial estimates for the IDA and SFADCo, which are the agencies having responsibility for job creation.  This is because the numbers of new jobs created in any particular period cannot be attributed to grant expenditures in that period.</P>

      <P>The January, 1977, budget provided for an expenditure of £2 million on employment incentives for which the Department of the Environment is responsible.  Since 5th July last, the Government have announced proposals for additional expenditure from public funds of some £7.8 million in 1977 and £42.5 million in 1978 on job creation measures for which the Department are responsible.</P>
      <P>Supplementary Estimates were introduced on 6th July last and a further Supplementary Estimate will be introduced during the present session to meet additional voted expenditure.</P>
      <P>The estimated number of additional jobs to be created directly and in&mdash; directly by job creation schemes is as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="811" /> It is not possible in all cases to state precisely the likely duration of these jobs and the cost per week to the Exchequer of providing each job in the different categories.</P>
    <P>Regarding road works, it is estimated that each additional £1 million that has been provided by the Exchequer this year results in the creation of 100 man-year jobs for road workers and 65 man-year jobs in indirect employment corresponding to approximately £115 per week for each job.</P>
    <P>Regarding public water supply and sewerage schemes, the average construction period of the schemes to which the 105 jobs mentioned above relate is 13 months.  It is estimated that the average capital cost per week of a job to which the job creation measures relate is £80 for a sewerage scheme and £110 on a water supply scheme.</P>
    <P>Regarding environmental works and local improvement schemes. short-term employment is being provided which is expected to terminate next month. Precise estimates of the cost per job are not available.</P>
    <P>Regarding the introduction of the £1,000 new house grant and the increase in the SDA loan limits, separate figures for employment on private housing are not available.  It is estimated that these measures will result in an additional 1,000 jobs in 1977 and 2,500 jobs in a full year.</P>
    <P>The cost figures represent the estimated total expenditure involved which is financed initially by the Exchequer and is mainly of a capital nature.  Part of the current cost is met by local authorities, for example public water supply schemes and by individuals, for example SDA loans.</P>

      <P>In the January, 1977 budget funds were allocated for the Employment Incentive Scheme, the Youth Employment Scheme, the Community Youth Training Programme and for capital expenditure by AnCO.</P>
      <P>In the period since 5th July, 1977 to 4th November, 1977 a total of 1,567 new jobs were created under the Employment Incentive Scheme.  In the same period applications for premiums under the Apprentice Re-employment Premium Scheme for Youth Employment were received in respect of 15 apprentices.</P>
      <P>Premiums of £20 per week and £14 per week, depending on the category of eligible employee, are payable for 24 weeks under the Employment Incentive Scheme.</P>
      <P>The Apprentice Re-employment Premium Scheme provides for the payment of premiums of £14 per week for 24 weeks for first and second year apprentices and £20 per week for 24 weeks for others.</P>
      <P>There is no information available to my Department to indicate the length of time premium-attracting employees under the aforementioned schemes are retained in employment after the cessation of the payment of the premiums.</P>
      <P>The Community Youth Employment Scheme is operated by AnCO. Since 5th July, 1977, 47 schemes were brought into operation giving employment to a total of 316 persons; this includes 47 craftsmen, 82 apprentices and 187 trainees&mdash;school leavers.  The craftsmen are paid an allowance, equivalent to the normal net take-home pay payable in industry.  The apprentices are paid an allowance equivalent to the week wage appropriate to their year of apprenticeship. The school leavers, that is, trainees are paid the normal training allowances in operation for trainees in AnCO training centres.  It is not possible from the available records to indicate what is the weekly cost to the Exchequer for these operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The funds for capital expenditure by AnCO were allocated for the construction <Col N="813" /> of training centres in Athlone and Cork. Construction work on the Athlone centre commenced in October and approximately 15 workers are employed on the project at the present time.  Work has not yet commenced on the Cork centre.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the question of creating job opportunities for young people in the south Tipperary area is part of the overall plan for the country as a whole.  The problem of youth unemployment is one that is causing grave concern and the Government had full regard to it in formulating the measures to improve employment prospects generally and the specific measures taken to aid youth.</P>
      <P>The Government since assuming office on 5th July, 1977, have given priority to the implementation of the short-term job creation programme outlined in its election manifesto, which includes the expenditure of £20 million on youth projects to yield 5,000 new jobs.  A Cabinet subcommittee was specially set up to deal with this.</P>
      <P>The question of job creation will be a central element in the Government's proposed White Paper on National Development 1977-80, which it is hoped to publish by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="826" /> In so far as my direct area of responsibility as Minister for Labour is concerned, an employment action Team, which is representative of the Government and the social partners and other interested organisations, has been established to promote employment schemes for school leavers and other young people.</P>
    <P>I have, in addition, extended the employment incentive scheme to include employments in the hotel and catering industry, the services sector and the building industry.  I felt that its extension to these areas would benefit young people particularly and with this in mind, I also increased the premium from £10 to £14.  I increased similarly the premium payable under the apprentice re-employment programme in respect of redundant apprentices taken into employment; to date 33 employers in south Tipperary have submitted applications in respect of 76 workers under the employment incentive scheme.</P>
    <P>Young people also benefit very significantly under the AnCO training programmes.  Some 70 per cent of the trainees on normal courses are under the age of 25.  In addition, AnCO operate the community youth training programme for young people and it is hoped, allowing for some difficulties which arose in the earlier part of the year, that 80 per cent of the initial target of 90,000 man days on suitable projects will be reached by the end of the year.  At present 59 school leavers from south Tipperary are undergoing training in the AnCO training centre in Waterford or on community youth training projects.</P>

      <P>Discussions have not yet taken place on the proposed deed of trust for community schools.  A reference was made to the matter during the course of a meeting with a deputation from the TUI in July and it was indicated to them that discussions with the recognised educational organisations would be held before a final decision was made in regard to the terms of the deed of trust.  Copies of the draft deed of trust are being placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Economic Planning and Development if he is aware of the statement in the annual report of the ESRI that several proposed research projects of the institute for 1978 may have to be postponed because of lack of project finance; and if he will favourably consider an increased allocation to the ESRI for 1978.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Economic Planning and Development (Professor O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the statement referred to by the Deputy.  The question of postponing projects arose because the 1977 grant-in-aid fixed by the previous Government fell far short of the sums needed by the institute to meet both rising costs and the funding of new research projects.  I am keenly aware of the need to maintain an adequate level of economic and social research. In determining the level of the 1978 grant-in-aid the Government will take into account the proposed research programme of the institute.</P>
