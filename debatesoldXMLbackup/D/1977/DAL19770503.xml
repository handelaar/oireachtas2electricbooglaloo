      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. O.J. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>A person who is appointed to be an officer holds his commission until he retires or is retired or relinquishes or resigns his commission or is dismissed.</P>
      <P>A former officer of the Permanent Defence Force who has not been granted a commission as an officer of the Reserve Defence Force is not liable to be recalled for service.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister indicate why an officer is retired not on pension but on retirement pay? Could he indicate how this term is <Col N="2" /> used, and what is the interpretation of retirement pay in relation to retired officers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appears to be referring to the case of a particular officer.  If he will be good enough to furnish me with the details, I will be very pleased to have an examination made and I will communicate with him or, if he so desires, he can put down a question in connection with the particular case he has in mind and I will be glad to reply to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not referring to a particular officer.  I am referring to all retired officers.  NCOs, men, chaplains, and members of the nursing service retired on pension.  When officers retire they are on retirement pay.  Could the Minister indicate the difference between a person retired on pension and a person retired on retirement pay?  What is the interpretation of retirement pay?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not unusual for the Deputy to become complicated with his own questions.  I am afraid that is so in this case.  A reserve officer is not a retired officer; an FCA officer is not a retired officer.  One is not retired while serving in any capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to retired officers and the term &ldquo;retirement pay&rdquo; as distinct from a pension. Can the Minister indicate why an officer does not get a pension when he is retired and why he gets retirement pay?  Can he give me a definition of &ldquo;retirement pay&rdquo; in relation to retired officers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if it is his intention to change the system of selection of personnel for army cadetships; and if he will state the composition of the interview boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no proposals to change the system of selection of Army cadets.  The boards which interview candidates for Army cadetships are composed of officers of the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that at this stage it is necessary to broaden the base of the board for the interviewing of cadets?  Because of the technical nature of the Army of tomorrow and the technical advances within the service, does he not consider some type of independent assessment is necessary and desirable and that outside engineers and other people should be consulted who would be qualified to assess individuals on an independent basis in conjunction with the military assessment?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  Perhaps we have the most superior and the most highly technically qualified people in the country in the Defence Forces.  I have every confidence in their qualifications, in their ability and, above all, in their very high standard of integrity.  For that reason I do not propose to make any change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as ministerial interference is a big factor in the selection of cadets, would the Minister examine the situation and ensure that people are selected on the basis of ability rather than on the basis of political motivation by Ministers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that his insinuation is most unbecoming.  Not alone is it untrue but I look upon it as a slur on the competence and integrity of the members of the Defence Forces.  It is most regrettable that Deputy Dowling should make such a serious allegation and charge which, if it came from a responsible Deputy, could reflect very seriously on the integrity and the high standard of Army officers.  I can assure him that I have every confidence in their technical qualifications and in the manner in which they are so particular and exact in their recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the previous Minister for Defence took upon himself the absolute right to promote senior officers without reference to the Chief of Staff and in so far as the Minister for Defence now has this absolute right, an amount of dictation is percolating to the senior officers from Ministers for Defence in the Coalition in relation to personnel not only on the basis of promotion but also in the selection of individuals for cadetships.  Is the Minister aware that a very serious situation has developed where the flow of young officers into the Army and the appointment of senior Army officers are regulated by ministerial interference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that is not so.  The allegation he is making reflects no credit on himself and the regard in which he is <Col N="5" /> supposed to hold the Army.  There are no proposals to change the system. There is no demand for any change in the system except from the Deputy and, for those reasons, I do not propose to take any steps in that direction.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister is far out of touch with the realities of the Defence Forces when he indicates that what I said is incorrect, would he examine the situation in relation to the ministerial interference which has taken place not alone in the promotion of senior Army officers but also in the selection of personnel for the military college?  In other areas of the Defence Forces, ministerial interference is rampant and the pals are being packed into various posts and positions of authority.  If the Minister thinks that is not happening at the moment, I can assure him that it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a similar question on the 17th February, 1977. It is hoped to finalise the matter at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>A serious situation has developed here in relation to widows of former members of the Defence Forces.  As there is a loss of social life because of the duty tours of Army personnel, will the Minister ensure that this matter is expedited?  I would also point out that many of the widows are left destitute because of the untimely death of their husbands.  It is not enough for the Minister to tell us that this matter is under examination and that he is awaiting a report.  Will he indicate the date on which widows of former members of the Defence Forces will get some pension rights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I will endeavour to finalise this matter with the least delay possible.  I am not unmindful of the problems faced by widows.  Last, but not least, one widow&mdash;Mrs. Lemass&mdash; in the Deputy's constituency must be enduring the most desperate problems because of the unreasonableness of Deputy Dowling.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared at this stage to give an undertaking that widows of deceased Army personnel will get pension rights within a short time?  I pity the widows in <Col N="7" /> his own constituency whose rights he has probably trampled on from time to time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence the number of young horses bought for the Army Equitation School during the past four years; their average age; the average price; the number of horses sold during the same period; and the average price obtained for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past four years 30 horses were bought for the Army Equitation School; their average age was six and two-third years; the number of horses sold during the same period was 24.  It would be contrary to my Department's practice to give any indication of the purchase and sale prices of the horses in question, such matters being treated as confidential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The information the Minister has given the House is incorrect because on occasions in the past other Ministers have given the same information.  What has this Minister to hide in relation to the purchase and sale of Army horses?  Will he indicate how they are purchased and sold, who sells them and where the information leaks come from?  He is concealing information from the House and I demand that he gives it. We make moneys available in the Estimates and we are entitled to know how they are spent and also what amounts are received for the sale of the Army horses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have informed the Deputy that the purchase and sale prices of the horses in question are matters that are treated as confidential.  He must have some degree of responsibility and must realise that to disclose the prices could have an effect on the purchase of horses at a future date.  Naturally, the very best and most superior type of animal is purchased.  I have every confidence that the Army Equitation School will discharge their duties in purchasing the very best horses and I have every <Col N="8" /> confidence in the manner in which they spend the money allocated for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is grossly misleading the House when he says that the information requested has not been disclosed to the House.  In the past the House has got information regarding the purchase price of the horses and the individuals from whom the horses were purchased.  The House has also got information regarding horses sold by the Army and the average price.  Is the Minister ashamed to give the average purchase and sale price?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will amend the regulations under section 54 of the Health Act, 1970, to abolish the six weeks limit on payment of capitation grants for patients in private nursing homes as the health boards have not the accommodation to meet the present requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevant regulations do not limit the payment of subventions for eligible persons in approved nursing homes to a period of six weeks and health boards may continue payments after that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>What regulation prevents payment after six weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health Act, 1953, says that where institutional services were available in a nursing home or a maternity home the payment should be limited to a period of six weeks in the case of a nursing home or two weeks in the case of a maternity home unless the health authority otherwise determined.  This means that the health authority have permission to extend the payment of the subvention after six weeks.  It is true that one or two health boards do not exercise this option and confine the payment to six weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to the statement that there is a shortage of consultants in Irish hospitals <Col N="13" /> and that about 400 additional appointments will have to be made in order to keep the hospital service working at adequate levels throughout the year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any statement of the precise nature referred to by the Deputy.  I am aware that a memorandum on medical manpower prepared by a subcommittee of the Irish Medical Association and discussed at their recent conference in Kilarney contained recommendations for increasing the number of consultant posts in hospitals by over 1,000.  This would more than double the existing number of posts.</P>
      <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal has the statutory function of regulating the number and type of appointments of consultant medical staff in hospitals and it is for that body to decide what should be the appropriate complements of such staff.  I might add that I was pleased recently to provide, as part of the Government's job creation programme, the funds necessary in respect of the additional posts approved to date by the comhairle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, in view of the reported statement (details supplied) of the President of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union that patients were failing to take essential drugs because of the high cost, he will take all possible steps to resolve this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report to which the Deputy refers.  The speaker was referring to persons other than those covered by medical cards and the great majority of whom are eligible for the scheme which provides for the refund of part of the cost of prescribed drugs.  While the initial expenditure on drugs has increased in the past year, there has been no increase during the same period in the amount which a person is required to meet from his own resources before becoming entitled to a refund.  Therefore the net cost of medicines to such persons has not increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The control of drug prices is primarily <Col N="14" /> a matter for the Prices Commission and the Minister for Industry and Commerce but my Department are taking part in discussions relating to certain aspects of drug prices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the evidence that people are going without drugs because they cannot afford them?  Would he consider buying drugs in bulk which could be made available to these people through chemists?  This would reduce the cost of drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the price of drugs has increased in the last year by 13 to 18 per cent.  I would like to stress that as far as the recipient of drugs is concerned, he or she has not had to pay any extra over the last 12 months.  The maximum any person in the middle income group pays for drugs is still £6.50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right, but because of the high prices in other areas, parents are doing without drugs to buy food and clothing.  The Minister should consider making these drugs accessible to these people at a cheaper price and bulk buying would help reduce prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not say there is a great deal of evidence of that but we are investigating with the Pharmaceutical, Chemical and Allied Industries Association the price of drugs and in particular the differential between Ireland and the United Kingdom. I am aware that people are very chary of buying drugs because they must pay cash and await for their refund. Sometimes there is a long delay between the time they pay for the drugs and the time they get the refund. It would be my desire that we could short-cut it to the extent that people would not have to pay on the spot.  I will certainly examine the Deputy's suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy and I told that to the Deputy when he raised this question in June of last year.  This year I can make a start on the health centre because money has been allocated. There is a problem with Dublin Corporation in regard to the area of the site which, I am told, is about three-quarters of an acre.

      <P>I am aware of the statements made at the meeting referred to by the Deputy.  I was present at the association's annual dinner and I am sending the Deputy a copy of my address to the association on that occasion.  It will be noted from the address that I acknowledged the existence of certain defects in the public dental service and possible ways of remedying them.  I also indicated in my address that the profession should have the opportunity of discussing the improvement and future development of the dental service with officials of my Department.</P>
      <P>Since the meeting, the Department have written to the president of the association inviting representatives of that body to attend a meeting in the Department to discuss the general matters referred to in my address.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately 1,450 smallholders with land valuations in excess of £20 were notified that as from the 29th March, 1977, they would cease to be entitled to unemployment assistance on the basis of a notional assessment of their means from their holdings; of the number notified about 250 were registered at local offices of my Department in County Galway.  The persons concerned were informed that their entitlement to unemployment assistance after the 29th March, 1977, would depend on the assessment of their means on the normal factual basis and arrangements are proceeding accordingly to have means reassessed in cases where this is necessary.</P>
      <P>To date five appeals have been received against decisions arising from reassessments in these cases, of which one is from a person in County Galway. Decisions on the appeals will be given as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that it is most unfair that a farmer with a land valuation of £20 should have his unemployment assistance discontinued while a decision was under appeal?  Would it not be a better system to wait until a decision had been made on the appeal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The entitlement of the person concerned to unemployment benefit on his claim of 14th February 1977 depended on the number of social insurance contributions paid or credited in respect of him during 1975.  The records of my Department showed only three credited contributions in respect of him during that year and the normal inquiries in a case of this nature had to be undertaken to clarify the position.  These have now been completed and the claim for unemployment benefit has been authorised.  Arrangements have been made to have the amount due paid to the person concerned this week.</P>
      <P>An application for a qualification certificate, which is a necessary requirement for entitlement to unemployment assistance, was also made on 14th February but title to the assistance does not arise as his entitlement to unemployment benefit has not been exhausted.</P>

    <P>(a)  Housing authorities have been informed that allocations generally will be reviewed after 30th June, 1977, and that further allocations may be made following the review, to cover expenditure on additional starts to be authorised later in the year.</P>
    <P>(b)  Wexford County Council only sought £671,000 in draws from the Local Loans Fund in 1976 out of their total authorised expenditure of £1,204,000.</P>
    <P>(c)  The figures shown for 1971-72, 1972-73, and 1973-74 are for the financial years ended 31st March 1972, 31st March 1973 and 31st March 1974 respectively.  The figures for 1974 (9 months) relate to the transitional financial period from 1st April 1974 to 31st December 1974.  In subsequent years the calender year coincides with the financial year.</P>
    <P>(d)  The figures shown in the table for 1971-72, 1972-73, 1973-74, 1974 and 1975 represent actual issues from the Local Loans Fund for local authority housing in each of these periods.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will make a statement in relation to the provision of open space at Maguire's land, Newtownpark Avenue, Blackrock, County Dublin; and if he is aware of the anxiety of the people of the area concerning recent reports about the cost per acre of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the development for housing and flats on a site at Newtownpark House, Newtownpark Avenue, Blackrock, County Dublin for which outline permission was given on 15th September, 1976, arising from a third party appeal against a decision by Dublin County Council.  Conditions attached to the outline permission included a requirement that the detailed plans to be submitted for approval should provide for the reservation of a total not less than 11 acres as open space for public recreational facilities. It is understood that the planning authority have received an application for compensation under the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, from the owner and the developer, and that this claim was received on 11th March, 1977, and is being examined.  The matter is one for the planning authority and it would not be appropriate for me to make a statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The consideration of compensation in the first instance is a <Col N="24" /> matter for the planning authority, and in the absence of agreement between the parties, section 68 of the Act, provides that payment shall be determined by arbitration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that land for open spaces has already been designated as open spaces. Consequently, it seems rather odd that the developers are seeking compensation for land already designated for open spaces.  Will the Minister agree with me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not, unfortunately, hear the first part of the Minister's reply.  I think the Minister must agree that, having regard to the fact that planning permission has already been given by a Minister of the present Government and that a claim now is being made for £55,000 per acre for land already designated as open spaces, this claim is wrong socially and from every other viewpoint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government why he refused to meet a deputation from Clare County Council to discuss a proposal from the council for an increased grant to improve the Ennis/Kilrush road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I allocated Road Fund grants of £762,000 to Clare County County Council for the current year, as compared with £563,500 in 1976, which was an increase of £198,500. When the council indicated their desire to have a further grant made for the Ennis-Kilrush road, I indicated to them on 18th March that although I am always pleased to meet members of the council, there is no way open to me at present to make further increased road grants available and, accordingly, <Col N="25" /> the reception of a deputation, as suggested to them, could not serve the purpose they sought.  I also told them that when determining the Road Fund grants for 1978, I will give due consideration to the special needs of the Ennis/Kilrush road and I pointed out that for the current year it is open to them to continue to apply funds from their own resources supplemented by the block grant to improving this road. The block grant totals £425,000, which is an increase of £50,000 on 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the very bad condition of this road? Is he also aware that it is mitigating against the attraction of industry to the west Clare area?  Would he not consider that there is a case here for a special grant for this stretch of road?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very surprised that the Deputy should put this question down because he was more aware of the situation than perhaps many other people.  I am sure he is also aware that the improvement of the Ennis/ Kilrush road did not warrant priority over the improvement of the national primary Ennis/Shannon/Limerick road for which a grant of £90,000 was allocated in 1977.  I do not know whether Deputy Daly is suggesting to me that, instead of putting it on that road, it should have gone on the other, the subject of his question.  Clare could not get grants of that magnitude for both.  They have got £198,500 more than they got last year.  They can allocate some of their block grant to doing this road if the local council consider it is that important.  The subject of the question is whether or not I should have met a deputation.  My point was that there was no use meeting a deputation to tell them that; I told them in my letter.  Any local authority wanting to send a deputation to Dublin to discuss any matter with me&mdash;provided they consider it is worth spending ratepayers' money on &mdash;is entitled to do so and I will meet them.  But I want to make it very clear first that they know what is the situation.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Moore</b> asked the Minister for Local Government the number of local authority dwellings completed in January, 1976 and January, 1977; and the percentage change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of 580 dwellings was completed in January, 1976 compared with 275 in the corresponding period of 1977, a percentage change of 52.6 per cent.  The low completions figure in January, 1977 was largely due to bad weather and water logging of sites but compared favourably with the 245 dwellings completed in January, 1973, when weather conditions generally were much more favourable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the reply he has given portrays a very serious situation?  Would he say what he proposese to do to reverse that very serious trend, in which there was over 52 per cent fewer houses built in January, 1977 as compared with January, 1976?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a considerable increase on the number built in 1972, the last year for which a Fianna Fáil Minister was in charge.  If we take that as a basis, we did quite well, particularly in view of the fact that the weather was so bad.  I would suggest to <Col N="27" /> Deputy Faulkner that we wait a little longer and we will be able to prove that the houses are still being built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope particular notice has been taken of the fact that there was a 52 per cent decrease in the number of houses built in January. Is the Minister further aware that, taking the unemployment figures for mid-December, 1976 and mid-January, 1977, there has been an increase in the number of unemployed building and construction workers of 1,326? Surely in those circumstances and in a situation in which there has been such a dramatic fall in the number of houses built, the Minister at least should indicate to the House what he proposes to do to improve that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is again getting his lines crossed.  The number of people employed in building local authority houses is higher now than it was 12 months ago.  The number has increased steadily over the years.  That is because, as Deputy Lynch might say, we are building too many local authority houses.  But we are building them. We will build them this year as we did last year and in every year since I took over.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should remind the Minister that the figure for unemployment amongst building and construction workers is now 25,882.  In those circumstances surely the Minister will at least indicate to the House what he proposes to do to reverse the trend. Surely the Minister accepts&mdash;and the country will accept&mdash;that it is not sufficient to talk about what happened many years ago.  The Minister has now been in office for four years.</P>

      <P>Not so many, only a little over four years ago Fianna Fáil were <Col N="28" /> building half the number of houses we are building.  Deputy Faulkner imagines everybody has a very short memory if he thinks that sort of codology will be accepted by anybody in the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister suggest that a fall of 52 per cent in January, 1977 as compared with January, 1976 is codology, as is the fact that there are 13,026 more building and construction workers unemployed in mid-January than there were in mid-December, 1976?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had an average of 15,000 more houses being built than were built under Fianna Fáil for 16 years and the Deputy cannot get away from that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the criteria by which his Department will calculate private housing completions in future, using ESB data on new meter installations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Since November, 1976, my Department receive from the Electricity Supply Board a monthly return of all new dwellings connected to the electricity supply in each county, excluding local authority demountable dwellings and private house conversions.  The number of local authority demountable dwellings is ascertained separately from local authorities and it is estimated that 450 dwellings are now provided each year by the conversion of houses into flats.</P>
      <P>The number of dwellings provided by public authorities is ascertained from these authorities.  By deducting this number from the total number of dwellings provided, the number of private house completions is calculated. Representatives of the building industry consider that the above methodology offers the best prospect of getting reliable figures of private house completions in 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, as houses under the new <Col N="29" /> system will become completed houses in the statistical sense immediately they are occupied whereas previously they did not become completed in the statistical sense until the final grant was paid&mdash;which could be months, and, in some instances, even years after occupation&mdash;in the first year at least of the new system completed housing statistics will be artificially swollen and will give an inflated picture of the housing situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Faulkner for believing that we built more houses last year than we did. The situation is that such houses will be counted only when the ESB is connected to them.  If Deputy Faulkner has a better idea perhaps he would write me a letter, or call in to see me and let me know because the building industry, the Department of Local Government and the ESB have agreed that this is the best way to do it.  If Deputy Faulkner has a better way I should love to hear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The supplementary question I asked has not been answered by the Minister.  What I am pointing out is that houses which were regarded previously as completed in a statistical sense on the basis of grants paid&mdash;which very often were not paid for months or perhaps years after the houses were occupied&mdash;will become completed houses in the statistical sense as soon as they are occupied because one must assume that they will be connected to the electricity supply before they are occupied.  Therefore, we will have for quite a while, for comparative purposes, an inflated picture of the number of houses actually built.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner is getting somewhat mixed up on statistics. Such houses will be counted only once.  If there were houses built last year&mdash;as Deputy Faulkner says&mdash;or built this year and they are completed and occupied, the fact that they are counted as soon as the ESB connection is made to them is the very same as if they were counted when the grant was paid&mdash;the grant can be paid more <Col N="30" /> quickly some times than at other times. It makes no difference at all; they will be counted only once.  By no stretch of the imagination could we be connecting now houses built by Fianna Fáil in 1971-72.  I think that is what the Deputy is trying to get at.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that if a house was built in March, 1975 that house would not be reckoned as a housing statistic until the final grant was paid&mdash;which could be months later&mdash;whereas, in relation to the new system, to which I do not object except for comparative purposes, a house built in March, 1977 would be counted immediately as a statistic and that, therefore, there would be far more houses compressed into the quarter ended 31st March, 1977 than into the quarter ended 31st March, 1975?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

A swing bridge would be of no advantage over a fixed bridge unless extensive dredging operations which would cost millions of pounds were undertaken in the canal and approach channels. The existing swing bridge has now operated as a swing bridge for more than 40 years.  Traffic needs in the area do not warrant the construction of a swing bridge involving extensive outlay. The holding of a local inquiry would not serve any useful purpose <Col N="37" /> and the necessity for a bridge order for a swing bridge has not been established.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the amendment is to allow the Minister to request the director to carry out particular inquiries.  This would not give the Minister any influence over the director or over his findings.  It would simply be a matter of asking him to investigate something.  This is a sensible provision. From time to time Members might consider some practice detrimental to consumer interests and it is only proper that the Minister, acting in response to representations, should be able to request the director to carry out an inquiry and to report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>What exactly are the practices or proposed practices referred to here?  Are they in relation to advertising or do they deal more broadly than that with consumer affairs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>They relate to the functions conferred on the director.  These functions are at present confined to misleading trade descriptions.  If, at some future date, other functions in relation to consumer affairs devolve upon the director the examinations he <Col N="58" /> could carry out would naturally cover a wider field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that the phrase &ldquo;any such practices or proposed practices&rdquo; would seem to refer back to (a), which seems to relate to advertising and the provision of information in relation to and description of goods, services, accommodation and facilities?  The words &ldquo;any such practices or proposed practices&rdquo; would therefore appear to be confined to these particular categories and that would seem to inhibit the director from possible future extensions of his functions on lines all of us would desire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If future extensions were made I think they could be framed in such manner as would ensure the Minister would have the option in respect of such extended functions of requesting that an examination be carried out.  This should be read in conjunction with subsection (7) which provides:</P>
      <P>The Director may do all such acts or things as are necessary or expedient for the purposes of the exercise of his functions under this Act.</P>
      <P>In that sense I do not think one would be confined solely to the matters mentioned in subsection (5) (a).  I agree with the Deputy that it is desirable that as wide discretion as possible be given to the director and, if it is possible to improve the provision, I shall certainly do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary consider an amendment on Report Stage which would broaden the phrase used here, &ldquo;any such practices or proposed practices&rdquo;, by adding something like &ldquo;or any other consumer matters which the Minister may request him to examine or which the director considers it is proper to examine in the public interest&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is somewhat similar to a later amendment by the Deputy.  There are problems in extending in an imprecise manner the functions <Col N="59" /> of the director beyond those directly contingent on this Bill.  Referring in that way to any other consumer practices is, I am advised, not clear enough.  I agree it is probably all right in the case of examinations but where one gets into the area of powers that might be challenged in the courts it is important that the powers be sufficiently clearly defined so that there can be no question of the director's actions being challenged as <i>ultra vires.</i> I agree it might be worthwhile having a look to see if we can improve the provision here, but not going as far, perhaps, as the Deputy suggests, to widen the functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The danger I see, and I said this as far back as the Second Stage, is that the director has a very narrow jurisdiction.  His jurisdiction is confined to the matters with which this Bill deals.  When one looks at consumer affairs generally then the Bill has a very limited jurisdiction.  It deals with only one aspect of the whole field and many would say, with some justification, that the aspect with which the Government and the Minister chose to deal first is perhaps not the most important.  I am not saying it is unimportant but it is one of the least urgent.  Though all aspects are to some extent urgent, if the other legislation to follow were to take as long as this Bill took, the director could well be in a situation in which he would hardly have a day's work to do until such time as his functions are broadened by subsequent Bills.  That is why I think, particularly as there is such an urgent need in regard to consumer affairs in spheres other than just this one, an effort should be made to give the consumer as broad a jurisdiction as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the case the Deputy is making certainly in so far as examinations to be carried out by the director are concerned.  Obviously if one is giving him substantive powers to do things as distinct from examining them, one has to be a little more careful. However, I have said I would consider any amendment which would remove any doubt there might be as <Col N="60" /> to the scope of the directors power to make examinations on request from the Minister being unduly narrow.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to place an obligation <Col N="61" /> on the director to publicise the provisions of consumer protection legislation in this and other measures.  It is somewhat narrower than the Deputy's amendment.  I think it is better to confine him to a more manageable task, namely, to publicisation of legislation.  If he were given the remit to make publicity about any matter affecting the consumer, which might be one which had no relevance to any statute, conceivably it would be giving him such a wide task that he might not do the more important things and it is possible that he could go off at a tangent.  For that reason it is better to confine the power in relation to the giving of information solely to matters which are, if you like, the State's business to publicise, that is, legislation.  While accepting the general purpose of the amendment submitted by Deputy O'Malley, I have redrafted it in this way to meet a more net point.</P>

      <P>The redrafting has taken 90 per cent of the value out of the original amendment, if you take No. 27 as the original and No. 26 as the Parliamentary Secretary's redraft of it.  Am I right in saying that amendment No. 26 is only to bring to the attention of the public the provision of legislation and nothing else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of consumer legislation that exists is limited anyway.  It is confined to about five or six series of Acts of which this one forms part of the series known as the Merchandise Marks Acts, going back to 1887, and there are about four others of specifically consumer legislation, which is what amendment No. 26 seems to deal with.  There is not therefore a great deal of it and it is not all that difficult for the public to become aware of its provisions in the normal way.  It does seem to confine the director very considerably in his functions, in that his only power to bring the attention of the public to such matters is in relation to legislation. It is a fundamental part of our jurisprudence that everyone is supposed to know the law and everyone, <Col N="62" /> technically at least, has access to the law and can find out, often from a public representative, from a citizens' advice bureau, from a solicitor or someone like that, what the law is on a particular topic if they are not already aware of it, or they can look it up in a library.</P>
      <P>It is not extending the director's powers very much to say he will have the power to publicise legislation. That is already publicised in a certain way.  What I had wanted to do in No. 27 was not alone to publish and disseminate that type of information but also to publish and disseminate information about consumer affairs generally.  There is a great lack of that type of information.  It is only in the last week or two that we had a statement from the consumers' association in this country to the effect that the kind of information that is available, for example, to the consumer in Britain or in virtually any of the continental countries is not available here.  While, unfortunately, with all the papers I have on consumer matters from Europe and elsewhere, I cannot place just at the moment that particular statement, I think I paraphrase it reasonably accurately when I say they drew attention in a letter they wrote to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and a similar letter they wrote to the Minister for Agriculture in the last week or so, to the huge increase in the price of meat last year and, in particular, apart from the increase in the cost of meat that was paid to the farmer, there was a huge increase in the margins that the trade were able to obtain in 1976.  The feeling of the association was that if the kind of information that was readily available daily in Britain and in continental countries had been available here, the outrageous increases, which were up to 50 per cent in the price of beef and up to 38 per cent in the price of mutton and lamb, would not have taken place, that there would have been greater consumer resistance. Consumers were entitled to know from day to day the movement in prices so that they could make their arrangements accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a valid point.  There is no <Col N="63" /> service that I know of at the present time, either on television or radio or in newspapers, that monitors regularly the prices of various basic commodities. These prices are available, not just from a producer's point of view but from a consumer's point of view, in Britain from the BBC.  They are available, as far as I know, in all the continental EEC countries.  They are not available here and there seems to be no encouragement to provide them. The Parliamentary Secretary should urge RTE, for example, in the interest of the consumer, to provide that kind of information every day, perhaps twice a day.  The price of beef is quoted every evening on RTE radio, it is quoted for the benefit of the farmers and in what, to the housewife, are rather unintelligible terms, the price per 100 kilogrammes live weight.  No unfortunate housewife can convert that into £'s per pound.  You would need a computer to do it.  The price of fish is given on most mornings of the week but it is the wholesale price and bears little or no relation to what the housewife has to pay in the shops.  The Director of Consumer Affairs should have the power to publish information of this kind which would be beneficial to the consumer and which would make a significant contribution to keeping down prices.</P>

      <P>The Prices Commission issue a report once a month and I must remind the Parliamentary Secretary that the report is published at periods which vary between one and three months after the month in respect of which the report is issued. The monitoring of prices as they were three or four months previously is of no value to the consumer or the housewife. It is more an academic exercise than anything else.  Furthermore, when the lists produced by the Prices Commission are adopted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the price increases are imposed by him, he has forbidden his Department or the Prices Commission to advertise these increases in the newspapers.  This was <Col N="64" /> always the practice until about 18 months or two years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing in amendment No. 27 the publication and dissemination of information about consumer affairs generally.  If the price of commodities, basic necessities, is not information about consumer affairs generally, then I do not know what is.  The situation is that it is almost impossible to get this information. I think it is the view of the Consumer Association&mdash;and if it is I would concur with it&mdash;that the absence of this information is a significant factor in the inflation rate of 20 per cent and upwards which we have had in the past year.  If we had the daily publication or frequent publication of the prices of vital everyday commodities the element of competition would be much stronger and prices would be kept down to a much greater extent.  That has been the experience in other countries where it is the practice of those who are responsible for consumer interests to publish such information at very frequent intervals, generally once a day and even twice a day in some instances. This serves to highlight attempts to raise prices unnecessarily.  The consumer association gave as an example the extortionate increase of 50 per cent in the price of meat in 1976.  The farmers did not get 50 per cent more but various people along the line got 50 per cent more and the housewife had to pay 50 per cent more, though in many cases she was unaware of the trend in prices because the whole thing was so secretive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be the function of the Director of Consumer Affairs to arrange for the publication of that information as often as possible.  We have a State-owned television station and the publication of this information <Col N="65" /> every day would be regarded as a public service and would be appreciated. The tendency of the Minister is to hush things up and not even to publish by way of advertisement the price increases which he allows, except for a very limited category which he is apparently compelled by law to publish. The great bulk of price increases are not published.</P>
    <P>It is quite inadequate for the Parliamentary Secretary to argue that it is enough for the Director of Consumer Affairs simply to publish and disseminate information about consumer legislation. That is far too limited a function. He should also publish or arrange for the publication and dissemination of information about consumer affairs generally.  The amount of legislation we have is fairly limited and its value in many instances is somewhat out of date.  That is why I urged the necessity of controlling consumer credit, where there are undoubtly abuses that cause considerable hardship to many consumers.  I have also urged the necessity of updating the Sale of Goods Act of 1893 which was designed for an era totally different from the times in which we live.  It should be possible for general information, particularly in relation to prices, constantly to be available to the public.  They are concerned about this and many people are suffering grave hardship as a result of the uncontrolled inflation we have seen under this Government during the past four years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I fear that if the Director of Consumer Affairs were given the job of publicising all matters which in his opinion, are relevant knowledge for the consumer, he would be drawn into a very expensive operation in the area of publicity and, furthermore, he would be diverted from his primary task which is to deal with certain practices which are misleading to the consumer and diverted from the more precise functions which he is being given in this legislation. There is grave danger in giving too wide a remit to any statutory officer. If that is done it will be impossible for him to do the job which he is intended by Parliament to do and he will be <Col N="66" /> forced into a situation where he will have to select one aspect of his job on which to concentrate, thus not giving sufficient time to other aspects. I should prefer to see a defined task given to the director.  If he were drawn into the situation in which he was publicising comparative prices in the shops in individual provincial towns and comparing the prices in the shops of Mrs. X and Mrs. Y in Abbeyfeale, the task would be so enormous that he would have no time left for the work which he is primarily being given.  It is for that reason that I have decided that his function in relation to the provision of public information should be confined to information in regard to legislation, present or future.</P>
      <P>One must realise that the provision of consumer information in the general sense, as distinct from information about legislation and rights conferred by legislation, is not solely a matter for the Government and should never become such.  It is also a matter for voluntary consumer agencies and other agencies which may be acting with a degree of State support but not acting exclusively as agents of the Government. There is a big role to be played, for instance by the consumer associations themselves in giving general information to the public about consumer matters.  Perhaps one of the good examples of what voluntary organisations can do is the example of <i>Which</i> magazine published by a consumers' association.</P>
      <P>I would not agree with the concept of the director's function which would give him the power to take over, in effect, the functions of consumer organisations or to move into their area of competence to the extent to which Deputy O'Malley would seem to envisage.  As far as the specific matter of price information is concerned, it is fair to say that the national broadcasting company provide information about prices through one of their morning radio programmes and also they have a programme on television called <i>Alert</i> which provides fairly substantial information each week about consumer matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="67" /> I have set up a committee to be known as the Consumer Education Committee.  This committee consists of representatives of the Consumers' Association of Ireland, the Irish Housewives' Association and the Irish Countrywomen's Association along with the Department of Education and other people who are likely to be able to contribute in a useful way. The committee have been given a general remit to recommend ways and means whereby consumer education may be improved.  This committee are already in session and in their terms of reference I specifically requested that an early report be provided.  They may recommend that certain functions in the area of consumer education&mdash; I would hope functions more precise than those envisaged by Deputy O'Malley&mdash;might be conferred in the future on the Director of Consumer Affairs.  I would be favourably disposed to any recommendations which might come from as representative a body as the Consumer Education Committee.  I agree with Deputy O'Malley on the need to provide more and better information about comparative prices so as to enhance competition. However, the best form of competition in relation to prices is competition at local level between shops which are within a reasonable range of a given consumer.  Publicising information about prices on a national scale, while it may be useful, is not often of great relevance to an individual consumer.  For a consumer in Cork to know that he can get a commodity cheapest in a supermarket somewhere in Dublin is not really relevant information as far as he is concerned.  It may be relevant as far as somebody in Dublin is concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying it is not useful, but there are more useful ways of supplying the information as far as the consumer in Cork is concerned. For that reason I am initiating improvements in relation to price displays in shops.  Existing lists display the prices of individual commodities in very small type and consumers usually cannot see them until they are well into the shop and perhaps have made their purchases.  The proposal I am making, and will implement in the very near future, will provide for price displays in much larger characters in such a place as can be seen by shoppers before they enter a shop so that people if they are in the shopping area of a town and are looking for individual commodities will be able readily to compare prices by, so to speak, window-shopping without necessarily going into a shop at all, or feeling under any moral or other obligation to purchase something, having gone into the shop.</P>
      <P>Much can be done also through the agency of the National Social Service Council, who are concerned with advice to the consumer generally, in the matter of providing comparative information about prices.  Obviously the council in question might not have the resources to carry out comparative price surveys themselves.  However, they could perhaps enable individual shops voluntarily to submit their prices in respect of individual commodities which could be displayed or publicised on a regular basis by the council in a particular town.  This would have the benefit that first of all, it would be voluntary; it would provide free advertising, so to speak, for the shops who submitted their lists of the commodities which had been chosen for a particular week for a particular town; and in the publicising together of the prices of a number of different shops in respect of the commodities chosen the shopper would be able to see this list either as displayed or as publicised in a publication and would be able at a given time to draw useful conclusions which he could immediately put into effect in relation to shopping in his own town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="69" /> Coming back to the interjection of Deputy Haughey, perhaps I overstated my case.  I do agree with him that, to a certain extent, information about prices in Dublin is useful to a person in Cork and <i>vice versa,</i> and it could exercise a degree of pressure on the shopkeeper in the town where the price is higher to reduce the price. However, I feel that the type of local information which I have suggested, and which I am taking steps to have provided by the new display order, is more effective and of more practical use to the individual shopper.  I feel that the function in relation to the provision of information which is given by amendment No. 26 is the best and most appropriate function to be given to the director at this time. However, if the Consumer Education Committee, who have been asked to bring in an early report, recommend that wider functions&mdash;more precise than those envisaged in Deputy O'Malley's amendment but wider nevertheless&mdash;should be given to the director, I will of course be favourably disposed to considering amending the director's functions in this matter in later legislation, of which there will be a considerable amount coming before this House as a result of work which is already in hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have two amendments before us, Nos. 26 and 27, one in the name of the Minister, the other in the name of Deputy O'Malley.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will accuse me of partisanship but I cannot resist the conclusion in my mind that Deputy O'Malley's amendment is by far the more beneficial in this context. Let me say to the Parliamentary Secretary that the amendment in the name of the Minister is very technical in its import.  The Minister's amendment wants to confer a function on this new director:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) to ensure that the provisions of any legislation providing for the protection of consumers that, in his opinion, should be brought to the attention of the public are brought to the attention of the public and for this purpose to publicise those provisions in such manner and to <Col N="70" /> such extent as he thinks appropriate,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That function deals only with the provisions of the legislation.  I do not think that that is of any great value to the general public.  The provisions of the legislation would be of interest to us, to lawyers and to technical people involved, but this new statutory creature's functions are to relate to the general public.  With all due respect, the general public are not interested in the provisions of legislation.  They are interested in matters that affect them. The provision of the legislation will be largely directed towards manufacturers, salesmen and shopkeepers but not specifically towards the general public.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley's amendment, on the other hand, talks about publishing and disseminating information about consumer protection and consumer affairs generally.  The consumer is concerned with information for the general public about the products they purchase and the services they avail of, not the technical provisions of the legislation itself.  It is the implication of the provisions of the legislation that are of interest to the general public.  If the Director of Consumer Affairs does no more than say that subsection (3) of section 6 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1964 or whatever it is, states that, he will have complied with the provisions of the Minister's amendment.  Surely that is not what we are concerned with.  We are concerned with relating this legislation to the ordinary citizen going about his everyday affairs.  Deputy O'Malley is right to have pointed out that what concerns consumers basically is information about the quality and price of goods, the services, the guarantees, the value and relationship of those goods or services to the person buying them, and not to the legislation governing the situation.</P>
    <P>One aspect of this matter is in relation to people such as coeliac sufferers who have a vital interest in the composition of the articles they are buying.  The Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities looked into this question in another context and recommended that in <Col N="71" /> future it should be compulsory for persons producing or offering for sale goods which contain gluten to specify the nature of the product as far as gluten is concerned.  It could be made mandatory for a person selling a product which contains gluten to specify that it contained gluten or it could be mandatory that all goods must state whether they are gluten free or not.  That is vital information so far as a coeliac sufferer is concerned. If a coeliac sufferer inadvertently consumed a product which had gluten in it, the effects could be very detrimental.  We discussed this matter with the representative of the Irish Coeliac Society, and in the joint committee we made a recommendation that the proposed EEC directive be amended so that manufacturers would be required to indicate the presence or absence of gluten in their products and that this be supplemented by domestic legislation to deal with packaged products coming from non-member countries.  I would have thought that this new status would deal with that sort of thing.  Under Deputy O'Malley's amendment this person would have the duty of dealing with a matter of that sort, but under the Minister's amendment he would not.  The Minister's amendment is much more restrictive and is of a much more technical nature.  When discussing the sections as distinct from the amendments I will refer to the functions of this new office in regard to the whole EEC situation.  I have only now mentioned the question of whether or not it would be necessary for this director to be on the lookout for the sort of situation to which I have referred and to have a duty to act in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley wishes this officer to have a function of publishing and disseminating information generally about consumer affairs.  If the Minister's amendment was broadened in that way it would enable the Director of Consumer Affairs to be more useful to ordinary people in their everyday lives.  As it is phrased at the moment it is of use only to practitioners and persons who are specifically and <Col N="72" /> directly involved in the business of producing and selling goods.</P>
    <P>There is a whole new body of legislation in this area emanating from Europe, from the Commission and the Council and I would have thought that some reference in this section to that situation would have been desirable.  There are all sorts of directives emanating from the EEC about labelling, presentation and advertising and as far as I can see in the Minister's amendment the Director of Consumer Affairs will have no function in regard to these directives, so that the publishing and disseminating of information which would be of specific value to the consumer is the most important thing here.  I am not too clear about the Parliamentary Secretary's intervention with regard to this consumer education council.</P>

      <P>It is a rather peculiar way to defend the provisions of the Bill by the Parliamentary Secretary telling us that while we are discussing the Bill a committee are sitting and, depending on what they say, he may or may not amend those particular provisions and elaborate on them.  It places this side of the House at a very considerable disadvantage.  I do not think, whatever they come up with in their report, that they would be foolish enough to restrict the Director of Consumer Affairs in his functions to the extent of excluding the functions that Deputy O'Malley wishes to confer on him. This is an unsatisfactory way of dealing with the Bill.  The director should certainly have the power we wish to see conferred on him in amendment No. 27.  He should be permitted to be of the greatest possible usefulness to consumers by providing them with all relevant information about consumer affairs generally as proposed in Deputy O'Malley's amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer briefly to the point made by Deputy Haughey.  The position in relation to <Col N="74" /> coeliacs is primarily a matter for the Minister for Health.  I know that discussions are taking place in relation to the points made by the joint committee in regard to how best they can be met. As far as EEC directives are concerned or regulations made by the EEC which provide new rights for the consumer these are matters of which the consumers should be aware.  These will come within the term &ldquo;legislation&rdquo; contained in amendment No. 26 and, therefore, if the Director of Consumer Affairs feels that information should be made available to the public about EEC legislation as well as domestic legislation he will, under the terms of amendment No. 26, be in a position to do so and also be authorised to do so.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey may be under a misapprehension in regard to the functions of the Consumer Education Committee.  This committee are not confined in any way to dealing with what should be the educational functions to be granted to the Director of Consumer Affairs.  The committee are concerned with all the possible agents which should play a part in consumer education.  The schools, for instance, would probably have the biggest part of all to play.  Television, the newspapers, consumer associations and voluntary bodies of various sorts will all have a part to play.  The committee will as far as possible make recommendations about how consumer education in the general sense can be improved within the existing channels.</P>

      <P>Yes, but they have also been told if they wish to suggest any new areas of activity or any additional expenditures which would be required they should specify what these expenditures are. I feel that the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Malley would give the Director of Consumer Affairs a laudable but possibly large task which would divert him from his major functions, which are the rooting out of individual practices which are actually deceiving consumers.  I feel if he were given the broad functions envisaged by Deputy O'Malley's <Col N="75" /> amendment he would be expanding into an area where other bodies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have only given an indication at random of the sort of bodies I have in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary a little more about the coeliac situation.  I am sure he is aware that there are 15,000 people in the country who must abstain from any product which contains gluten.  It can be quite disastrous for any one of these 15,000 people to inadvertently partake of the smallest particle of gluten.  This is the sort of situation at which this Bill should be specifically directed.  A directive is emerging from Brussels about the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer.  This is exactly the area this Bill deals with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That directive is in course of preparation.  It is under consideration and being discussed and amended and processed through the normal machinery of the EEC institutions. The Minister for Industry and Commerce is the appropriate Minister in this country to deal with that directive, not the Minister for Health, although the Minister for Health also has a function in regard to it.  It is primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Joint Committee made a very specific recommendation the purpose of which was to ensure that our Minister for Industry and Commerce and his advisers and officials in dealing with this directive would ensure that it covered this matter and that the containing or non-containing of gluten <Col N="76" /> in a particular product would be stipulated on the produce itself.</P>
    <P>The Coeliac Society and the committee were quite satisfied that this recommendation would be implemented and that, so far as it lay within their power, the Irish side in the discussions and negotiations would press to have this done.  Some indication has been emerging recently that this may not be going to happen, and that the Irish Minister for Industry and Commerce may not be pressing to have this stipulation included in the directive.  I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary is in a position to give me an assurance about this now, but I should be grateful if, before we conclude the discussion on this Bill, he would indicate what the position is.  This is particularly relevant to the functions of this new Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    <P>It is one thing, and it is beneficial and advantageous that the Director of Consumer Affairs should be able to help out the general public in so far as the quality of goods, the price of goods, or misleading advertisements are concerned, but surely it is far more important that he should be in a position to ensure that persons whose health and well-being could be affected by the composition of a particular product are protected.  That is why I should like to see Deputy O'Malley's amendment accepted.  I believe if it were accepted it would broaden the scope of the functions of the director sufficiently to enable him to take this sort of thing into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>He could not enforce labelling.  The Deputy is talking about labelling requirements.  We are not really talking about labelling here. Deputy O'Malley's amendment would not give the director power to ensure that an individual firm put an individual label on their product.</P>

However, I just mention that by way of illustration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="77" /> It is not really central to the argument I am making.  The argument I am endeavouring to make is basically that Deputy O'Malley's amendment is directed towards helping the ordinary consumer as a consumer, whereas the Minister's amendment is directed towards the legislation itself rather than to the application and implications of the legislation in practice.  The Parliamentary Secretary is relying a good deal on this consumer education committee. This is a very unsatisfactory way of dealing with this situation.  I am not clear what the difference is between consumer information and consumer education.</P>

If there is some subtle difference in this area between the functions the Director of Consumer Affairs will perform and this committee is performing, the sensible thing would be to incorporate permanent provision for such a committee in this legislation and not have us in <Col N="79" /> this ridiculous position of dealing with this Bill now without knowledge of what the committee will say or do.  If there is a job to be done in investigating how information or education should be disseminated to the general public or through different channels that should be an ongoing process. Such a committee should have been incorporated in this legislation with some function of advising or being in a consultative capacity to the Director of Consumer Affairs.  It seems very haphazard and short-sighted to bring in legislation and have it discussed while, at the same time, having an <i>ad hoc</i> temporary committee about to make recommendations and then go out of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the question is put I should like to reiterate what I said earlier in relation to the necessity to give information to the public by a permanent authority or body with adequate finances for that purpose.  It appears to me that the Director of Consumer Affairs is misnamed if his functions are confined to the adminisstration of the Merchandise Marks Acts and this legislation.  If he is going to live up to his title he should have powers to publicise the various matters about which we have spoken and he should give information on consumer affairs to the public.</P>
      <P>The functions of the Director of Consumer Affairs are very limited under this Bill.  I would not mind that if there were some permanent body in a position to assist consumers generally, as is the case in other countries.  In Germany and France the State fully finances what are called comparative testing units for the benefit of consumers and those countries subsidise substantially their consumer organisations.  There is virtually no subsidy for any such organisation here and, because they are part-time and voluntary organisations, their effectiveness is limited through no fault of their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I got this information from the Consumers' Association of Ireland who want to see some permanent authority deal with this matter.  They <Col N="80" /> do not want to carry out on their present basis the kind of jobs the Parliamentary Secretary is suggesting. They cannot do it on the basis on which they operate.  They tell me that Denmark has a home economics council financed entirely by public funds and a consumer council with 50 per cent State funds.  Even a country with a small population, for instance New Zealand, has a consumer council that is publicly funded to the extent of 50 per cent.  The general view of the Consumers' Association of Ireland is that we should have a consumer information and research centre that would have a broad series of functions&mdash;very much broader than what is proposed here for the misnamed Director of Consumer Affairs. The director will deal only with merchandise marks, he will have nothing to do with the vast area of consumer affairs.  At one stage the Parliamentary Secretary said he did not want to interfere unduly with the existing organs who were giving information on consumer protection.  I asked him what they were and he referred to teachers at school&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  He referred also to the Consumers' Association of Ireland.  I would imagine that 95 per cent of teachers have no great specific knowledge of consumer affairs, of consumer legislation or consumer protection generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Through no fault of their own their ability to assist consumers generally is limited.  The Consumers' Association of Ireland&mdash;and there are other consumer bodies also on a voluntary basis&mdash;are the first to recognise that because they are voluntary and funds are limited they can do very little.  They point to the good work done in other countries where there is a consumer protection authority or information and research centre with statutory recognition and with public funds.  The passage of legislation to protect the consumer is of limited value if there is not a <Col N="81" /> permanent authority to enforce it and to ensure that the value of the legislation percolates to the consumer.</P>
      <P>The setting up of an <i>ad hoc</i> committee, as referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary, is not the answer. Such a committee may do some good but it is very limited compared with what has been done in other countries and what could be done here at comparatively little cost.  If we are to have a Director of Consumer Affairs who warrants his title, amendment No. 27 should be accepted.  It should be accepted for the reasons given by Deputy Haughey in some detail.</P>
      <P>If the Director of Consumer Affairs is to be confined in his functions as the Parliamentary Secretary wants, it would be much better to describe him as the director of merchandise marks or trade descriptions because that is all he will be.  This was pointed out to me by those concerned with a rather backward state of consumer affairs in Ireland.  It would be much better to give him an accurate name rather than mislead the public into thinking he has the right, power or duty to deal with consumer affairs generally.  He has not and, therefore, his title is a serious misnomer.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has not given any valid reason why amendment No. 27 should not be accepted. The only reason I have heard from him was that it would dissipate or widen too greatly what he called the remit of the director and he considered that matters would not be dealt with in sufficient detail.  Presumably the director will not operate on his own.  He will have a staff to help him and, if necessary, his office can be extended to ensure that he can deal with all aspects of consumer protection, information and education that need dealing with, that need enforcement and publicity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a difference of philosophical <Col N="82" /> approach between myself and Deputy O'Malley to this amendment.  He is anxious to give the Director of Consumer Affairs so large a task in the matter of provision of public information as would be unmanageable without very substantial provisions of public funds at the taxpayers expense. I am not anxious that that should be the case nor am I anxious to agree to some functions being given in broad terms when I am not satisfied that the resources existed to fulfil them.</P>

      <P>In page 7, subsection (6), line 51, after &ldquo;this Act&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or any other consumer protection legislation, existing or future,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to subsection (6) and is connected with the point made by Deputy Haughey when he concluded on the previous amendments. Under this subsection as it stands the Minister may by order confer on the director such further functions as he considers appropriate in relation to any matters to which the Acts or this Act relate.  &ldquo;The Acts&rdquo; are the Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887 to 1971.  This Bill, although it is not called the <Col N="84" /> Merchandise Marks Bill, is an extension of the Merchandise Marks Acts. It has been called the &ldquo;Consumer Information Bill&rdquo; to give the impression that it is something new which had never been thought of before, although an Act was passed on this topic as recently as 1971.</P>
    <P>Because the Minister has power to extend the functions of the misnamed Director of Consumer Affairs, the director is confined here to further functions in relation to merchandise marks and trade descriptions.  As the Parliamentary Secretary said, we would need legislation to give the director the kind of powers Deputy Haughey and I feel he should have and which the Parliamentary Secretary, after a lot of pressure, now seems to agree he should have ideally but which he refuses to give him because of the cost to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to go back a couple of years on the question of things which members of the present Government thought desirable and which they would not consider under any circumstances because of the cost to the taxpayers. I am referring in particular to food subsidies which two years ago were unthinkable and were called gimmicks when suggested by this side of the House.  The Government said these subsidies would never be implemented because of the cost to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The same argument, equally full of holes, is being made today by the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to extending the functions and jurisdiction of the Director of the Consumer Affairs.  As Deputy Haughey pointed out, if the money is not available to let this man administer, enforce and have jurisdiction over all aspects of consumer legislation at the moment, then at least give him power and as the money becomes available extend his functions each year and the areas at which he will look, for example as is done in regard to the medical services.</P>
    <P>As money becomes available the State provides a greater degree of medical care.  For example, there has been a statutory obligation on the State from many years past&mdash;I think it goes back to the Health Act, 1953&mdash;to provide <Col N="85" /> free dental care for a large category of people in the community: every medical card holder, every primary school child and certain categories of insured workers.  Unfortunately, due to financial stringency, these people are not able to exercise their rights.  Nevertheless the statutory right to these services has continued to exist since 1953.</P>
    <P>If we cannot give the Director of Consumer Affairs power to deal with all aspects of consumer protection from the start, we should at least give him the power to do it and the money to do part of it in the first year, more the second year and more in the third year.  That is the normal method of development.  Because it seems that legislation is necessary to extend these functions outside of merchandise marks to the more vital areas of consumer protection, such as information, education, the control of credit and matters other than advertising trade descriptions, which is very important to consumers, the Minister should have the power here to enable these extensions of function to be done by order.</P>
    <P>For that reason I have suggested inserting after the words &ldquo;this Act&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or any other consumer protection legislation, existing or future,&rdquo;.  That would cover everything. If necessary, perhaps we could introduce a few more words to amend that amendment.  I presume it would cover EEC directives, which will be increasingly important in the next couple of years in consumer affairs. I would imagine the word &ldquo;legislation&rdquo; used in Irish legislation on its own covers only Irish legislation.  If necessary by amendment of this amendment, we could make it clear that it covered EEC legislation also. There will be quite an amount of EEC legislation.  I have been in Brussels recently inquiring about that very topic.  There is a lot of it at the stage of near completion and hopefully it will be implemented within the next year or so.  It is far more radical than anything proposed here and far more likely to be of benefit to the consumer than some of what we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>Therefore I would ask the Parliamentary <Col N="86" /> Secretary to accept this perfectly reasonable amendment.  It gives the Minister power to make these orders.  It does not compel him to make them if he thinks it inappropriate. At least it gives him power to do so, and it can be done quickly without the rather laborious necessity for legislation in this House which takes a very long time, not merely within the House but in its preparation and various other stages before it ever comes to be published as a Bill or introduced here.</P>

      <P>I am in sympathy with the objectives of Deputy O'Malley in proposing this amendment.  I am prepared to consider something which would meet his case.  However, the problem is that the concept of consumer protection legislation contained in his amendment is imprecise.  To be sure that the powers were being properly given the particular legislation should be specified more definitely.  That is the advice of our legal advisers.  I would be prepared to consider an amendment, if one could devise one that would get over this problem of precision in relation to the actual legislation one is referring to when one speaks of consumer protection legislation.</P>
      <P>One possible way in which this could be done is that the legislation could be deemed to be such by affirmative resolution of the House.  On whether provision would be needed in the amendment to have it take effect only if an affirmative resolution was passed, deeming in respect of a particular power to be given to the director, that the legislation in relation to which it was being given was consumer protection legislation, I would need to consult further. Possibly it could be done.  In any event it is my intention that any extra powers which would be given to the director under subsection (6) would be given to him only after an affirmative resolution had been passed here and an opportunity for discussion had been afforded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to assure the Deputy that I will seek to draft an amendment between now and Report Stage <Col N="87" /> which would meet the case he has made but get over the technical difficulty to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>As long as it is covered I do not mind.  It does seem that within the next couple of years the Community legislation will be of immense significance.  Some of it is <Col N="88" /> very radical indeed by our standards. Of course, some of it is based on a totally different type of law to ours and to the British.  In particular I have seen the proposed directive relating to product liability where there is tremendous protection for the injured consumer but where the most enormous difficulties will be created for manufacturers, who in this country have never had to face such problems.  Indeed it may put a lot of manufacturing undertaking here out of business unless some amendment can be negotiated by the Government.  Certainly it is a potentially very serious thing if it is to be applied here suddenly.  In parts of the United States similar legislation is in force.  The difficulties created there for manufacturing firms are fairly considerable.  There are many people, within the consumer lobby, in the United States who are having second thoughts about such extensive product liability remaining part of the law.  I mention that in passing in reference to EEC legislation simply because I want to demonstrate that some of it by our standards will be extremely radical and important and may well have great effects on business and affairs here generally.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I am happy to withdraw this amendment on the basis that it will be redrafted by the Parliamentary Secretary for Report Stage and that it will be clear that EEC legislation is included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
      <P>In page 8, after subsection (9), to add the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(10) (a)  Whenever it appears to the Minister that the Director is temporarily unable to discharge his duties, the Minister may appoint a person to act in place of the Director during such inability or for such shorter period as the Minister thinks proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  A person appointed under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall have all the powers, rights and duties conferred on the <Col N="89" /> Director by this Act and each reference in this Act to the Director shall be deemed to include a reference to such a person.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is an essential provision in a case where the director may become unable, for one reason or another, temporarily to discharge his duties.  There is a similar provision to meet a similar occasion in the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, in relation to the office of examiner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to provide it for the civil service in general.  In regard to this post, however, specific functions are laid down by statute.  There would have to be somebody to devolve that post to somebody else when the director would be incapable, for one reason or another, to discharge his duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If this were a provision applying to the public service I would not worry but subsection (4) provides that the director shall be independent in the performance of his functions.  I query the Parliamentary Secretary rather than argue with him on this aspect.  Will this provision take from the rugged independence of the director?  It seems to me the amendment will in effect give the Minister a way around the independence conferred by subsection (4).  If the amendment stated &ldquo;when it appears to the Minister, for some good reason&rdquo;, or something of that nature, I would not worry but the subsection now will read:</P>
      <P>Whenever it appears to the Minister that the director is temporarily unable to discharge his duties,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That leaves the situation very open. There is no objective test that the Minister would have to conform to. Apparently, he would only have to be of the opinion that the director was unable to discharge his duties and then he could appoint somebody in his place.  From the practical common sense point of view there is a need for some such provision but I am wondering <Col N="90" /> whether the amendment does not go too far and take from the independence of this new office.  That is why I asked what happens in a case where, for instance, the Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce became incapable of performing his duties temporarily, for some reason or another.  Presumably the Minister can make an appointment in his place, but is there some overall provision relating to that situation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say.  I presume it is covered by the Ministers and Secretaries Acts.  Here we are creating an office which is very definitely separate; it is not integrated within the departmental functions in the same way as the office of secretary or assistant secretary.  The functions of this office are referred to specifically in statute.  I can see some point in what the Deputy is saying.  If one were sufficiently malevolent one could suggest that this is not for the best, but it is restricted to a situation where the director temporarily would be unable to perform his duties.  I would have no objection to the incorporation of the words &ldquo;for some good reason&rdquo;. I do not think it would make much difference because a Minister is supposed to act for a good reason anyway.  If it makes the Deputy more satisfied I would agree to have the suggestion incorporated.</P>

      <P>As the provision stands, it seems that the director has that obligation because it states that &ldquo;the Director shall in each year make a report to the Minister in relation to the performance of his functions in the preceding year&rdquo;.  The difficulty is that he could produce that report to the Minister on 31st December of the following year but the Minister may not publish the report or lay it before the Oireachtas.  That has been happening all the time.  Some of these bodies produce statutory reports three years <Col N="92" /> after the year under review.  I got a report recently relating to 1972-74.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about this section because of my duties as Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  It seems to me that the Parliamentary Secretary is looking on this whole consumer affairs situation in a vacuum.  He is setting about creating this office of Director of Consumer Affairs as if the EEC did not exist.  There is no doubt that in this area, as in many other areas, the impetus is coming from Brussels.  A great deal of what we are doing here now is being done under the spur of directives from Brussels.  That applies right across the board, but it is particularly true in regard to consumer affairs.  The Commission in Brussels are very active in this area and we are going to be compelled to move quicker than we might otherwise have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would be foolish to let this legislation go forward without adverting to that situation.  I should like to direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the directive on packaging, labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuff and ranges of <Col N="94" /> nominal quantities.  This directive was considered by the Joint Committee who issued a report on it, their 46th Report.  The directive is at a fairly advanced stage and will be with us for implementation soon.  The Joint Committee stated in the course of their report that they had been informed by the Department of Industry and Commerce that many of the matters dealt with in the proposed directive are already provided for in existing legislation administered by that Department, the Department of Health and the then Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  They went on to say that they considered the directive, if adopted, should be implemented in a single domestic instrument which will also specifically repeal any existing statutory provisions.  That directive is on the way but this legislation does not take any cognisance of it.</P>
    <P>I should like to see section 9 amplified considerably in this regard.  The fact that a number of different Departments, as pointed out by the Joint Committee, are concerned with the implementation of the directive makes it necessary to rationalise this situation. As far as legislation from Brussels is concerned this Director of Consumer Affairs should enter immediately into the situation.  If he does not, we are going to have a certain amount of confusion.  It seems to me that we will have a situation where we will have a Director of Consumer Affairs here responsible for the exercise of certain functions in regard to consumer affairs while side by side with that we will have the Department of Industry and Commerce proper responsible for monitoring EEC legislation on consumer affairs, going back and forward to Brussels to discuss it, negotiate about it and dealing with its implications for Ireland.  It is not difficult to foresee a great deal of demarcation problems arising.  We will have a situation where our internal affairs will be affected by legislation from Brussels and at the same time those internal affairs will be the responsibility of a Director of Consumer Affairs.  It is common sense to make the Director of Consumer Affairs responsible for Brussels legislation as well as for our internal situation.</P>

      <P>There are 101 situations in which this arises.  The Revenue Commissioners go backwards and forwards to Brussels dealing with Revenue matters but they are independent of the Minister for Finance in the execution of the tax laws of this country.  There is not necessarily any conflict there.  The practically of the situation is that directives of this sort are dealt with, teased out, negotiated, bargained about an official level long before they ever get near the Council of Ministers and the interests of the different countries are reconciled at official level before a directive is finally promulgated and sent forward to the Council of Ministers.  I, as I say, would foresee a great deal of confusion if the Director of Consumer Affairs is not in on the discussions and negotiations regarding directives before they are finalised.  In addition to that, I think the section must be amplified to ensure that once a directive is adopted by the Council of Ministers its implementation in this country is the responsibility of the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure up to now in regard to this secondary legislation emanating from Brussels is well known.  Broadly <Col N="96" /> speaking, it is of two types.  Some directives are immediately and directly applicable and require no further Act by the Irish Legislature or Executive.  Other directives require domestic instruments for their implementation here.  In the case of a directive which is immediately and directly applicable surely there is a clear case for that being the responsibility of the Director of Consumer Affairs because no further legislative act is required here by the Minister or by Parliament or by anybody else. The directive is directly applicable in our situation and in that case the supervision of the application of the directive should be the responsibility of the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    <P>In the other case I believe the Director of Consumer Affairs should have a function in deciding how the directive is to be implemented by domestic instruments and legislation because it is he who will have to deal with the results of the implementation of the directive.  All in all, I believe there is a need to recast this section very considerably in order to ensure that the Director of Consumer Affairs is, first of all, in on all the discussions and the negotiations before the directives are finalised; secondly, in so far as directives are immediately and directly applicable to this country, that he supervises that applicability and, thirdly, in so far as additional domestic legislation is necessary to implement a directive, he should be the person who promulgates that legislation, even though it is done in the name of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley mentioned there will be a great deal of this legislation coming our way in future from Brussels.  He also mentioned that it will be radical in its implications for us.  A great deal of it will be far ahead of the sort of situation and even of the sort of thinking to which we have been accustomed and I do not think we can afford to let this Bill go on and become a statute without referring to that situation.  This directive to which I am referring deals with matters which will be specifically the concern of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  It deals with labelling, presentation and advertising and, if <Col N="97" /> this Bill is concerned with anything, it is certainly concerned with advertising. As I say, the situation would become very confused and very complicated if we do not provide in some way here in this function-conferring section for this new situation and for bringing the Director of Consumer Affairs into this process at the very early stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a situation where the function in relation to determining policy would devolve on any subsidiary party.  However, I can assure the House that the director will be very fully involved in the consultations leading up to the determination of national policy in relation to any proposed regulation or directive and will be involved in discussions with Brussels officials to that end and will be consulted very fully by our own officials also, but the final responsibility must always rest with and remain with the Minister.</P>
      <P>As far as the promulgation and implementation of legislation is concerned, it is open to us within the terms of this section, as amended, to confer further functions on the Director of Consumer Affairs and these can apply to matters concerning EEC Regulations as well as domestic legislation because, in my view, that is legislation just as much as domestic legislation.  However, I promise to have the matter finally clarified.  In so far as promulgation is concerned, the Director will have a function in relation to the promulgation of the provisions of legislation and the publicising of those provisions, whether that be European Community legislation operative within this jurisdiction or domestic legislation.</P>

      <P>I venture to say I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary fully comprehends as yet what <Col N="98" /> the EEC is all about because his opening remarks just now are quite erroneous.  It is a simple fact of life now that the Minister for Industry and Commerce or any Minister of the Irish Government is no longer the ultimate authority in so far as legislation in this country is concerned. There is a growing body of legislation which comes from Brussels and which is immediately and directly applicable here without any further intervention by anybody in this country.  That is one of the situations that this Bill must take cognisance of.  If some instrument, directive or decision emerges from Brussels dealing with consumer affairs and is immediately and directly operative in Ireland without any further action on our part, then surely the person to see to the implementation of the administration of that directive in our circumstances is the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Implementation is a different thing from deciding whether or not it should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no determining whether or not it should be done.  That has been done already. That process has taken place in Brussels.  The directive comes here straight from Brussels and is immediately and directly operative in our situation without any intervention on our part.  That is the sort of situation I mentioned to the Parliamentary Secretary. I said there were three different types of situation, and that is one of them.  This section should specifically state that where a directive comes from Brussels dealing with consumer affairs and is of direct applicability in our situation, the responsibility for the supervision and the administration of that directive should rest on the Director of Consumer Affairs and this section should state so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary gave me a very bland and, I am afraid I must use the word, specious assurance just a moment ago.  He said: &ldquo;Please do not worry.  I assure you that this Director of Consumer Affairs will be fully involved in all these discussions and negotiations about these instruments.&rdquo; That assurance is not satisfactory <Col N="99" /> from the point of view of this House.  We should ensure in this statute that there is legislative provision for that involvement of the Director of Consumer Affairs in this EEC legislation.</P>
    <P>First of all, I think the case where the directive is directly applicable is unanswerable, but I am moving on to the other area where a directive comes from Brussels and requires legislation or a ministerial order on our part to have it implemented in this country.  In that situation also I think this section should specifically state that the responsibility for any domestic legislative act to implement a consumer affairs directive from Brussels should be the responsibility of this new office.  That is only common sense.</P>
    <P>The next area to be considered is before the directives are adopted, when they are still at the formative, negotiation, discussion stage&mdash;and that can be a long process because the divergent legislation, the different viewpoints, the different traditions and the different attitudes of the nine countries have to be brought together and hammered out in the bureaucratic machines, if you like, of the EEC, before a directive is adopted.  At that stage the responsibility for conducting the Irish negotiations where consumer affairs are concerned should be that of the Director of Consumer Affairs. That should be in the section and not left to a guarantee from the Parliamentary Secretary across the floor of the House that it will be so.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to an incident which happened recently in regard to this very area.  This is something which Deputy O'Malley spoke about a moment ago.  There is a directive coming out now on product liability, and this is a directive which, as Deputy O'Malley has said, will have starting implications for this country, which is going to represent a major upheavel in the law of negligence.  We in the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation were looking at this directive and we had some conception of the implications of what was involved.  We asked the appropriate <Col N="100" /> Department what their view was and we were informed that because it had such fundamental legal implications, it was going to be referred to the new Commission on Law Reform for their opinion, and we were reasonably satisfied by that.</P>
    <P>It subsequently emerged that the matter had not been referred to the Commission on Law Reform at all. What happened apparently was that the Department of Industry and Commerce got in touch with the Attorney General and asked him to transmit the matter to the Commission on Law Reform for their view.  They rightly thought that that was enough for them to do and that in due course the Commission on Law Reform would report on the matter.  The Attorney General, for some reason best known to himself, did not refer this matter to the Commission on Law Reform at all, so exactly where the matter stands at the moment nobody quite knows.  But there is this major, fundamental change in the whole law of negligence coming about and nobody is quite sure where responsibility for our approach to it lies.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that to illustrate the danger of leaving these things to common sense, as the Parliamentary Secretary apparently wants us to do in regard to this.  These things are so important that they should be spelt out in this legislation, and the role of the Director of Consumer Affairs in relation to EEC consumer affairs legislation must be incorporated and defined in this legislation.  I think that case is unanswerable, and I press it very strongly indeed on the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>I think it would be possible for us to devise a number of amendments under the functions subsection, subsection (5), which perhaps could provide for the situation, but I would much prefer if the Parliamentary Secretary would say to us: &ldquo;I see the need for a major recasting of section 9 in this connection and I propose to look at the section in the light of the situation and bring forward a considerably amplified section 9 on Report Stage.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In my view, the decision on the Government's policy in relation either to directives which will come before the Council of Ministers, if there is a dispute, certainly, or regulations where it would be a question of the making of representations by the Government expressing the official Irish view to the Commission, who would then take it into account in making the regulation, that in both cases, the latter being the one referred to by Deputy Haughey as being directly applicable, the responsibility for expressing the official policy of the Government of Ireland should rest squarely on the shoulders of the Minister.  I do not believe this responsibility should be taken from the Minister or that the Minister's responsibility in the matter should be diminished in any way by sloughing it off to a director or any subsidiary person.  Certainly if the Minister needs to get the director's advice on the attitude he should take or if the Minister wishes that the director should represent him at a particular meeting in relation to the matter, that can be done.  However, I do not believe that the ultimate responsibility of the Minister who, after all, is answerable to this House, should be in any sense diluted.  That is my fundamental position in this matter.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary is dealing only with a very narrow aspect of the negotiations in the formative stage of a directive.  That is only a very minor aspect of the whole business.

      <P>Regulation or directive&mdash;the two terms are very often interchangeable in Community affairs. Let us get our terminology right. These directives or regulations, whichever they are, go through a long complicated procedure on which perhaps I should elaborate for the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the Commission has the responsibility for promulgating and bringing them forward and they go to the Parliament and the Council at the same time.  The Parliament has a function in regard to them and the Council has its own permanent machinery for processing.  It is not just a question of making representations.  The thing is hammered out, fought out, negotiated, discussed, debated; concessions are made and viewpoints are reconciled. All that has to be done by responsible officials of the nine countries.  I am concerned that the Director of Consumer Affairs should be brought into that process at that stage, in so far as consumer affairs legislation is concerned. I am not happy that it will be left to the discretion of the Minister to say &ldquo;Mr. Director, go to Brussels tomorrow and have a look at this matter&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that, certainly.  I am appealing to the Parliamentary Secretary because obviously this legislation has been compiled on the basis of ignoring this situation altogether and not adverting to it.  I had hoped that the Parliamentary Secretary would have <Col N="103" /> been prepared to recast section 9, but if not I will put down an amendment.</P>
      <P>Another aspect is that when a directive or regulation or decision is adopted by the Council of Ministers very often it requires a further legislative act by the national administration before it becomes law.  That may sometimes have to be done by legislation or on other occasions by ministerial regulation.  In so far as consumer affairs are concerned that domestic administrative act should be the responsibility of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  If it is a ministerial regulation it must necessarily be made in the name of the Minister but in this section there should be some responsibility placed on the Director of Consumer Affairs for the promulgation of that ministerial regulation to give effect to a consumer affairs directive from Brussels.  The really important situation is where a consumer affairs directive will be adopted by the Council of Ministers and will become law, directly and immediately operative in this country without any further intervention on our part.  No case can be argued for the Minister for Industry and Commerce being the responsible person there.  The law has been made; it is now only a question of implementing and administering it. This section should place the responsibility for the implementation, administration and supervision of a directly applicable directive on the Director of Consumer Affairs.  I trust I have made my case.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to make some progress in relation to this section.  So far as policy is concerned, the Minister will determine it and he will have the responsibility therefor and I believe it should remain so, but he can consult the director in relation to any matters. Powers exist in relation to the implementation of the legislation to devolve particular powers on the Director of Consumer Affairs under part of the section which we have just agreed and amended, in fact, to broaden the possibility as to the type of legislation under which powers could be given to the director.  The same applies to the provision of information about the legislation.</P>

Once the processes of the Community start to operate, then to say that the Irish Minister for Industry and Commerce is solely responsible for policy is just nonsense.  I am trying to persuade the Parliamentary Secretary in regard to many of the functions which we are now bestowing on the Director of Consumer Affairs that he will not be in a position to discharge them satisfactorily unless he has the statutory right to be the person in the Community process responsible for that, both at the formative and later at the implementation stage.  If I cannot get that across to the Parliamentary Secretary I accept that he has every right to be irritated with me.  He obviously does not understand what it is all about and he will regard me as an irritating nuisance.  I can assure him that I am not.  What I am saying is well grounded on the facts of the situation and the legal situation.  If he is not prepared to see that, I do not propose to delay the House any longer on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am worried about subsection (4).  There is no amendment dealing with it so it was not mentioned during the debate.  It provides that the director shall be independent in the performance of his functions.  I am worried about his independence in this regard.  We have just listened to the Parliamentary Secretary dealing with Deputy Haughey's contribution and outlining the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is the be-all and end-all in relation to the making of regulations about consumer protection, but he did concede that the Minister would consult with the Director of Consumer Affairs from time to time. There is nothing in section 9 dealing with consultation between the Minister and the Director of Consumer Affairs.  The purpose of this section as outlined in the first instance would appear to have been to create an independent person or body who would deal with this and who would be removed from any influence one way or the other in his decisions and in the performance of his functions as outlined in subsection (5).  Subsection (4) specifically spells out, as did the original section, that the director shall be independent in the performance of his functions.  On the other hand the Parliamentary Secretary introduced into this House, and we have passed, an amendment to the section whereby added at the end of the section, and properly so, is the provision that the director should be asked to make a report each year in relation to the performance of his function.  The last part of that amendment reads:</P>
      <P>The Director shall furnish to the Minister such information regarding the performance of his functions as the Minister may from time to time require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a necessary and useful addition to the section.  On the other hand, I am worried that the amendment submitted by the Parliamentary Secretary on behalf of the Minister takes from the independence of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  We have completely amended subsections (2) and (3) and the section was fully <Col N="106" /> debated as to how the officer could be appointed.  Arising from our discussions and the amendments on section 9, the Director of Consumer Affairs is no longer somebody comparable to the Secretary, Deputy Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce. He is an independent personage altogether doing his thing in relation to this and carrying out the functions assigned to him under subsection (5) and whatever further functions may be assigned to him under subsection (6).</P>
    <P>I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to clear up a worry for me. Subsection (5) (c) says:</P>
    <P>The functions of a Director shall be&mdash;</P>
    <P>To request persons engaging in or proposing to engage in such practices that are, or are likely to be, misleading to members of the public in a material matter, to discontinue or refrain from such practices,</P>
    <P>That is a judgement for the Director of Consumer Affairs.  If the Director of Consumer Affairs feels that a person is advertising falsely the content of a particular package, the Director of Consumer Affairs can get after this person and instruct him to discontinue or refrain from this practice or, I presume, can go ahead and prosecute if the person refuses to refrain.  If, on the other hand, the offending party feels that the Director of Consumer Affairs is going beyond himself, being a bit too oppressive in his attitude, taking an approach which the offender feels is a little bit too aggressive, and cutting the regulations too fine, is the potential offender entitled to lodge a complaint with the Minister and say &ldquo;Your Director of Consumer Affairs is breathing down the back of my neck; he is making a nuisance of himself and I honestly feel that he is going beyond his powers&rdquo;?  Can the Minister interfere under this section?  I visualise ministerial interference in this arising from the amendment which was added just before we got on with the section.</P>
    <P>Let us assume that I claim my product <Col N="107" /> is much safer than saccarine and can do away with the necessity for sugar altogether.  A lot of pressure will develop.  The Minister for Agriculture is going to be very interested. The farmers will be pressing him.  If I put on a notice to say that this product has been tested and has been proved medically to have no damaging effects and the Director of Consumer Affairs is satisfied that I can justify that claim and put it on the label, somebody may get at the Minister for Industry and Commerce and say: &ldquo;This is disastrous. The Director of Consumer Affairs is fully accepting it but we would want years to test that out. Maybe if human beings consume this product it can give them cancer and it has not been established that it does not.&rdquo;  The Director of Consumer Affairs is satisfied and in this instance he is not harassing the individual.</P>

If the Parliamentary Secretary tells me that the Minister has the right to stop this fellow from making that sort of claim under subsection (4), this subsection is inoperative.  It is not being complied with.  I feel in that context the Director of Consumer Affairs would have the right under subsection (4) to tell the Minister to go to blazes.  On the other hand, the Minister can use the arm-twisting of getting after the director and saying to him &ldquo;I want you, before you do anything in this, to give me such information as I require&rdquo;.

This will enable the Minister to make an order in respect of certain categories of goods where he feels that information should be provided, where he feels that certain information in relation to maintenance, storage and so on must be attached to the goods.  This will be a useful protection to the consumer.  Any orders that the Minister envisages making under this section will have to be approved by the House by a special resolution, so there will be adequate opportunity for debating measures the Minister may take under the section.  I asked the National Consumer Advisory Council, which is a broadly representative body, to examine the powers which are being given to the Minister in sections 10, 11 and 12 and to recommend particular types of product in relation to which it would be appropriate to make an order.</P>

      <P>The power to require that information be given on the label in relation to the contents of foods is fine so far as food is concerned.  However, there is other information in relation to non-food goods, in relation to industrial items, information such as maintenance, safety precautions which should be taken by a potential purchaser, the installation of an item, the expenses which may have to be incurred by the potential purchaser before he can use an item, and so on. This information is not covered by the Food Standards legislation, which is concerned solely with matters relating to food, and is not covered by the Merchandise Marks Acts, which are concerned only with the marking of the quantity of contents in a commodity.  A much broader power is being conferred by section 10 to bring in any information which may be deemed by the Minister, and subsequently by resolution of this House, to be relevant to the consumer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is more or less the same thing except that it relates to advertisements which are not attached to or beside the goods but which are published separately.  This gives the Minister power, subject to the same safeguards, to require that similar relevant information be given in advertisement as and when it is considered necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that one of the abuses that exists at the moment in relation to advertising is the practice of certain firms, particularly in the food line, of advertising the availability <Col N="111" /> of certain goods at a particular price, but having either no goods of that kind available at that price or else having such a small quantity available that they are gone very early in the day.  Does this section cover that type of situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather that there is a problem in dealing with the matter raised by the Deputy.  There would be difficulties about the definition of the quantity that would be required to allow an advertisement to be deemed inaccurate in the sense the Deputy has in mind.  If the problem can be dealt with under section 11, I will be disposed to deal with it if we can get over the legal problems involved in defining the offence.  There will be considerable difficulties in meeting the case the Deputy has made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an abuse that is going on and it causes loss to the public.  It is hardly enough to say that there are difficulties in dealing with the problem.  It is a problem that should be tackled and dealt with.  The State of Illinois in the United States deals with this problem by providing that where a supermarket run out of the goods in question which they advertise as being available at a particular price they must give the customer a credit note enabling him or her to obtain those goods at that price at some later date.  The American expression &ldquo;rain check&rdquo; seems to work quite well there.  If they can deal with the problem there, it can be dealt with here.</P>
      <P>It is also necessary for the retailer who has run out of goods at the price he advertised or of the type he advertised to display a notice near the checkout desk of each supermarket to this effect.  It is one of the abuses of advertising which is frequent here which I believe this section as it stands will not cover.  It should be amended to cover this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is one of deciding what would be adequate buffer stocks that an individual might be required to have.  It is possible that a small shop which in a normal way might not carry a very large stock of <Col N="112" /> goods might suddenly find that because they had made a particularly attractive offer on one occasion that there was a huge demand for their goods and the goods could run out.  It might be a great hardship for that shop to have to provide a lot of the same goods to all the people who come looking for them if they could not in turn get the goods from their supplier at a price that would enable them to sell the goods at the price they sold the original goods which they had presumably obtained at a lower price, if prices had gone up in the meantime at wholesale level. One size of buffer stock might be appropriate for a very big shop but for a very small shop, which could just as easily find themselves in this situation, another size of buffer stock would be appropriate but it would be very hard, legislatively, to distinguish between the appropriate level of buffer stock for a small shop in a country town and the appropriate level of buffer stock for a large shop in a city centre.</P>
      <P>It is possible, if this matter becomes a severe difficulty in this country, for the director to take action under his powers in relation to the elimination of certain practices which are deceptive to the consumer under section 9 (5).  I believe there would be severe drafting problems in getting over the matter but I will certainly make inquiries about the provisions made in the State of Illinois.  I will see the extent to which we could adapt any of the provisions they have to our conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary spoke about causing hardship to retailers who might find that if wholesale prices went up they would not be able to buy goods wholesale at the price they had already advertised they are willing to sell them retail. I am afraid he displays a lack of knowledge of what goes on in those matters.  The whole purpose of this type of operation is to mislead the public.  This is deliberately done by large retailers.  They advertise what is described in the trade as a &ldquo;loss leader&rdquo;.  They sometimes sell the commodity in question at a lower price than they are paying for it.  They certainly sell it at a lower price than their small <Col N="113" /> competitors can purchase it.  If they get themselves into difficulties as a result of that kind of activity which is designed to mislead the consumer, then their difficulty should be on their own heads.  I would not share the concern of the Parliamentary Secretary for large retailers who deliberately set out to mislead the public and then get themselves into this difficulty.</P>
      <P>There was an example within the past week&mdash;I suppose because it is very topical it is better not to mention it&mdash;where a certain commodity was being sold by a certain supermarket below the wholesale price and a lot of difficulty for many people arose because of this.  It is not this year or last year that this difficulty first arose.  It has been there for a very long time and will continue to be there unless this Bill deals adequately with that kind of situation.  I believe there should be power under this section to deal with the deliberate advertising by a major retailer of a particular commodity at a particular price in order to draw people into their store and then either say that the commodity is not available, that it is available at a higher price or that it is sold out at five minutes past nine in the morning.  This is being done to mislead the public.  There should be power under this section to prevent this recurring.</P>
      <P>That problem has been dealt with successfully in other countries.  It is not good enough for the Parliamentary Secretary simply to say that there are a lot of difficulties involved in trying to draft legislation to cover this.  We have to stop it if it is a damaging and misleading practice. It is bound to be damaging and misleading in other countries also but they stopped it.  I suggest that between now and Report Stage the methods of stopping it be ascertained and that they be adopted here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that the section as it stands would allow the Minister to make an order which would stop that kind of deliberately misleading advertising.  If the rectification of this problem causes hardship or loss to those who cause it themselves and create the problem by deliberately misleading advertising, which they know <Col N="114" /> they cannot comply with, then let them suffer loss as a result.  It is their own fault because they deliberately mislead the public in order to bring members of the public into their premises and having got them in assume that the members of the public will then purchase other goods at a good profit to the retailer in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble is that the method of dealing with the problem would apply not just to the case envisaged by the Deputy but to people who might very innocently advertise goods at a particular price, having bought them at a lower price, and then find that the wholesale price had gone up.  Some people will deal in the manner the Deputy has in mind but there will be others who will probably be caught just as easily by the provisions of the remedial legislation who would quite innocently find themselves in this situation.  It is this problem of distinguishing between one case and the other which is posing the chief drafting difficulty.</P>
      <P>The problem of loss leaders referred to by the Deputy is primarily a fair trading problem, and a problem encountered by other traders in competition with a particular trader. In the first analysis, this would be a matter for the restrictive practices machinery to consider.  I have said I will have a look at the legislation referred to by the Deputy.  I understand the possibility of dealing with the problem has been gone into exhaustively already.  I cannot quote chapter and verse on the precise legal difficulties beyond saying what I have said already.</P>

      <P>In page 9, subsection (1), lines 25 and 26, to delete &ldquo;give to any person so requesting, if the request is made within 18 months of the publication of the advertisement,&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;, if the Director or an officer of the Minister or an officer of a council of a county or corporation of a county or other borough in whose functional area the publisher has a place of business so requests within 18 months of the give to the Director or officer&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In its present form this section entitles any person, whether or not he has an interest in what is being advertised, to demand the name and address of the person who procured the advertisement. As such it is too far-reaching and representations have been received that it would have serious implications for the confidential relationship that exists between newspapers and those who advertise in them in relation to advertisements not in the course of trade or business.  Accordingly, it was considered that the power to seek the names and addresses of advertisers should be restricted to the person designated.  It would not be possible to limit this to business advertisements because the fact of whether an advertisement was for business purposes or was private would not be known in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="121" /> The kind of situation where this is most likely to be appropriate is in the case of a box number advertisement where obviously the person who inserts it would not like any member of the public to find out his name and address merely by getting on to the newspaper concerned.  This would be particularly the case where it was obvious that there was no serious intention on the part of the member of the public to buy the article mentioned in the advertisement.  That could be regarded as an invasion of privacy. Where a broadly-based campaign is launched by a firm it might be desirable for the consumer to know more about the firm but a power applicable to that kind of situation should not be used in an unfair manner in relation to the box number situation I mentioned previously.</P>
    <P>We tried to find some means of distinguishing between those two types of situation on conceptual grounds but it was not possible.  We found the most effective way was to get the name and address to the director and if a person wishes to get that information he must go the the director who will give it to him if he considers it appropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought amendment No. 33 in my name would have covered that situation without all the problems the Parliamentary Secretary's amendment seems to create. It seems strange that somebody will not be entitled to get the name and address of an advertiser while, at the same time, a private individual under section 8 has the right to go to the High Court without permission from the director, the Minister or anybody else, and stop an entire advertising campaign.  If a major advertisement relative to the provision of goods, services, accommodation or facilities appears in a newspaper, on television or anywhere else and the name and address of the person putting in that advertisement are not given, a member of the public should have the right to find out who they are: but, if it is a small box number advertisement, he should not have that right.  That seems the simplest way to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, a member of the public has <Col N="122" /> no right as such&mdash;he has lost his absolute right&mdash;to find out who put in even a two-page advertisement which cost tens of thousands of pounds.  I think that is wrong.  It seems to me to be a wrong sense of priorities to ask in relation to a comparatively minor thing that the permission of the director the Minister or the local authority is necessary while under section 8, even an individual crank can proceed to the High Court.  This was the point I tried to get the Parliamentary Secretary to accept when we were discussing section 8.  He did not accept it then but he brings it in under section 13 in a way that seems to be far too confining.  The simpler thing for him to do would be to withdraw his own amendment and add after &ldquo;agent&rdquo; in line 27 a sentence to the effect that this section shall not apply to box number advertisements in newspapers, magazines or periodicals.  That would get over the problem and still allow the individual consumer the right to obtain the information in relation to big advertisements which were more likely to mislead the public at large than a small box number advertisement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble here is that the Deputy's amendment would remove the power from anyone, including the director, to get information within the ambit of this section about the person responsible for all box number advertisements.  I am informed that box numbers are used predominantly for private purposes but in some cases they are used systematically for trade.  It is desirable that this power should exist so that somebody can get information in relation to box numbers where it appears that they are being used for trade or in a manner deceptive to the public. While Deputy O'Malley's amendment is directed in the right way, it would go too far in one sense and not far enough in another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This boils down to whether the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister is of the view that a member of the public is entitled to this information.  If that is the view, the amendment deprives him of his right. <Col N="123" /> He can only get it if the director or somebody authorised by the Minister or the local authority seeks it.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary not feel that the amendment is becoming too restrictive in order to get over a difficulty that arose only in relation to private advertisements under box numbers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Deputy's point.  I would prefer if we did not have to introduce this amendment but this is the best form of amendment to provide protection against the situation where a private individual who is placing a private advertisement would be caught and forced to disclose his identity to anybody. The director would ensure that that power would not be used unfairly.  As I said, in some cases box numbers may be used for trade.  It is desirable that somebody should have the power to get the names and addresses of those responsible for all advertisements and that it should be the Director of Consumer Affairs who would act on the request of a member of the public but that an ordinary member of the public would not be able to get the information without going to the director as envisaged in this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, taking serious note of the continuous rise in crime and vandalism in the city of Dublin, condemns the Government for failure to provide</P>
      <P>(a)  increased Garda presence on the streets</P>
      <P>(b)  increased night patrols in suburban areas</P>
      <P>(c)  for the maintenance of full establishment strength at all city Garda stations and</P>
      <P>(d)  extra gardaí in areas where the 1977 crime figures have shown a substantial rise.</P>
      <P>Opening this debate I should like to quote the Minister in a speech to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce at a luncheon on 27th January, 1977, when he said:</P>
      <P>I am always disturbed when I see reports, very often couched in sensational terms, that Dublin is a violent city and that it is not safe to go to such and such a place or that people are cowering in terror behind locked and barred doors. These reports are an exaggeration for by and large Dublin is a safe city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister gets his information from the same source as I endeavoured to get mine today, I am not surprised. I endeavoured to get information from the Minister's Department today, which I was unable to get, when I asked simple questions in relation to the number of Garda barracks in this city and the country generally and certain information also in relation to Garda strength. <Col N="125" /> I was told approximately two hours ago that they would telephone me back. For the past two hours I have been sitting beside the telephone waiting. Did the Minister, or some of the personnel in his Department, indicate that I, as a Member of this House, was not to get the information I requested? This is a very serious matter.  Was the person deliberately impeded from giving that information which this House and its Members should have? If that is the type of person supplying the Minister with information, then I can well understand some statements made by the Minister in recent times and some of the information made available to us by way of statistics. Now I can well understand also how the Minister has erred in some of those statements and how erroneous they have been.  I take particular exception to the fact that people who advise the Minister refuse to supply me with information.  They are my servants just as they are the Minister's.</P>
    <P>It is important in debates of this nature that every Deputy be fully armed and fortified with factual information but, when we endeavour to get information from the Department of Justice, the shutters go up.  I want to know did the Minister indicate that I should not get this information? Was it conveyed to him that I was seeking information?  I wanted to be sure, when I came in here this evening, that I had factual information in relation to some aspects of the matter I wanted to discuss.  I had to resort to the telephone directory&mdash;and how accurate that may be in relation to the number of Garda barracks in this city and the country generally I do not know. However, that must be my source now that I have failed to get the figures I required from the information section of the Department of Justice.  Perhaps they have not got it.</P>
    <P>In relation to this motion I should say that the matter of concern about crime generally has been conveyed time and time again to the Minister. Indeed, every organisation in this city, every tenants' and shopkeepers' organisation over the past two or <Col N="126" /> three years, has conveyed in the strongest possible terms the terrible situation obtaining.  The Minister is quite wrong when he speaks of sensational terms.  It shows how far removed the Minister is from reality and the day-to-day affairs of this city. I can well understand the Minister and judges, who are probably overprotected, not understanding what is happening to the average individual in housing estates and streets of this city.</P>
    <P>In this city we have 850,000 people. We have an unemployed adult population of 33,000 and an unknown number of school leavers unemployed, because the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach indicated in that respect that the figures were not available to the Government.  Therefore, the Government do not know the full extent of the problem creating the terrible situation in this city.  The problem of unemployment is one of the factors the Minister did not mention in the course of his speech to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. He mentioned many other factors but not the grave one causing all of the terrible problems at present confronting our citizens.  At present Dublin is a city of steel shutters. Anybody going through shopping centres will realise that it is all too sad that these steel shutters have to be put up at nighttime in order to protect property.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the information we have in relation to crime as I proceed. It is a fact of life now that if people want to protect themselves or their property they must have armoured plating of one type or another outside their properties.  If the Minister disbelieves me let him go into the shopping centres or walk down the principal shopping streets of this city any night, when he will see the shutters up.  Window shopping at night has become a thing of the past in Dublin city because of the serious situation obtaining there.</P>
    <P>The Government have been endeavouring to excuse the lack of protection in the South because of the violence in the North but they have a responsibility to the people of the <Col N="127" /> South and they should get on with that job.  Also in the course of that speech to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I can say that of all the terrorist incidents in Northern Ireland in the past year only about 2 per cent of them have a Border connection.</P>
    <P>Those are the Minister's own words. What percentage of the Garda are on Border duty?  I have great sympathy for the members of the Garda who strive, in terribly difficulty conditions, to do their job to the best of their ability.  And they are succeeding, in many ways, under very difficult conditions.  But they do not get the support of the Government.  Law and order have broken down in this city and country and here the Government and Minister are responsible.  Even at this late stage I would hope that they would admit there is a grave problem needing remedial measures.  They have admitted that 500 extra gardaí are necessary because of Border duty.  I would say to them: get on with the job of protecting the people in this part of the country.  As the Minister states, there is a 2 per cent problem in the North.  Therefore, there must be a 98 per cent problem here which the Minister and the Government are not tackling and which must be tackled as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>However, if the Minister gets his information from the same source as I endeavoured to get mine today, he may be very much out of date.  Law and order have broken down completely, in this city in particular, and the crime report indicates that that is a fact.  If the Minister does not want to take my word for it, or the banner headlines as fact, then let him examine the crime report of 1975, the last such report available to us. Let him examine the figures given him by his Department when he made that speech to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce some time ago and he will realise the terrible problems confronting this city.  Mob law has taken over in many cases; the boot boys and bully boys are terrorising the aged and young alike and making it impossible for people to go about their business <Col N="128" /> in a normal way.  The Government are completely out of touch.  I would urge the Minister to realise that a serious problem obtains.  If this debate does not prove that to him conclusively let him visit Garda barracks in this city and hear what the gardaí have to say about the gross understaffing. Garda cars are being laid up because there are no drivers for them.  We have one-man cars but the Minister must realise that it is physically impossible for one garda to man a car on his own.</P>
    <P>There is no substitute for additional gardaí in this city and immediate measures must be taken to provide them.  It is no answer to say that there will be 500 extra gardaí available in seven or eight months.  If the Minister cannot or will not get on with this job he should go and let somebody else do the job, although I doubt if there is anyone in the Coalition parties who could do any better.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the statistics given by the Minister during the course of the debate.  I represent the largest working class area in the country and I know its problems, as the Minister must know them from Garda reports. The same applies to other areas in Dublin.  Old people are particularly vulnerable to the boot boys, the bully boys and the mobsters patrolling the cities.  An old lady wrote to me recently.  She is sick and infirm.  She is unable to go out and afraid to stay in, as are countless thousands of others in this city.  If they go out they will be mugged and their houses raided while they are out; if they stay in they are subject to robbery with violence.</P>
    <P>Our crime reports confirm what I am saying and I hope that during the debate we can go through the 1975 crime report I have been quoting.  The importance of the debate is that we may prevail on the Minister to try to do something about the situation. Either he is being guided by people who do not understand the problem or the information he has received has been coloured&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the Government's failure to do anything about the unemployment position there is large-scale unemployment of young people and there is nowhere that they can go to divert their minds.  We can see from reports that the Government are not fully aware of the volume of this problem.  Vandals have broken up schools in my area and throughout the city.  Schools have been burned and the school provided for itinerants was burned out.  Cars and other property have been burned.  This is being highlighted in the Press every day but the Minister takes no notice. Teachers are losing heart when they see their schools being burned. Financially this could be rectified by providing additional facilities and repairs but there is no compensation for people who have to live in terror because of the burnings, robberies and rapes.</P>
      <P>No doubt the Garda have being doing a good job in difficult circumstances but they cannot provide a solution, at their present strength, for the massive intimidation of citizens.  Garda statistics refer only to reported crimes: they cannot do anything about the unreported rapes and other crimes of violence.  People are afraid to report such cases.  They have been intimidated by gangsters who break into their houses and tell them that if they go to the Garda members of their families will be mutilated and their houses burned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This must be stamped out at the earliest possible moment.  The remedial measures which the Minister has in his power to exercise should be introduced immediately.  Gardaí should be given overtime to do extra work on the beat.  The Minister may say that I have been trying to alarm people unnecessarily. He has said that I have been doing an injustice.  I am not exaggerating the serious nature of the problem.  There must be proper protection for our citizens.  I know a man in Summerhill who tried to stand up to the bully boys and who had his premises burned down.  This is a city of fear, a city of steel shutters, and this can be confirmed for the Minister by Garda officers if he so desires.  He should not be content any longer to <Col N="130" /> bury his head in the sand.  It is my intention tonight to make him fully aware of the situation.</P>
    <P>I know of a case recently when a young woman allowed her child on the road on a bicycle which had been bought last Christmas.  Shortly afterwards she got a telephone call to say the child was in the Meath Hospital as a result of an accident.  She went there and was told that no such child had been taken in.  She tried other hospitals and was told the same story. When she went home she found the house had been ransacked.  That type of phone call is prevalent.  People have become afraid to answer the telephone. If it is discovered they are not at home their homes will be raided and if they are in they will be attacked and robbed.</P>
    <P>I read in a recent speech by the Minister a reference to the cost of training a garda.  He went on to say that there is always a point at which a certain level of loss is reached which is cheaper in cash terms than the cost of taking steps to prevent such a loss.  I trust that is not the Minister's general attitude to crime throughout the country.  The Minister should be thinking in terms of trebling the proposed 500 extra gardaí.  We had Garda Jim Brannigan who did such a wonderful job in bringing criminals to justice. He was a man among men but he was pushed out of the force without any recognition of the wonderful work he had done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is that the people may become depressed when they see no effort made to recognise the substantial effort some people are making to improve the situation, very often beyond the call of duty.  The Minister has told us that 500 additional gardaí will be appointed and I should like to break down that figure.  Looking through the telephone directory today I discovered that there are 500 Garda stations in the country and 67 in Dublin city.  The Department have that information but they did not give it to me. <Col N="131" /> Taking into consideration that the gardaí work four shifts in the various stations there would be 125 per shift, but, taking leave, sickness and other factors into consideration, an average of 25 per shift would be absent.  The result is that 100 extra gardaí of the 500 are available at any time for duty. That number would create little impression in the 500 stations throughout the country or in the 67 in Dublin city. The competition has taken place for these recruits but the assessment of the results is only in progress now.  After that those called must submit themselves for a medical examination.  They are then sent to Templemore for training. After they are posted to a station they need time to familiarise themselves with the area.  There is no doubt that it takes a long time before a man is effectively on the beat.</P>
      <P>Even when those 500 extra gardaí have been posted a serious situation will still exist.  The Minister has given us phoney figures from time to time and recently he indicated that on March 1st there were 2,630 gardaí in Dublin while on the 1st April the figure was 2,693.  Apparently, the Minister is not aware that the population of the city is increasing rapidly.  While it might be true to say that there are only 18 fewer gardaí operating in Dublin than in the previous year statistics show that when the number was decided on for Dublin it was to suit the situation in 1973 and not 1977.  In this regard I should like to tell the Minister that the Sundrive Road station is at present 18 under strength.  Bearing in mind the huge population that station caters for it is hard to imagine how they can operate an effective police system when they are 18 under strength.  Gardaí are taken from that station for full time duty at Green Street Courthouse.  Those gardaí should be left at Sundrive Road to ensure that the people of the area are fully protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the crime figures.  The number of offences against property with violence in Dublin city alone in 1975 was 8,836 or 53.8 per cent of the total number of offences.  That figure escalated to 11,014 in 1976.  In spite of those <Col N="132" /> figures the Minister has said that he is appalled at statements made by individuals and in the Press from time to time.  In relation to offences against property without violence the total in 1975 was 29,000 with Dublin city accounting for 17,191 or 58.5 per cent. The Minister must recognise that the situation must be rectified immediately.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the situation in relation to drugs.  Of the total number of persons charged, 333, 283 were charged in Dublin.  That is an indication of the level of crime in the city.  It is also an indication that it would take more than the 500 additional gardaí to combat the situation which the Minister and the Government have allowed to deteriorate.  The Minister told us that the strength of the Garda force is 8,464 and that he recruited an additional 900 after he took office.  He has also told us that it is his intention to recruit 500 more.  Because I did not receive any information from the Department in relation to the annual wastage in the force&mdash;retirements, dismissals and so on&mdash;I am not able to make comparisons, but in telling the House that he is recruiting 500 additional gardaí the Minister should also give us the information in relation to annual wastage.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of police cars.  The situation in relation to those cars is a farce because there are more cars lying idle without drivers than there are cars on patrol.  There is little use in sending just a driver out on patrol because he must concentrate on the traffic in the streets.  An observer is necessary.  Every statistic shows that there has been a complete breakdown of law and order under a Government that projected themselves as a law and order Government.  The Minister must bear in mind that the working people must pay for the damage to property by vandals.  My constituents, and the working people throughout the country, must pay for the Government's mismanagement of the security forces.  The farcical situation should be stopped.  The Minister should take remedial action and ensure that Garda overtime is maintained until such time as crime is curtailed.  One business that is thriving at present is <Col N="133" /> that concerning burglar alarms.  A man told me recently that when he reported three break-ins he was advised to instal a burglar alarm as a precautionary measure.  It is possible that the Minister will issue burglar alarms free of charge as an alternative to extra gardaí but that is not a solution.</P>
    <P>More gardaí are needed to patrol our streets.  In the past their presence was enough to frighten criminals off. One man contributed in a big way in this regard and I am sure there are many more men like him willing to do that work.  I am sure they are there and have the will to work, if they are happy in their jobs and if they know there is recognition and support from the Department, the Minister and the Government. But that support is not there. It has not been there for years and the deteriorating situation is the result of the mismanagement and miscalculation by the Government and the Minister. Perhaps the Minister has been badly advised.  Perhaps his advisers, be they gardaí or civil servants, are misleading him.  If his speeches are the products of members of the Garda Síochána or the civil service, then I fear he is being misled and, if that is the case, he should get rid of these people whoever they may be.  If, on the other hand, he himself has composed his own speeches, then it is time the Taoiseach got rid of him and replaced him by someone who will do the job and stop this ever-growing crime spiral.</P>
    <P>Like the judges, the Minister is overprotected. Those who are over-protected are thereby far removed from reality.  I wonder what his reaction would be if his car or the cars of the judiciary were &ldquo;knocked off&rdquo; time and time again, or damaged, or their houses burgled.  Of course, they do not suffer that experience because they are protected.  I can understand the Minister and members of the judiciary having a different outlook from mine and from that of the majority of my constitutents. I am sure if their cars were knocked off and their houses burgled it would not be a case of the Probation Act because then they would know the situation for what it really is.</P>
    <P>High crime areas are well known to the Garda and some steps should be <Col N="134" /> taken immediately to protect the people in these areas.  It is no good saying there will be 500 more gardaí next January or February.  What will happen between now and January next?  If the Minister does not act and take remedial measures the people will take the law into their own hands and protect themselves by any and every means at their disposal.  I can see people resorting to every type of self-defence, armed and otherwise.  If that is the evolution the Minister cannot say he and his Government were not warned.  But that appears to be the only alternative because the Garda Síochána are under strength.  The Garda are abused for lack of detection.  The simplest forms of detection are the bald tyre and the parking offence.  Automatic conviction follows.  Hours are spent on tracking down criminals and when these criminals are brought before the court they get the benefit of the Probation Act or sympathy from some of those who sit upon the bench.</P>
    <P>This report shows the true situation and I hope we will now have some action from the Minister and the Government.  Long and tedious hours must be spent tracking down criminals.  Tracked down they should be.  Barracks are understaffed.  In some there is only one man in the station and no man on the beat.  The Minister can ascertain the facts.  I hope he will make an investigation in these high crime areas and, having done so, take steps to ensure that the technical experts are free to do the work they should be doing and clear these areas of their criminal content.  If one reports a crime there is a long delay before a garda appears on the scene. It is not the fault of the garda.  The manpower is not there.  The violence in the North is, as I said, being used to excuse crime in the South.  I hope this is the last motion on this matter it will be necessary to table in this House.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister give us the figures as to how many gardaí there are in Kilmainham, Sundrive, Ballyfermot and Clondalkin?  Perhaps there is need for a change in the system. We adopted our force from the British.  Perhaps it is not suitable to our needs.  Let us endeavour to ensure <Col N="135" /> that the manpower we have is used to greater advantage.  Let us have some new thinking on the subject of overtime and the withdrawal of personnel. When I went last Saturday week to visit a clinic which I hold I found the building had been burned down by vandals.  It is normally a children's play centre.  I know many places which have been the recipients of the torch of the bully boys and the boot boys. Innocent children are the victims.  A parish priest wrote to me recently one Friday and I went to see him on the Saturday morning.  There had been a hatchet attack on the local school and the devices for teaching the children had been stolen.</P>
    <P>It is no good telling us we will have another 500, 1,000 or 1,500 extra gardaí next January.  What protective measures to safeguard the people will be taken in the meantime?  We have seen the protective measures in O'Connell Street&mdash;the iron grids and the steel shutters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to assure the House that I share the Member's concern with the recent crime figures, but the dimensions of the problem are available to us only in terms of cold statistics and I think we must pay attention to those statistics rather than to personal experiences which necessarily can be exaggerated or coloured and, quite understandably, can grow in the telling.  We had an example of that just now in Deputy Dowling's contribution.  While there was a strong tone of genuine concern in it, and I am the first to admit that, I think he rather spoiled his case by reason of the fact that the overlying tone was one of strident hyperbole.  We have to rely on statistics rather than on reported hearsay because, if we do not rely on them, a wrong impression can be created or a distorted picture can be painted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated here on other occasions, it is detrimental to the national good to distort the crime situation. Let us not diminish its seriousness, but equally let us be careful not to distort or exaggerate it, because to distort or exaggerate it can do two <Col N="136" /> things; first, it can cause unnecessary unease to a large number of citizens and, secondly, and more dangerously, it can indicate to criminal elements that they are free to proceed with impunity.  It is well known that the most effective crime deterrent is the detection of crime, and the speeches by public figures which indicate that there is open season, so to speak, for the criminal in the capital city of the country can invite criminal elements to embark on criminal activities in the knowledge that they may not be detected.  Not alone is that dangerous but, in terms of fact, it is also wrong.  It is important when we are debating this matter that we should debate it from the point of view of being accurate and of expressing the problem in realistic terms and avoiding distortion, exaggeration or extravagance from which only ill consequences can come.</P>
    <P>To assess the dimensions of the problem one has to consider the statistics that are available to us, and I indicated in previous debates in the House that the statistics for the country as a whole were showing an increase.  That is a fact that I do not dispute.  It is there in the Garda Commissioner's annual report.  However, as this debate concerns the Dublin metropolitan area, we will confine ourselves to dealing with that area.  The statistics for that area follow the national trend of increase.</P>
    <P>Between 1974 and 1975&mdash;although we are not comparing like with like because in 1975 the statistics were assembled on a calendar year basis whereas the previous lot were assembled to the 30th September, 1974 &mdash;allowing for a certain element of distortion because like is not being compared with like, there was an increase of 18.8 per cent between those two years.  That is a very large increase indeed and one that must give rise to concern.  We come now to the figures for the year ending 31st December, 1976.  These are figures which, I understand, have not yet been published but they are the preliminary ones which have been made available to me.  They show a continued growth in crime but happily the rate of increase&mdash;and I think this is important&mdash;<Col N="137" /> is 11.4 per cent.  Therefore while there is an increase, the rate of growth of increase is slowing down considerably.</P>
    <P>Again the incidence of crime follows no appreciable pattern throughout the city.  If we compare the first three months of this year, 1977, with the first three months of 1976, we find that the rate of growth has again decreased. There was an increase, comparing those two periods, but the net increase was 11.1 per cent.  Again it is a serious increase but the rate of growth is diminishing.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin metropolitan area there are divergences in the rate of incidence of crime.  Deputies, I am sure, will be interested and possibly surprised to hear that in the Garda District of Store Street there has been a drop in the crime figures for the first three months of this year compared with the first three months of last year, and that is something that must give us some considerable room for encouragement.  The drop was small &mdash;it was only 1.4 per cent&mdash;but to have an actual decrease in the number of crimes is a significant and a heartening fact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister taking into account the fact that many people have given up even reporting crimes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Collins by that interjection has betrayed the motivation behind this debate. I did not want to make the point myself, but I did feel from some things Deputy Dowling said that this was a political debate and that the Deputies opposite were delighted to have these crime figures and to beat the Government about the head with them.  I have given what I think are heartening figures for a particularly difficult part of Dublin city.  Deputy Collin's reaction is to pooh-pooh the figures and to suggest it is the result of people not reporting them.  Again I would imagine that Deputies opposite would perhaps <i>prima facie,</i> share my relief at seeing these crime figures for the favourable trend that they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if the figures could only be believed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Again Deputy Dowling quoted statistics here from the crime reports as representing a certain picture, and some sentences earlier he talked about phoney statistics.  I am prepared to rely on the statistics furnished by the Garda Síochána as being accurate and reliable statistics. They are the statistics I am using now, and if we do not rely on them as such, then we have no criterion whatever on which to consider this problem.</P>
      <P>In the area of Cabra which is a large suburban area, some parts of it new and other parts not so new, there was a decrease of 12.1 per cent.  It is not a question that in Cabra or in Store Street the rate of crime slowed down but that it dipped and there was a positive decrease.  Bray is an area we hear a great deal about from the point of view of vandalism and so on. In the first three months of this year &mdash;and one hopes that during the summer season the pattern will continue&mdash;there was a decrease of 11.1 per cent.  In Coolock, an area which has been the subject of questions by Deputy Tunney and which takes in part of the city in which he would be interested, the decrease was 12.1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are the favourable areas.  Let me give the House an indication of where the reverse has happened and where there has been an increase. However, I mention this to show the strangeness of the problem, that in some areas of Dublin where one would expect&mdash;particularly having regard to the hearsay reports coming from those areas&mdash;an increase, there has been a decrease.  In Ballyfermot, which is Deputy Dowling's area, there has been an increase of 27.4 per cent. That is a substantial increase and a worrying increase.  The other biggest increase is in the Whitehall area where the increase is 44.2 per cent, but again we have to consider that the number of crimes in that area is small and that any increase on a small number is statistically a large increase. The total number of crimes has actually increased by 96, which of itself is a substantial figure but not that alarming.  In the area of Store Street, which has the highest number of crimes, in the first three months <Col N="139" /> of last year 1,959 crimes were committed, and this year there were 1,931. Therefore there is a decrease and these are heartening figures.</P>
    <P>Statistics are the only hard evidence available to us and we must rely on hard evidence rather than on hearsay. It is unfortunate that when people are reporting their experiences in this area there is a natural and understandable tendency to exaggerate, to colour, to horrify.  It is also understandable that the tale will not diminish in the telling. One often hears that there was a burglary or burglaries in a scheme of houses and after two or three tellings it is represented that every house in the terrace or the road was knocked off last night.  It is dangerous to rely on hearsay and informal evidence.  One must look to the statistics only.  While the statistics have some discouraging features about them they also have some heartening features about them.</P>
    <P>The crime problem is still a serious matter because, while the rate of growth on a yearly basis for the whole area is continuing, it is slowing.  We want to achieve throughout the entire Dublin metropolitan area and indeed throughout the country as a whole the situation that has been achieved in Bray, Coolock, Store Street and the other areas I have mentioned, where not merely is there a reduction in the rate of growth but a positive and actual decrease.</P>
    <P>There are a number of factors which go towards fighting crime, the police force, the community and the sanctions available to the law.  Regarding the police force, it now stands, as Deputies know, nearly a thousand stronger than when we came into office.  For Deputy Dowling's information, that is exclusive of wastage; the establishment figure is that much higher.  The extra 500 will also be exclusive of wastage, which now runs at under 200 per year.  Two or three hundred of the new gardaí will be on the streets next November, so that projections of next January or February are wrong.  I am advised that the examination results will be available before the end of this month and <Col N="140" /> that recruitment will take place immediately.</P>
    <P>I anticipate, because of the particular problem in this city, that the initial draft of gardaí can be made available here, so there is relief coming in the sense of extra gardaí coming to Dublin city.  In the meantime it is possible, because of the fact that these extra personnel were budgeted for and the entire budget allocation in respect of them will not be called on before the end of the year, that there may be some financial fat available which might permit an increase in beat tolerance and that is being investigated.  If that can be achieved&mdash;I do not see any great difficulty&mdash;there should be an improvement in the very near future in beat tolerance.  That would be maintained when the extra men come on duty towards the end of the year and in the new year.</P>
    <P>Two other important steps have been taken by the Garda in Dublin. The crime task force was set up in 1971.  Membership has been increased steadily over the years and it now stands at 38.  This has had considerable success in combating vandalism and crime generally in city centre areas.  For some time we heard that O'Connell Street was a no go area and that citizens could not walk along it at night but I have been assured by the centre city traders that conditions have improved considerably and they are very pleased with the results which have been achieved by this crime task force which is deployed in an area where vandalism is particularly rife in an effort to support the local force.  I have indicated to the Commissioner other areas of the city to which Deputies have drawn my attention in the course of Question Time where there is a need for this force to be deployed.  I hope that it will be possible to deploy them on a wider basis than heretofore and in more areas.  It will be necessary to increase its personnel and this can, of course, be done when the extra personnel become available.</P>
    <P>In addition, a major crime investigation squad was set up in 1973 to deal with major indictable offences. In April of last year the strength of that squad was increased from 13 to <Col N="141" /> 25.  That is a very significant and desirable development in the deployment and structure of the police force serving the needs of the capital city.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling queried the deployment of the force and wondered had any changes been made since the force came into being or was it operating with the same structures, methods and procedures which had operated in the police force prior to independence. The answer to that up to now is, essentially, yes.  I am glad to report that the management consultants I engaged about two years ago to investigate the structure of the Garda Síochána have made available preliminary reports and the final report should be available in a matter of weeks.  For the first time since the foundation of the State the Garda Síochána has been surveyed on a scientific basis and the whole question of deployment, structures and all that goes into the organisation of a large and complex force has been analysed and teased out.  I am looking forward to the result of that consultancy study. Deputy Dowling can be assured that we are conscious of the need to move with the times and I am expecting the results of that study shortly.</P>
    <P>Police by themselves cannot prevent crime.  Since man came on earth there has been crime.  I might mention that while we are worried about the crime position in this country we must bear in mind that by comparison with the nearest similar country, Great Britain, we are comparatively crime free.  The latest comparative figures which I have in this regard relate to 1975. Per 100,000 of the population in 1975 the crimes in this country were 1,600; in the London metropolitan area 6,000 per 100,000 of the population; in England and Wales, excluding London, 4,000 approximately.  Deputies can see that the incidence of crime here is way below the incidence of crime in Great Britain.  Again, the ratio of police to 100,000 of the population here bears favourable comparison with the ratio across the water.  In this country the ratio is 266 per 100,000 of the population and when the extra 500 join the force the ratio will be 280 per 100,000 of the population. In England and Wales the ratio is <Col N="142" /> 218 per 100,000 of the population and in London it is 280, at least it was in 1975; presumably it has increased.  Yet the part of Great Britain with the highest ratio of police to the population also has the highest crime figures, so there is no connection essentially between the two.  I mention those as comparative figures which must be of interest in a debate of this kind.</P>
    <P>I was talking about the role of police in combating crime to show the steps that have been taken and to show the crime position based on statistics.  I mentioned, too, that in addition to the steps taken by the police the community itself has a responsibility in regard to crime.  The community working in liaison with the police force is the best way to deal with the problem.  To assist in involving the community in this problem, which is essentially a community problem and not a police problem, I am glad to report that an inspector has now been selected from each district of the Dublin metropolitan area who will be trained to undertake the duty of a community liaison officer.  I have met deputations from various parts of the city and from the Dublin branch of the National Association of Tenants Organisations and they have indicated to me their anxiety to co-operate with police in this city to ensure that any dichotomy between police and citizens will be removed.  In an effort to avail of this expressed goodwill these community liaison officers are being appointed for each of the districts of the Dublin metropolitan area.</P>
    <P>On an external basis their duties will be to be helpful to all members of the public and to youth and community organisations which need advice and to keep in touch with groups and organisations in their districts, to give talks in schools and other educational establishments and generally to inform the public of the gardaí and arrange liaison with the public in police matters.  They will have a role to play internally in indicating to the members of the force the importance of community relations and stimulating and fostering appropriate attitudes by members of the force dealing with the public in <Col N="143" /> order to ensure a high degree of co-operation between the police and the community.  It is only in that sort of integrated relationship that the crime problem will begin to be tackled and the heartening figures obtained in some of the Dublin districts will begin to be seen throughout the entire metropolitan area.</P>
    <P>I know the community have to take steps to protect themselves.  Deputy Dowling referred in perjorative terms to steps for protection which have been taken by shopkeepers and others.  They should not be referred to in those terms.  It is proper that shopkeepers and householders take steps to protect their property against vandals and criminals of a worse order, whether the steps be the installation of burglar alarms, the provision of protective screening or whatever.  Citizens have a responsibility and they cannot be all the time looking to the State to provide the very last in protection. There is a responsibility and a duty on citizens, and I am glad to note from what Deputy Dowling says that there has been a response in that regard. Again, co-operation is all-important.  I do not believe that there is a failure to report crime.  I am satisfied that crime is fully reported to the Garda and that the statistics we have can be relied on as an accurate estimate of the crime figures and in particular in the Dublin metropolitan area.  Apart from reporting crime it is important that citizens co-operate with the guards in giving them information about perpetrators of crime.  I have called in the past for a greater willingness on the part of the community to give information to the police.  The Garda Síochána are our police and are only as effective as we can make them.  That call, I am glad to say, was echoed in the past by the Opposition and I look forward to hearing it being echoed again in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>Another area in which the fight against crime has relevance is the courts and in the sanctions that are available to deal with criminals.  I share the perturbation of the Deputies on the other side who quote cases of criminals, possibly first-time offenders <Col N="144" /> as far as serious offences are concerned, getting what seems to the man in the street a rather light punishment for the offence in question.  We cannot adjudicate or tell the courts what to do.  The courts are independent, and properly so, in the exercise of their judicial duties.  We outside cannot hear or see what goes on in a court.  We do not hear the pressures of skilled advocacy or the background reports from welfare officers that influence a judicial person in making a decision. It is right that I should reflect in this House what is said to me by citizens: that the courts appear at times to be lenient having regard to the crime coming before them.  I have no doubt that the members of our judiciary, who are citizens and involved in our country as are the rest of us, are aware of the pattern of criminal activity and of the need to ensure that the full sanction of the law bears heavily and fully on criminals on whom it should bear heavily.</P>
    <P>In the near future the welfare service attached to my Department will be expanded considerably and I will be announcing the details of that very soon.  I hope that this too will have a beneficial effect, particularly in the Dublin metropolitian area, in enabling young persons to be taken into control early and supervised in their own localities. This will be another significient factor in the battle against crime.</P>

      <P>I assure the House that I share the concern which has been expressed about crime and the crime figures, but it is important that we should keep the matter in perspective and that in talking of it we should avoid extravagant language.  It is detrimental to the national good to state that this is a lawless city, that citizens are cowering in terror in their homes and that the streets are deserted at night.  This defies casual observation. One has only to go around to see that that is not true.  Apart from my own observation, I have given the comparative crime figures which show that compared with our nearest neighbour the incidence of crime here is considerably <Col N="145" /> less than the incidence of crime over there.  This is something that we must be pleased about and that we must all work to maintain and to improve further.  The Government will do their part by ensuring that there is a police force adequate in numbers, training and equipment to do the job they have to do.  The Government rely on the support of the Opposition to ensure that the community are constantly made aware of their obligation in this regard to take steps in their own areas to ensure that those among the community who might be tempted on courses of deviancy are restrained in so far as community sanctions and controls can restrain them.  They should co-operate with the police and generally behave in such a way as will help to decrease the incidence of crime.</P>
      <P>I was perturbed to hear Deputy Dowling's attack on officers of my Department for failure to supply him with information.  This motion, so far as I am aware, has been known to Deputy Dowling from last Thursday. He knew, presumably, as the instigator of it when he opened the debate here, what his line was to be and what he was going to say.  He waited until the afternoon of this debate and then demanded over the telephone a whole plethora of statistical information which I will not allow to be given out until it is checked and I am satisfied is accurate.  I deprecate his suggesting that there was some fault on the part of officers of my Department.  This is a matter in which I am concerned.  I am disappointed that Deputy Dowling should have used this debate for making an attack of that nature.</P>

I want to emphasise again the importance of looking at this in perspective.  Again I want to assure all citizens and the Deputies opposite that the Government and myself are concerned about the matter and that whatever steps need to be taken to ensure that the rate of crime continues to drop, as it has already started to drop in some significant districts of Dublin, will be taken.  This will continue to be the pattern throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the Minister for the last half-an-hour with an increasing sense of despair. It was a typical speech from a Fine Gael Minister for Justice who warns and advises everybody else in the country, the Opposition, the public, the Garda, the civil service and the community at large to beware of extravagant language.  The same Minister in the course of his contribution to this debate uses figures which are merely Ministerial figures not available to the rest of the community.  As I understand it they have not been published by the commissioner and are available only to the Minister himself.  These figures in the context of the debate here until they are published by the Garda Commissioner can be pooh-poohed as the Minister pooh-poohed the argument put up by Deputy Dowling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In debating this question we must get one thing clear from the start.  We <Col N="147" /> in Fianna Fáil in the motion we have put down are in no way critical of the performance of the Garda throughout the country and in this city in the work that they are doing under impossible conditions.  This is reflected in the wording of the motion.  It was responsibly worded and well thought out.  It reads as follows:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, taking serious note of the continuous rise in crime and vandalism in the City of Dublin, condemns the Government for failure to provide</P>
    <P>(a)  increased Garda presence on the streets</P>
    <P>(b)  increased night patrols in suburban areas</P>
    <P>(c)  for the maintenance of full establishment strength at all City Garda stations and</P>
    <P>(d)  extra Gardaí in areas where the 1977 crime figures have shown a substantial rise.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in that motion to indicate criticism of the Garda but there is a lot in it condemning this Government for their complete inactivity and inattention to the protection of citizens' rights and property rights.  We have heard this old cliché &ldquo;law and order&rdquo; being thrashed out by this Government.  During this term I worked in a by-election in west Mayo and I never heard more nauseating speeches in my life than from the people talking about law and order. The law and order situation in the city and county of Dublin is very unbalanced. The Minister said that he shared Members' concern about the increase in crime figures but that it was detrimental to the national good to distort the figures.  The Minister has distorted the figures in relation to the situation in Dublin.  The first two paragraphs in the April edition of the <i>Garda Review</i> are well worth quoting and they read as follows:</P>
    <P>Last June in these pages we drew attention to the deteriorating crime situation and we asked the Government to face up to the realistic problem of law enforcement.  We were subsequently taken to task <Col N="148" /> over our stand in the matter by the Minister for Justice in the Dáil.  At the same time the Minister informed the house that a decision to raise the strength of the force by five hundred members was ample evidence of the Government's commitment to do what was reasonably possible to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>Now, nearly one year later, not one of those extra five hundred Gardaí has been appointed and it will be at least eight months more before one of them, fresh from initial training at Templemore, takes up duty on the street.  Meanwhile, the crime situation continues to deteriorate.  Provisional figures given by the Minister at a Chamber of Commerce luncheon in January showed that in Dublin crime involving offences against the person, the most serious form of crime, rose by fifty one per cent in 1976 over the previous year.</P>
    <P>This is not Fianna Fáil propaganda. The <i>Garda Review</i> represents the views of the Garda force.  These figures are not distorted.</P>
    <P>What really distressed me about the Minister's contribution was the fact that, although he spoke about crime figures in London and Wales and about community involvement in Dublin, he did not speak about what the Government were doing to tackle the problem.  The Minister used figures to show that crime had decreased in some areas in the city and county of Dublin, in particular the Coolock and Cabra areas.  In one two-month period in 1976 in the Priorswood Estate, which is an area covered by the Coolock Garda station, there were over 68 break-ins.  This is an estate of about 300 houses.  One house was broken into at least three times and a number were broken into twice. I got these figures from a member of the association in that area.  This afternoon when working in my office I received a message from one of the ushers to ring a certain man.  When I rang him this man explained that he has a son aged about 16 who is studying for his leaving in June.  At about ten o'clock last night, having been studying all day, the boy went <Col N="149" /> out for a walk with a friend to get a breath of air before going to bed. He had gone no more than a couple of hundred yards from home when he was set upon by six thugs and had to be taken to hospital and was detained until about two o'clock this morning.  The boy's father wanted to know where the Garda were and where was all this protection of citizens we hear so much about from this law and order Government.  The Minister says that we should be very happy that we have not got the violence they have in London or Wales.  I suggest to the Minister that here is the hard evidence he was asking for earlier.  The Minister criticised points raised by Deputy Dowling as being too general, but I have outlined a specific case.  I will give the Minister the name and the details privately so that he can go into the situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister made great play of the fact that in 1974-75 there was an 18.8 per cent increase in crime and in 1976 there was only 11.4 per cent increase. That would have been an 11.4 increase on the 18.8 per cent increase of the previous year.  In effect, the Minister is saying that we should be grateful that our homes will be burgled only once a year from now on and not twice. They are not the sort of figures any Minister for Justice should stand over, and most Ministers for Justice would be ashamed to have been talking about them.  They are not figures we can question.  They are figures which the Minister gave to us tonight.  He must get clear in his mind that we are not asking for cliché law and order, glorious black print on the front of the evening papers.  We are asking for protection for the people of this city and county in their homes, shops and business premises.</P>
    <P>I should like to give the example of the situation in the Malahide district. The Malahide Garda station is dealt with by the superintendent in the Coolock area.  Malahide Garda station is responsible for approximately 25,000 people and deals with the villages of Malahide, Portmarnock, Kinsealy and the district joining up with the Coolock Garda station.  This station is served <Col N="150" /> by one sergeant, nine gardaí but no detectives.  The Minister and the House are familiar with the rota system used by the gardaí, the four shift situation, three on and one off.  There is a protection post in the area which involves three men, two on and one off.  As well as providing men for the protection post, there are two men off duty every day.  Two men are required in the station as well.</P>
    <P>The staff in this station are on duty from 9 a.m. to 1 a.m. the following morning in summer time.  The Minister for Justice regards this as a seaside resort despite the fact that 25,000 people live in the area.  In the winter time the station is only opened in the morning from 9 o'clock to 1 o'clock and from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. at night. There is a garda car and a motor bike in the station but they are only ornaments because there are no men there to use them.</P>
    <P>Last year about 300 housebreakings occurred in the area.  They had approximately 3,000 summonses to issue and about 1,000 warrants, most of which had to be sent back because there is no manpower there to do the work. The Feltrim quarry is in the area, and about three times every week they have to go along and supervise the use of the explosives.</P>
    <P>The Malahide Garda station was broken into on at least two occasions. It was broken into on St. Patrick's night, 1975.  It was closed, and a row took place outside.  They went in and stole a radio belonging to one of the gardaí.</P>
    <P>We hear the Minister for Justice stand up and tell us that we should be very happy with the situation, that we are not as bad as London and we are lucky that we are not living in Wales where the situation is ten times as bad.  I would like to remind him that we do not live in London or Wales.  We live in Ireland, and quite a large proportion of us live in the city and county of Dublin.  We knew the city and county of Dublin when it was a nice quite area to live in, when one did not have to fear if one's home was left unoccupied that when one returned it was stripped and nothing was left in it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="151" /> A man from Portmarnock came to me about 12 months ago and asked me if I could make representations to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to get a telephone for him.  He is a commercial traveller and has to be away from his home from Monday until Friday.  His young wife was living in the house on her own.  I got on to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and made a case for him. A week later the man came back to me and said that things had got a lot worse.  He told me that the houses on each side of his house were unoccupied, that the people were only moving in.  He said that the previous night he was away on business in Donegal and burglars stripped those two houses.  The young couples who had purchased those houses had carpets in them and had started to move in their furniture but had not yet lived in them.  The burglars removed everything from those houses. This is the type of situation the Minister tells us we should be very happy about.</P>
    <P>The responsibility is on the heads of the Minister for Justice and on the Government to provide the gardaí in <Col N="152" /> those areas.  The manpower is not being provided and the gardaí cannot do a good job under the present circumstances.  It is not possible for them to give the coverage the people deserve.  This is not something that is being quoted by Fianna Fáil.  This is being spoken of by the gardaí and by every responsible journal in the country, by every responsible residents' association, community council, tenants' association and every concerned citizen in this city and county.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that we should be happy that the crime rate is only 11 per cent instead of 18 per cent for last year.  We want to see the crime rate decreasing from its existing level, not increasing.  The only way it will decrease is if the Minister implements the suggestions in our Private Members motion.  The Minister did not refer to this motion in his contribution.  He gave us a lecture that we should be very grateful that we were not living in London or Wales.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 11.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 4th May, 1977.</P>

He appealed against this decision but an appeals officer disallowed his appeal.</P>
      <P>On the 2nd December, 1976, he renewed his claim for unemployment assistance but up to the present it has not been possible to give a decision on this claim because the Social Welfare officer to whom his case has been referred for a report on his circumstances has not yet succeeded in contacting him.  The officer has already called twice on him but he was not available. The officer has arranged to call again this week and has informed the claimant to this effect.  A decision will be given in the case as soon as the officer's report is received.</P>

      <P>An offer of service made to the person in question in November, 1973, was not accepted. It is expected that terms will be quoted towards the end of the year on foot of his most recent application.  It is not practicable to attend to the matter earlier because provision of service requires very extensive linework&mdash;reconstruction and cabling of almost seven miles of pole route&mdash;and the Department are already committed to a heavy engineering work programme.</P>
