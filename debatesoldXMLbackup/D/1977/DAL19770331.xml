      <P>Might I ask the Taoiseach if, before the Dáil goes into recess for Easter, the House could have a statement from the Government as to what proposals they intend now to implement in view of the breakdown at the Council of Ministers' meeting over the weekend on the fishery proposals.  I understand that the Government have been having discussions on this.  I wonder if the Taoiseach would indicate whether or not the Ministers concerned could make a statement to the House as to what intentions they have at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on this amendment yesterday I referred to the increasing number of people growing the genus <i>Cannabis</i>.  Though not wishing to deviate from the <Col N="775" /> amendment I drew attention to the fact that titled landowners, <i>nouveau riche,</i> pseudo-liberal, left wing intellectuals are among those most prominent in growing their own crop of marijuana, that it has become a fad and the in thing to have one's own private plot on one's estate and grow one's own supply.  Tied in with this in relation to other parts of the Bill&mdash; where a very liberal view is taken of the possession of a small quantity of cannabis for one's own use&mdash;there will be a further reflection on this section in relation to how much, if any, a person would be allowed to grow that would not come under the normal penalties in the Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill, in attempting to deal with the widespread problem of cannabis, is too bureaucratic, cumbersome and elaborate.  It is almost a blueprint of the British legislation introduced in 1972 by Reginald Maudling.  It is almost an identical copy&mdash;apart from the treatment sections&mdash;of the Fianna Fáil Bill.  It is also almost an identical copy of the Private Members' Bill Fianna Fáil attempted to bring in.</P>
      <P>This section, referring to the growing of cannabis and opium, to the preparation of cannabis for smoking, to an occupier in control of or concerned in the management of any land, vehicle or vessel, will be nullified by the section which allows a person to have cannabis in his possession for his own personal use. Therefore, I view with grave concern the ineffectiveness of any penalties which could be considered under this section.  It is well know that cannabis use has spread throughout our society at an alarming rate, that the numbers of those using it have increased dramatically.  Indeed, some of those users are among the most vulnerable sections of our society, many of them coming from the student population most in need of all the protection legislation can afford them.  When it comes to drugs of this kind liberal thinking is not to be condoned.</P>

      <P>I am anxiously awaiting the Deputy to come to <Col N="776" /> the subject matter of the amendment. I have already had to remind him that a long-ranging speech on this amendment is out of order.  He has had plenty of latitude in that regard.  I should like him now to come to the amendment.  Indeed, debate on the section is out of order.  The sections have been disposed of on Committee Stage.  We are now dealing with a very limited amendment on this section.  The Deputy has been allowed wide-ranging latitude and I am anxious that he would now come to the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate in Committee was rather limited and as a result of amendments there the Minister has now put forward this amendment which I support, although I had hoped he would go a little further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment which was necessary because as it was framed, section 19 could result in serious injustices.  It was very widely cast in its wording, and in the anxiety to deal with the problem, it would put a large number of people in danger of prosecution for offences in regard to which they would not be culpable.  The section deals with persons who are occupiers or are in control or are concerned in the management of any land, vehicle or vessel and sets out a number of situations.  Under the section as it exists, even though one might be only in control of or concerned with the management of land, one could be made liable for an offence if opium or cannabis were cultivated or grown on that land.</P>
      <P>The amendment goes some way to improve the situation, and in so far as the cultivation of opium poppies or the growing of cannabis is concerned, it will have to be proved that the activity is contrary to section 17.  It will have to be shown that the cultivation or the growth was not by licence.  That is what the amendment will mean.  We are all grateful to Deputy Byrne for directing attention to that situation and to the Minister for putting down the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="777" /> However, section 19 will still be very wide and many of us on the Special Committee expressed doubts on the situation.  When dealing with such a complicated situation we appreciate that we must be prepared to envisage a net catching people who might be innocent and we must still rely on the courts to ensure that justice will be done.  It must be realised that people completely innocent could be prosecuted under section 19 but in this sort of legislation this sort of thing seems to be inevitable if we are to deal with people who grow, push or sell these dangerous drugs.</P>
    <P>The amendment is only common sense because it makes sure at least that in a situation where a licence exists one will not be prosecuted for owning, controlling or managing land on which cannabis is grown or opium poppies are cultivated, activities with which a person is not connected in any way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne referred at some length to the whole question of cannabis.  We have now come to a decision about it rightly or wrongly.  It caused serious problems for laymen on the committee particularly when we found the medical experts in disagreement. In that situation what are we non-experts to do?  The discussion in the committee was worth while, everybody expressed views to the best of his ability and the Minister was very receptive. On the whole, it was a good constructive process and, rightly or wrongly, we have come to a certain decision about cannabis.  We are not prepared to accept yet that it is completely harmless, and the Bill is based on the proposition that it is still an offence to have cannabis in one's possession even for one's own use. However, we have made a reasonable compromise and all we can do is to hope that the legislation will work out reasonably satisfactorily and that some day the experts will reach a definitive decision on cannabis and let us know what they want us to do about it.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 16, to delete lines 16 to 33 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="778" />&ldquo;23. &mdash;(1) A member of the Garda Síochána who with reasonable cause suspects that a person is in possession in contravention of this Act of a controlled drug, may without warrant&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  search the person and, if he considers it necessary for that purpose, detain the person for such time as is reasonable necessary for making the search,</P>
    <P>(b)  search any vehicle, vessel or aircraft in which he suspects that such drug may be found and for the purpose of carrying out the search may, if he thinks fit, require the person who for the time being is in control of such vehicle, vessel or aircraft to bring it to a stop and when stopped to refrain from moving it, or in case such vehicle, vessel or aircraft is already stationary, to refrain from moving it, or</P>
    <P>(c)  seize and detain anything found in the course of a search under this section which with such cause appears to him to be something which might be required as evidence in proceedings for an offence under this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This arises from a discussion on section 23 on Committee and from recommendations by the National Health Council and medical people in relation to the matter of medical prescriptions and records.  It was felt that the legislation should not apply to medical prescriptions except in regard to controlled drugs.  The amendment confines the Garda Síochána search to controlled drugs.  It has been made clear that where a garda with reasonable cause suspects that a person is in possession of controlled drugs he may detain him for such time as is reasonably necessary to make the search.  The amendment also provides that a member of the Garda must have reasonable cause before he seizes for purposes of evidence anything found in the course of a search.  On the basis of Committee discussions and representations by the National Health Council I have tried to achieve the best balance possible in regard to the enforcement of the Act.</P>
    <Col N="779" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept the amendment and appreciate that the Minister is going a reasonable distance to meet suggestions made in Committee.  In sections 23, 24, 25 and 26 we come up against this very real problem of trying to maintain a balance between the rights of the individual, the freedom of the individual to go about his normal pursuits without interference and the necessity to deal with a social problem. We gave this matter a great deal of thought and consideration at the Special Committee and there was a very free and frank discussion on the matter.  We all found ourselves in agreement as to what we would like done.  We just had a difference of opinion as to how it should be done.</P>
      <P>There is no point in bringing in legislation of this sort unless we can ensure it is effective, it can be implemented and that the Garda Síochána have the capacity, the ability and the power to give effect to its provisions.  On the other hand, we do not want a police state.  We do not want the existence of some particular evil or problem to result in the loss of freedom for practically everybody in the community.  This is, perhaps, the modern dilemma; how do we cope with these problems in a modern community and how do we give the authorities the necessary powers to deal with these difficult situations while at the same time preserving the highest possible degree of individual freedom?  None of us wants to live in a community in which there are irksome and unnecessary restrictions on the liberty of the individual citizen.  We all like to try to achieve the situation where the person who does no wrong or is not involved in any nefarious activities would not be bothered by the Garda Síochána at any time or in any way but, unfortunately, that is not possible because the Garda Síochána cannot always know who is engaged in illegal or nefarious activities.  From time to time mistakes occur and innocent people find themselves involved with the law, through no fault of their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question recently we were told that the Garda <Col N="780" /> Síochána detained in the region of 400 people and finally were only able to procure prosecutions against six people.  We were told that prosecutions were only brought in 30 cases. That is an unduly high proportion. One would like to think that the Garda in the implementation of this legislation would be much more accurate in their assessment than that. It is a bit disconcerting to think that 400 people have to be brought in in order to prosecute 30.  That is an unhappy situation in any community. I do not believe that there is any danger of that arising in connection with the implementation of this legislation.  We all have a great deal of confidence in the members of the Garda Síochána who are entrusted with giving attention to this area. Most of us in our capacity as Deputies have some experience of the way in which the section of the Garda Síochána responsible for the drug problem go about their business and we are satisfied with the way they do that.  Of course, when this legislation comes into effect it will be open to any member of the force to act under the provisions of the legislation and, therefore, it is important that we build into these provisions as many safeguards as possible without, at the same time, making the legislation ineffective.  That is a perennial problem that confronts us in this House, to try to make sure that the Garda Síochána have the necessary powers and, at the same time, that the powers are not excessive.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of situation where we can only do our best in framing the legislation and then we have to leave it to the traditions of the Garda Síochána to ensure that the thing is implemented in a reasonable and satisfactory way.  A civil servant whom I knew once and who had spent a lifetime in the administration of justice here always maintained that the happiness and welfare of a local community depended on the common sense, wisdom and experience of the local Garda sergeant.  There is a great deal in that simple proposition. With a fair degree of confidence we can expect that these provisions will be used sensibly and reasonably by the <Col N="781" /> Garda Síochána and that the legislation will be clearly in the minds of the gardaí when they are enforcing its provisions. The purpose of the legislation is to deal with the evil problem that exists and, at the same time, not to have any undue, unnecessary or irksome interference with ordinary citizens going about their daily affairs.</P>
    <P>The changes made by the Minister in this new section are significant.  The basic change is the change of wording from &ldquo;reasonable grounds for suspecting&rdquo; to &ldquo;reasonable cause suspects&rdquo;.  At first sight there might not appear to be any great difference between those two sets of words but, in fact, there is.  The original section was concerned with the situation where a member of the Garda Síochána had reasonable grounds for suspecting and many of us thought that that was a bit nebulous, a bit vague, that any garda at any time could consider he had reasonable grounds for suspecting but there was no objective test which could be applied.  Under the new section there is a test which can, if necessary, be subsequently applied to the action of the garda.  The new section stipulates, in fact, that the garda, before he does any of these things without a warrant in section 23, must have a cause for suspecting.  That is a reasonable safeguard as far as we are concerned. If subsequently there is a complaint, legal action taken because of the action of the garda by someone who feels aggrieved, then it can be reasonably ascertainable whether or not the garda had cause to suspect as distinct from whether he had reasonable grounds.</P>
    <P>This is an improvement and one which we on the Special Committee asked the Minister to carry out.  He has now met us on this issue.  The new section is confined to controlled drugs and the forged or wrongfully issued prescription has been dropped from the ambit of of the section.  I think that is wise. After all, we are giving fairly unusual and wide power to a garda and it is right that it should be confined specifically to the actual problem itself, that is, the person on the drug.  I am glad to welcome the change which the Minister proposes here.  Perhaps we could have come up with a better or wiser provision <Col N="782" /> but we have done our best after long and serious discussion and earnest consideration and at this stage we can only hope that what we are providing here will work successfully.  It will give the Garda the special powers that they need to cope with the drug situation and at the same time they will be constrained to act reasonably in implementing the provisions of the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Haughey said, we spent quite some time on this section and also on sections 24 and 25, up to the concluding sections of this Bill.  We are now dealing with the implementation of the provisions of the Bill and if the Bill is to be really effective the remaining sections are of vital importance.  I had certain reservations about section 23 because I was a little worried about the prescription. I agree with the Minister's amendment.  He has come a long way to meet the wishes of the members of the working committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agreed totally with the original section but I should like to ask one question.  A person may be carrying a forged prescription and if this is suspected by the garda, what is the position then?  I agree with Deputy Haughey that we are all worried about infringing constitutional rights but at the same time we must remember that we are trying to protect thousands of young people from those who move through the streets and dance halls and lounge bars peddling drugs.  To me this is the most important aspect of the Bill.  We must safeguard these young people.  Perhaps the Minister could enlighten me further regarding the position of a garda who suspects someone and who, in the course of a search, comes upon a prescription which he has reason to suspect is forged.  That prescription could be a passport for that peddlar.  I am not objecting to removing prescriptions from the section but I am somewhat worried about this because we are really talking about the forged prescription.  The Minister said that he had discussions with the medical profession on this.  I agree with the section and I agree with the majority of the members of the committee in their observations but I <Col N="783" /> am worried about the situation in which a garda is convinced that the prescription has been forged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Fortunately, I do not have much contact with this problem down the country and the gardaí in my area do not have much difficulty with it either.  It is correct to say that the gardaí who are dealing with this in the built-up areas do so in a benevolent way and have a personal interest in the problem.  They act more in the preventative aspect than in the criminal aspect.  We are lucky in the people to whom we are giving those powers. Any reasonable person must agree that under some circumstances a garda must have the right of search without warrant and he must have the right to detain persons for some time. My worry would be about how long the person would be detained.  I feel that under present circumstances the people dealing with this problem are not likely to abuse this power and it would be a pity if this power were abused at any time.  It is important to build up a relationship between the Garda and the people trying to break the law and this relationship should be fostered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wyse has indicated that his difficulty is with the forged prescription. I do not see the same difficulty here because the Minister has indicated that he is giving a lot of thought, with the medical profession, to the design of the prescription form.  It has been suggested by Deputy Haughey that it should be an easily recognisable form and it should be obvious to any pharmacist with a reasonable amount of experience that there is a difference between it and the forged prescription. No doubt there are clever people who will from time to time succeed in forging a prescription but the number of times this would occur would be limited.  There is another aspect which the law cannot take cognisance of and that is that there are certain people who like to have access to medicines, even though they have no notion of taking them, because the fact that they are there gives them a certain amount of confidence.  The medicines may be in cupboards for months and this is <Col N="784" /> what leads to the build-up of medicines in cupboards.  It is also possible that a person might like to have a prescription in his pocket in case he would need the prescription at any particular time and the fact that he has it gives him the feeling that he has something to fall back on should the necessity arise.  I admit this is not the best reason for having prescriptions in one's pocket.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is in relation to ships.  Has any thought been given to the proposed extension of our fishery limits to 50 miles and 200 miles? Where do we stand legally in those circumstances?  Will this Bill extend to the 50-mile and 200-mile limits?  The number of occasions on which a problem could arise would be few but there is food for thought here.  By and large, I agree with the amendment and I doubt if the Bill would function at all without it.  If the amendment were not incorporated the Bill, when enacted, would be useless.  The only matter on which I have a slight doubt or to which I have some objection is that of detention.  One hopes the need for this will be the exception rather than the rule.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Following on what Deputy Gibbons has said, I was talking about the forged prescription.  The Minister has yet to make the decision on section 14.  I understand he is still discussing it with the medical profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment has been generally accepted by Members. It is in accordance with the representations made at the Special Committee and as a result of discussions with the National Health Council and the medical profession.  Deputy Wyse said he was worried about the phraseology in section 23.  It has been changed.  We must agree that the Garda act with care and responsibility and the words used are &ldquo;has reasonable cause&rdquo;.  They must have reasonable cause.  If they do not have <Col N="785" /> reasonable cause a civil action could be taken against them so they will have to be very, very careful.  I do not suggest the Garda should be timid in searching for drugs but they will be aware that they must be very, very careful.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gibbons referred to the detention of a person whom a garda had reasonable cause to believe was carrying drugs.  That was very wide indeed in the original section but now a person can only be detained for such time as is reasonably necessary in regard to a search.  That would, of course, be determined by the Garda. Nobody visualises a search continuing for a week and a person being detained for a week.  I cannot say how long a search might last but I believe it would be carried out in a proper manner.  I am not trying to commit the Garda to anything, but detention in the original section could mean detention for any period whatsoever.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wyse referred to an infringement of constitutional rights.  This is an extremely delicate and difficult situation but, as far as drugs and drug abuse are concerned, whilst we certainly do not waive constitutional rights, we must trust the Garda and give them as much latitude as possible in order to stamp out this evil.</P>
      <P>The question was raised as to what would happen if a prescription were found in the course of a search.  Subsection (1) specifically provides that a garda cannot search for prescriptions as such but, if he came across what he believed to be a forged prescription, I think we would have to accept that. What we want to guard against is the searching of cars belonging to the medical profession in which there might be confidential documents.  In the case of the ordinary person a garda would be bound to act in accordance with the law if he found what he believed to be a forged prescription.</P>
      <P>This amendment, as Deputy Haughey said, is a vast improvement on the original section.  That improvement is the result of the detailed discussion we had in the Special Committee. I believe we have gone as far as we can in this amendment.</P>

      <P>(c)  with reasonable cause suspects that the person unless he is arrested either will abscond for the purposes of evading justice or will obstruct the course of justice, or</P>
      <P>(d)  having inquired of the person, has reasonable doubts as to the person's identity or place of abode, or</P>
      <P>(e)  having inquired of the person, knows that the person does not ordinarily reside in the State, or has reasonable doubts as to whether the person so resides.</P>
      <P>he may arrest the person without warrant.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If Members look at the original section 25 they will see that it is a very short and rather severe type of section. After discussion in the Special Committee I decided that it seemed to be too severe because it gave wide power of arrest without certain safeguards.  A number of suggestions were made for modifying these powers and the consensus generally was that the section should be limited to serious offences or to circumstances in which there was an obvious and serious risk of an evasion of justice if the ordinary procedure of securing a warrant for arrest had to be followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="787" /> In this amendment I have tried to meet the consensus of views expressed at the Special Committee.  The original section 25 is being replaced by a new section.  Subsection (1) provides for an unqualified right to arrest without warrant only in case of offences under section 15&mdash;in other words, arrest of persons suspected of being pushers.  In such cases I do not think we would be justified in restricting the Garda in the enforcement of this particular section.</P>
    <P>For other offences under the Bill the power of arrest without warrant would be restricted in a number of ways.  These are set out in the amendment in paragraphs (c) to (e) of the proposed new subsection (2).  The garda must have reasonable cause to think that the suspect might abscond or obstruct the course of justice.  He must have reasonable doubts about the identity of his place of abode or must have doubts about whether the person resides in the State.  In cases not covered by these considerations the ordinary procedure of obtaining a warrant for arrest would apply.  In this amendment I have endeavoured to maintain the balance between the need for effective enforcement of the Act and the rights of the individual. I hope that this new section, the substitution for section 25 of the original Bill, will be accepted by the House.</P>

      <P>Once more I am glad to welcome this amendment and to agree to the change the Minister proposes to make.  As he said, section 25, as originally put before us, was very draconian.  It was a pretty simple straightforward provision that a garda only had to be of the opinion that a person had committed an offence under this Act.  It is important to note that it dealt with any offence under the Act.  If the garda was of the opinion that any offence under the Act was committed he could arrest without warrant.  I believe, looking back on it now and reflecting on it, we all agree that was far too sweeping and far too loose in the wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A garda had only to be of opinion and the original section did not even state that he had to have <Col N="788" /> any grounds for that opinion.  He could, out of the air, as it were, form an opinion that an offence was committed. The Minister is very wise in making the change he now puts before us.  A very important aspect of the change is that the new section 25 will be confined to offences under section 15.  That is the real essence of the change.</P>
    <P>Section 15, is, of course, the pushing section.  It is the one which deals with people who are in the commercial business of selling or supplying controlled drugs.  The section is directed at the heart of this problem.  It tries to catch the people who are engaged in the nefarious trade of pushing controlled drugs.  That is basically what section 15 is about.</P>
    <P>I fully agree that section 25 will be confined to offences under section 15. The original section 25 would have enabled a garda to arrest a citizen who committed the simplest and most technical type of offence under the Bill.  It is quite proper to confine the power of arrest without warrant to offences arising under section 15 because that is really the sort of offence all of us want to get at.  That is the activity we want this Bill to bring to a complete stop.  We are all quite prepared to give the Garda the maximum possible powers we can legitimately grant them to deal with that type of offence.</P>
    <P>The new section 25 also introduces the concept of reasonable cause.  A member of the Garda Síochána, before deciding to act under the new section 25, must have reasonable cause, as distinct from the old section 25, which just stated that he would have to be of opinion.  That is a commendable change and it is an adequate safeguard.  The new section 25 is very cleverly constructed.  It is in two parts and it is a very sensible and intelligent approach to divide the matter into those two parts.</P>
    <P>Section 25 now stipulates that where a garda has reasonable cause for suspecting that an offence under section 15 of the Act has been committed and so suspects the person of having committed the offence he may arrest without warrant.  That is a simple straightforward situation.  An offence must be <Col N="789" /> committed before that particular part of the section comes into operation.  If the garda has reasonable cause for suspecting that the offence has been committed and that this person has committed it he can arrest him without warrant.  We all agree with that.  There must be reasonable cause and there must be an actual offence.  Then the garda can arrest the person without warrant.</P>
    <P>I might not have made it quite clear that subsection (1) of the new section 25 is restricted to section 15, the pushing section.  I may have suggested that all of the new section is restricted to offences under section 15.  As far as the offences under section 15 are concerned they are dealt with under subsection (1) and the situation is quite straightforward and quite specific.</P>
    <P>The second part of the new section deals with offences under this Act other than offences under section 15 and what is proposed there is not quite so draconian as what is proposed in relation to offences under section 15. In subsection (2) of the new section we will be dealing with what I might call ordinary offences, those which are separate from the crime of pushing and selling.  The Minister rightly makes an important distinction between those two types of offences.</P>
    <P>In regard to the general body of offences which will arise under the other provisions of the Act, other than section 15, a different procedure is envisaged. Again, the Garda must have reasonable cause for suspecting that an offence has been committed or is attempted and that the person involved is the person who has committed or has attempted to commit the offence. Then, if the Garda suspects that unless the person is arrested that he will either abscond for the purpose of evading justice or will obstruct the course of justice or, having inquired of the person, has reasonable doubts as to the person's identity or place of abode, or having inquired of the person, knows that the person does not ordinarily reside in the State or has reasonable doubts as to whether the person so resides, he may arrest the person without warrant.</P>
    <P>It is only in those circumstances in regard to offences other than offences <Col N="790" /> under section 17 that the Garda can arrest without warrant.  He must suspect that the person will abscond unless arrested or that he has given a wrong identity or wrong address or that he is not normally resident in the State or it is not clear where he resides. I think we would all have no hesitation in agreeing that in those circumstances the Garda concerned should have power to arrest the person without a warrant.</P>
    <P>Again it is a difficult situation.  It is hard to know where the line should be drawn.  We do not want to have members of the Garda Síochána going around arresting without warrant at the drop of a hat, as it were.  On the other hand, we do not want the Garda to be completely inhibited from dealing with the problem.  The Minister has put forward this proposal which, as I say, is in two parts.  It deals with offences under section 15, the pushing section, and then it deals with the rest of the offences which arise under the legislation.  Two separate procedures are envisaged for these two separate categories of offences.  For my part, I am quite satisfied to accept this proposal. It may not work.  The Garda may have to go back to the Minister after a period of time and say. &ldquo;We cannot deal with the problem under this provision.  We would like a different sort of power, or extended power.&rdquo;  In that case this Legislature will have to look at the position again and consider what should be done.</P>
    <P>At the moment, after our discussion and consideration, this seems to be a reasonable way of proceeding.  It certainly meets many of the objections which were put forward and, particularly, it makes this important distinction between the two categories of offences, the type of person who is, by and large, in the area of controlled drugs to make money and the other type of person who is involved in the world of drugs for some other less blameworthy, less culpable reason. Again I commend the Minister for his attempt here in this section to meet the situation and to meet the objections and worries which were expressed by different members of the Special Committee when we were considering the original section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 28 relates to the option, in certain circumstances, for persons convicted of offences under the Act of being referred for treatment instead of being sent to prison.  The section was introduced primarily in relation to persons who are themselves takers of drugs and who accordingly might need medical treatment, but as the section stands it relates also to persons convicted under section 18 of the Bill, that is, those convicted of forging prescriptions.  This was included because a person so convicted is also likely to be a user and thereby have the problems for which section 28 was specifically put into the Bill.</P>
      <P>In the debate on Committee, however, Deputy Haughey made the point that if the section were applied to these forgers then it was just as logical to apply it to those convicted under section 17 for illegal cultivation of, for example, cannabis.  I accept the logic of Deputy Haughey's point and agree that offenders under section 17 and section 18 should be dealt with similarly in section 28.  However, on considering this matter it seems to me wrong that the courts should be obliged to refer a person convicted under either of these sections to a treatment centre.  Accordingly, what is proposed by the amendments under consideration is that the court will have the option, but not the obligation, of referring a convicted forger or cultivator to the treatment centre.  I hope this modification in the section will be agreed by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think it is a useful piece of tidying up here.  Section 28 will now be confined to persons who are convicted of an offence under section 3, other than a first or second offence, that is, the cannabis offence&mdash; the section which comes under the ambit of section 27&mdash;or an offence <Col N="792" /> under section 15.  Sections 16 and 18 are taken out of that part of the section and paragraph (b) will now read that &ldquo;where a person is convicted of a first or second offence under section 3 of this Act in relation to which a penalty may be imposed under the said section 27 (1) (a)&rdquo;&mdash;again that is the cannabis section&mdash;or an offence under section 17.  Those latter words are brought in under amendment No. 30. This seems to me to be a sensible adjustment of these very useful provisions. Many people hope for a lot from this section and it is an important part of the approach of the legislation to the problem that the court can remand persons convicted to arrange for their medical treatment or care.  It is one thing to bring in legislation to control by means of penalties for criminal offences the misuse of drugs, but it is an entirely separate area to try to ensure that some form of treatment is given to those unfortunate people who become involved with this problem.</P>
      <P>Section 28 recognises that a person who might be convicted under certain provisions of the legislation might not necessarily be a criminal at all and would be far more in need of care and treatment than of punishment.  That is a very important aspect of the general approach of the legislation.  I hope it will work out satisfactorily.  It is breaking new ground.  It is an innovation. We can only hope that this provision will be used carefully by the courts and used fully when necessary to try to ensure that persons are just not convicted, punished and forgotten but if there is in the view of the courts a need to go a bit further and to arrange for medical treatment or care, the courts will be authorised to act accordingly.  It is an important section and we all hope that it will have a beneficial effect and that it will work satisfactorily.  It may not and may prove in practice inoperable or difficult to operate but we can only do our best, introduce this type of machinery and see how it works out.  As far as these amendments Nos. 29 and 30 are concerned they are an improvement because they make the operation of section 28 more sensible.</P>

      <P>Before the Committee Stage of the Bill I received representations from the medical profession to the effect that the consent of the medical practitioner in charge of the treatment centre should be obtained before he is obliged to accept a person referred to under section 28.  I agreed that this would be a reasonable practice when I spoke on Committee Stage and I proposed an amendment which would require the court to satisfy itself that the medical practitioner in charge of the treatment centre agreed that it was appropriate for the person concerned to be received there.  The Special Committee, however, thought that this might be going too far and I withdrew the amendment.  The amendments I now move are a modified version which leaves the decision with the court as to whether a person should go to the treatment centre or not but which requires that the medical practitioner in charge would be consulted before the court makes up its mind. I think that this, arising out of the Committee discussions, is a reasonable compromise and I recommend it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>All these amendments are acceptable.  The principal one is amendment No. 34.  The rest are really consequential to enable the new subsection (8) to operate.  Deputies who were on the Special Committee will recall the discussions we had on this matter.  It was recognised that there was a problem in regard to the institutions <Col N="794" /> to which persons might be committed for medical or custodial treatment. It is all very well for us to lay down that the courts could send persons for treatment to institutions but what will happen if the institution refuses to accept the person?  As the Minister has pointed out, we discussed this at some length in Committee and it was very useful for us in that Committee to have as members of it doctors who had practical experience of this sort of thing.  It is quite possible to visualise a <i>contretemps</i> arising from the courts committee people to institutions and the institutions either refusing to accept them&mdash;not being in a position to accept them&mdash;or making difficulties.  The Minister had one proposal at the Special Committee and that did not seem to many of us to meet the situation.  Now the Minister is bringing forward this proposal which I think is a fair compromise.  It indicates that the court cannot operate these committal provisions unless after consulation with, or consideration of a report of, either the medical practitioner in charge of the hospital, clinic, custodial treatment centre or other place concerned or a medical practitioner nominated by that person, it is satisfied that the giving or making of the commission or order would be the appropriate course having regard to the needs of the person proposed to be committed and would not prejudicially affect the ability of such hospital, clinic, custodial centre or other place to provide for the treatment or care of persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have two aspects of it.  On the one hand, the court is expected to satisfy itself after some reasonable process of consultation that the committment to the institution would be appropriate to that person.  On the other hand, the new subsection (8) is alert to the danger that an institution clinic or centre might not be able to accept the person without interfering with its proper running and administration and without detriment to the existing patients.  These are two important aspects of it and we are recognising here that it is not just a matter of the courts in a vacuum arbitrarily ordering that the particular convicted person be committed to a particular institution. <Col N="795" /> There is need for some investigation and co-operation.  Investigation, consultation and co-operation are necessary in the interests of the person about to be committed, the institution itself and the people already in that institution.  Some institutions which might be thought by the court to be suitable might not, in fact, be suitable to receive a particular person and a person whom the courts would wish to commit to a particular centre or institution might totally disrupt that institution or centre to the detriment of the patients already in it.  This is a very sensible provision, well drawn and carefully constructed and should operate satisfactorily.  As far as I can see, it gets over the difficulty and meets the situation which we were all aware of when we were talking about this in the Special Committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we say farewell to this legislation there are a few comments I should like to make in regard to it.  First, I wish to express the appreciation of this side of the House in regard to the attitude and the approach of the Minister to this Bill. It was satisfying and encouraging for us to know that the Minister, conscious of the importance of the measure and having regard to the delicacy of the matters with which it dealt, was prepared to take the Opposition fully into his confidence and consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was one Bill that benefited considerably from being put through the Special Committee procedure.  One very serious disadvantage in this regard from the point of view of hardworking Deputies is the fact that these committees are ignored largely by the Press and the media generally.  It is discouraging for many Deputies, particularly the younger ones, who put a great deal of work into these committees to find that they are ignored in this way.  In the case of the legislation before us there was one honourable exception.  I refer to the medical correspondent of <i>The Irish Times</i> who reported in a very mature and intelligent way the discussions of the Special Committee but so far as ordinary media reporting is concerned, the Committee might just as well not have been meeting.  It is sad that all those commentators who express the desire to have Dáil procedures improved and who engage in criticism <Col N="802" /> of our procedures, ignore us when we make a serious attempt to make use of the Special Committee procedure. However, on this occasion that procedure worked very well.  This can be attributed largely to the quality of the people who sat on the Committee, most of whom took the work very seriously, participated fully and studied the situation with which we are trying to deal.  They gave their views in a straightforward, responsible and mature way.</P>
    <P>Another reason for the success of the Special Committee in this instance was the Minister's attitude.  He was prepared to listen, to consider and, where possible, to meet the view of the Committee.  Most of the amendments that have been dealt with on Report Stage resulted from the Minister's co-operation with the Committee. Mostly, they were brought forward by the Minister to meet viewpoints or criticism put forward by Committee members to meet dangers or problems which the members envisaged arising.</P>
    <P>This is very important legislation. It has taken a long time to come to fruition.  The situation with which it deals is complex and difficult.  The misuse of drugs is a modern problem and one in respect of which we have not very much legislative experience. To a large extent we have been feeling our way, so to speak, in dealing with this Bill.  I do not know whether I am right in this but my impression is that the problem of drug taking, particularly among young people, is on the wane.  At least one is not as conscious now of the intensity of the problem as was the case, perhaps, five or six years ago.  That is all to the good.</P>
    <P>Throughout the legislation we have had to endeavour to maintain a balance, to strike a happy medium and to try to preserve the individual rights and personal freedom of individual citizens while at the same time giving the authorities the necessary powers to implement the legislation effectively.  We have had to try, too, to bring in legislation that would render certain acts punishable but we have had to recognise that very often people <Col N="803" /> committing these offences are not guilty of criminal activity in the normal sense but, perhaps, are people who require medical care and attention rather than punishment.  Therefore, this has been a difficult legislative exercise.  There were very significant disagreements among those of us who took an interest in the Bill but I think we can say that this Legislature has discharged its responsibility on this occasion in a wise and mature fashion.  Although there were disagreements. Members were prepared to compromise and to arrive at a proposal which would have general acceptability.  All the time we were confronted with this basic underlying problem of the medical people concerned disagreeing as to what should be done.  They were not prepared to give us a unanimous opinion as to what line we should adopt in regard to this modern problem of the misuse of drugs.  However, despite all those difficulties we had the full co-operation of the Minister and it is largely due to his attitude that we now have this legislation.  At this stage all we can do is hope for the best and put forward the legislation, asking the authorities to implement it.  We trust it will make an important and significant contribution to the welfare of our community in so far as this aspect of life is concerned.</P>
    <P>While the Bill is basically a lawenforcement measure we would all wish that it would have the result of helping our young people to cope with the problems of modern living to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to compliment the Minister for the manner in which he approached this legislation.  We had many differences but, as Deputy Haughey has said, everybody was prepared to make a contribution and work for the benefit of all.  I enjoyed working on the Committee and this I think was mainly due to the Minister's co-operation.  I hope the legislation will be effective. It will need the co-operation of the Garda, the courts, the medical profession and the general public.  Usually it is the young people who are affected <Col N="804" /> by this drug culture.  They are confronted with drugs in dance halls, streets, lounge bars and so on and we should make a special appeal to them that where they have information about persons peddling drugs or people being invited to certain places they should give this information to the Garda.  They would be doing a great service.  It would show their civic spirit and help to protect themselves and their children and the community in general.</P>
      <P>Young people have a tremendous part to play in ensuring that this legislation will be effective.  That is why I am speaking now because I know, through my involvement with young people that they have this information but, unfortunately, they must be prepared to co-operate with the Garda.  We are indebted to the Garda for the work they are doing in this matter.  On the other hand, I suppose we shall be discussing ways and means of helping people by prevention rather than cure and we hope that the Minister will keep in mind the importance of making available as soon as possible especially to the medical profession, places where people can be looked after rather than have them going into psychiatric institutions.  This is of vital importance if we are to help drug addicts: the general hospitals must make available private beds and so on where these unfortunate people can be cared for.</P>
      <P>It is only right that I should also pay special tribute to our spokesman on Health, Deputy Haughey.  He was a great source of help to all of us on the Committee.  He did tremendous research and although we differed at times over certain things, I as a member, have the greatest admiration for the tremendous efforts he made in contributing to this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the legislation now being passed here.  It is no harm to reflect that it was first brought up, and is on the record of this House, in 1966. Deputy L'Estrange and Deputy Clinton in Opposition raised it also and the need for legislation of this kind.  Ten years later the legislation is now in its final Stages.  In 1971 <Col N="805" /> Fine Gael introduced a Private Members' Bill which was refused.  The Minister for Health introduced legislation but because of the 1973 general election it fell.  After that election Deputy O'Malley of Fianna Fáil introduced a Private Members' Bill and, finally, the Minister for Health introduced this legislation.</P>
      <P>I should like to be in a position to say that I am very pleased with all the contents of the Bill, entitled an Act, to prevent the misuse of certain dangerous or otherwise harmful drugs but, unfortunately, I am rather pessimistic as regards the efficacy of the measure in regard to the most insidious of all drugs, cannabis.  It must be said, whether we like it or not, that Irish society which is uniform in its culture, its ethos and racial qualities, is one of the few societies in which one could expect the authorities to come to grips with the problem of drug taking since we are free from many of the defects that other societies have, due to their cosmopolitan make-up and the different cultures that are a hindrance to the detection, eradication and prevention of drug problems.  These do not exist to any extent in our society and I am disappointed that we have not produced a less elaborate and I would consider possibly more efficient piece of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first defect I see in this is the effective decriminalising to all intents and purposes of the use of marijuana and cannabis resin for one's own personal use.  Perhaps the most disappointing part of the legislation is the absence of a definition of the quantity that a person may have in his possession.  It is, perhaps, disappointing that there is an omission of a definition of cannabis whether this would be the leaf or the resin, each of which has a different concentration of the active constituent in the cannabis plant.  Without those, I think we have been flippant in our approach, and that although we gave a great amount of time to this matter on Committee Stage, we have not grasped the nettle and I think that in time the Minister will possibly have to introduce some form of amendment to this effect.  In <Col N="806" /> effect, we have become the most liberal country in western Europe in regard to the personal consumption of marijuana and the Bill that we are passing effectively decriminalises marijuana for personal use.  It decriminalises the growing of it and the preparation of it for personal use and it decriminalises the possession and consumption of it for personal use.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the legislation because the kernel of the drug problem as we know it is the cannabis problem, the drug on which the youth start.  Every heroin addict starts on cannabis: not every cannabis addict goes on to heroin but every heroin addict, whose history has been recorded, started on cannabis.  I should like to refer to another omission about which I think Deputy Wyse was concerned and that is in regard to the reporting of people to the Garda Síochána.  I suggested at certain stages of this legislation that it would not be impracticable where a person was being pressed by friends to take cannabis or other drugs, such a person should report the matter to the Garda Síochána and that they should be rewarded in some way when an amount of drugs was seized instead of people being frightened of these pushers to the extent they are frightened.</P>
    <P>Another omission I attempted to bring up in the Special Committee was the provision of special courts to deal with this exact type of problem, such as they have in other countries.  In the United States there is a special subcommittee sitting in Washington having a look at the overall picture of the cannabis problem.  As Deputy Haughey said earlier, this committee reported that the medical experts disagree. Disagreement among the medical profession and chemists is sufficient warning that the drug cannabis is not harmless.  If a drug is not harmless, it should not be decriminalised. It is one thing to prove a drug is harmful and it is another thing to prove it is harmless.  We have had that problem in the medical profession for years.  Something which is not harmless is not released.  Something that is harmful is never released.  At least 50 <Col N="807" /> per cent of the medical reports have shown this drug to be harmful.  None has shown it to be harmless.  We should consider special courts for people who have entered into the drug-taking scheme.</P>
    <P>The drug squad are to be commended for the great work they have done over the past decade against tremendous odds in relation to personnel and detection.  The customs and excise people have also done their very best.  At the Special Committee I suggested that we should have a review of this type of legislation and a monitoring of its efficacy.  As Deputy Haughey said, it was an excellent committee. He deserves great credit for the catalytic way in which he helped the great work of the Minister who was extremely helpful to everyone.  He did a wonderful job in getting the Bill expeditiously through the Committee. Yesterday and today with kindness and generousity he has ensured that the Bill will become law.  There has been a vacuum.  This is very similar to the legislation in the United Kingdom.  The disappointing aspect is the decriminalisation and the liberalising of cannabis which will not make us popular in the EEC, will not make us popular with the drug squad, and certainly will not make us popular with parents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Byrne continues to exclaim <i>&ldquo;Delenda est Carthago&rdquo;</i>.  I should like to join with other speakers in paying tribute to the Minister on the way he has conducted the discussions on this Bill and also to his advisers who gave us so much help from the beginning.  One must be impressed by the efforts of Deputy Haughey, who probably had not the same amount of advice available to him, for the time and detail he brought to bear on this legislation.  Future offenders must be very grateful for the fact that two such humane men were dealing with this problem.  One would like to think that in future, if the legislation has to be amended, two such humane men will be dealing with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputies who commented on the manner in which this Bill was dealt with at various <Col N="808" /> stages.  At the initial meetings of the Special Committee Deputy Haughey described it as ham-fisted and complicated.  I took the Bill from my predecessor and the object, of course, was to try to make it as uncomplicated as possible, and to make it readable and operable.  This type of legislation is not unlike other Bills which could be described as complicated with so many cross-references and so on, and so much legal jargon. During the course of Committee Stage, I thought one would nearly want to be a legal man and a medical man in order to understand the Bill in its entirety.</P>
      <P>I do not say this by way of criticism but I believe there was a defect in the original Bill in that drug offenders were to be subject to punishment, detention, and so on.  While we all abhor the use of these dangerous drugs, my personal view is that as a society we have a duty to help drug takers.  This was a defect in the Bill, and one which we have corrected and which I trust will be accepted by the Seanad.  We must have a certain amount of sympathy for young people who are hooked, possibly not through their own fault, but through a sense of bravado, or a sense of fear in certain company if they do not take cannabis or some such drug.  Treatment is extremely important.  As Deputy Dr. Gibbons and Deputy Wyse said, we must ensure that there will be accommodation for these people.</P>
      <P>This legislation updates our control of drugs.  My information is that the last Bill dealing with drugs was the Drugs Act, 1934.  Certainly, the situation has changed very dramatically since 1934 so far as the consumption of illegal drugs is concerned.  I agree with Deputies opposite and with Deputy Byrne who advocated that the Bill should be proceeded with as quickly as possible in order to have it on the Statute Book and in order that its various provisions can be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also updates our control of drugs in accordance with international thinking on the subject.  Some countries are much more advanced than we are in this regard, but our Bill will measure up to any legislation in any of the <Col N="809" /> other European or American countries. I should like to thank the Special Committee.  Deputy Byrne raised the question of cannabis.  In view of all the discussion which ensued, and in view of the various expert reports we got, I think we came to the proper conclusion when we decided that there would be different penalties in respect of cannabis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne said the amendment was tantamount to decriminalising the use of cannabis but it is not.  All of us know of the dangers of cannabis.  We have an idea of the frequency with which it is smoked, without having any special examples.  There was a view in the Special Committee that cannabis was harmful.  I will not say that was the majority opinion but the majority opinion was that there should be some penalty not as severe for cannabis as for other controlled drugs. The Special Committee decided unanimously with regard to the first two offences in connection with the consumption or smoking of cannabis that they would be confined to fines.  However, it was decided that on the third offence not only could there be a fine but there could be imprisonment as well at the discretion of the court.  In addition to that there is provision in the Bill for remedial treatment.</P>
    <P>Another important change in the original Bill was the amendment that abolished the various categories.  Many opinions were expressed about how dangerous one drug might be or how less dangerous another might be.  In all the circumstances I think it is best to have just one Schedule but, of course, to have different penalties for the various offences.</P>
    <P>Another important change was in respect of the powers of the Garda Síochána and we discussed this matter this morning.  In the Special Committee it was pointed out that at present the Garda Síochána have no powers to search for drugs.  They have to use another Act in order to accost and to search persons whom they suspect of having drugs in their possession.  The Garda Síochána will now have well defined powers.  It was an absolute necessity to delete section 25 altogether because, as was pointed out this morning, it went much too <Col N="810" /> far.  With the new provision the Garda Síochána will use their discretion and their powers to ensure that this drug problem can be dealt with.  It is a problem that is not peculiar to Ireland. I do not know the statistics regarding the use of these dangerous drugs but I assume from remarks made that in the bigger centres in Ireland a certain number of people use them.  The Garda Síochána now have certain powers but, knowing them as I do, I believe they will use their discretion and will not invade any constitutional rights so far as individuals are concerned.</P>
    <P>It may be a complicated Bill but I think it is now more acceptable to Members of the Oireachtas and, I trust, to the country.  I should like to pay tribute to the members of the Special Committee who worked under the chairmanship of Deputy Barry Desmond.  In that Committee we worked with open minds and, apart from a few instances, I did not recognise any political party set-up.  The members of the Committee approached their job with open minds and, as a result, we got this Bill.  One of the significant points about the manner in which we treated this Bill in the Special Committee was the fact that there was no vote whatever.  We appeared to be far apart in respect of certain points but after talking it out we came together and decided what amendments might be made on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I think I have fulfilled all the promises.  I made in the Special Committee with regard to amendments that were considered necessary.  I should like to thank Deputy Haughey, the shadow Minister for Health who conducted most of the discussion on behalf of his party, for his co-operation. I wish to thank the Special Committee as a whole for their co-operation in what was a tricky job over a long period.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="815" /> What is included here is the provision for limited light non-industrial work by children between the ages of 14 and 15.  Deputies will recall that that was the subject of a good deal of discussion on Committee Stages in the Dáil and Seanad.  The formula incorporated in this amendment should gain general all-party acceptance, as it did in the Seanad, as a compromise solution to a difficult issue.  For two years after the Act comes into operation, the intention is to ban employment during school term for those aged 14 to 15.  We can extend that two-year period by coming to the House again if circumstances dictate.  On the other hand, if it is not tampered with in two years' time this exception lapses.  That is what these amendments are about.  Amendment No. 27 is necessary for reference to the House for these powers.</P>

      <P>Section 5: In page 5, line 39, &ldquo;obtain&rdquo; deleted and &ldquo;require and production of&rdquo; substituted.</P>
      <P>This amendment simply requires the substitution of &ldquo;require the production of&rdquo; for &ldquo;obtain&rdquo; in relation to certificates.  The problem raised in the Seanad was that the original wording of the section might be said to have required the acquisition of a fresh birth certificate each time a person was seeking a job.  The revised formula meets the objective of this requirement and overcomes the possibility that somebody might have to get a fresh birth certificate each time he looks for fresh employment.</P>

      <P>Section 7: In page 6, line 29, &ldquo;ten&rdquo; deleted and &ldquo;nine&rdquo; substituted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will remember that we had a very long debate here on the provisions relating to the maximum and normal hours in sections 7,8 and 9. <Col N="818" /> I undertook at that time to review these matters as soon as possible.  I did so and I have had consultations with both the unions and employer interests. I believe that what we have now are improvements, in the form of amendments, to maximum hours in sections 7 and 8.  These improvements met with general approval in the Seanad.  I consider that these proposed charges set the levels appropriate at this time.  I should point out that these levels of maximum hours can be reduced at appropriate times in the future by means of the powers contained in the section.</P>
    <P>I might add also, for the information of Deputies, that I was asked in the Seanad if, in the interests of better presentation and clarity, sections 7 and 9 could be transposed.  This is simply a change in the layout which was agreed by the Seanad and which will appear in the final Bill.  I do not know if this point was raised in the Dáil but certainly it was in the Seanad. These amendments relate to improvements in the hours position on questions already raised in both the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This was one of the very controversial sections of the Bill when it was being considered in this House and there was a lot of discussion on it.  Sections 7 and 9 are very closely related with regard to the questions of the normal working hours and maximum hours.  The amendments do constitute improvements for young persons.  The reduction in the daily, weekly, monthly and yearly maximum hours is a vast improvement and is something we encouraged when the Bill was being discussed here.  However, having done that, one would have expected that the normal hours in section 9 would have been reduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem there is that if one tampers with normal hours&mdash;and this is the problem throughout legislation of this kind&mdash; one begins to set off a chain reaction in terms of hours of adult workers. One is then in the difficult area of finding the negotiations themselves being affected.  That is a problem inherent <Col N="819" /> in legislation of this kind which makes it very difficult to do what one might wish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister is not saying that he is against a reduction in the hours of work for adult workers.  However, the amendments to section 7 are definitely an improvement. I entirely support the idea of sections 7 and 9 being transposed for ease of interpretation.  In the debate in this House I remember that some confusion arose between the maximum and normal hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat concerned about the time factor on the basis that, for example, in summer time, the working hours may not be near maximum hours&mdash;they might amount to only half the maximum hours being worked by a young person who in certain circumstances is anxious to do so.  Now, under the licensing hours, we have an 11 o'clock and 11.30 p.m. closing.  In summertime 11.30 p.m. seems so much earlier taking into consideration the weather, daylight hours, it being holiday time for young people and so on.  I question if that is not somewhat rigid.  I do not expect that a person should be allowed work nine hours up to 11 o'clock at night.  But, in relation to somebody who might only start work at 7 p.m. or 7.30 p.m. such a person would have to finish at 10 o'clock although he had got in only two and a half hours.  Is there any way around that?</P>

      <P>Those have not been altered by amendment.  What we have been trying to do is to keep within ILO specifications and international conventions for latest times of work permitted to those age groups. The times we have chosen for latest periods of work are in line with those international conventions and standards. This is something that will have to be looked at closely in practice through our inspectorate.  As will have been seen, we have the power later to amend it.  It was not remarked on greatly in the debate in the Seanad. Certainly I shall keep in close touch with the inspectors and it will be vital in all of these operations to see what reports they come back with.</P>

      <P>We are talking now about the maximum hours of work for persons under 16.  I am not too happy here that we have not gone that little bit further to the weekly maximum in this case.  We have reduced the nine hours maximum per day to eight but we have left the 40 hours per week.  Particularly in the case of a person under 16, while taking the Minister's point earlier on the normal hours perhaps as they would apply to a person over 16, no adult <Col N="822" /> could, or should, expect to follow the lead of working hours given to a young person under 16.  In these circumstances the nine hour provision should be reduced to eight but the case is very strong for an under-16-year-old to have a shorter working week.  We refer to a maximum daily period in the amendment but that cannot be divorced from a maximum weekly period. The original section provided that an employer shall not permit an under-16-year-old to work for more than nine hours in any day.  That has been reduced to eight but the employer may still permit him to work 40 hours per week.  I am not so happy with that situation.</P>

There are still the very important matters of pay and the exploitation of young people which, of course, would be very difficult to legislate for.  I agree that there are few employers who would indulge in exploitation but there is nothing in the Bill to provide against it other that the mere activities of an inspectorate to ensure that when hours are being checked there will be less likelihood of unfair practice.

The Bill extends the protection of this legislation to groups not covered before.

      <P>I am not happy, and I do not believe the Minister is happy, that this is the way to do it. My opinion is that if we were to do it this there would have to be an amendment of the earlier Acts or a definition of &ldquo;industrial worker&rdquo;.  A factory inspector would be at a disadvantage in many cases.  How does one differentiate between industrial work? Is the service industry considered to be industrial work?  It could be interpreted as being industrial work of a kind.  As I see it a young lad pulling pints or employed during the summer in one of our hotels is not allowed work after 10 p.m. while his counterpart, who may be younger than he, if he is in industrial work can work almost at any time of the night.  It also appears to me that he can be put on shift work, provided he complies with the other sections of the Bill.  There appears to be a contradiction or conflict that needs more investigation.  I would hate to see a blatant opportunity of abuse given that might be availed of by certain people.</P>

I am amazed that the ICTU have allowed this to pass because it appears to me that there is a difference between the two sectors which should not exist in fairness to both young people and to employers.

      <P>I am not being critical of this.  I am trying to help the Minister.  I accept entirely what the Minister said but we are creating a difference here and we should not have amended that section.  Whether a Bill was passed in 1936, 1944 or 1977 is not relevant if the conditions imposed are uniform.  It is imperative, particularly in the area of youth employment, that there should be no difference between the two sides or between two different industries.  It now appears to me that an employer or an employee may do things in a heavy type of work, because of the amendment to this section, which are not allowable to employers or employees in a lighter type of work.  The same conditions should apply to both.</P>

I would ask the Minister to give particular attention to cases where the boy or girl is merely working for pin money but in cases where a child is compelled to go out to work through economic necessity there should be no offence.  I am trying to bring a more socially humane aspect into this Bill. Could there be a provision whereby parents or guardians who act out of sheer economic hardship will not be subjected to the rigours of the law? <Col N="832" /> I think it was either St. Thomas Aquinas or St. Augustine who said that it was lawful for a man who was starving to steal a loaf of bread.  It is known as occult compensation.  There are shortcomings in our social code. The parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare has stressed this on numerous occasions and, until such time as these shortcomings are redressed, the fact that children are compelled to work through sheer economic necessity should not result in their parents or guardians being subjected to the rigours of the law.</P>

      <P>In page 8, subsection (3) deleted and the following substituted:</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>Section 6: In page 8, after line 28, the following inserted:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(7) Where it is shown that a dismissal of a person referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of section 2 (1) or section 3 or 4 of this Act results wholly or mainly from one or more of the matters referred to in subsection (2) (a) of this section, <Col N="838" /> then subsections (1) and (6) of this section and the said sections 2 (1), 3 and 4 shall not apply in relation to the dismissal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The effect of this amendment is to give access to the Bill to employees who feel they have been dismissed due to trade union membership or activities but who are otherwise excluded from the Bill because they have less than one year's service or are beyond retiring age.  That means that some people are excluded under other sections. The Deputies will recall the probation people who are excluded and also people who have less than one year's service.  It is felt&mdash;the representations I had from the unions were very strong on this point&mdash;that if even within these excluded categories somebody was dismissed based on his membership of a trade union that the protection of the Bill should be at his disposal.  Where such protection is open to the employee in those cases there is no presumption of unfairness on the part of the employer.  In other words, the employer and employee are on an equal basis in such cases.  If elsewhere in the Bill, where there is a presumption that the employer after he has dismissed someone is a person who has got to discharge the onus of proof he does not have to do so in this case.  If in this case the employee says: &ldquo;I was a member of a trade union and I am dismissed&rdquo; it is not presumed that the employer must discharge an onus of proof.  He has just got to put his arguments to the employee. This gained the enthusiastic endorsement of the leader of the Deputy's party in the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not take it for granted that what the Leader of that party in the Seanad may say or do would necessarily influence what the party spokesman in this House may say or do.  I have no objection basically to the amendment.  One aspect of it which I welcome is the encouragement of a more informal attitude between worker and employer.  Right through the Bill the procedures are too rigid.  Of the whole package of social legislation this is the one which concerns me most having regard to its possible <Col N="839" /> deterring effect on employment, the fear of the employer, the small employer especially, to re-employ.  On the amendment, I believe the Minister is entering an area of discrimination. Nobody is covered without 12 months' service.</P>

In other parts of the Bill where the employer dismisses somebody he has to discharge the onus of proof in the case of a dismissal.  He does not have to do so in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; or because of one or other of the reasons mentioned in the Bill.  They should be entitled to the same concession.  The Bill should apply to everybody on the same basis.  Exceptions are being made here.  Take also the case of a nurse or almost any employee of a health board who could have two, three or even four years' service during the training period.  Such employees have no recourse to it after, perhaps, only two months.  While I am not objecting to the amendment, I believe it is opening a vast area.  The Minister is making a special case, and I know why he is doing it.  I am afraid it is political.  He has been under strong trade union pressure and probably they have told him he has not honoured his commitment to them.  The Minister realises <Col N="840" /> that we are probably sitting on the last day of this Dáil, that we will not be back, and he has to placate these people and honour his commitment to them.  As I say, if the Minister makes a concession in this case, he should do so in every other case specified here; otherwise it is singling out people who are only one of a number of categories.</P>

      <P>Dismissal for involvement in a trade union is one of the commonest reasons for unfair dismissal. This is one of the main reasons why we felt an exception should be made in this case.  We will accept that there was strong representation to this end, but anybody who looks over the history of unfair dismissals will realise that membership of a trade union has been one of the commonest reasons for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to tell the Minister about a case in this city in which a man who led an unofficial strike was dismissed.  After a while the dispute was settled, and the trade union notified the employer that they would not work with that man again. The employer sent for the man and said: &ldquo;I am sorry, the trade union will not work with you.  You will have to go&rdquo; and he was dismissed.  Would such a person be covered by this Bill? It could be said that he was dismissed for trade union activities or for antitrade union activities, if you like.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will accept that in the majority of cases employees must be members of a trade union, and it is generally official policy under any Government to encourage people to join a trade union.  If the case arises in which a person is sacked because of his membership of a trade union, I think we should afford him protection under <Col N="841" /> legislation of this kind, because it is almost a condition of employment in many occupations to be a member of a trade union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not object to that, but the Minister is extending the cover of the Bill.  I am sure the Minister will agree that if a person was dismissed after three months for his religious or political opinions, it would be unfair, but that is not covered by this Bill.  There are other forms of redress to a trade union, for instance, under common law, but, strictly speaking, a person who is only six or nine months in employment has no redress or cover under the Bill if he or she is dismissed on religious or political grounds, nor, indeed, if civil or criminal proceedings are taken or if the race or colour is wrong.</P>

      <P>Not forgiveable, because he should not exclude other categories.  He must realise there are other categories affected by unfair dismissals.  Singling out one category is a major change from the terms of the Bill.  Section 2 specifies the period for which a person must be in employment.  I have been very annoyed about certain exclusions.  For example, in section 3 we improved the situation for probationary teachers after pressure from here and after pressure from the organisation itself we improved it still further but because there was no groundswell of pressure for all these groups of people working in the health services they are outside the scope of this Bill and may be for four years with no redress.</P>

      <P>Yes, but it is more than training, it is employment. It does not take in nurses.  If a nurse <Col N="842" /> does maternity or psychiatry at the end of general nursing it could amount to a four-year course in the one hospital. She could be dismissed from that hospital in her fourth year with no redress under this Bill.  Yet somebody who is two weeks in a job has redress if he is dismissed because of his trade union affiliation, membership or activity.  I agree that he should not be dismissed and that this would constitute unfair dismissal, but the Minister is putting that qualification in a special category. What should effectively be done is to do away with the 12-month qualification altogether, but that would not be desirable.  The Minister is saying that after one or two weeks' employment a person is not liable to dismissal because of his trade union activities.  He is not liable to dismissal at any time because of trade union activities, but when we stipulate in legislation that a person must be in continuous employment for a year we should not now start segregating.  The Minister should reconsider his decision.  He may have been hasty in this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfair.  How far does one go?  For one type of dismissal a person is included from the first day he enters employment.  We have outlined in section 6 when a dismissal can be an unfair one.  We have already said under section 2 that the employee must be in employment for 12 months.  We have excluded in section 3 certain categories of people who cannot come in at all during their period of training or probation.  We have made special arrangements for apprentices in section 4.  Now we are taking one of the offences out of section 6 and amending it on the basis that that should get special treatment. I do not object to the amendment, and I take the Minister's point that trade union activity is often the reason for an unfair dismissal or for difficulty between employer and employee, although fortunately not as commonly <Col N="843" /> as it used to be.  There is general acceptance of the fact that trade union membership for workers, is desirable from the point of view of both sides, but the Minister is doing something that he has not given much thought to.  He should look at the situation and if he does want to concede the pressure he has obviously got then let him be fair about it and let it cover all aspects of unfair dismissals but let there not be just one provision for one type of offence.  I am not opposing the amendment but it should be accompanied by further amendments.</P>

      <P>Section 15: In page 12, after line 40, the following subsection inserted:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) A person who accepts redress awarded under section 9 or <Col N="845" /> 10 of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, in respect of any dismissal shall not be entitled to accept redress awarded under section 7 of this Act in respect of that dismissal and a person who accepts redress awarded under the said section 7 in respect of any dismissal shall not be entitled to accept redress awarded under the said section 9 or 10 in respect of that dismissal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is in regard to redress awarded governing dismissal under certain circumstances under the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and it is conceivable that an employee might decide to make claims under both that Act and this Bill.  I do not want to interfere with the employee's choice, but this amendment is intended to avoid duplication in respect of the same dismissal and that a reinstated employee will not also have received compensation.  He must take one path or the other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That amendment speaks for itself.  I have often accused the Minister of regarding all employers as being big bad people. Thank God we do not have to say that about employees.  The vast majority of them are very honourable reputable people who would not dream of availing of such an opportunity.  There may be a loophole that could be exploited by a small minority, and I agree that it must be closed to prevent a duplication of claim under both Acts.  I did not realise that this possibility was there.  In view of the points made in section 6, I presumed the only one there could refer to (f), to the pregnancy of the employee.  Surely that is the only area where there could be a duplication?  This Bill would seem to me to cover all the other areas of unfair dismissals.  I have no notion of opposing this amendment.  If it closes loopholes, we welcome and support it. It is the last amendment to this Bill, which will obviously now go to Areas an Uachtaráin for signature and will become law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope this Bill will get the type of flexible introduction and encouragement from the Department that we spoke about earlier in the protection <Col N="846" /> of employment.  There are aspects of this Bill that may still be controversial, but we should regard it as a guideline rather than a rigid piece of legislation to be enforced.  In relation to improving industrial relations the only way we can make progress is by encouragement and co-operation rather than by wielding the big stick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion I said I would look carefully at this promotion section, section 3 (6), between now and Report Stage.  I made the point that I was anxious to see that we <Col N="847" /> advance in the promotion area because it is at the heart of this Bill.  I agree that anything proposed by us must be practical and with this criteria in mind I will look very closely at it between now and Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I had expected the Minister to have had more to say on this subsection.  I agree with the Minister that we must improve the promotion opportunities of women and ensure that equality exists.  It would appear that this is a subsection which cannot be complied with.  That being the case, I do not regard it as a subsection that should be left in the Bill. We are referring to section 3 which refers to discrimination by employers being prohabited.  I and my part want to co-operate with the Minister in ensuring that discrimination is prohibited, but it would be disastrous for this House to pass a section or a subsection that would contain something that would encourage contention or controversy among an existing staff.  On the last occasion when things became a little heated on all sides, I mentioned a number of people to the Minister.  If ten people are equally qualified for promotion opportunities and there are only four vacancies it would appear that under this section the six people who are not promoted have a grievance for redress although in effect there were no positions to which they could be promoted.  This may seem silly but it is my reading of the subsection.  We should not allow legislation to go through in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the question of equal opportunity let us assume that the ten people are made up of five men and five women and that two men and two women are promoted. This subsection provides that any one of those six has the right to accuse an employer of discrimination since he or she, with the other four, is equally qualified.  The subsection reads that a person shall be taken to discriminate against an employee if he refuses or omits deliberately to promote a person to a post for which he is qualified in circumstances in which other person equally qualified <Col N="848" /> are promoted.  This does not take account of the promotional outlets not being available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious from reading the subsection that Deputy Fitzgerald is right.  We must endeavour to impress on the Minister the hopeless position that would obtain in the event of this subsection being passed without amendment.  Deputy Fitzgerald illustrated the situation that would apply by reffering to a hypothetical case of ten persons in a situation in which all were equally qualified but where there were only four vacancies. At any time the matter of promotion is a delicate one but by including this subsection we would contribute to further industrial disorder and disruption. In any sphere of economic activity it has generally been the case in the past that, all things being equal, the person with the longest service was promoted but nowadays the situation is more complex. Naturally, though, an employer will pick for promotion the people he consider best suited for the job conall the people in contention were worthy of promotion and were capable of carrying out the duties involved in work at a high level but if there are not enough vacancies what is an employer to do?  An employee in such circumstances would take the line that the Dáil seemed to think that all the people concerned should be promoted.</P>
      <P>The Minister has had a full week to look at this matter, discussion of which ended in a rather unmannerly fashion on the last occasion.  I need hardly stress that the bad manners did not emanate from this side of the House.  If the Minister refuses to comply with our request to amend the subsection let it be on his head that we are sowing the seeds of disruption in industrial and commercial concerns.  However, I am still hoping that the Minister will meet us on this point in order that this Bill, like the two previous ones, may make a contribution towards better industrial relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have explained to Deputies, part of the difficulty <Col N="849" /> here may lie in the drafting of the subsection.  That is something we must look at between now and Report Stage.  Deputies will appreciate that it is necessary to provide for a situation in which bias exists in relation to opportunities of promotion.  We must provide, too, in regard to the question of selection for promotion as well as the actual promotion itself.  All we seek in this subsection is to give to a prospective candidate for promotion the right to challenge a decision if she considers that she was more suitably qualified but that by reason of being a woman, she was not selected.  In section 2 we define carefully what is meant by discrimination.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that no legislation be passed at any stage which would be impracticable.  We must ensure that the provisions of any legislation must be capable of being implemented.  To that extent I undertake to look carefully at this subsection between now and Report Stage in order to see whether there is any way in which I can meet some of the objections raised by the Deputies and which are based mainly on their fears that the legislation will be impracticable.</P>
      <P>The point has been made that perhaps the section as drafted issues an open invitation to anyone who might have trivial reasons for invoking the power of the Bill.  It is not my intention to permit such a state of affairs to develop.  Consequently, as I undertook on the last occasion on which we discussed this matter to reconsider it, I undertake again to have another look at it before Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I might add that there are provisions on those lines in similar legislation in other EEC countries where this type of legislation has been operating for much longer than has been the case here.  I recall that the UK legislation, for example, has a section on the lines of the one we are dealing with although it is not couched in identical terms.  But its aim is to ensure equality of promotion and to ensure, also, that prejudices based on sex will no longer prevent promotion in industry.  Deputies are aware that we have a dismal record in relation to women holding senior positions in industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will indicate the necessary qualifications that would enable a herdowner to avail himself of the hardship fund in the case of the the disease eradication programme; the number of applications received to date; the number of animals concerned; and when the fund will be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions of qualification for payments under the hardship fund were advertised in detail by my Department in the national daily newspapers on 16th March, 1977.  The fund is being administered through the Department's district veterinary offices and special applications by herdowners for assistance from the fund are not necessary.  The number of animals involved can only be determined progressively as the examination of herd records proceeds.  The first payments from the fund will be made very shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell the House the exact percentage because there is a misunderstanding, I believe, between the Department and the Health Advisory Council about this fund?  Would the Minister say that in the case of 50 per cent going down, and a man had 40 cows, the first two have to be disregarded; but if he has 23 down does he get paid <Col N="854" /> on 21 cows, disregarding two, since this is over 50 per cent of his herd? I should like the Minister to clarify that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot add anything to what appears in the advertisement indicating the conditions under which the hardship fund should be administered. It clearly states that, acting on the recommendation of the Advisory Council on Animal Health and Disease Eradication, the Minister for Agriculture has decided that payments from the fund will be made where the number of qualifying reactors removed from the herd exceeds (a) 5 per cent of the herd in the case of TB reactors; (b) 20 per cent of the herd in the case of brucellosis reactors and (c) 20 per cent of the herd where there are both TB and brucellosis reactors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is how I understand it, but there is a misinterpretation by departmental officials.  Some of them who attended a meeting said that it would be only the cattle that were over the 50 per cent that would be paid for.  I am just taking the 50 per cent and leaving out the five and 20.  I want the Minister to assure the House that is not so.</P>

      <P>The Minister first introduced this scheme and made the money available for this hardship fund in December, 1976.  It is a long time, especially for applicants who had their herds completely cleared due to incidence of disease, to have to wait to replace their cattle.  Is the delay of four months not overlong when he told us that the scheme would shortly be operating?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>They have got the normal payments up to the present. The only thing they are waiting for is additional money from the hardship fund, if they are hardship cases.  We <Col N="855" /> have to go back to the records since we introduced the new system of payments. We have been paying since some date in August.  I cannot give the Deputy the exact date.  We have to go back through the herdowners' records to see whether during that period any of them qualified for the hardship fund.  It takes time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to cases where payment is requested by representatives of deceased participants in the scheme.  I have been advised that in such cases payment of grants due in excess of £100 can be made only on receipt of formal proof of entitlement such as letters of administration.  In cases where the amount involved does not exceed £100 the normal practice is to make payment subject to the completion of a form of indemnity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one particular case where two women were running a holding jointly.  When one of the women, the applicant in former years, died the second woman did not qualify when she applied for a grant. Also, the wife of a deceased man does not qualify for the grant unless she <Col N="856" /> takes out administration and, in some cases, it costs £500 or £600 to take out administration.  It is very unfair of the Department to deny those people the grants because they have not the money to take out administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told we are doing all we are permitted to do in law.  We can go as far as £100 on the signing of a form of indemnity but we cannot go beyond that without additional proof such as letters of administration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>If three people were involved in an estate and one applied for payment and the other two signed that they were not interested in the payment, would the Minister not agree that the first person should be paid?  I agree with the Deputy who asked the question that it is very unfair, because £100 is a very small grant.  It is costly to take out administration.  If two of the people signed that they had no interest in the grant it should be paid to Mr. X.  Would the Minister agree that should be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a further note which says it has been found from time to time that disputes arise where different members of a family claim entitlement to grants due to the estate of a deceased applicant under the scheme.  Accordingly it is necessary to adhere rigidly to the advice of the law officers in the matter.  If the Deputy has a particular case in mind which he wants investigated I will investigate it for him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister ensure that outstanding claims are paid?  The Minister may recall that in late January in answering a question in this House he said all grants would be paid by the beginning of March. This has not happened.  They are being paid on a most unusual basis.  Some were paid three months ago.  Others were paid last week.  They do not follow any pattern.  There seems to be a bit of a spread.  This is giving rise to concern.  If a man gets a grant and his neighbour does not this gives rise to concern.  It almost seems as if they are drawing them out of a hat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I inquired about the same thing myself in the Department. The applications come in in big numbers. Perhaps 18 or 20 girls are dealing with them.  The applications are thrown there and pulled at random, so exactly what the Deputy says could be the case.  One man could be paid and his next door neighbour not be paid.  To take them in order of inspection would be a very difficult job where a number of people are dealing with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <P>The count only starts in September for some reason.  By the time the count is over and the returns <Col N="858" /> are in and payments are made, it is very difficult to see how this could be done any faster.  It is a question of the use of staff as much as anything else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot give that information.  I can tell the Deputy something more accurate.  To date, 9,842 herdowners in Donegal have been paid grants amounting to £1,620,000.  A further 470 owners will be paid within the next week.  About 500 cases still remain on which queries have arisen.  These are being investigated and will be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the plans he has to aid sheep farmers; and the progress made by him to achieve a CAP for <Col N="859" /> sheep in the light of the fact that the industry does not appear to be making sufficient progress to help the national economy by way of increased exports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Sheep farmers are already aided under our headage payments schemes for hogget ewes and mountain lambs.  Payments in 1976 to sheep producers under these schemes amounted to about £3 million.</P>
      <P>As regards a common policy for sheepmeat, I have been pressing this issue for the past four years but, while proposals for an interim arrangement have been put forward by the EEC Commission, it has not been possible to reach agreement on them in the Council of Ministers.</P>
      <P>Market prices here for sheep and lambs have been at very satisfactory levels for the past year or so and the market outlook continues to be encouraging. Producers have, therefore, an incentive to expand production.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister will agree there has been a very big decline in sheep numbers.  Furthermore, sheep farmers are second-class citizens so far as agriculture in Europe is concerned.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should understand the way the Community works.  It requires only one member state to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; and then you do not have a common organisation of the market for a product.  Both the British and the French have stuck out stubbornly against a common organisation of the market for lamb and in those circumstances there is no way I can get one.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the statement that payments for reactors are only about one-third of the price of similar cattle which are not reactors. On disposal of a reactor the herdowner gets a grant from my Department and also retains the salvage value he receives from the meat factory.  When these two sums are added the herdowner may in some instances receive more than if the animal had not been diseased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that a herdowner may receive more for a diseased animal but that occurs rarely.  With regard to brucellosis, a herdowner may get a worthwhile price for a good beast but he will lose the price of the calf.  However, the same situation does not apply with regard to the TB scheme.  If a herdowner has a cow with a heavy milk yield or a light beast, the price he will receive will not be one-third of the replacement cost.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware, the Land Commission have been invested with extensive acquisition powers, but in granting such powers the Legislature has been careful to safeguard the rights of owners whose lands may be subject to acquisition proceedings.  An owner has the right of objection and appeal, as a result of which the legal process of <Col N="866" /> acquisition is a lengthy one which frequently tends to follow the line of most rather than least resistance.  In this connection, I may say that the Land Commission always endeavour to meet owners' reasonable requests with a view to bringing proceedings to finality as amicably and as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Where lands are offered for sale to the Land Commission the transaction normally proceeds quickly and is completed with the minimum of delay.  In some cases, however, title difficulties may arise and delay proceedings but I need scarcely say the question of establishing title is one for the owner rather than for the Land Commission and normally the Commission cannot assist to any great extent.</P>

      <P>The redemption terms would depend on the Act under which the advance for the purchase of the lands concerned was made and the rules relating thereto.  In the case of allotments being made by the Land Commission under permanent agreements the entire purchase money may be advanced by the Land Commission and repaid by an annuity.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The pay agreement between the Construction Industry Federation and the group of unions concerned was drawn up in June, 1976.  The agreement was referred to the Labour Court by the parties on 28th July, 1976.  On 5th October, 1976, the court issued an interim report on the relativity agreement which indicated that because of the circumstances peculiar to the construction industry the first phase increases proposed from 1st September, 1976, could be implemented.  In their final report on the agreement which was issued on 18th February, 1977, the court found that, on the basis of a comparison of other industries, a case could not be made for an increase in pay in the construction industry, on the grounds of serious inequity, further to the increase already granted in September, 1976.  The court pointed out however, that the interpretations of the national agreements given in their report were the court's own interpretations and were not authoritative.  The court added that if more authoritative interpretations were required they could be sought from the Employer/Labour Conference under the relevant clauses of the national agreement.</P>
      <P>Following a meeting of the Joint Industrial Council for the Construction Industry, held on 8th March, 1977, the council issued a statement to the effect that they were in agreement that the second phase of the relativity agreement could be implemented from 1st March, 1977, and that this decision was based on an interpretation, by the council, of clause 9 of the Interim National Agreement, 1976, and clause 10 of the 1977 national wage agreement which relate to special problems in relation to pay and conditions of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of this development the Government issued a statement on 10th March, 1977.  The concern of the Government as expressed in the statement was that no increases additional to those allowable under the national agreement should be made without the sanction, by way of an authoritative ruling of the Employer/Labour Conference. However, in the case of the building Joint Industrial Council's <Col N="870" /> decision to pay the increases, the ruling of the Employer/Labour Conference has not been sought.  The action contemplated by the Government, that is, their intention to use the price variation clause in relation to Government works contracts and the house building cost index, would be taken to prevent the increases agreed by the building contractors being passed on in higher charges, where no reference for an authoritative ruling by the Employer/ Labour Conference is made.</P>
    <P>The Construction Industry Federation referred the agreement to the Employer/ Labour Conference for a ruling&mdash;which is what the Labour Court had suggested in their report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing that this is the second time during his ministry that a pay freeze has been imposed on a certain group of workers would the Minister not agree that, rather than the Government using the big stick they threatened regarding the price variation clause and the house price position, it would have been advisable before making any such threats to have referred this to the Employer/Labour Conference for their comments and observations?  Would it not have been more beneficial in creating good industrial relations at a time when they are in chaos?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Government were waving a big stick. In fact the Government statement was saying to the parties concerned that their settlement should be the subject of an authoritative ruling by the only body able to give such a ruling, namely, the Employer/Labour Conference.  That was the intent of the Government notice.  The Government said if the attempt to gain that ruling was not made by the parties to the joint industrial council who had suggested these settlements, then the Government themselves would be forced to consider the steps outlined in their statement. But the force of the Government's statement is to suggest to the parties concerned here that they subject their pay settlements to the Employment/ Labour Conference, which is the authoritative body for seeing that any settlements are in accord with the national wage agreement.  I am sure the Deputy <Col N="871" /> would agree that that is not waving the big stick.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that if he regarded such a review as being necessary it should have been instituted and carried out before any changes were made in the staff or personnel at the head of the Labour Court?  Secondly, excellent though the person is, does he regard it as a sensible move to set up a review body under the chairmanship of the existing chairman of the body being investigated rather than under a neutral chairman who would be able to give a less involved appraisal or report on the situation?</P>

      <P>Nearly 30 years after the Act which set up the court was passed by the Oireachtas.  An opportune time to begin that review it seemed to me was at the changeover period between one chairman and another in the service of the court. Maurice P.

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the number of registered employment agencies in the country at present and in 1976; the amount of revenue collected in licence fees in 1976 and the expected revenue for 1977; and the percentage increase in the licence fee in January and if it was sanctioned by the National Prices Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of employment agencies holding licences under the Employment Agency Act, 1971, on 31st March, 1977, is 143 and the number on the corresponding date in 1976 was 109.</P>
      <P>The amount of revenue collected in licence fees in 1976 was £600 and it is expected that the revenue in 1977 will be between £10,000 and £11,000. The licence was increased from £5 to £100 on 1st February, 1977.  The proposal to increase the fee was made with the agreement of the National Prices Commission.</P>
      <P>I decided to increase the fee because the nature of the business makes it desirable that there should be some evidence of the financial standing of the applicant agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that such a drop in the number of employment agencies, such an enormous increase in licence fees to agencies whose personnel devote their time to recruitment and seeking employment for people, is no contribution to helping employment at a time like this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, in general I want to see a strengthening of the State employment service, that is, the National Manpower Service.  All I was anxious to do in the matter of increasing fees in relation to private agencies was to ensure that there would be, by this means.  I thought it was a ridiculous state of affairs that a fee for a person seeking a licence in this area of business should be £5.  I thought it more realistic that the figure should be £100, in order to assure the job applicant of at least some minimal financial standing in the case of existing agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask is it the Minister's intention to endeavour to put employment agencies, as such, out of business, having it a function completely taken over by a State agency?  That would certainly seem to be the tenor of his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy <Col N="874" /> will see that there is no contradiction between the private and general State objective under all Governments of seeing that the National Manpower Service is given requisite strength for its functions under various legislation. It is, after all, a free service for the benefit of all citizens.  As I understand it, we are, on all sides of the House, anxious to see that job vacancies in the employment market be opened up to all, irrespective of personal or private connections.  That objective remains.  That is not in conflict with the desire on our part to see that existing private agencies should prosper to the greatest possible extent.  But we should see to it&mdash;and it is in the interest of the better agencies to see to this&mdash;that fly-by-night concerns which up to now for the mere investment of a £5 licence fee could have set up business, are ruled out.  Most people who work in the private employment agency field would accept that a £100 licence fee is not excessive in these times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that clerical staff, and female clerical staff especially, depend for the most part on the effectiveness of a private employment agency as against the National Manpower Service, would the Minister not review the massive increase of approximately 2,000 per cent in the licence fee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it seems a lot to go from £5 to £100. All I can say is that I consider this change long overdue.  It was a ridiculous situation that anyone could get, for something like the price of a dog licence, permission from the State authorities to open up a job agency business.  I thought that was risky to the job applicant and that it did not assure him of the standing of the agencies concerned.  I think the increase is in the interests of the people who run reputable employment agencies and in the interests of the person who, as the Deputy says, still goes to the private employment agency, the clerical worker and so on, though it must be added that the National Manpower Service caters for that job applicant as well.</P>

      <P>Ó thaobh na ndeontas, ní bhíonn aon aisíoc i gceist.  Maidir leis na scaireanna, bíonn rud éigin ag teacht isteach. Níl cuid de na comhlachtaí seo bunaithe ach cúpla bliain agus bhí deacrachtaí eacnamaíochta ann ag brú orthu.  I gcuid mhaith acu is déantús fite a bhí i gceist agus níl sé réasúnta bheith ag súil le díbhinní ó na comhlachtaí sin.</P>

      <P>Le cead an Cheann Comhairle tógfaidh mé Ceist a 23 agus Ceist a 24 le chéile.</P>
      <P>Ó mhí na Mheithimh, 1975, i leith is faoi scáth Chomharchumann Chois Fharraige atá <i>Amárach</i> á fhoilsiú agus á chlóbhualadh.  Deontas £120 in aghaidh an eagráin a bhí á íoc ag mo Roinnse díreach roimhe sin agus leanadh ar aghaidh leis an deontas céanna ar bhonn sealadach.  I rith na bliana 1976&mdash;agus le feidhm ó thús na bliana sin&mdash;méadaíodh an deontas in aghaidh an eagráin go dtí £200.  Foilsíodh 43 eagrán sa bhliain 1976 agus íocadh deontais dar luach £8,600 ina leith.</P>
      <P>I lár na bliana 1976&mdash;faoi mar a luaígh mé anseo sa Dáil ar an 1 Iúil&mdash; chuir mé in iúl do Chomharchumann Chois Fharraige go mbéinn sásta iarratas ar mhéadú eile ar 'dheontas <i>Amárach</i> don bhliain 1977 a bhreithniú go báúil dá léireofaí dom roimh dheireadh na bliana 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> (a) go mbeadh tacaíocht ag an lucht foilsithe ó na príomheagrais atá ag obair ar mhaithe leis an bpobal ar fud na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>(b) go mbeadh ionadaithe ar an mbord eagarthóireachta ó na priomhcheantair Ghaeltachta uile, agus</P>
    <P>(c) go mbeadh socruithe éifeachtacha i bhfeidhm chun teacht isteach fiúntacht a thuilleamh ó dhíolacháin agus ó fhógraíocht.</P>
    <P>Fuair mé litir ó <i>Amárach</i> ar an 14 Nollaig, 1976, agus ba mhaith liom sliocht amháin a léamh as an litir sin:</P>
    <P>Rinneamar teagmháil le gach Comharchumann Gaeltachta agus le gach coíste pobail sa Ghaeltacht ag iarraidh tacaíocht, comhoibriú agus comhairle uathu faoi fhorbairt an nuachtáin mar nuachtán náisiúnta do phobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.  Níor tháinig aon toradh ar an iarracht sin.  As breis agus 70 litir a cuireadh amach ag na heagrais sin níor freagraíodh ach 3 cinn.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir nár mhiste a lua freisin, go háirithe de bharr na rudaí adúirt an Teachta Molloy an tseachtain seo caite, go raibh figiúirí mar seo a leanas i gcuntais Chomharchumann Chois Fharraige don bhliain dar chríoch 30 Meán Fómhair 1976:</P>
    <P>&mdash;brabach £9,445 ag an gclólann tar éis £12,948, nó 22½ faoin gcéad de theacht isteach na clólainne, a fháil ó <i>Amárach,</i></P>
    <P>&mdash;costais riaracháin £5,525, nó 25 faoin gcéad den iomlán, curtha ar <i>Amárach,</i> agus</P>
    <P>&mdash;caillteanas £15,396 ar <i>Amárach</i>.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh cuntas neamhiniúchta ar fáil don ráithe dheiridh sa bhliain 1976 agus thug sé le tuiscint nár thuill <i>Amárach</i> in aghaidh an eagráin sa ráithe sin ach teacht isteach glan £29 ó dhíolacháin.</P>
    <P>Is é sin go hachomair an cúlra don chruinniú a bhí agam le hionadaithe <i>Amárach</i> ar an 8 Feabhra agus tar éis dom an scéal a phlé leo&mdash;faoi mar a mhínigh mé anseo an tseachtain seo caite&mdash;d'iarr mé ar Bhord na Gaeilge scrúdú a chur á dhéanamh ar chúrsaí <i>Amárach</i> ó tharla gurb eol dom go <Col N="881" /> bhfuil suim ar leith ag an mbord sna foilseacháin Ghaeilge.  Tuigim nach foláir don bhord cabhair a fháil ó chomhairleoirí taobh amuigh dá n-eagraíocht féin chun cuid den scrúdú a dhéanamh.  Ní féidir dáta cinnte a leagan síos chun obair mar sin a chur i gcrích ach tá a fhios ag an mbord gur maith liom an toradh a fháil a luaithe is féidir.</P>

Cén fá nach bhfuair siad freagra ach ó trí eagrais ar fud na Gaeltachta don litir a d'eisigh said?

      <P>The Minister has learnt with concern of the detention in Rhodesia of the priest to whom reference is made in the Deputy's question.  As Deputies will be aware from previous replies to questions regarding Bishop Lamont it is not possible for the Government to raise the matter directly with the Rhodesian regime.  In accordance with United Nations Security Council resolutions with which we are obliged to comply we are not permitted to recognise or have diplomatic or consular relations with the regime.</P>

We have no assurance that this case will be dealt with and treated properly from a medical point of view.  It is more serious because of the fact that a large number of Irish priests are in Rhodesia and it is likely, unfortunately, that we will have similar cases in the near future.  It is about time some mechanism was set up to deal with a situation which is almost certain to recur in the near future.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Arising out of the statement by the Deputy, I should like to put it on record again that the Government are prohibited from making direct representations to the Rhodesian authorities by the terms of resolutions 253 of 1968, and 277 of 1977, of the United Nations Security Council.  These resolutions contain mandatory decisions which are binding on member states under article 41 of the Charter. We are, therefore, unable to extend consular protection in the normal way to citizens in Rhodesia either ourselves or through friendly countries who are not represented.  I am sure the Deputy will be glad to hear that from inquiries made from the priest's Order I am satisfied that up to last Monday evening the priest in question was receiving adequate medical attention for his condition and was allowed two visits per day.  I should like the House to know that I am as concerned, as is the Minister and the Government, about the fact that we are unable to make representations to the Rhodesian regime but we must face up to the facts and realities of the case.  The reality of the case is that as members of the United Nations we are bound by a resolution passed by them not to have any diplomatic or consular representations or relations with the Rhodesian regime.  We are precluded from having such relations.  There is no way in which we, as a Government, can approach or communicate with the regime in question.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> With respect, there is no necessity for anybody to lose his temper.  It is unfortunate that this priest is detained in Rhodesia.  It is also unfortunate that, due to the type of the Rhodesian regime, we are precluded by a resolution of the United Nations, which is binding on us and the United Nations, from making representations or approaches to the regime.  From inquiries made to the priest's Order in Ireland I am satisfied that up to the time of the latest contact the Order had with Rhodesia the priest was having proper medical attention and two visits daily.  My inquiries suggest that to date he has not been given bail.</P>

We are bound by resolutions of the United Nations and I am sure Deputy Haughey fully appreciates this and that the United Nations are also bound by such resolutions.  On a previous occasion it was suggested by Deputy O'Kennedy that inquiries, representations or protests could be conducted through the United Nations but the fact is that the United Nations have precluded themselves, as an organisation, from making representations or approaches to this regime.</P>

      <P>This is the second occasion on which an Irish cleric has found himself in this position for precisely the same offence.  In view of the likelihood that there will be other Irish missionaries in a similar position for similar offences, does the Minister not recognise that it is vitally important that our Government should find a way to bring pressure&mdash;note, not make representations; note, not consult&mdash;on this illegal regime through the Geneva conference or through world opinion or otherwise?  They should bring pressure to ensure that our citizens, doing the job they are committed to do because of their vocation or otherwise, will not be imprisoned, as two of them have been.  Surely the Minister will recognise that we cannot sit back and confer an immunity from any protest on an illegal regime.  This is what the Government is now, in effect, doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to approve the Government's acceptance of the second amendment to the articles of agreement of the International <Col N="899" /> Monetary Fund, the text of which is set out in the Schedule to the Bill, and to make the necessary changes in the previous Bretton Woods Agreement Acts arising from this second amendment.  The Bill also authorises the Central Bank to make certain payments to the IMF.</P>
    <P>The proposals incorporated in the second amendment to the IMF articles provide for a major reform of the international monetary system&mdash;the most important revision of these arrangements since the par value system based on fixed exchange rates was established at Bretton Woods in 1944. The need for reform became apparent during the sixties and assumed a new urgency with the breakdown of the par value system in the early seventies. The major world currencies then gradually abandoned the fixed exchange rate regime, which constituted the central element of the international monetary system, and we have since experienced a period of widespread floating of currencies in contravention of the existing IMF articles of agreement.  The breakdown of the Bretton Woods system led to a major reappraisal of international monetary relationships in the light of the changed economic realities of the seventies.  Five years of debate and negotiation within the IMF have produced a consensus on major adaptations to the international monetary system, particularly designed to provide for the greater flexibility which today's monetary relationships require.</P>
    <P>An explanatory memorandum has been circulated along with the Bill for the information of Deputies.  This memorandum sets out the main themes of the proposed amendment of the IMF articles.  While the mechanics of the proposed new international monetary system may be fundamentally different from the old, the objectives towards which they strive remain unchanged, namely the fostering of international monetary co-operation through the medium of the IMF; the promotion of the balanced growth of trade; the elimination of financial barriers to trade; exchange stability; <Col N="900" /> and the provision of financial assistance to countries with balance of payments difficulties to allow them the opportunity of correcting maladjustments without resorting to measures destructive of national or international prosperity.</P>
    <P>By far the most important area of change in the new international system concerns the exchange rate arrangements which countries may adopt. The Bretton Woods system, envisaged international monetary stability as being based on a system of fixed though adjustable exchange rates supported, when necessary, by IMF assistance.  Adherence to this fixed exchange-rate regime encouraged members to adopt stable economic policies and facilitated the unprecedented expansion in world trade of the post-war years.  But inevitable divergences between national trends in growth and inflation made the rigid structure established in 1944 increasingly obsolete.  These developments accelerated during the sixties and early seventies, which were characterised by faster growth in the volume of world trade and also by external shocks of unprecedented magnitude. The suspension of the convertibility of the US dollar in 1971, which heralded the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, was thus inevitable.</P>
    <P>The new system takes a radically different approach from Bretton Woods.  Now each country will be free to adopt the exchange rate arrangement of its own choice.  This approach recognises that countries' competitiveness is subject to change and that it is much less destabilising to permit exchange rate flexibility in response to market forces than to attempt to adhere to a fixed exchange rate until its abandonment is forced after costly financing.  The IMF, however, is conscious of the potential instability that could result from undue reliance by countries on the exchange rate flexibility which the new system allows.  Accordingly an obligation is imposed on member countries of the IMF to collaborate with the IMF and other members &ldquo;to assure orderly exchange arrangements and to promote a stable system of exchange rates&rdquo;. In particular each member will be <Col N="901" /> required &ldquo;to direct its economic and financial policies toward the objective of fostering orderly economic growth with reasonable price stability&rdquo; and must &ldquo;seek to promote stability by fostering orderly underlying economic and financial conditions&rdquo;.  The emphasis therefore of the new system is on developing stability from within through attention to responsible management of underlying economic and financial policies in individual member countries.</P>
    <P>To ensure the effective operation of the new system, the IMF will &ldquo;exercise firm surveillance over the exchange rate policies of members&rdquo; and &ldquo;will adopt specific principles for the guidance of all members with respect to those policies&rdquo;.  These principles and related procedures are at present being worked out.  This surveillance function does not imply that the IMF will have power to determine the policies of member countries.  It does, however, mean that the IMF will seek to ensure that members' behaviour should not be at the expense of other members' well-being. In particular the IMF will be concerned to ensure that members observe their undertaking to avoid exchange rate manipulation which could have potentially harmful consequences if resorted to on a wide scale.</P>
    <P>I need hardly emphasise to this House the importance which we attach to the successful realisation of the objective of exchange rate stability.  For a small open economy, such as ours, a stable external environment is particularly desirable.</P>
    <P>The new system, in its flexible approach to exchange arrangements, will accommodate more the practice of large than of small countries.  Most small countries will, no doubt, continue to peg their currency to that of one of the major currencies or to a basket of currencies.  In this context, perhaps I should mention that no change in Ireland's exchange arrangements is required under the new system.  As I have stated before, the Government are keeping our exchange rate position under continuous review and the balance of advantage is still <Col N="902" /> considered to favour the present arrangements.  The new IMF articles do, however, give us a wider range of choice of alternative regimes than the existing articles.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the question of exchange rates, I should add that provision has been made in the amended articles for a possible return to a system of exchange arrangements based on stable but adjustable par values.  This would be much less rigid than the Bretton Woods par value system as no country would be obliged to adhere to the par value system.  The introduction of such a system would only be contemplated where there was general agreement that international economic and financial conditions were conducive to such a move.  The essence of these provisions is to allow the flexibility which present economic realities require while permitting evolution to new arrangements as and when conditions permit.  For the immediate future however it seems likely that the international monetary system will continue to be characterised by a diversity of exchange arrangements. The important change which the amended articles will entail is to make such arrangements subject to surveillance and guidance by the IMF.</P>
    <P>Now that the exchange rate system established at Bretton Woods is being officially replaced, it is appropriate that the role of gold, which constituted the linchpin of that system, should also be reduced.  Under Bretton Woods, gold was the ultimate reserve asset of the international monetary system.  However, gold has long ceased to perform adequately its monetary functions.</P>
    <P>With the growth of trade since the war, the need for international liquidity has also grown, but the stock of monetary gold has not grown correspondingly. Consequently the world has come to rely increasingly on holding US dollars and other currencies for its supply of reserves.  In the event, the growth in dollar holdings led to the suspension by the US in 1971 of its undertaking to convert dollars into gold.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the inadequacies <Col N="903" /> of gold, the new system promotes a reduction in gold's monetary role in a number of ways.  The most important changes under this heading include the abolition of the present official price of gold as well as abolition of the present obligation to use gold in certain IMF transactions&mdash;for example, in quota subscriptions and in payment of charges.</P>
    <P>Most significant, perhaps, in this connection, is the provision empowering the fund to dispose of its gold holdings and to use any profits from that disposal for normal IMF purposes, or for other uses, including use for the special benefit of members with low per capita incomes.  Already agreement has been reached on the disposal of 50 million ounces of gold, one-third of the total IMF gold holdings. Of this amount 25 million ounces is being sold back to IMF members in proportion to their IMF quotas at the official price of SDR 35 per ounce. The balance of 25 million ounces is being sold by auction with the profits over and above the official price being used for the benefit of developing countries through a Trust Fund. Auctions for this purpose have already commenced and are expected to continue at regular intervals over a four-year period.</P>
    <P>One of the objectives set out in the new IMF articles is to make the SDR &mdash;the Special Drawing Right&mdash;the principal reserve asset of the international monetary system.  This is a reserve asset created by the IMF at the end of the sixties.  It was designed to supplement the supply of gold and foreign currency reserves to meet any need for international liquidity.  If it were to become the principal reserve asset, it would also enable a measure of international control to be exercised over the global supply of liquidity. There has been a continued growth in recent years in the foreign currency component of official reserves, which has been considered adequate to meet the need for global liquidity.  Consequently, no allocations of SDRs have taken place since 1972.  There has not yet been agreement on measures that would ensure that a substantial part <Col N="904" /> of the growth in global liquidity would be met through periodic allocations of SDRs.</P>
    <P>The present amendment of the IMF articles provides for changes in the characteristics and expansion in the possible uses of the SDR which should enhance the attractiveness of the asset and promote the objective of making it the principal reserve asset of the international monetary system. Under the new system the SDR will assume an increasingly important role as a unit of account and as the preferred means of paying IMF charges. Furthermore the categories of official holders will be increased, countries will have greater freedom to enter into SDR transactions with each other on a voluntary basis and the rules governing the use of the SDR will be eased. Only time will tell whether these measures will promote the greater use of SDR, so necessary if it is to assume an increased role in the reformed monetary system.</P>
    <P>Few would question the desirability of this end, which would ensure increased international control over world liquidity.  For my part I welcome the prospect of increased international control of global liquidity which could help obviate the international inflationary pressures which we have experienced in recent years and to which we, as an open economy, are particularly vulnerable.  It is therefore in the interest of all nations, but particularly of the smaller economies, to ensure that the objective of promoting the role of SDR, to which we subscribe in the proposed amendment, is realised as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The IMF have taken the opportunity afforded by the present reforms to modify obsolete provisions and incorporate in the articles certain policies and practices that experience has proved useful.</P>
    <P>The most significant change in this context is the provision that the IMF's holding of the currencies of each member will be usable by the IMF in order to provide balance-of-payments financing to other members&mdash;the basic purpose for which quota-subscriptions are required to be paid to the IMF by all members.  However under existing <Col N="905" /> arrangements some countries can effectively prevent the use of their currencies in IMF loans.  Ireland and the other countries, which have permitted the use of their currencies, have long argued that such a situation throws a disaproportionate burden of financing on some countries while effectively reducing the resources available to the IMF.  We therefore fully endorse the provision in the amended articles requiring that the currencies of all members be made usable.  This will add substantially to the fund's usable resources and will strengthen its ability to provide temporary balance of payments assistance to members.</P>
    <P>Among the other important operational changes are the simplification of the provisions governing the repayment of IMF loans and the granting of authority to the IMF to adopt special policies on the use of their resources, as may be required for special balance of payments problems.  This again is further evidence of flexibility of approach, which today's economic relationships require to be built into the new monetary system.</P>
    <P>Provision is also being made in the amended articles for improvement and change in the organisational aspects of the IMF.  The most significant aspect of this change is an enabling provision which would permit the establishment of a new organ to be known as the council.  This council would be similar to the present interim committee, a body representing all the member countries of the IMF, charged with advising on the management and adaptation of the international monetary system.  The council would differ from the interim committee in that it would have powers of decision rather than be solely an advisory body.</P>
    <P>A number of changes are necessary in the existing Bretton Woods Agreements Acts because of the amendment of the articles.  These are largely concerned with simply changing the references in the Acts to various articles which have a new number in the amended articles and do not provide for any new powers.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made for additional power to be given to the Central Bank to make any purchases of gold <Col N="906" /> from the IMF required to be made by Ireland under the amended articles. This arises from the restitution of gold by the IMF which I have already mentioned. The Central Bank have been given the obligation to carry out transactions with the IMF on Ireland's behalf and it is appropriate that this additional power should also be given to the bank.</P>
    <P>Pending ratification of the amended articles, the IMF decided to commence the restitution of gold using a &ldquo;scarce currency&rdquo; clause in the existing articles and the first restitution took place in January, 1977.  This clause was incorporated in the Bretton Woods Agreement largely to cater for the scarcity of dollars which emerged in the post-war era.</P>
    <P>When Ireland became a member of the IMF in 1957&mdash;to which effect was given in our Bretton Woods Agreement Act, 1957&mdash;it was not seen as necessary to provide for payments under this head.  The Central Bank, using their general powers to purchase gold under the Currency and Central Bank Acts, 1927-1971, have effected the necessary transactions in connection with this first restitution.  It is felt desirable to give retrospective sanction to these transactions in this Bill under the Bretton Woods legislation.</P>
    <P>The subject of international monetary relationships is no doubt a mystery as far as most people are concerned. However, after the experience of the last five years, few will have failed to grasp the importance of a stable international monetary environment for balanced economic development at national level.  We in Ireland have been particularly vulnerable to the international inflationary forces which were partly the cause, and partly the consequence, of the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system.</P>
    <P>We attach considerable importance therefore to the proposed amendment of the IMF articles which heralds the return of the international monetary system to a legal framework.  We are particularly pleased that the IMF will henceforth assume responsibility for surveillance of the multifarious exchange arrangements which have replaced <Col N="907" /> the Bretton Woods par value system.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of some delicacy, touching as it does on questions of national sovereignty.  However, I am sure that all nations will subscribe to the end which it seeks to attain, namely the operation of the international monetary system in a manner which promotes the welfare of all while discouraging any selfish national measures which prejudice the interests of others.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me say that the proposed amendment of the IMF articles while it represents a new and radical departure from the system established at Bretton Woods in 1944, nevertheless recognises the essential philosophy of the Bretton Woods Agreement&mdash; namely the interdependence of nations and a consequent determination to ensure international co-operation which would promote the welfare of all.  It is in the spirit of the 1944 agreement that I now commend the approval of its amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House have no difficulty in supporting this Bill since it seeks to give legislative approval to efforts made by the IMF to improve the chaotic situation at present existing in the international monetary scene.  I do not think, in doing this, however, that we ought to fool ourselves into thinking that the measures on which approval was eventually reached in the IMF, after a great deal of difficulty and argument, go anywhere near establishing a system in any way comparable to the system established by Bretton Woods in 1944 and which has broken down in recent years.  The Minister, although he has phrased it delicately, has said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many members of the IMF, large and small, have been engaging in activities which were quite illegal under the existing Bretton Woods Agreements. This includes ourselves because we have been indirectly engaged in floating our currency, something which is illegal under the existing arrangements. That the system broke down is indisputable.  The reasons why it broke <Col N="908" /> down are another matter and have already led to and probably will in future lead even more to many learned treatises on the causes and consequences. I do not know if we will ever achieve a satisfactory consensus on this, nor whether that is of great importance except to those who are technically concerned.</P>
    <P>The reality of the situation does, as the Minister said towards the end of his speech, affect all of us, men, women and children in all the countries which are members of the IMF. The system which has now broken down may have had some disadvantages but it had the great advantage of certainty and control.  It broke down under pressure&mdash;pressure of the developments in world trade, pressure on countries which were running substantial balance of payments deficits which they could not meet, at least without taking what their Governments regarded as unpalatable or unacceptable political decisions based on the economic measures they would have had to take.  They took what appeared to be the easy way out.  In many cases it started with devaluations and then floating their currencies.  Even the floating arrangements arrived at by many countries were not clean floats, as they are called.  In many cases they were dirty floats.  That means that the central banks concerned were intervening in the markets to keep up or keep down the prices of particular currencies. To the best of my knowledge no Government or central bank have ever openly acknowledged that they engaged in these activities.  Nevertheless, it is a matter of very common knowledge that quite a number of central banks on the authority and on the instructions of their Governments have done so.  As a result of their doing so we got a completely artificial situation whereby the value of a country's currency was to some extent being determined by its central bank, not by its true economic value and not by the value fixed if it adhered fully to the original Bretton Woods Agreement.</P>
    <P>The reasons are complex.  I may be quite wrong but I believe that a contributory factor has been the role of gold, about which I want to say a word <Col N="909" /> in a few minutes.  In the meantime the important thing to understand in this regard is that the system has broken down and that it has proved inadequate for the strains put upon it by the developments in world trade and by the unwillingness of Governments to face up to the consequences of the large balance of payments deficits they were running.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said quite rightly, for a small country like ours uncertainty in the international monetary field can only be harmful.  It is certainly vital to small countries which cannot exert any real pressure in the international monetary scene that there be an international monetary system which provides a degree of certainty to enable them to operate on a basis that can be planned ahead.  For example, before sterling started to float an Irish exporter could take an order which he would be supplying a year or two years ahead to a country outside the sterling area and calculate, at least in regard to the value of the currency in which he was being paid, how much he was going to receive and whether, on his estimates of his own costs, he could make a profit or not. As soon as sterling started to float&mdash;I am speaking only of sterling; there are other currencies floating too but I want to take it in simple terms&mdash;he could not with any degree of certainty calculate whether when the time came for him to supply the goods and be paid he was going to make a profit or loss.  I mention this as a simple example of the degree to which floating currencies interfere with trade, lead to uncertainty, and in many cases lead to loss of trade, particularly by manufacturers and others operating in countries whose currencies are floating. Even if one is operating in a country whose currency is strong one is, on the export market, forced to deal with countries whose currencies are floating or are of uncertain value, the same situation arises in reverse. Therefore it should be clear that anything that can be done to bring about the creation of an international monetary regime which has a degree of certainty is certainly in the interests of small countries, and almost certainly <Col N="910" /> in the longer term is in the interests of even the strongest countries in the world.</P>
    <P>We should be realistic enough to recognise that the proposed amendment of the Bretton Woods Agreement, the subject of this Bill, is not going to bring that about.  It is not the answer to all our problems nor, in fairness, did the Minister claim it was. However, I am disappointed at some of the omissions in this.  I want to make it clear that in saying this I am not in any way being critical of the Minister or the Government.  This amendment of the Bretton Woods Agreement is, as I have said, the result of a great deal of lengthy and tedious negotiations between the member countries of the IMF; to be realistic about it, between the large members of the IMF, the people who carry the weight and the votes.  We are members, we participate, we express our views, sometimes perhaps very sound views, but when it comes to the crunch we do not carry any weight.  It is the larger countries who decide on this and the larger countries could not agree on the major reforms that were necessary.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the changes proposed in the amendment, the subject of this Bill, which are in regard to exchange rates, are simply giving an air of legality to what has heretofore been illegal.  They do not provide a solution to the basic problem which has arisen in recent years.  I do not pretend that even with the best will in the world the countries concerned could find easily a solution to that problem.  Nobody is quite certain what is the right approach to this.  If the system which the world members of the IMF operated in the past cannot now be operated&mdash;and it cannot be&mdash; nobody is quite certain as to the right alternative.  We know the general direction in which we are going but we cannot say with certainty what is the right system.</P>
    <P>It is clear that a rigid system which does not recognise or provide for the natural changes that take place in the trading position between one country and another is a system which will eventually break down.  If a country <Col N="911" /> runs a large balance of payments deficit, then some other country or countries are running a balance of payments surplus.  If this continues for a very long time, obviously the exchange rates have to be changed. The manner in which they should be changed and the relationship between that change and the underlying economic strength or weakness of a particular country is where the difficulty arises in providing a system that will take adequate account of these changes and will produce them in an orderly way.  Nobody can pretend that the amendment of the Bretton Woods agreement now before us will do that.  It is really only giving a cloak of legality to what has heretofore been illegal, but it does not tackle the basic problem and it cannot do so in the absence of fundamental agreement between the major trading countries.</P>
    <P>I believe that gold has contributed to the breakdown of the system.  I have always believed, and continue to believe, that gold represents a form of superstition.  There are people who say that this is not realistic, that over a long time anybody who buys gold at a reasonable price will not lose, and that gold in the foreseeable future will be a valuable commodity.  That may be so, but it does not alter the fact that the whole basis on which gold gets its value is a form of illusion.  It would be equally true to say that people engaged in fortune telling may in the foreseeable future, be in a business in which they will make money, but it does not alter the fact that they are engaged in making money from a form of superstition.</P>
    <P>If that was all that was involved, it would be a fairly harmless exercise, but it is much more than that.  It has been pernicious, because for a long time the role of gold in the international monetary system was that it provided the basic asset backing of world currency. The amount of gold made available is determined by a handful of Governments, some of which hold diametrically opposed political views, but they all seem to act in the same way when it comes to supplying it to <Col N="912" /> the market.  I am referring particularly to South Africa and the Soviet Union. Whichever country is concerned, they are dealing in gold in what they conceive to be in the best interest of their economy, not in the interests of the international monetary system.  It seems self-evident that the basic unit backing international monetary system should be international and should be controlled internationally.  It should not be subject to the control of any Government or any group of governments getting together.</P>
    <P>Efforts were made to supplement the role of gold in financing the growth in world trade with a great deal of success, but a system which finds itself depending to any notable degree on gold or any similar material is a system which is basically flawed, lacking in reason, and not in accordance with what we could reasonably expect the world to have produced in the last quarter of the 20th century.  That is not to say that I believe this system will change and that gold will be phased out.  Too many people have a vested interest in it.  One of the basic problems in trying to bring about the fundamental change in the international monetary system has related to the question of what the role of gold should be.  Predictably enough, those Governments which had a relatively small supply of gold were very anxious to phase it out, and the Governments which had large supplies of gold in their national reserves were totally opposed to any move in that direction. France is the outstanding example of this.  Various learned arguments have gone on for a very long time on this question, but the reality is that we need an international monetary system which provides the mechanical method of adjusting currencies in an orderly way related to the change in a country's economic strength or weakness.</P>
    <P>The SDR's or paper gold, which were introduced some years ago by the IMF are a step in that direction, and some move is being made in this amendment of the agreement to try to give a much greater role to SDR's. Until we have an international monetary system in which the basic unit of account is something like the <Col N="913" /> SDRs, internationally controlled and with teeth given to the body exercising the international control, we will not have a rational international monetary system.  The move here is in that direction but we are a long way from the ultimate goal.  While the Minister properly expressed a decent and respectable confidence in the attitudes and goodwill of the members of the IMF in the future, he knows as well as I that this is a misplaced confidence.  All the evidence suggests that it is.  For instance, when the Minister was talking about the function of the IMF and its surveillance function he said:</P>
    <P>This surveillance function does not imply that the IMF will have power to determine the policies of member countries.  It does, however, mean that the IMF will seek to ensure that members' behaviour should not be at the expense of other members' well-being.  In particular the IMF will be concerned to ensure that members observe their undertaking to avoid exchange rate manipulation which could have potentially harmful consequences if resorted to on a wide scale.</P>
    <P>I have not much doubt that if a small country like Ireland were to engage in these activities the IMF could probably restrain us effectively.  But equally, I feel convinced that if one of the larger countries were to engage in this type of activity, the IMF could make noises but could do nothing about it.  It is because of that situation that the existing system has broken down, because large countries have done things which were clearly quite illegal and the IMF were unable to do anything about it.  Nothing that I can see in this amendment of the agreement will improve the power of the IMF to deal with these problems. Ultimately this will only happen when all the countries concerned have agreed to vest a part of their sovereignity in the IMF.  As the Minister said, it is a delicate area.  He skirted around it carefully, but perhaps I am at greater liberty than he to talk in this regard because of our respective roles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt I shall have to duck them at some time in the future but at present I am reasonably immune in that respect.  The reality is that until the major countries can come to agree to pooling a certain amount of their sovereignty and vest it in the IMF, all we are doing is tinkering with the system.  We will have to struggle on for a very long time with an international monetary system that will have all the disadvantages we have experienced in recent years, such as the uncertainty, the floating currencies and the kind of inhibitions to trade that I mentioned earlier, especially in the smaller countries.  This is not a very happy prospect.  Indeed, it is a bleak prospect; but it is a realistic assessment of what is ahead of us.  To the extent that the amendment of the agreement moves even a short way towards the goal we wish to achieve, it is welcome. However, I have been at some pains to stress that we should not think in any way that it cures the problems with which we have had to live in recent years because of the breakdown in the international monetary system.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that some unit of account is necessary.  This would be controlled internationally so that the amount of money available would be matched reasonably to world trade and expansion, an expansion which would not be dependent on national Governments, for whom the temptation is to expand the supply of money as an easy way out rather than having to cut their economic cloth according to the measure of their country's economic performance.  A continuation of that role by national Governments means international inflation. We must live with that unpleasant prospect but we must recognise that it is the prospect ahead of us for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that provision is made in the Bill for the establishment of a new organ of the IMF, a council that will have decision-making powers as distinct from the <Col N="915" /> existing <i>ad hoc</i> interim body which is advisory.  I will invite the Minister, when replying, to elaborate a little on this, particularly on Ireland's role in relation to that council.  I assume that we will be members of it, even on a rotating basis, although it may be that we will be represented on it by one of the countries with which we are grouped in the IMF, possibly Canada.</P>
    <P>There is one matter that arises when one considers any question of exchange rates.  I refer to what might be described as the old chestnut of breaking the link with sterling.  I have spoken here before on this topic and I have no wish to speak at great length about it now but I could not sit down during discussion of a Bill dealing with exchange rates without making some reference to it.</P>
    <P>I should like to say first that perhaps too few people realise that in the past &mdash;I am not sure of when but it was more than 100 years ago&mdash;we broke the link with sterling.  Apart from the kind of parity we have now we had one situation of having no link whatsoever with sterling and there was another situation in which we had a link with sterling but in which there was no parity.  I think the situation was then that 13 Irish £'s equalled £12 sterling so that we have had some experience of both situations.  I know that the economic conditions existing then are not comparable to the present situation.  Nevertheless, there are some lessons for us in respect of what happened then.  It is clear, for instance, that breaking the link with sterling is not the answer to all our problems.  The real danger in urging such a break is that it represents the soft option. When people find the going difficult it is natural that they seek the easy way out but a break in the link with sterling is not the easy way in the situation we are talking of.  Perhaps it is something that we could consider in due course.  I am convinced that it would be in the long-term interest of our economy to break our link with sterling but those who suggest that it should be done now are grossly mistaken.</P>
    <P>A country's exchange rate is related <Col N="916" /> ultimately to its economic strength or weakness.  There are technical factors that will move the pendulum up or down but basically the determining factor is a country's economic strength. No country, even the strongest in the world, can fix an exchange rate for its own currency and make it stick.  It will stick only if it is related to the country's economic strength and is so recognised by the other countries with which it deals.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to assess the situation so far as we are concerned but I am convinced that if we were to break the link with sterling now and to let the Irish £ find its own level on the international market, it would sink below sterling.  That may be unpleasant, but it is true.  Most people who advocate breaking the link with sterling now think in terms of the Irish £ being valued higher than sterling, but that would not be the case.  Our economic strength is not such that that would happen.  The reality is that, being such a small country with such a relatively insignificant currency, in practice if we were to break the link with sterling we would have to link with some other basket of currencies.  Most likely what we would try to do would be to participate in the Snake in the EEC.</P>
    <P>The great advantage that people see in breaking the link with sterling is that it would reduce our inflation because as long as we are tied to sterling on a par basis and as long as inflation is raging in Britain we cannot get rid of inflation here.  That proposition is true.  But too many people seem to think that there the story ends and that if we break the link with sterling we avoid British inflation and, consequently, everything is all right.  However, that thinking ignores the extent to which we are generating inflation at home.  At this stage it is not my wish to become involved in a denunciation of the Government's economic policies which I believe are contributing substantially to our home-generated inflation.  I am simply recording the fact that I believe that to be so.  But, in fairness, not only the Government but all of us as a people are contributing substantially to home-generated inflation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="917" /> I believe the significant thing about most people who advocate breaking the link with sterling now is that they do not seem to understand that to break the link with sterling and to avoid a catastrophic drop in the value of the Irish £ would entail first, our linking probably with the Snake within the EEC but, perhaps more important, would entail an economic discipline, a control on expenditure, on the income of everybody in the country that we have not known, that the great majority of the advocates of breaking the link with sterling would run miles from.  They are mostly the people who have consistently advocated a form of economic policy by whichever Government is in power which inevitably has led to inflation, a form which they like to think of as expansionist.  Expansion is all right within reason, but expansion which is not based on real growth is directly inflationary.  One of the people concerned, an outstanding advocate of breaking the link with sterling, is a Member of this House. He will probably contribute to this debate.  I have spoken about him before and so I am not speaking behind his back in that sense.  I believe he would be one of the first to object to the economic consequences of breaking the link with sterling at this time, to the kind of restraint that would have to be imposed by whatever Government are in power on incomes and imports in order to preserve our balance of payment situation and the standard of living we could have would drop very quickly in the immediate short-term.</P>
    <P>I do not say that in the long-term to do this we would not end up better off than if we do not.  We probably would, but I say that it is unreal politically to imagine that our people are ready to accept that kind of hairshirt discipline for the sake of breaking the link with sterling in the hope of long-term gains.  It is my belief that we should break the link with sterling in the longer term, that it will be to our advantage, but that before we contemplate doing so we must first get our economy into order, get it on a strong basis so that it will be able to stand on its own feet and enable us to take part <Col N="918" /> in the European Snake obligations and keep our currency within certain narrow limits in relation to the other currencies of the members of the Snake in the EEC.  To exercise that discipline means that we must ensure that our economy, our basic strength, is such that we will be able to keep within the Snake because failure to do so, if we have broken the link with sterling, will mean a run on our external assets with a consequential clampdown on imports and consequential loss of thousands of jobs and lowering of our standard of living.  The reality is that if we are to contemplate breaking the link with sterling we must first put our own house in order.  I hope that in due course we will be able to do that and that in due course we will break the link with sterling.  But I repudiate as strongly as I can any suggestion that breaking the link with sterling at this time will ease our problems and will be an easy way out of the economic difficulties we face.  It is not; in fact it would create enormous problems with which I doubt if we could cope at this time.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister for Finance on a few occasions has expressed a somewhat similar view, not in the terms in which I am expressing it, but he has come to the same conclusion. It is understandable perhaps that he would not express the view in the terms in which I express it, but he has reached the same conclusion.  The facts of the situation are so obvious that there is an onus on anybody, particularly in this House, who advocates an immediate breaking of the link with sterling or a breaking of that link in the very near future, to face up to the difficulties involved and tell us how he or she thinks they can be coped with, and not to dwell on the long-term, rosy prospects which could come from this&mdash;which I admit&mdash;but which are only possible if we are prepared to take the short-term consequences which could be catastrophic.</P>
    <P>For that reason I feel that if any discussion on this topic is to be useful it must face up to those difficulties and must recognise them and acknowledge that a way must be found of coping with them.  In the absence of <Col N="919" /> facing up to them it is unrealistic and to some extent dishonest to advocate breaking the link with sterling at this time.</P>
    <P>I believe that this agreement, the subject matter of this Bill, is a small step on a long road ahead of us and we should not be under any illusion that it is doing anything revolutionary towards tackling the problems which face the international monetary system and face us as members of the IMF. But to the extent that it is even a small step on that road, I welcome it and support the Bill.</P>

They also make facilities available to voluntary organisations and to the adult community generally.</P>
      <P>It is not the intention nor would it be a practical proposition to provide community schools in every area of the country but the structure of management and administration which has been devised for community schools offers a means of overcoming many of the obstacles which arise in areas where rationalisation of resources is desirable.

      <P>Although I have no function in relation to the holding of inquests or in relation to decisions as to what witnesses are called, I have already, on humanitarian grounds, fully inquired into this matter in so far as it was possible for me to do so after the lapse of several years&mdash;the death occurred nearly six years ago.  All the information that was ascertainable has been conveyed to the family and there is no further action that is open to me.</P>
      <P>There are aspects of this matter that affect the rights of several other persons and I do not consider that I could appropriately comment further in public on it but I am quite prepared to send the Deputy a detailed statement in writing about it if he so wishes.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, and again emphasising that this is not a matter in which my Department are officially involved, may I put on record that it is not correct to say that the family had no official notice of the cause of death?  I am informed that official notice, in the form of a copy of the inquest verdict, was sent by the coroner to two different solicitors who acted for the family in August, 1971 but, apart from that, a further copy was obtained by my Department and sent to them, through a parliamentary colleague of the Deputy, some 15 months ago.</P>
