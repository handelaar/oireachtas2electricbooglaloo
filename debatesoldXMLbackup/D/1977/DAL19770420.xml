      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is contained in section 1 which provides for an increase from seven to nine in the statutory maximum number of ordinary judges of the High Court, ignoring for the moment the terms of section 14 of the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, which provide <i>inter alia</i> that, in certain circumstances, the number shall be one more; an increase from nine to 11 in the statutory maximum number of ordinary judges of the Circuit Court; and an increase in the statutory maximum number of justices of the District Court&mdash;in addition to the President&mdash;from 34 to 39.</P>
      <P>The Bill also contains certain changes in existing legislative provisions regarding assignments of Circuit Court judges.  These changes are to some extent made necessary by the increase in the number of ordinary judges proposed in section 1.  However, the opportunity has been taken to consolidate in one Bill all the existing provisions relating to assignments.  Section 3 contains certain consequential provisions, including the necessary substitution of a new paragraph for paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 14 of the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent years have shown a very substantial increase in High Court business.  Between 1970 and 1976 the number of cases set down for hearing increased by 151 per cent and, although there was an increase of 143 per cent <Col N="1065" /> in the same period in the rate of disposal of cases, serious arrears have accumulated.  As a result, the position at the end of the Michaelmas term in December last was that 1,335 cases awaited hearing.  This unsatisfactory state of affairs has been exacerbated by the fact that Judge Pringle was appointed full-time chairman of An Bord Pleanála in January of this year which has resulted in the time of one of the ordinary judges of the High Court now being fully absorbed by sittings of the Special Criminal Court, and this will continue while the existence of that court continues to be necessary.</P>
    <P>To highlight the seriousness of this situation it is sufficient to point out that the average time-lag between the setting down of a jury action and its coming on for trial is now about ten months.  The last occasion on which an increase in the number of High Court judges took place was in 1973 when the Courts Act, 1973 increased the number of ordinary judges from six to seven.  At that time there was a time-lag of about 12 months between the setting down of a jury action and its coming on for trial.  As a consequence of the appointment of the seventh judge this time-lag was reduced by mid-1975 to five months.</P>
    <P>I should also mention here that in the past two years there has been a sharp increase in the number of family law cases coming before the High Court.  The coming into force of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act and the Family Home Protection Act during 1976 has intensified that increase and the growth in the number of such cases is expected to continue.  The position has already been reached where the hearing of these cases accounts, for all practical purposes, for the full time of one judge.  I am sure the House will agree that, having regard to the nature and special urgency of such cases, any avoidable delay in dealing with them cannot be justified.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, I have already arranged for the provision of special additional court facilities for the hearing of family law cases in rented accommodation in the immediate <Col N="1066" /> vicinity of the Four Courts.  These facilities are intended as a temporary measure pending completion of the redevelopment of the Four Courts Hotel site which has been purchased for the purpose of enabling the existing courtroom accommodation within the Four Courts proper to be considerably increased.</P>
    <P>The Government are satisfied that the growth in the volume of High Court business generally will continue for the foreseeable future and that, accordingly, the proposed increased complement of High Court judges will be fully occupied even after sittings of the Special Criminal Court cease.  This, then, is the background to the proposal to increase by two the statutory maximum number of ordinary judges of the High Court.</P>
    <P>The maximum number of permanent ordinary judges of the Circuit Court authorised by statute&mdash;section 2 of the Courts Act, 1964&mdash;is nine. However, section 14 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, authorises the Government temporarily to increase that number whenever it appears to the Government that such a step is necessary to prevent the work of the Circuit Court getting into arrears either generally or in any particular circuit or circuits.  Successive Governments have, over the years, found it necessary from time to time to increase temporarily the number of Circuit Court judges to cope with the persistent growth in the business of that court and, in recent years, to contribute judicial time to the sittings of the Special Criminal Court.  At the moment the full complement of Circuit Court judges includes two &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; judges.  These appointments were necessitated by the continuing growth in the volume of court business and the involvement of Circuit Court judges in sittings of the Special Criminal Court the membership of which now includes three such judges.</P>
    <P>The business of the Circuit Court has, as I have already indicated, continued to grow over the years and this growth has accelerated in recent years. Between 1970 and 1976 the growth in the overall business of the court has been of the order of 30 per cent.  The <Col N="1067" /> Government are satisfied that the business of the Circuit Court will continue to grow for the foreseeable future and that, accordingly, the existing complement of 12 judges including the President of the Circuit Court, is the minimum number that is now required and that will continue to be required to cope with the business of the Circuit Court even when sittings of the Special Criminal Court cease.</P>
    <P>The Government are also satisfied &mdash;and I am sure the House will agree with them in this&mdash;that in such circumstances it is unjustifiable that two judges should continue to hold office on a temporary basis.  Accordingly, the Bill provides for an increase of two in the statutory maximum number of ordinary Circuit Court judges.  I may add that it is the intention of the Government that the two serving &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; judges be made permanent so that the question of new appointments does not arise as a result of this provision.</P>
    <P>Section 28 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, provides that the number of justices of the District Court, in addition to the President of the District Court, shall not be more than 34.  However, as in the case of the Circuit Court, the Government are authorised to increase that number temporarily whenever it appears to them that such a step is necessary to prevent the work of the District Court getting into arrear.  This authority is contained in section 51 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936.</P>
    <P>At the present time, in addition to the complement of 34 permanent justices, five &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; justices stand appointed.  One of the temporary justices is, of course, required to make good the loss of the permanent district justice who acts as full-time chairman of An Bord Uchtála.  The number of such justices was increased from one to five during the years 1973 and 1974 because of the need for more justices to cope with the then rapidly increasing volume of business and the substantially increased demand that sittings of the Special Criminal Court were making on the services of district justices.  The overall volume of District <Col N="1068" /> Court business increased by about 43 per cent between 1970 and 1976 and the Government are satisfied that the volume of business will continue to increase.</P>
    <P>Another pertinent factor is the growth in the number of maintenance cases following the enactment of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.  Due to their complexity and delicateness each of these cases can account for a proportionately large amount of court time compared with, for example, parking cases.  The position has been reached where the existing complement of 39 justices, in addition to the President of the District Court, is the minimum number that is now required and that will continue to be required for the forseeable future to cope with the business of the District Court even when sittings of the Special Criminal Court cease, and also to continue to provide a full-time chairman for An Bord Uchtála.</P>
    <P>As I have already pointed out in relation to the Circuit Court, it is, in the Government's view, unjustifiable that in such circumstances five justices of the District Court should continue to hold office on a temporary basis. Accordingly, the Bill provides for an increase of five in the statutory maximum number of District Justices.  Here again, it is the Government's intention that the five existing &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; justices should be given permanent appointments so that the question of new appointments does not arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>From the Minister's speech and from this brief Bill itself, it is clear that the net effect of this legislation is to increase the number of High Court judges by two. This will effectively enable the Government to make the appointments of the two temporary Circuit Court judges permanent and will also enable the Minister to make the existing five temporary District justices permanent. This would seem to mean that the number of extra justices and judges available at District, Circuit or High Court level would be two.  Taking into account the fact that Mr. Justice Pringle, who served in the Special Criminal Court, has now been <Col N="1069" /> assigned to the planning board and that a High Court judge has to act constantly in the Special Criminal Court, this means that one extra High Court judge is being appointed over and above the complement that existed when Mr. Justice Pringle was sitting in the Special Criminal Court.</P>
      <P>To summarise, this Bill enables the Government to appoint one extra judge.  It also enables the Minister to make permanent the temporary appointments of Circuit Court judges and District Court justices.  It might be no harm to see to what extent that is an adequate proposal to deal with the position in the courts at the moment.</P>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out, a very serious backlog of cases in the courts has been developing at every level.  I would like to state as a first principle that the cheapest time of all&mdash;I do not mean the cheapest to the State but to get the best return in terms of money paid for services rendered&mdash;is judicial time.  There can be a long delay in dealing with cases.  Even when a case is called, people can be delayed in the courts for two or three days before their cases are heard.  This means that expert witnesses, engineers, doctors and so on, are queueing up to give evidence.  We have this delay because there are not enough judges to hear the cases.</P>
      <P>If one were to analyse the situation one would realise that to appoint an extra judge at the appropriate salary would be a saving to the public&mdash;and they are the people we are concerned about here.  This could mean a great saving for litigants and that should be our first concern.  The public must get the best service at the lowest cost and I do not think this Bill goes far enough to do that.</P>
      <P>It can be reasonably argued that this Bill goes further than we ever went in our time.  It has become quite clear, because of the unfortunate increase in crime or the natural increase in population&mdash;about which we will not know very much over the next few years&mdash; that there has been a considerable increase in litigation, whether civil, criminal or otherwise, coming before the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An example of this emerges from <Col N="1070" /> the Minister's statement.  When talking of the High Court he said:</P>
    <P>As a result, the position at the end of the Michaelmas term in December last was that 1,335 cases awaited hearing.</P>
    <P>May I bring him up to date?  Those 1,335 cases on jury actions alone have become 2,060 and, on non-jury actions, have become 562.  That seems to make a grand total of 2,622 in comparison with the 1,335.  I do not know if we are comparing like with like.  I am working merely on the abstract available in the central office showing that total.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister is talking about jury actions here.  No, he seems to be talking about High Court business generally.  That is a huge increase in the amount of business and is symptomatic of what is happening at other levels.  I am told further by those who practise in the Dublin Circuit Court that that is the worst of all, that the delay there in getting a case on for trial at present&mdash;it is civil litigation&mdash;is between one-and-a-half and two years after the case has been entered for trial.  I understand that there are four judges in the Dublin Circuit Court.  I understand that two of them deal permanently with criminal work.  One deals with motions, District Court appeals, licensing applications and title work generally and the third is available. My apologies, I was wrong; one deals with motions, District Court appeals and licensing work generally. The fourth seems to be available for all the other civil work needing to be done in the city and county of Dublin &mdash;one circuit judge for income tax, malicious injury applications, ejectments and all other civil actions needing to be dealt with.  The reality of the situation is that citizens of this city and county who want to have these matters dealt with by the court&mdash; and I am speaking now only of civil actions&mdash;have to wait not less than one-and-a-half years to have their cases heard and sometimes up to two years.  That is the information given me by those who practise in that court.</P>
    <P>That is merely a measure of those <Col N="1071" /> who are determined, no matter how long they wait, to put their cases down. There are so many others who obviously ask themselves: &ldquo;What is the point?  If one has to wait this long it will not be worth a candle by the time the case comes to be handled.&rdquo;  The issues may have been clouded, the parties involved could have died and so on and many of them will not proceed to have their cases dealt with.  It is the old maxim of: justice delayed is justice denied.  I should like to know if that is not so but I believe at first hand that it is so.  If the Minister can convince me that my informants are wrong, I shall be glad to hear the basis on which he can assure me that they are wrong.  If they are correct&mdash; and I believe they are&mdash;equally I shall be glad to hear what steps the Minister proposes to take to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>It does seem that, like every other business of the State, the pressure of court business has increased enormously.  One must add also that the pressure on judges and judges' staff has accordingly increased enormously, which is something that must also be taken into account.  But in the final analysis what we are all concerned about and what we are concerned about here is that the public get the best and most expeditious service at the cheapest possible rate. I question whether this Bill goes even a small way towards providing those answers.  Merely securing the appointment of two temporary Circuit Court judges who will become permanent <i>ipso facto</i> does not constitute any move towards dealing with the huge backlog of litigation cases obtaining in the city and county of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The appointment of extra judges is only one aspect of it.  The provision of extra accommodation is equally important.  When I speak in terms of providing extra accommodation the need will not be very great now because we are providing for only one extra High Court judge over and above the complement existing while Mr. Justice Pringle serves on the Special Criminal Court.  There is one extra man only at all levels, High Court, <Col N="1072" /> Circuit Court and District Court. Assuming that we were going to tackle the problem&mdash;which does not appear to be the case at present&mdash;then the provision of adequate accommodation would be as vitally important as the appointment of judges to deal with the business.</P>
    <P>I welcome and support entirely the provision of a separate complex to deal with family law cases.  The fact that the complex will be located near the existing courts is equally vitally important for a lot of good social and practical reasons.  To take the social reasons first, at present at every level in our courts&mdash; certainly in the District Court and again I am relying on information provided to me by practitioners there&mdash;it seems to be a matter of very great concern not merely to the practitioners but to all concerned.  All the people involved in the normal issues that arise in family law in many cases have to sit cheek by jowl with people in the corridors, sometimes in the courts, who are before the courts for criminal offences, unfortunately, young people sometimes involved in these family law cases who are not segregated to the extent they might be from others before the court not because of anything their parents have done but because of offences they have themselves committed.  I know the Minister accepts the desirability of ensuring that these cases be treated differently.  They are very different from any other type of litigation, be it criminal or civil to be dealt with by the courts.  It has become a great social issue.  The media have become very concerned and many concerned pressure groups have been promoting the need for reform of family law.  However, one must, at the same time, recognise that the fewer family law cases there are the better.  Generally, they derive only from the breakdown of the existing fundamental structure in our society, namely, the married unit.  The only time people will need to have recourse to the courts on family law issues is when the normal agreement and harmony existing in the ordinary married unit&mdash;allowing for the regular stresses and strains that occur in every marriage&mdash;have broken down.</P>
    <P>The provision of separate family <Col N="1073" /> courts, far from being an inducement to people to litigate, where they should settle their differences is simply a recognition that these are different from other types of court cases and should be dealt with in a different atmosphere. As we provide separate facilities in court equally we must ensure&mdash;and this is probably a matter of less concern to this Minister than to others&mdash;that, as our law develops in this area, that our social services, advisory services, school services and educational services for young people in the preparation and training for marriage are developed to an extent that the need for recourse to family courts will diminish rather than increase.  If we do not tackle that side of it we are only treating a symptom that will spread and spread.  That symptom, unfortunately, will only be seen at the last stage, when one goes to court.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government have in mind, in conjunction with the provision of adequate facilities and separate judges at every level to deal with family law, the need for the necessary social and advisory services, marriage councils, and the extension of that service, to service these courts, to take them out of the atmosphere of litigation but, more important, to prevent people in the first instance having to go near a court.  That concerns education and recreational facilities and the other things which create the environment that makes crime more likely in built-up cities than in rural Ireland.  That means that the Department of Education must show a greater awareness of the problem of overcrowded classrooms and the problems teachers face in dealing with such classes.  If that problem is not tackled the children who are being neglected in these crowded classrooms have only one road to travel which eventually leads them to the courts we are at present discussing, a road we must ensure they do not travel.  We must have adequate recreational facilities for our children.</P>
    <P>During my term as Parliamentary Secretary with responsibility for youth and recreational facilities I got a magnificent response from the voluntary <Col N="1074" /> organisations dealing with those matters.  I was made aware that those people did more to maintain the harmony, happiness and security of the young people of our towns and cities than any number of judges can when they finally adjudicate on problems.  I cannot understand how the Government turned their backs on them.  We achieved a minor breakthrough in this regard and it was most satisfying to work with people who were trying to ensure that our young people were provided with adequate recreational facilities. However, as with so many other things, the Government have no plan. We had a plan but it is dead.  Those who refer to the increase in juvenile crime should ask themselves if anything has been done over the past four years to provide facilities that would ensure that children do not get into this inevitable tunnel of crime from which there is only one exit, into court and then to prison.  It is our job to ensure that they are diverted to something more meaningful.  There is little evidence of any awareness of the need to do that.  I acknowledge that that is not the function of the Minister for Justice.  He is only here like the surgeon who is called in at the terminal stages.  The Minister is here not to deal with preventive medicine but to provide the facilities whereby judges, practitioners and those concerned at that level, can deal with the diseased body.  Many of us would prefer to see social circumstances in which families can grow and prosper in a healthy environment.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the view expressed by the group calling themselves &ldquo;community councillors&rdquo; was to a great extent telling the people that they believed such facilities should be provided to prevent children getting into trouble.  There was a response to that view by the people of Dublin and we should all take account of that. That is an indication of the concern people have.  If it reaches the stage when juveniles are brought before the court we must try to find the best way of dealing with such cases.  On the family law side there is, unfortunately, an increasing number of such cases being litigated at every level in the High Court.  I say &ldquo;unfortunately&rdquo;<Col N="1075" /> because it is an indication of the breakdown in the ordinary marriage unit. However, we should not go overboard because it is not always quite as overwhelming as it is sometimes presented.  Yesterday I checked with the central office of the High Court to find out how many family law cases are awaiting determination.  The House will be surprised to hear that there are 50 cases awaiting determination. Most of those cases, as distinct from the ordinary provisions of custody or family home protection or rights within the home, would be what we call divorce a <i>mensa et toro</i>, separation proceedings.  The number is a lot less than most people felt would be in the High Court.  I cannot say what the issue is in all those cases but from my experience in the High Court it is reasonable to say that perhaps 80 per cent of those cases awaiting determination would be cases involving the seeking of a decree of separation.  Some of them might have been cases consequent on decrees which had been made previously.  It is perhaps less than most of us would have expected and if it is it is encouraging.</P>
    <P>When talking about the breakdown of marriages we must recognise that there are many people working on a voluntary basis, and otherwise, and people living normal family lives, who are setting standards which are maintaining that figure at such a low level. Nothing that anyone can do by way of providing court facilities can ever be as effective as the collective will of the public which is to ensure that the best standards are maintained.  It is fair to say that in Britain, America and other countries they have more effective separate facilities with sophisticated services in courts and elsewhere in areas of family law. That is as it should be but it is true to say that the need for them is more intense in those countries than it is here.  That is not to say that we are holier than anybody else, far from it, but we have an obligation at every level, particularly educational, to ensure that the need to go to court does not arise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1076" /> If these cases come to court there is a lot to be said for having them heard in an informal procedure that for one reason or another does not operate under the present system.  The general provisions of family law provide that these cases should be heard in private, and generally, that trend is followed. I would go further and suggest that they be heard in private with an informal type of procedure, and if possible, ensure that the ceremonial dress of judge and advocate is dispensed with so that the children or people appearing before such family tribunals would feel that they were not being adjudicated on but were having the opportunity to consult, be advised and helped by people qualified and concerned to do it.  The less of the ceremonial dress and procedures of the ordinary court they meet in such circumstances the better.</P>
    <P>I am not asking that a judge be required to take a casual approach.  I am sure judges would not but the least formal and most convenient procedures should be adopted to ensure that everybody presents the real issues to the presiding judge or justice and have all relevant facts considered in the interest of the family unit appearing before the tribunal.  In relation to the Circuit Court position in Dublin I have been informed that there are 10,000 civil actions awaiting trial in the city.  I am also informed that that means a wait of at least two years.  I am also informed that many people adopt the attitude that it is not worth waiting that long.  If that is so we cannot sit back and say that we are providing a service for the public because we are not.  The public always take a collective view towards a group they do not belong to and it is possible that, as I belong to the legal profession, they will say I am looking for the appointment of more judges but that is not my concern.  I do not hope to have any responsibility of sitting in that position but it is wrong that citizens of this city should be asked to wait for two years to have their ordinary civil cases determined&mdash; this applies to everything from title ejectment proceedings to injury and other kinds of actions.  We all meet people who express frustration about <Col N="1077" /> such delays.  Because of the delay that arises in having cases reached for trial even after they have been set down that poses a special obligation on the legal profession to ensure there is no delay on their part in getting cases to that stage.  Normally, before a case is set down for trial in the High Court there can be a delay of up to 18 months.  If the preliminaries take from three to six years, as in some cases they do, then we all have a greater responsibility because that is outside the scope of Government.  Deputy Esmonde is uneasy when I say that because he has a better track record than most in getting cases dealt with.</P>

      <P>It might help the Deputy to indicate that my information with regard to the time lag in the Circuit Court civil business in Dublin is that the interval is eight months between notice of trial and hearing. When the Deputy speaks of two years that possibly takes in the pleadings and the professional end of it but as far as the administration of the courts is concerned eight months is the period.</P>

      <P>It is not and I do not know the reason for the delay. However, judging by the increase in crime in Dublin over the last number of years one can see that there are many more cases to be dealt with.  On the criminal side the courts only fulfil one function, the function of imposing a penalty.  Every other function in the related area of crime, preventive or otherwise, is fulfilled by somebody else. The first people who come to mind are the gardaí.  There is no doubt that one of the most abiding worries at present is the lack of adequate gardaí on the beat.  Everybody is concerned about this.  People complain that the situation is disastrous because of the lack of gardaí to do the normal work they are trained to do, prevent crime by their presence and be kept informed by the public of undesirable developments that may lead to crime.  This can only start with the gardaí on the beat.  Many more judges can be appointed but if we do not have adequate gardaí we are not dealing effectively with the problem.  Like family law, the problem must be tackled at every level with the courts as the final stage.  Judges often admit that they would prefer that such matters be dealt with at an earlier stage.  We must provide for a greater increase in the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the public generally recognise that and accept the burden laid on them as taxpayers as very well warranted. My party have made clear our position.  Because of the continuance of security problems in the North and the unfortunate consequences they are having for us here members of both the Garda Síochána and the Army have to be deployed on a quasi-permanent basis along the Border and that naturally results in fewer gardaí being available in this part of the country. The lack of gardaí in towns and cities has led to a huge increase in crime. Everyone of us has become abundantly aware of the problem.  Irresponsible and ruthless men and women must be dealt with.  We are all aware of the attack directed against the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social <Col N="1079" /> Welfare, Deputy Cluskey, in his home yesterday.  In passing, may I say I deplore what happened and so does every member of my party?  It was a most vicious attack directed not just against the individual but against the institutions of the State.  Nothing could justify that kind of attack.  We all recognise the need for the Government to deal effectively with the situation.  I am glad to have the opportunity of saying this but, having said it, how can the Government ignore reality when the ordinary criminal is having a holiday in every city and town at the moment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a gross exaggeration and it is the sort of thing which encourages criminals to think they have open house.  It encourages crime.  Irresponsible exaggeration encourages the criminal to think he has open house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps &ldquo;holiday&rdquo; is an overstatement and I withdraw it. The Minister says it is gross exaggeration. That may be, but ordinary people are very, very concerned.  Is that an exaggeration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how one can quantify the concern of ordinary people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time we started to do it and that is the Minister's job, not mine.  People will not stay in their own homes.  Is that concern?  I am aware of the situation and I presume my experience is no different from that of others.  The situation can only be dealt with by increasing the number of gardaí so that the courts can deal effectively with those brought before them.  We need 2,000 extra gardaí and not 500 and we must pay them in accordance with the responsibilities they have thereby enabling the courts to operate effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must have statistics with regard to the cases in which there is delay and I would like to have these figures.  Unconvicted criminals out on bail invariably commit more crimes. The problem must be tackled and the appointment of two temporary judges as permanent judges is not the solution. What is it intended to achieve? <Col N="1080" /> When I have the answer to that question I shall be better informed than I am at the moment.  What is needed is more judges with accommodation and staff.  The appointment of more judges will call for the appointment of more county registrars, district court clerks and registrars to deal with the ever-increasing burden of work.  Staff play a vital part in the administration of justice.  Only with sufficient staff can there be expedition.  I would support the appointment of more staff to ensure effective and expeditious service. At the moment staff are very hard worked indeed.</P>
    <P>I presume the Minister will shortly be announcing a comprehensive scheme of civil legal aid to ensure that family law will operate without regard to the means of the parties concerned.  We want to see a proper code of social justice.  There must be every guarantee that those affected will not be prevented from benefiting because of lack of finance.  I presume the Minister will be able to tell us what long-term proposals he has in this area to allay the concern on the part of the public at the moment.</P>
    <P>In talking of delay, how much of that, I wonder, is due to understaffing in the office of the DPP and the Chief State Solicitor?  I have not had much experience of the office of the DPP and I am glad to have this opportunity of putting on record that I have never prosecuted, even during the long period of Fianna Fáil Government, because I thought it inappropriate for a Member of this House to prosecute. I have not done so either now.  However, I believe from those who do prosecute that there is a lack of adequate personnel to prepare cases for trial in the Criminal Court.  That is not at all to criticise those who are there, because those of us who know them are aware of the very diligent way in which they go about preparing these cases for trial.  Having regard to all the statements that have to be prepared to be presented to the accused and their solicitors, and all the necessary procedures that have to be implemented to guarantee the rights of the accused person and to ensure that justice is done, a great deal of paper work and preliminary work has <Col N="1081" /> to be done in consultation with the gardaí concerned.  It has been suggested to me that just as there is a shortage of gardaí in this critical area, there is also a shortage of adequate personnel in these offices.</P>
    <P>Any shortage of personnel, whether it is in the Garda Síochána, the office of the Chief State Solicitor or that of the Director of Public Prosecutions must be corrected.  The Minister is in the privileged position of having both the information and the authority to do something about it.  I have neither one or the other except to judge from observation and from comments made to me.  If that is so, the Minister should, rather than tell us about the delay in bringing cases to trial on the criminal side, tell us what he proposes to do to ensure that delay will be minimised in the interest of both the accused and of the public.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to something that will not necessarily win me the support and applause of all my colleagues at the Bar.  In the High Court, to which the Minister made reference in his opening remarks, particularly on the jury side, the general position is that 12 to 15 cases are listed for hearing in Dublin every day, more than likely in three courts.  I have no comment to make on the fact that it is necessary to put that number of cases in for hearing other than to wonder whether we will ever get to the stage of breaking down that backlog that I referred to earlier.  However, it is not possible to hear 12 cases per day with only three courts to deal with them.  Each case will take about one day, some more, some less.  Therefore the public are sometimes, by that simple fact, pressured into settling cases that otherwise they might want to have litigated by a court.  It is a good thing in its own way that cases should be settled but not on the basis that the rights of either party are being compromised.  I am not suggesting that they would themselves compromise their own interests.  Their professional representatives have the obligation, and I am sure so act, to ensure their rights are not compromised, but it may be that the doctor or the engineer who is a witness or <Col N="1082" /> the litigant himself may wish to get home and if it looks as if the case will not be taken that day, the litigant may feel that he should agree to settle the case.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the President of the court for putting in these cases for hearing, because otherwise there would be no prospect at all of dealing with that huge backlog, but the answer might be to provide an extra judge and an extra court&mdash;which would be much cheaper than having expert witnesses waiting around&mdash;and thus ensure that people can have their cases disposed of as is their constitutional right.  I know it is easy to point out the problems, that it is much more difficult to provide the remedy.  Nevertheless there must be a very radical and determined approach by the Minister and his Department in every area we are dealing with this morning to ensure that the problems we are trying to cope with will be dealt with as effectively as possible and that the rights we are trying to protect will be protected.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other anomalies to which I should like to refer as well, and jury actions in the High Court give me an opportunity of referring to one of them.  The position in court at the moment is that young people over 18 years are qualified to serve on juries. That is perhaps as it should be having regard to the attitude that has been adopted towards over 18's in the last few years.  However, is it not extraordinary that while he is qualified to determine the rights and compensation as between two parties, the litigant must be over 21 before he can act in his own right?  There is obviously an anomaly there that needs to be corrected.  If young people are qualified enough to decide (a) the liability between litigants in court and (b) the amount of compensation which should accrue to injured litigants, which is a much more complex operation than simply being a litigant, surely they are qualified enough to represent themselves in their own right without having to be represented by a parent or guardian.  I know there is protection for people under 21 that once proceedings have issued there must be a <Col N="1083" /> judicial determination as to settlement terms and so on.  All I am saying is that while those protections are desirable, there is an anomaly.  If we as a society take the view that people over 18 are capable of assuming certain responsibilities like voting, for instance, or sitting on juries, surely we should be consistent and say that that same generation, that same age group, are also capable of bringing their own cases to court as any other citizens would do.  I should like the Minister to let me know what proposals he has&mdash; and he must have some&mdash;to deal with that anomaly.  Anomalies are inevitable from time to time because as one makes progress in some areas it means that the areas in which progress has not been made must be brought up to date.  It is ludicrous that an obviously intelligent and well-informed 20-year-old has the issues in his case determined by a jury of people who may be two or three years younger than him and many of whom may have less education and experience than the person bringing the case before the courts.  I should like to have some response from the Minister on this.</P>
    <P>On the overall, as with our gardaí so with our judiciary.  We are especially fortunate to have a judiciary that operates independently and that must operate independently of this Parliament and Executive.  Generally the people most concerned here are the Government and every step they make in their association with the judiciary, in appointments and otherwise, should have one fundamental concern and that is to ensure that the judiciary generally will be allowed to operate entirely independently of the political representation in this House and of the Executive.  That is vitally important. Our judges are constitutionally independent and that is one of the greatest guarantees we have.  Those of us who have had the privilege of practising before them recognise how important that is and how much the public are protected by that.  Sometimes the public may have doubts or suspicions for one reason or another.  Irrespective of who is in Government the only thing we can do here is ensure that in our relations <Col N="1084" /> with the judiciary and in appointments to the judiciary we will discharge those responsibilities with one aim only in mind and that is the upholding of the dignity of the courts and the guarantee that justice will be administered effectively.  We can be very happy with the performance of our judges and the status which they have and the responsibility lies on us to ensure that that situation will continue.</P>
    <P>I know that the independence of the courts is the most precious asset they have.  At the same time, that does not mean that consultations cannot take place from time to time between the Minister and the representatives of the judiciary.  Inevitably in the District Court, where there are 39 judges operating in areas as far apart as Donegal and Wexford, there will be a difference of attitude and style and different reactions from the judges.  Because they operate in different conditions there will be a difference of attitude towards certain offences and there will not always be the consistency in sentencing that we would like to have in the best of all worlds.  Consistency generally is commendable, though it is not for us to comment on it.  To the extent that there would seem to be an inconsistency I would hope that it would be possible for the Minister to convey to the President of the appropriate court&mdash;not in regard to a particular case because that would be totally outside the functions of the Minister&mdash;the desirability of the judges meeting from time to time to maintain a liaison which normally might be difficult.  They would be able by constant discussion to maintain a fairly consistent pattern, particularly in response to criminal offences, so that the law throughout the country would be seen by the public to operate on an even pattern.  I do not think that would infringe at all on the functions of the judiciary.  If I thought it would I would be the last to suggest it.  If the President of the appropriate court were to tell the Minister that it was none of his business, then the Minister would have to live with that.  I feel it is desirable that uniform standards should be maintained.</P>
    <P>There is another point I want to <Col N="1085" /> make and I want some information from the Minister in relation to it. Some time ago we spent a very considerable time in this House discussing the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill, 1976, otherwise known as extra-territorial legislation.  This took a very considerable time and the Government have sometimes suggested that the Opposition have been responsible to a considerable extent for delays in putting business through the House.  We were told that this Bill was vitally necessary and urgent.  There was obviously a considerable difference of opinion between the Government and this side of the House as to how necessary and urgent this legislation really was and as to how effective it would be.  We said that it was neither necessary nor urgent and we said also that it would not work and would impose unreasonable hazards on our judges if it were to work.  We were told that all of these views were wrong and that some of them were irresponsible.  I want to ask the Minister what case, if any, has come before the courts under that legislation.  What judge, if any, of our Special Criminal Court has been called upon to deal with any change under that legislation?  If there have been no charges, can the Minister tell us why not?  Can he tell us why it was that we spent all that time here with all the consequences, all the debate and divisions and arguments, to no effect?  I want to know why that was so.  The Minister introduced the Bill on the basis that it was necessary and urgent.  Why was it so urgent and why did he not listen to our argument that it was not urgent and certainly was not workable?  We are not complaining that these things have not happened but we want to know why. The Government must answer for having taken up so much time to such little effect except to arouse a degree of concern, to cause divisions where divisions should not have existed and apprehension where apprehension should not have existed.  They should have looked at what would have been more effective, namely, an all-Ireland court.</P>
    <P>We are talking about courts and the problems of society at the moment, about civil and criminal litigation. <Col N="1086" /> Unfortunately we must talk more and more every day about the security position and the peace and the security which people want in their homes and what that means to them in their own land.  We still say that the best guarantee of that peace is to have a properly constituted court operating throughout this land with representation from both sides of this divided country.  That is the only way to deal with this problem.  We said this long ago and we say it again now with due respect to what courts can achieve, not just in imposing penalties and sanctions and also in upholding the fundamental rights of the individual where such may seem to be transgressed by the institutions of the State, if there are complaints to that effect.  We want to ensure that the courts which have done such a great job for us in this part of the country and which we have come to respect can spread that benign and effective influence throughout this land.  It is another argument, but in so far as one has not obviously been necessary to that extent it has failed.  It is not too much to ask the Minister if there is any consideration of a desirable alternative in dealing with what is still a very urgent problem, namely the terrible continuing violence throughout the whole of this land and if there is a way that this can be solved through the other system it is time we took another and more effective look at it this time than we did on the last occasion.  We seem to have spent so much time in this Parliament to so little effect.</P>
    <P>There is nothing else that I need to say.  Perhaps the Bill does not really deal with the problem because it does not provide for extra judges and it does not deal in a radical way with the problems that exist at every level of the courts, District, Circuit or High Court.  Perhaps the Minister has better experience of the District Court than I have.  I would like to hear what long-term plans he has.  To come back to the point at which I started, no one is interested in simply providing extrajudicial appointments to the extent that they are being made.  There is an obligation on us to make sure that they are made in the best interests of <Col N="1087" /> the people on whose behalf they are being made.  We are obliged to be interested in servicing the public needs. As far as one can see from the undue delays which occur in the courts at the moment, that is not being served adequately and this Bill does not go far enough to deal with it.  I would like to hear the Minister's response to some of the queries raised when he is replying to this Stage and I hope we can leave this legislation in the knowledge that we have taken some steps to deal with these problems in using the courts to the best possible advantage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanToal" hpid="Mr. Toal Mr. Toal">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Toal</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support this short Bill in which there are five sections. There are only two material sections, 1 and 2, and they are designed to increase the number of judges and justices throughout the country.  The Minister has convinced the House fully that this is absolutely necessary to the administration of justice.  I should like to use the opportunity of this Second Reading to say something which is not said often enough, that the judiciary are completely independent of the Government, of this Dáil and of the Oireachtas, and they carry out their functions, administer justice and interpret and apply the law to the citizenry of the State free from any interference whatsoever from the Government or anyone else.  The independence of the judiciary is the greatest safeguard that the individual has of his liberty.  Many civil rights people who speak about everything but civil rights never mention the independent nature of the judiciary which should be emphasised very strongly to the public at all times.  One reason I mention this is that because I am a Government Deputy people approach me in the streets and in all kinds of places and say, &ldquo;I was reading the paper the other day about the case down in Mullinavat&rdquo;&mdash;or a case in the Special Criminal Court in Dublin, or a case here or there&mdash;&ldquo;why did that happen?  What are you doing about that?&rdquo;  Somehow they identify the administration of justice with the Government of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The day-to-day running of the mechanics of the administration of <Col N="1088" /> justice are left to the judges and justices themselves and thank God for that.  It would be a sad day for democracy and for the populace if any Government or even a Government agency of any description could interfere with the day-to-day running of the courts.  This was brought home to me very forcibly recently because a lot of publicity was given to the case of a number of British army personnel who crossed the Border.  Many people came to me and expressed very strong feelings about that case and they said that this and that should have been done, that so many things had not been done.  I pointed out to them at all times that the case was brought and conducted independent of the Government and this Government had nothing whatsoever to do with it.  That is not said often enough.  The independence of the judiciary must be stressed to each member of the public. Certain members of the public do not understand the day-to-day running of the courts in this respect.  This Government have done more for the independence of the judiciary than any previous Government in the history of this State. They have gone further than any other Government in appointing a Director of Public Prosecutions and so have copper-fastened and made stronger the independence of the judiciary.  That will stand to their credit.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly about people's reaction to certain cases and particularly to the British army personnel case but that was initiated by the Director of Public Prosecutions and dealt with by the courts and this Government had nothing whatsoever to do with it.  There were different reactions to that case, but one reaction I would like to see from all quarters is that each and every person who interests himself in such a thing realises that the judiciary are fully independent.  I say that not because people came up to me in the streets talking about that or other cases. There was a lot of comment in the Press as well at the time.  There is a cardinal rule in politics that a pressman is never wrong, that the pressman is always right.  That may be true for politics, and I would be the last as a politician to tell any pressman how to go about his job or how to do his <Col N="1089" /> work.  However, in reporting court cases in the paper the Press can slant things sometimes and this is not done from any malice or ill-conceived intention. Many Press reporters, not only in the Special Criminal Court, the High Court or Supreme Court, but in the District Courts, do not fully understand the mechanics of the administration of justice.  I often read in the newspapers the reports of cases in which I have been involved and I am astonished at how different the reports are from what happened.  I am not preaching to the Press.  That is the last thing I want to do, but I say that the people's reaction to the Press has a tremendous possibility in this respect. We read of one man being charged with an offence and the following day another man in a different area being charged with a similar offence, both cases having completely different results.  The snippet that one sees in the newspaper gives the impression that justice is not being administered in a fair and impartial way.  The Press have a tremendous responsibility and politically motivated crimes should be handled with the utmost care.</P>
    <P>There are all kinds of descriptions of political prisoners in newspapers.  There is no such thing.  A prisoner is in prison simply because he has been convicted of an offence under the criminal code. The crime may have been politically motivated, but nevertheless it is a crime.  Reading about such cases people often let their hearts sway them instead of depending on their intellects. Everyone concerned should stress at all times to the public the complete independence of the judiciary.  We have had it since the foundation of the State and it has worked well.  In times of stress it still works well.  It is to the credit of this Government that they appointed a Director of Public Prosecutions and the public can be consoled by the fact that at all times the Government have nothing whatever to do with the conduct of any case in any court.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the increase in court work.  It is extraordinary that from 1970 to 1976 there was an increase of 151 per cent in the volume of High Court work.  Similarly, in the Circuit <Col N="1090" /> Court over the same period there was an increase of 30 per cent, and in the District Court an increase of 43 per cent.  On top of all this we hear that in jury actions there has been an average time delay of ten months from the setting down of a case for trial until it appears in court.  I do not need to belabour this point, Shakespeare said it better than I when he talked about the laws delay.  It is proverbial.  It does not do any good for the administration of justice or for people's respect of the law, if the law's delay is responsible for people not getting justice.</P>
    <P>I have been in cases in which all the complicated work had been completed when suddenly everything was put up on the top shelf in the solicitor's office, and we were told that we would not hear any more about that case for a year or a year-and-a-half.  This not alone has a serious detrimental effect on practitioners but it is highly injurious to the public.  When delayed cases eventually come into court and the solicitors and other people involved have performed the miracle of getting the plaintiff, the witnesses and the experts and so on into court, they are told that the case cannot be heard until the next week or the week after.  At that stage a little pressure comes on and a settlement is sometimes made. I have never seen anyone being forced to make a settlement but I do not like to see a settlement being made due to the fact that there is such pressure of court work the case cannot be heard that day.</P>
    <P>Irish people like to have things resolved.  A parish priest of whom I was very fond once said to me &ldquo;If you are going to have a row make sure you have a damn good one&rdquo;.  If one is going to court, it is better to see the judgment of the court rather than have the case settled on the doorstep.  Many of these cases could be resolved with better justice in the courts, if there was not such a backlog of work.  This is simply a measure designed to increase the number of judges.  It is the only way that this Government or any Government can demolish the backlog of cases in the courts throughout the land.  I support this measure which has the agreement of the House.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy O'Kennedy <Col N="1091" /> said that this was a measure for a few more judiciary appointments and that he fully agreed with it.  Many things have been said in this House in relation to the judiciary which were politically contentious but which would not have been said outside the privilege of this House.  These appointments are absolutely necessary and no one could honestly say that this is just another measure to bring in a few extra judges just for the sake of appointing judges.  Without being patronising, the judges and justices of this country are doing a tremendous service for the people.</P>
    <P>We heard on the radio and television and read in the newspapers yesterday of an attack made upon Deputy Frank Cluskey, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare.  I could not believe my eyes when I saw that on the television.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanToal" hpid="Mr. Toal Mr. Toal">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Toal</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy referred to it.  I was glad to hear that he deprecated what happened.  I am merely taking this opportunity of expressing my horror that such an incident should have occurred.  It was a sad day for democracy.  However, I am aware of many instances in which attacks have been made on judges.  There have been many instances, too, in which attacks on judges have been prevented. No judge wishes to have a guard on himself or on his property but in the present circumstances it is necessary that they be guarded.  This is another aspect of a judge's life that, perhaps, people do not appreciate fully.  We must condemn outright any attack on the person or on the property of a judge or district justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been introduced as a measure for dealing more effectively and speedily with the backlog of cases that have been building up in the courts during the past number of years but this is a problem that will have to be tackled not only by appointing more judges but by considering closely the work of the courts.  In this respect I should like to see the recently established Law Reform Commission <Col N="1092" /> examining the situation.  Much of the litigation coming before the courts could very well be decided on by arbitrators, by county registrars or-some other semi-judicial persons.  Deputy O'Kennedy referred to the number of civil cases listed for hearing in the Dublin Circuit Court but the Minister rightly asked the Deputy promptly if he would include in that category malicious injury claims.  I have always considered that malicious injuries cases should not be brought inside a court at all.  It may be all right for the court to have to decide on the question of malice but it is another matter when the court must spend many hours in assessing damages, in talking about the price of slates or timber, for example. Much of the time of the Circuit Court is taken up in this way while, as I have said, such matters could be decided on by, for instance, a county registrar although he, with the extra workload imposed on him by reason of the Landlord and Tenant Act, is a hardworking individual.</P>
    <P>These problems are of huge dimensions and that is why I should like the Law Reform Commission to give attention to them.  I am aware that in order to provide for the sort of change I envisage, new legislation would be required but the task would be worthwhile. It is not my intention to talk about the malicious injuries code except to say that it must be the most unconstitutional legislation on the statute books.  It, too, is an area that requires a complete review and a thorough reappraisal in terms of the mechanics of its administration.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Circuit Court, too, the first cases listed are the criminal cases so that on a Tuesday morning at the beginning of the week's sitting there may be up to ten such cases listed for hearing but all of Tuesday and possibly Wednesday and Thursday could be devoted to the first case listed.  On the other hand, the first case might be heard in only an hour on the Tuesday with the result that the whole list would collapse.  I agree that the stamping out of crime is the main function of the courts but the conduct of these criminal cases has a serious effect on civil legislation and on the <Col N="1093" /> smooth conduct of civil cases.  It may be said that this situation is responsible for the long delays experienced by civil litigants.</P>
    <P>I have talked about delays in this respect in so far as the High Court is concerned and I do not wish to go into the matter again in respect of the Circuit Court except to say that some method should be devised whereby litigants would know the day and even the approximate time of hearings. There is a huge amount of work involved in bringing to court all the interested parties such as surveyors, architects or doctors and this is all the more reason why it is unfair to have a situation in which there is so much uncertainty as to the time of hearing. Not only is it unfair to witnesses but it is very unfair to civil litigants.  So far as the law is concerned we are all equal.</P>
    <P>Another point that occurs to me in regard to the hearing of criminal cases in the Circuit Court concerns the practice whereby a number of prison wardens arrive in a town in which the court is sitting.  These people reach the town concerned at about 9 a.m. but they may have to wait all day before being able to take the accused back to custody, that is, if he is convicted. I would suggest that prisoners be put in the custody of local gardaí on the day on which they are awaiting the outcome of their cases.  This would constitute a saving in terms of prison wardens.  This may be a small point but I am taking advantage of this opportunity to bring it to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy spoke at great length about family law courts and about the absolute necessity for reforming these courts and making sure that they were as informal as possible and that the minimum of ceremonial dress&mdash;I think these were the words he used&mdash;was brought into them. While some people may entirely disagree with ceremonial dress I think it has a very useful purpose in our courts in the sense that if a judge came in in an ordinary suit and advocates appeared in their shirt sleeves it would certainly be highly informal but it would not be as much respected just as if a priest saying Mass came out in <Col N="1094" /> a soutane, it would not create the proper impression.  The whole purpose, to my mind, is to induce people to have a genuine respect for the laws of the land.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy also dealt at great length with another subject and made what I consider to be a very serious charge against the Government when he spoke very emotively and extravagantly about the numbers of gardaí and the absolute necessity of recruiting gardaí.  Coming from Fianna Fáil at this stage that is nothing short of false indignation.  Deputy Briscoe is shaking his head but he should remember this.  It was Fianna Fáil&mdash;I know this, coming from a Border constituency&mdash;that closed down the small Garda stations.  We are doing our utmost to open them again.  I agree there is a necessity for more gardaí, more Army and more of all these people, but to charge the Government with neglecting their duty is highly outrageous and I entirely refute that charge.</P>
    <P>I want to finish on a point that is very material to the Bill, which is designed to appoint a number of extra judges and justices to deal with the serious backlog of cases.  The backlog is not altogether accounted for by the increase in crime.  I have no figures for that increase before me at present but, speaking not only for my own area but for the regions of Monaghan, Cavan and Leitrim, that very sensitive Border area, I note that the recent statistics published by the Garda Commissioner show that there was actually a decrease in crime there.  That could be accounted for by the extra gardaí and Army personnel and so on in these areas.  I am very glad to see that decrease but the reason I mention crime in this respect is to state that this extra volume of work in all the courts is not entirely accounted for by the increase in crime.  There is a huge volume of business, Government regulations and different aspects of legislation affecting more people every day, and the only way we can get redress, appeal against provisions and see that rights are safeguarded and that people discharge their duties is by coming into court.  This is done from the civil point of view.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1095" /> The other main factor in civil legislation in the courts is the running down cases&mdash;we have only to look at the number of extra motor vehicles coming on the roads every day.  I would appeal to the Minister and ask him to appeal to the law reform commission to consider the matter of civil liability in running down cases and see if something could be done to take the great load of this work away from the courts.</P>

      <P>When one can have a case involving say, £2,500 and have a Dublin jury coming in for three days studying maps, looking at engineer's reports and so on there is something to be said for expediting such cases and trying to deal with them in some other way without having to bring in so many people, take up their time and the time of the courts.  I am not minimising the seriousness of a running down case which may have very great effects on the rest of the lives of some of the parties concerned but at the same time I think that a certain load of this work could be taken away from the courts and that this would be of benefit generally.</P>
      <P>Finally, I want to ask the Minister to have another look at the regulations governing jury service.  Speaking not as a lawyer but as a public representative&mdash;because some people have come to me as I am sure they have gone to others also in regard to this matter&mdash;I am talking about women in particular, newly married with small families who are suddenly served with a notice to attend for jury service.  Their obligation of attendance for jury service should be given the widest possible interpretation and judges and all concerned should try to excuse them if they cannot attend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully agree with the measure before the House and sincerely hope <Col N="1096" /> that it will promote smoother administration of justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with some trepidation that I trespass on what might be regarded as the preserves of the legal profession to refer briefly to some points regarding the courts and the administration of the law.  The Bill affords this opportunity.</P>
      <P>First, the Bill would seem to make permanent a number of temporary appointments and to me, it is mainly an effort to copper-fasten the position lest anything might happen towards the end of the year to upset the prospects of permanency of individuals. Otherwise, I do not think the Bill seriously tackles the problem of the backlog of cases awaiting attention in the courts.  Perhaps when the temporary appointments become permanent other temporary appointments will be made to increase the personnel at High Court and District Court level to expedite litigation.</P>
      <P>Some time ago the Department of Justice&mdash;or perhaps it was some newspaper correspondent&mdash;gave a breakdown of the hours worked by members of the Judiciary and I thought they looked appallingly skimpy in the face of what is regarded as normal for other professions.</P>
      <P>Could the hours recorded by the Judiciary and their long holidays be adjusted upwards or downwards as the case may be to ensure that more time is spent dealing with cases?</P>
      <P>There is another matter with regard to the District Courts in rural Ireland to which I have referred previously. The rumour still persists that the present Garda Commissioner insists that every member of the force must have a specific number of prosecutions every year.  That negatives what is meant by the proper administration of the law.  We are living in a time when proper relations between the police force and the public are more essential than ever before.  Good relations will not be fostered by persecuting people by bringing prosecutions because they are required by the top brass in the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy, but I do not see the <Col N="1097" /> connection of the Deputy's remarks with the Bill, and I want to put on record again that there is no substance whatsoever in that charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be the first to admit that the Minister has said that on a number of occasions.  However the fact remains that the rumour persists and members of the force have told me&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would believe me and not repeat this rumour, it might begin to die.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a factual statement that the feeling is still abroad, and nothing has been done to counter it, that the members of the force are frowned upon if they do not produce a certain number of prosecutions. I am putting down a question to the Minister about the number of fines and the amount of money collected in fines over the last few years.  That might help to dispel the feeling that exists about this matter or it might confirm it.  From my examination of the day to day situation in the courts there seems to be some evidence for that accusation.  As the Minister said, I hope it is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proper administration of the law is to be found in prevention.  Prevention means many things.  For our youth, a healthy mind and body is a basic requirement for proper behaviour. They should have respect for the law.  The GAA have done more to reduce crime and breaches of the law than any other body or person.  Our youth have not been given the facilities necessary for their physical and mental development.  The smoky nightclub and disco are poor substitutes for the sports arena, whether it be the playing field, the boxing ring or the swimming pool.  If our young people are interested in sports they <Col N="1098" /> will not have time to get involved in crime or to develop a twisted outlook. To tackle this problem from the preventive side means providing gymnasia in our schools, which is not being done at the present time for economic reasons, and to provide social centres where there will be libraries and sports facilities.  These fundamentals are necessary to prevent crime and to develop the minds and bodies of our citizens of tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is not conducive to a healthy society.  Unless we tackle these problems our courts will be chock-a-block with people who have been prosecuted for breaking the law.</P>
    <P>There are many things which contribute to respect for the law.  The most important is that the public should have confidence and respect for the independence and integrity of our Judiciary.  I remember debates in this House on the Estimate for the Department of Justice when we were accused by the then Opposition of political appointments to the Judiciary. These self-righteous people said we should be guided by the highest motives when making appointments to the most important institution of the State, our Judiciary.  Have this Government followed what they then advocated?  All our appointments were based on the ability and suitability of the person to discharge his important duties, either at the level of district justice or in the higher courts.</P>
    <P>Nothing contributes more to respect for the law than that the public have confidence in the independence and integrity of the Judiciary.  The Government have not practised what they preached when we were in power.  In the issue of <i>Hibernia</i> of 30th January, 1976, in the course of an article under the heading &ldquo;Jobs For The Boys,&rdquo; a list of the appointments made by the Government is given.  To my mind they were disgustingly political.  Without one single exception the appointments made were of prospective candidates for Fine Gael or the Labour Party, defeated candidates or people who were at one time TDs.  It is on record that one man was appointed one day after he was defeated in a by-election; he had made an excellent <Col N="1099" /> contribution to having his colleague elected.</P>
    <P>He is a poor man and a bad citizen who has not his political outlook and affiliations and that is what it is all about here, but I do not think the sole qualification for appointment to the Judiciary at a time when we have a serious situation in regard to lawlessness should be that the person in question was a political hack.  That article gives a list of appointments from the highest level to the lowest. The serious view which the public must take of such appointments is not relieved by the fact that one district justice when dealing with his first case imposed a fine on a Member of this House that was far above anything justifiable or in any way related to the offence.  It was blatant political victimisation and vindictiveness.  This is the type of thing that springs from over zeal to have political friends appointed to the Judiciary.  It is not good enough.  Looking at this list I see that every person appointed was either a Fine Gael candidate, an aspiring candidate, a Fine Gael county councillor or secretary of a constituency executive.  I do not think we can expect the high respect which our legal institutions demand while we have that sort of thing going on.  I do not want to name the people concerned but 18 appointments were made in a short period.</P>
    <P>One of those appointed was defeated in the general election while another went before a local convention and another was a constituency secretary.  They had the qualifications which are appended to every individual in relation to appointments made over the last four years.  The appointments were made by people who frequently accused us here of making political appointments and advocated support in the election to do away with jobbery.  I should like to hear any Member on the Government side defend their attitude in that respect bearing in mind the attacks they made on us when we made appointments. We were not solely concerned with a man's political background.  In fact, we frequently appointed Fine Gael supporters.  I am not apologising for <Col N="1100" /> that because they were good men and turned out good.  Irrespective of political affiliations, we ensured that those appointed would administer the law fairly, would be above suspicion and command public confidence.  That can be said of all our appointments.</P>
    <P>The fundamental matters which contribute to respect for the law are the things we must tackle rather than recruiting thousands of gardaí and hundreds of members of the Judiciary to deal with a community that is now experiencing a period of decadence, a society that has gone into lawlessness due to lack of proper facilities to develop and concentrate on the higher things in life.  I should like to see more money spent on the things which occupy young people in the pursuit of their proper development.  We should not be miserly in our approach to this all-important duty of any Government and that applies to the position in relation to employment as much as to the provision of facilities for sport and the mental and physical development of our youth.  Plans were withdrawn for local amenities and school buildings are being contained by the cutting out of gym rooms.  This is the wrong approach.  In my view we would not be appointing additional members to administer the law if we tackled instead the root cause of lawlessness. If the Minister is seriously concerned about killing the rumour that our police force are literally compelled to have prosecutions he will instruct the Commissioner to have them go in for prevention rather than prosecution.  I do not see what is wrong with a garda sergeant telling a local motorist that his tyres are too smooth.</P>

    <Col N="1101" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is going to condone that approach, we are not moving in the right direction. The Minister is not properly informed as to what really happens.  The minor offences with which the district courts are crowded lead up to an alienation of the local people and the decent members of the force.  I am not saying people should be allowed to break the law but there is such a thing as creating a resistance which leads to a multiplicity rather than an easing of crime. The present state of crime here has reached an all-time high.  Perhaps for the first time in our history&mdash;Deputy O'Kennedy was perfectly right&mdash;people are afraid in their houses at night. Children and teenagers are not safe going out alone, even in numbers, unless accompanied by adults.  It is quite a serious situation and we do not seem to really comprehend its seriousness in relation to crime and potential crime.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Toal when he spoke of the many cases going to court that should not go at all but could be dealt with otherwise.  If the Labour Court can have rights commissioners I do not see why the ordinary courts could not have some such commissioners also which would obviate neighbours spending money unnecessarily about rights-of-ways, roads, fences and stupid things which could be settled out of court.  I would go so far as to say that two-thirds of the cases, both criminal and civil going to court need not.  We should endeavour to move in that direction rather than that of sneaking up behind, waiting to get somebody.  That is the simplest thing in the world to do.  Prevention is much more difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to allow the lawyers their field day on this Bill.  But unless we can convince the public that we are not merely interested in jobs for the boys, we are not doing much to enhance the reputation of our judiciary and courts.  To revert to that list I was going to read but which, in fairness, I think I should not, which anyway goes only to January, 1976 and, in this respect, I should like the Minister to mention the appointments since then&mdash;one will find that those appointments fall into the same mould and qualification. While we do that, expecting the community <Col N="1102" /> to have respect for the independence and integrity in our courts, perhaps we are presuming too much.</P>
    <P>To date our courts have functioned reasonably well, with the exception of the occasional, blatant type of case I have mentioned in relation to a Member of this House brought up for a trivial offence, the fine being out of all proportion to the offence involved.  If we want the courts to enhance the reputation they should have as an important State institution, we must have regard to some basic things which could very easily undermine our people's confidence, some basic matters which would help in obviating crime rather than merely concentrating on capturing people when they have been dragged into the net from which they cannot easily extricate themselves.</P>
    <P>The Bill does little other than make permanent some temporary appointments. Something much more practical will have to be done if the bringing of cases before the courts is to be expedited, if the question of civil cases waiting for years is not to become a complete mockery.  Anybody setting out at present to recover debts will know the cumbersome machinery involved. In the end such people come to the conclusion that they are sorry they ever bothered.  That is the type of thing requiring something more than just jobs for the boys.  We should now pay serious attention to that aspect and regain the confidence people must have in our judiciary and courts, ensuring that we do nothing to destroy that confidence.  That is something of which we have been proud in the past.  The same applies to our Garda.  From the old days of the troubles our people were not noted for their respect for the police force.  It took several years for our police force to attain the high reputation they now enjoy.  It took many years for our people to realise that this was our own force for our own protection, built up by ourselves, paid for by ourselves, and of a very high standard.  To erode that confidence in or respect for that force or for the judiciary now would constitute a serious retrograde step.  However much the Government may feel the haste to do certain things now they should not be over-zealous in providing for their <Col N="1103" /> friends.  There are other people around, too, with ability who should be considered when it comes to making important appointments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to go down the byways introduced by Deputy Brennan at the behest of the Fianna Fáil think tank.  I noticed that he was briefed with an article in a journal, and that was the Fianna Fáil think tank contribution to the debate and I do not think very much of it.  I, therefore, do not intend to pursue that line.</P>
      <P>As Deputies know, I have been a practising member of the Bar for more than 20 years and one thing that has struck me forcibly in that period has been the attitude of mind to our courts of law.  When one looks back on history, all judicial appointments were made by a foreign power.  The administration of the police force came under the auspices of a foreign power.  That left a rather indelible impression on the minds of the Irish public.  It was an attitude of mind that was antipolice force, anti-judiciary, anti-courts of law.</P>
      <P>I think we have got out of that. We have come to our majority in the sense of thinking on these matters, but it is important that every citizen in the State, no matter where he comes in the ranks of society, should have respect for our legal system, our judicial system, and this means not alone respect for judges and the decisions that they hand out but respect for the entire legal procedure that leads up to the decisions of any of our courts of law.  This means that the legal profession have to be careful of themselves to see that they comport themselves correctly and act efficiently and in the best interests not only of their clients but of the fair administration of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may not be appreciated by many people that any lawyer appearing before a court of law not alone has to have the interests of his client at heart in real terms but also a sense of respect and responsibility for the court or tribunal before which he appears.  I think that the record of the Irish legal profession has been good in that respect.  I appreciate that there <Col N="1104" /> have been incidents in history when lawyers have not always come out with honour.  There have been very severe pressures on lawyers.  I do not think there is any practising lawyer here who has not had pressures brought to bear on him at one time or another in his career.  They could be pressures that would be utterly antagonistic to the fair administration of justice and the fair care of clients' interests.  When a lawyer gets a case, he cannot just always accept at its face value what has been stated to him.  He has to use his intelligence and his experience and knowledge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am a bit surprised at that interruption.  Possibly the Deputy is a bit annoyed that I am speaking before him&mdash;he offered to speak at the same time&mdash;but I should like to point out to him that I have been here for a considerable length of time this morning.  Deputy Briscoe left the House and rushed to get a copy of the Minister's speech to try to find out what the Bill is all about.  He may be a very eager little beaver to get in and have his little say on this matter.  I am dealing with matters that are possibly not apparent to the judgment of people like Deputy Briscoe. It may be interesting to listen to him because he will probably speak with a certain amount of ignorance of the matter, but he is a public representative and he is entitled to have his say in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>As was pointed out by the first Opposition speaker&mdash;of course Deputy Briscoe was not here &mdash;the administration of justice and the work of our judges are very intimately connected with every legal case. Deputy O'Kennedy spent quite a time dealing with the various aspects that the courts of law have to deal with, and I intend to take time to deal with the various matters that lead up to the <Col N="1105" /> outcome of a judicial decision.  It has often been said that justice delayed is justice denied.  That is true, but we are all aware that nobody can get instant justice except, possibly, in an application for <i>habeas corpus,</i> or for an injunction, or summary ejectment. Bar these cases, most cases that come to court take a considerable amount of time to germinate, if I may use the word, to fructify and to be ready for trial.</P>
      <P>Figures were mentioned here earlier about the large number of cases pending before the various courts.  That may be so, but one must bear in mind that many of these cases are not what one would call truly contentious in the full sense of the term.  Many of them are applications for procedural relief, or involve procedures that have to be adopted because the law says so.  I am afraid there has been a tendency in this House when people discuss arrears in the law courts to give undue emphasis to jury actions.  One must bear in mind also that there is a tremendous amount of contentious and non-contentious matter that falls within the non-jury action category.  These mainly deal with family properties, company affairs and chancery actions, and generally speaking such cases are sometimes very time consuming and detailed.</P>
      <P>I have been discussing the situation in regard to these types of law case with my colleagues who have the feeling that in a number of these cases there are what one might call preliminary steps to be taken, what one would be inclined to call miniactions under the umbrella of the main actions.  Judges have been very hard pressed to get through that type of work and there has been the sort of feeling that perhaps we may have been spending too much time on a particular stage of an action.  Nobody should ever be put in that position, be he a judge, or an advocate before the court.  Not alone must justice be done, but it must also be seen to be done, and must be felt to be done to everybody who participates in an action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite right, as the Minister pointed out in his introductory statement, that there has been a considerable <Col N="1106" /> increase in litigation, and that it is anticipated litigation will continue in an upward direction.  This increase in litigation has been brought about largely by the fact that new legislation dealing with family law matters has been brought before this House and passed in the past four years.  This recent legislation has given people extra reliefs which were not given to them before.  Naturally this has increased the load of work in the law courts.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect which has been commented on from time to time by practicising lawyers more than anybody else as a small matter of note. In boom times in business, generally speaking, there is a drop off in litigation, but when things get harder and more difficult there is an increase in litigation.  This can be seen on an area basis in the Circuit Court.  I am making a comparison between different rural areas and rural counties.  Historically in certain areas there is a great deal more litigation than there is in other areas.  In the better off counties there is less contentious litigation than in the poorer areas.</P>
    <P>There may be various reasons for that, but it is an interesting fact.  It has been apparent for a long number of years.  The present increase in litigation may have been due in part to the worldwide business recession.  Many people failed to complete their contracts or adopted a negative attitude to a business deal and the other party had to pursue them in a court of law to make them come up to the mark and complete the deal.  This is a fairly well-known fact.  The courts of law have often been used as a delaying tactic to give a person time to collect his assets and his money so that he could complete a deal.</P>
    <P>The question about the lack of gardaí was raised and there was a certain amount of worry in the public mind.  Deputy Brennan said more should be done for youth.  It would be interesting for this House to hear I took part in a seminar in my constituency dealing with youth.  Basically, the discussion was on youths' involvement in crime.  A very good cross-section of people took part. Members of the Garda were involved <Col N="1107" /> in the discussion, not in their official capacity, but purely in their personal private capacity as people very interested in youth work and deeply involved in it over the years.</P>
    <P>It seemed to me that the consensus at that seminar was that it was not a question of how many garda were on the beat or how many garda were not on the beat, but that the real problem arose at domestic level.  It has been stated before by people far more prominent than myself in public life, and it has been said with some truth over the years, that the trouble starts in the cradle.  Instead of complaining about the lack of gardaí, the parents might well examine their own home circumstances, and examine themselves to see what they are doing for their children.  In the past when acting for youthful criminals my experience has been that basically the trouble has arisen at home.  Children may get into bad company.  A lot of that could be avoided and ameliorated if the parents assessed their responsibilities properly and lived up to them.  When appearing as a lawyer for youthful offenders it is sometimes tragic to see the parents take no interest whatever in their welfare.  They are not interested in the court case which may be dealing with the liberty of their child.</P>
    <P>These are factors the courts have to deal with.  Sometimes the courts are ill-equipped to deal with them.  This might be another reason for the increase in the number of cases before the courts.  In such circumstances, judges try their very best to avoid having to send a young person away. They try to speak to them.  They try to convey a message to them.  They try to get them to pull themselves together and get themselves out of trouble and go straight.  Cases are adjourned.  Any of us who have had anything to do with the courts appreciate that cases come up again and again.  They are under review and they are kept that way until the delinquent gets himself or herself on the right road, and then the case is dealt with under the Probation Act, or struck out or some other procedure is taken &mdash;anything to avoid the stigma of being a criminal on a person.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" /> Deputy O'Kennedy referred to the question of the listing of jury actions in the High Court and to the matter of the 12 cases for the three courts. That is a sensible arrangement.  It has been known to work.  Usually the number of cases put in before the High Court when jury actions are on is dealt with by the registrars.  They have proved themselves to be very capable men in making the decisions as to how many cases should be put in for any particular day.  I should tell the House also that, when this is being done, the lawyers involved in the cases are consulted by the court staff in relation to the length of time a case will take, or whether there is some little discussion going on, as we call it, and there is a likelihood that the case might not be fought.</P>
    <P>I know this gives rise to certain hardship at times because one must always over-compensate so as to see that the courts lists are full.  You do not want judges sitting there doing nothing. Litigants want to get their cases on, and there is always a slight backlog, so you try to get as many cases on and through the courts as you can.  Sometimes this can cause hardship.  People may have travelled from Tipperary or Wexford to the High Court in Dublin and their case is not reached.  They have their witnesses there, and it costs money to have witnesses in court.  One has to put up with that.  This is the system we have.  By and large, it works exceedingly well.  The listing of cases is done very much on a co-operative basis between members of the profession, the staff of the courts, and the judges.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy mentioned consistency of sentences at District Court level.  As I understand it there is a system of consultation among the members of the District Court bench in relation to the work of those courts.  I do not know how far that system of consultation goes in relation to sentences. There is a difficulty here.  The same crime may be committed by two people in different areas of the country. One person could be a criminal charged with that offence for the third time and the other person could be in court for the first time.  There might be a reason why the person charged for the first <Col N="1109" /> time had committed that particular offence.  There is a lot of evidence that does not appear in the media when the report is published of a certain sentence having been imposed.  There are particular circumstances in relation to every case and every human being is different.</P>
    <P>In relation to crimes of trespass, to use a generic term, that is, assault on the person, interference with personal property, breaking into houses and threatening people, there is a view abroad that the sentences meted out by the District Court are far too light, do not match up to the severity of the crime and that sentences are no longer a deterrent to people who might consider taking up the same risky course of crime.  This has become a matter of some concern.  I am aware that there was a certain type of crime being committed in this city.  A new judge was appointed and he went up to deal with the criminal list and gave out far heavier sentences than had been meted out before to a certain set of criminals. The crime was the bashing of night filling station attendants and a couple of men were beaten up every night. When this case was dealt with a sentence of something like seven years was meted out and that was the end of it.  There was no more coshing of night filling station attendants.  It had a deterrent effect, which meant that the courts were prepared to get down to work and clear up this type of crime.</P>
    <P>When all is said and done, when dealing with crime the only organ in the State that can prevent further crime and show that crime is not worth it is the court of law.  I think certain members of the bench should bear this in mind because there seems to be a tendency for the motorist to be victimised while other criminals are having a light time of it when they come up before the courts.  I think it is right that I should say this in this House because it is being said repeatedly abroad.  It is well to say it at this stage.  I hope the statement will be noted, because the situation is becoming a matter of worry to the public and a source of serious disenchantment to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>We must remember that when a person commits a crime he is not <Col N="1110" /> always seen committing the crime.  The evidence has to be collected and the criminal must be tracked down.  It must be very frustrating for the gardaí investigating serious crimes of violence when, having tracked down the criminal, they find that he gets a very light sentence.  This should be borne in mind by the Judiciary.  The time of training for a member of the Garda Síochána is comparatively short.  A large part of his training is picked up by experience in the field and through working with his colleagues.  Whilst he can collect the facts he also has the very difficult function of translating those facts into a legal formula known as acceptable legal evidence before a court of law.  In other words he has two jobs to do.  He is not given any particular or extended training in regard to the latter.  Very often there has been an undue strictness by some courts in relation to proof of crime and there is a failure to hand out penalties that bear a better relation to the crime that has been committed.</P>
    <P>This brings us to the most serious matter of all, and that is the confidence in the Judiciary.  If these matters are not seen to be right or acceptable to members of the public, then there will be a lack of confidence in the Judiciary.  I have noted a slight hardening of attidude on the part of the Judiciary in the giving of sentences in recent times, but some members of the bench have a long way to go in regard to serious crimes of violence.  That is my contribution to this debate.  I am very much in support of this Bill; it is badly required.  I think more judges may be required but it is better to hasten slowly than to overdo it.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the last speaker, all I can say is that he is out of touch with reality, the reality which meets the people in the streets of our cities and towns.  It pains me to listen to him because I know that if the people I was speaking to only the other night, the people who have these problems of vandalism, were to listen to him they would throw up their hands and give up the ghost altogether.  We have reached the stage of the demoralisation of the people of this country and I can speak from <Col N="1111" /> first-hand knowledge of my own constituency. Unless something happens very quickly we will witness within a very short time the complete overthrow of all the institutions which we regard so dearly.  That is not alarmist talk.  I welcome this Bill.  It does not go far enough, but I will pursue these points later on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the intention to provide gymnasium facilities in this school.  The situation is that such facilities cannot be provided immediately on the completion of the school.  It was felt more judicious to go ahead and build the basic facilities, such as classrooms and improved teaching facilities for academic and practical subjects, and defer the provision of sports facilities to a later date when finances will be available.  The policy adopted in the recent past has been to concentrate resources exclusively on the provision of basic educational facilities and, in the light of the present situation in regard to the availability of capital, that is the correct decision.</P>

In Cabinteely these classrooms <Col N="1116" /> will be a definite improvement on what exists there at the moment and it is the intention to provide gymnasium facilities later when money is available.

      <P>In regard to the provision of assistance to youth clubs in County Dublin and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, I would refer the Deputy to my statement in the House on 25th November last.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary pursue this matter of joint meetings of the three educational authorities concerned?  The Parliamentary Secretary is aware that there is a statutory instrument available for him to dispose of moneys which I understand are available for the County Dublin areas and Dún Laoghaire in particular.  I refer the Parliamentary Secretary to section 5 of Statutory Instrument 328 of 1975 which sets out very clearly the maintenance of new training centres of the Dublin city vocational education area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to impart the information first and having done that I want to pick up a question.  The question is: can the Parliamentary Secretary, as a matter of urgency, give the moneys so badly needed by this youth club?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal first with the information which the Deputy has imparted.  The authorisation to spend money outside the Dublin city area was specifically predicated and if he looks closely at the terms of that statutory instrument he will find that this is a case of an agreement between <Col N="1121" /> the vocational education committees of Dublin City, Dublin County and the Dún Laoghaire area.  At the time that instrument contained this phrase in relation to this extension no such agreement existed.  It was with a view to securing such an agreement, subject to certain conditions, that I suggested in the Dáil here on the 25th November last that a meeting might be set up between the three vocational education committees.  In the case of Dún Laoghaire, the area in which the Deputy is interested, the Borough of Dún Laoghaire Vocational Education Committee have indicated in a letter of the 11th January last that they are prepared to take part in such a meeting on the lines suggested. However, there are two other parties involved and their agreement to the meeting has not yet been forthcoming.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary may be unaware that already the board of management have been obliged to place a salaried youth officer on protective notice, the protective notice to fall in with the 30th June next.  Therefore this is an urgent and serious matter. Would the Parliamentary Secretary make a number of efforts to bring these three groups together?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Since many Irish manufacturers of men's shoes supply retail outlets throughout Dublin city I do not think that prospective purchasers should have any great difficulty in obtaining Irish-made men's shoes.  To assist consumers in locating those shops which stock Irish merchandise, including footwear, the Irish Goods Council has set up a &ldquo;shoplink&rdquo; shopping information service within the Dublin Tourism Organisation.  There are regrettably some shops in the area which tend to stock little or no Irish-made footwear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Parliamentary Secretary doing about the situation, first of all to reduce unemployment in the footwear trade and also to bring home to the people the need to buy Irish-made footwear?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has done a great deal about this subject.  He was responsible, in conjunction with the various agencies, for the establishment of the Guaranteed Irish scheme and for the programme mounted by the Irish Goods Council which includes this &ldquo;shoplink&rdquo; service which enables people who want Irish-made goods to get in touch with a body who will be able to tell them where they can get them.  I agree with the Deputy that there are still some retailers who do not stock Irish-made shoes on the scale that they should, but a recent survey carried out by the Irish Goods Council indicates that the measures taken by the Minister and the various agencies under his aegis are already yielding <Col N="1124" /> very substantial and significant results. In a survey carried out by the Irish Goods Council 74 per cent of respondents purchased more Irish footwear in 1976 than in 1975, with an average increase of 18.5 per cent in the purchase of Irish-made shoes by retailers surveyed by the Irish Goods Council.  This indicates that the retailers are improving in their performance, and that in the same period the purchase by consumers of Irish goods went up by 14 per cent.  The Deputy may also be aware of recent press reports from certain shoe industries which indicate that their improved performance is attributed by them voluntarily to the success of the Guaranteed Irish scheme and the improved purchase of Irish shoes in the Irish market as a result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will initiate a careful examination of the profit structure of insurance companies with a view to ascertaining if some of the profit in the companies' overall business could be diverted to ameliorating motor insurance premiums especially those of young drivers starting in their first job who are at present penalised because they are under 20 years of age although they are prime targets for selling campaigns for life assurance policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably true that there has been a certain amount of subsidisation of motor insurance, which has incurred heavy losses in recent years, by other and more profitable classes of insurance, but I would not regard it as desirable that such a position should continue indefinitely.  There is no reason why any class of driver should be subsidised by others&mdash;for instance, by home owners insuring against fire.  I might point out in any event that the great majority of young drivers are insured with a company which up to recently did motor business only and so has not other resources from which its motor business or any part of it could be supported from outside the motor area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> I am concerned at the high level of premiums that young drivers are now being charged.  At present the Motor Premiums Advisory Committee are conducting a statistical exercise to establish the appropriateness of the levels of loading including the loading on young drivers.  I have also just received from the Examiner of Restrictive Practices a report for which I had asked him on competition in the motor insurances market, and I am having it examined urgently.  My intention is that full and open competition should return to the motor market and it may be that very high premiums for young drivers can be avoided by a better rating structure. The companies are well aware of my intentions in this matter.</P>
    <P>In case there is any misunderstanding, in view of the reference to life assurance, I would inform the Deputy that in this country non-life insurance companies cannot be licensed to undertake life assurance business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he has any proposals to amend section 51 of the Insurance Act, 1936, so as to restrict the amount of premiums payable to the level of benefit which may be recovered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had no proposal, from the Committee on Insurance or otherwise, for a change in the law in the sense indicated by the Deputy.  He will appreciate that cases where the total of premiums paid exceeds the benefit due under a policy must be balanced against cases when the total of premiums falls far short of the benefit due.  I understand that, in the more extreme cases where payments exceed benefits due, insurance companies may be prepared to make some <i>ex-gratia</i> concession.  If the Deputy has a particular case of this kind in mind and would care to communicate the details to me I should be glad to have it taken up with the company concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary recognise that in the calculation <Col N="1129" /> of premiums the kind of case to which he referred is taken into account, in other words the case in which an insurance company receives only a relatively small amount of premiums and pays out the full amount assured? The Parliamentary Secretary referred to that example of where the insurance companies could lose out.  That type of case is taken into account in the actuarial calculations of insurance companies.  What is involved here is a situation in which parents of young children may go on paying premiums for many years but be restricted by law to a very small amount that could be recovered.  Is it not wrong that people should be obliged to pay premiums when there is no way in which they can increase the amount of benefit available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first part of the Deputy's question, the answer is yes.  The Deputy will appreciate that if the practice referred to in the second part of his question were to cease the overall level of premiums would have to be increased, because a potential source of income to the insurance companies to make up the balance in their actuarial calculations would have been removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there is a whole range of different policies involved and it would be a very difficult statistical exercise to get the information referred to.  I am not certain that it would be a desirable end to achieve in any event, because it is a well accepted principle of insurance that, for instance, if one has accident insurance and does not have an accident, one never benefits from the contributions made.  It is of the essence of insurance that one will find in some cases, in respect of some policies, that one will get little or no benefit from the policy by comparison with what one pays in, and that that, by the principle of mutuality, enables <Col N="1130" /> the company to pay benefits to people who make small contributions simply because all are covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not accept that there is a very clear distinction between a case in which one insures against accident which may never occur and a case in which one is insuring on a life?  Is it not the case that at the point at which a child reaches a certain age there is an upper limit on what may be paid by the insurance company but that premiums must continue being paid?  The distinction is that in one case a certain point is reached and there is certainty at that point while in the case of accident one is insuring against unknown risk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the National Prices Commission's membership is already broadly based, taking directly into account the interests of consumers, I do not consider that consultation on price increase proposals with persons or organisations outside of the National Prices Commission is necessary.  In any case, adoption of the Deputy's suggestion would require the disclosure of confidential information in relation to persons and firms applying for price increases.  Such disclosure would be contrary to the provision of section 25 of the Prices Act, 1958, which precludes the disclosure of any information obtained by virtue of the powers conferred by the Prices Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be confusing this with two other initiatives, one of which was the setting up of price line offices at which people could make complaints about overcharging.  That initiative was adopted and put into operation.  There was a suggestion also, not by the Minister but by the commission, that local price committees be established.  An attempt was made to do this in one provincial town but as it was not successful I gather it has not been pursued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce why price increases sanctioned following recommendations by the National <Col N="1132" /> Prices Commission are announced only on RTE; and if he will henceforth cause appropriate advertisements for the information of the public to be inserted in the national and provincial Press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Copies of all Press statements or price increases are issued to the national and provincial newspapers and normally receive wide coverage.  I do not, accordingly, accept the Deputy's suggestion that price increases are announced only on RTE.  It is of course, a matter for the media to decide what emphasis they wish to give to Press statements relating to price increases.</P>
      <P>In their January, 1975 report, the National Prices Commission recommended that the practice of advertising, in the national newspapers on the date of publication of each NPC monthly report, the list of authorised price increases referred to in that report should be discontinued.  The reasons for this recommendation are set out in detail in the report mentioned. Copies of the report are available in the Oireachtas Library and were circulated to each Deputy at the time of publication.  The main reasons for the recommendation were as follows:</P>
      <P>(i)  Since price increases by firms, which had been wholly or partially exempted from price control, were not included in the list of price increases published in the advertisement, the list was no longer comprehensive.</P>
      <P>(ii)  Almost all of the price increases would have already been implemented before the date on which the relevant monthly report and the Press advertisement were published.  Thus the list of price increases that appeared in the Press advertisement was more likely to confuse than inform the consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accepted the commission's recommendation. Since the circumstances under which the commission made their recommendation have not changed, I do not consider that the publication, by way of advertisements, of price increases authorised would <Col N="1133" /> be of any more benefit to the consumer at the present time.</P>
    <P>Full details of all price increases recommended by the National Prices Commission continue to be published in their monthly reports.  Copies of each report and a Press statement in relation to the report, are sent to all newspapers, national and provincial, and to RTE.  The Press statement indicates whether I have accepted all of the commission's recommendations for price increases.  An advertisement relating to the publication of the report is also inserted in the national newspapers.</P>
    <P>When price increases are authorised for goods subject to maximum retail price orders, a separate Press statement is issued to the media and an advertisement giving details of the new maximum retail prices is inserted in the national newspapers.  Similarly, in the case of other important commodities, a separate Press statement may be issued at the time of the increase in prices.</P>

      <P>I do not think these advertisements were of any real value to the consumer.  Much better use of the resources in regard to prices is now being made.  In 1975 the commission reported that the cost of these advertisements was in the order of £30,000.  As they recommended, this money can be put to much better use in other ways and one of the ways in which it is being used is in respect of the price line service whereby people who consider that they are overcharged in respect of any item can telephone their complaints in this regard and, in that way, effect redress. The publication of a long list of commodities of which only a small number might be of interest to an individual is not a useful exercise.</P>

      <P>The commission are an advisory body and are widely representative of various interests including consumer interests.  Their function is to keep under review the prices of commodities and the charges for rendering services and for carrying out work or processes and to advise me in relation to such prices and charges.

      <P>In dealing with applications for price increases the commission are fully aware of the need to restrict increases to the absolute minimum.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wishes to pose a question in relation to a particular price increase such as cement he may put down a separate question but every price increase is carefully scrutinised by the National Prices Commission and it is worth noting the procedures which must be gone through before a price increase is granted.  The application must give details to the Prices Division and to the Prices Commission who are an independent body, fully documented in relation to increases in overheads and materials and material costs.  These must be specifically documented.  Their wage cost increases, if these are being used to claim increased prices must also be within the terms of the national pay agreement.  It is only after these have been carefully scrutinised and passed as correct by the National Prices Commission and a recommendation made that a decision is made by the Minister to grant an increase.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been drawn to the statement from the National Prices Commission that a high percentage of lower income elderly people in Dublin city have a nutritionally inadequate diet; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the report in question.  Perhaps the most important thing to emerge from that report is that because of unwise shopping choices many people over 65 are spending more on diets which are nutritionally inadequate than on alternative diets which would be nutritionally adequate.  However, we cannot compel people to depart from their personal preferences in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it hard to accept that as a responsible answer.  He blames these people who are almost starving for the fact that they do not shop properly.  The position is that they cannot afford to do so.  This is the message coming from the National Prices Commission and I am asking what are the Government doing about <Col N="1140" /> it.  Does somebody have to die to bring home to the Government their responsibility in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Moore has fully understood or perhaps even read the report in question.  It indicates that for people in the category over 65 both male and female, an adequate diet as determined by nutrition experts would cost less than the typical diet which they are buying. For instance, the cost of a day's food for a woman over 65 years of age, as an adequate diet as nutritionally approved, would be 62p as against a range of amounts between 77p and 66p paid for an inadequate diet.  Similar relativities, only slightly narrower, apply in the case of males over the age of 65 years.</P>
      <P>I agree this is a cause for concern. I agree, obviously, that increases in prices hit hard people in this category particularly.  Apart from the other measures which have been adopted, it would be useful if the Health Education Bureau and the National Social Service Council were to see what measures they could adopt to promulgate the findings of this report, and see what can be done to improve the situation of the people in question.  To that end, I have asked that the findings of this report be specifically drawn to the attention of those two bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary go to his Minister and ask him to try to arrange the finances of the country to ensure that these pensioners, whose recent increases have been eroded by the spiralling cost of living, are brought to a realistic standard?  The heading of the article is &ldquo;The elderly poor are starving&rdquo;.  They are not my words.  They appear in the newspaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree this is a matter of concern.  Quite apart from the increases in the various social welfare payments which have been made, the Government have sought, by their policy of subsidisation of particular prices and, in some cases, at the cost <Col N="1141" /> of extra prices for other less essential commodities, to bring down the price of essentials such as food which figure relatively larger in the weekly expenditure of old age pensioners than they do in the weekly expenditure of more prosperous sections of the community. In effect, as a result of this policy of subsidisation and the removal of value-added tax from certain commodities, there has been a shift of the burden of inflation away from people such as old age pensioners and those covered in this report.</P>

      <P>I was about to quote a line from a musical show&mdash;here's to a record wave of crime.  That is what we have here today.  I know this to be true.  An associate of mine told me the other day an American visitor told him he would prefer to walk through Central Park in New York than through O'Connell Street at night.  That gives some indication of how serious the position is with regard to law and order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> Deputy Toal was critical of Press reporting of court proceedings.  It is only fair to say that from the reporters' point of view not all counsel are clear and the facilities for Press reporting are wholly inadequate.  If people feel there should be better coverage of court proceedings the Minister must ensure when new courts are being built or courts are being renovated that there are proper Press facilities.</P>
    <P>I have always considered that the primary obligation of any Government is to protect citizens in their homes or on the streets.  Unfortunately, this is not happening here and I am not exaggerating when I say that. At every opportunity I have been advocating the setting up of night courts to deal with motoring offences because many such offences take up a great deal of valuable court time and they could easily be dealt with at night.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be called cúirt an mheán oíche?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It could.  I also believe that night courts should be set up to deal with young vandals.  I would be very happy to introduce the Parliamentary Secretary to constituents who have caught vandals red-handed, held them until the gardaí arrived, saw them taken away in squad cars and two hours later they were back on the streets because the gardaí do not have the power of detention: they cannot detain them overnight. That is why I urge the Minister to introduce night courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If necessary, the Minister should create temporary district justices to deal with these vandals when they are caught red-handed.  As the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary are aware, bail cannot be refused.  This means that these young people are released on bail and cannot be detained because of the Supreme Court decision of 1966 which stated that you cannot assume somebody is going out to commit another crime.  We all know that when many of these people are out on bail they commit further crimes and that when they eventually come before <Col N="1145" /> the court again they are sentenced for the crimes subsequently committed, the sentences to run concurrently.  In my view it is very important that the Minister ask the Supreme Court to have another look at the 1966 decision as soon as possible to see if it can be reversed.</P>
    <P>When a person signs a bail bond he does not have to pay the money&mdash;the average bail is about £40.  If the defendant does not show up in court, the bailsman will then have to pay and forfeit the £40.  If he had to put his hand in his pocket immediately the court sets the bail, he might think twice about it.  I realise the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is about to tell me I am straying from the Bill but I ask him not to do so because this is very important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">

      <P>It is important to keep to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I understand that judges can impose legal sanctions against parents of young people who get into trouble.  It has happened that when young people were found guilty of committing crimes the parents have been made to pay. In the Criminal Justice Bill which we were about to introduce and which died with the last Dáil, one of the changes we proposed was that certain penalties would be imposed on people who committed acts of vandalism.  It was suggested that the money should be deducted from their social welfare cheques, or at source from their salaries to pay for the damage.  At the moment the State is paying for damages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that judges use the powers they already have.  Not many people are aware that the birch is still on the Statute Book.  Judges stopped sentencing people to birching because of the outcry by the public and the media.  Lately when speaking to groups I asked people what their feelings were about crimes of violence against the person and whether they were in favour of the birch being used. In one case where there were 200 people present, 60 per cent put up their hands in favour, 30 per cent were against it and 10 per cent were undecided. <Col N="1146" /> At another meeting of 29 people, almost all said they were in favour of the birch being used for those crimes.  I am not trying to make a case for the return of the birch but I am saying that people have lost faith in the implementation of the law.  They see crimes being committed, the culprits being caught and being released soon afterwards.</P>
    <P>When we adjourned at lunchtime in the corridor the Minister said he knew I would talk about the intensive care units and the high security prisons for hardened young criminals which no institution will take.  We may criticise our judges for not sentencing consistent offenders and letting them out on our streets again but what can they do if no institution is available to take them?</P>
    <P>We closed Marlborough House when we were in Government and I believe we were right to do so because it had long served its purpose.  At the moment there is no place of detention for young offenders and we must do something about that.  That is why I urge the Minister to give consideration to night courts.  Talking to those people the other night I told them&mdash; and was interested to know whether they were in agreement with me&mdash;that I considered a bigger issue than prices was law and order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was a group of people from Parnell Road in Harold's Cross we met in the senior citizens' centre in Clogher Road, who had written to me of their concern about vandalism and the breakdown of law and order.  There were also a number of other people from the area, including a member of the clergy, whose house was broken into twice in a period of two weeks, who is satisfied that nothing is being done to help the Garda.  In Sundrive Road Garda station the strength is approximately 40 gardaí.  It works out approximately eight men per shift.  But in fact two of those men are sent down to Green Street court, two more somewhere else. Allowing for weekends, illness and holidays, it averages at approximately <Col N="1147" /> three men for a population of 49,000. There is no protection for those people. I do not want to overdramatise the situation.  I am not; I am stating the position as it is.</P>
      <P>I am amazed that the media have not carried out independent surveys among ordinary people in the various Dublin areas.  Politicians have become suspect among media people as well as perhaps the ordinary man in the street.  Sometimes I say to people &ldquo;Do not call on me to speak about this on the radio or elsewhere because I will be accused of making a political speech about it.  Talk to someone who knows the problems, somebody in authority, a member of the church or somebody else, somebody who is in touch with the people.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>One of the big planks of this Government was law and order.  In its popular interpretation today law and order means protecting the State from subversive organisations.  This is something to which we fully subscribe.  As the Government are well aware, nobody on this side of the House has given any support or succour, as it were, to the present crisis over the hunger strikers.  I am a person who believes in the free will of the individual and, if people of their own free will want to go on hunger strike, that is their affair.</P>

      <P>No, I do not want to get into that.  Some such people who fell into the hands of these people did not have the right of exercise of their free will.  But law and order is a two-way business.  It has to do not merely with subversion by illegal organisations but subversion also from within the community itself.

      <P>What I am saying is that the victims of these people did not have the right to exercise their free will&mdash;the people who were shot, murdered or nearly murdered.  I think we are on the same wavelength as far as that is concerned.  I deplore as much as anybody else in this House&mdash;as has been said already this morning&mdash;attacks on elected public representatives.  But I know that the feeling of the man in the street can be one of &ldquo;Maybe now that person knows how I feel when all the windows of my house are knocked out simply because the law is inadequate in bringing these people to trial.&rdquo; Recently outside a house in Harold's Cross a man caught people throwing a cider bottle through a car.  There was a gang involved.  He went out and gave one of them a bang with a rake.  The guards were called, the people were taken away and a couple of hours later released.  Every window in that man's house was broken that night.  Three nights later&mdash;after he had replaced those windows&mdash;they were broken again.  The police knew who did it. They had the people.  There was nothing they could do because of the inadequacy of our courts system.</P>
      <P>This is what I might describe as a God-given opportunity for me to impress on the Minister that he should go further than the appointments. There has been talk about patronage, about this person and that person.  I want to see courts manned.  I want to see people there who can administer justice.  It has to be administered immediately when these hoodlums and vandals are caught so that our people can have some sense of security.</P>

      <P>I certainly would, yes. In fact I know my party are in favour of it.  Deputy G. Collins said this on a Private Members' motion in November last.  We had hoped&mdash;as I think <Col N="1149" /> had the Minister&mdash;that the Supreme Court might even review the earlier decision to save a referendum.  I hope such will happen because people are demanding that it will.  I know they will certainly support such a referendum if it goes before them.  The courts have the most important function because they are the defenders ultimately of the people's right to liberty and protection. They are appointed; they act independently of us.</P>
      <P>Reference was made this morning to malicious damage claims and to the amount of court time taken up with them.  I was talking recently to the law agent of Dublin Corporation, a very learned gentleman, who told me that for quite a while now they have been seeking power from the Government through legislation to allow minor claims to be settled out of court, that they did not have to go to court, that they could have independent assessors. There is the person who has £200 or £300 worth of damage done to his house&mdash;as happened to one of these gentlemen I should be glad to introduce to the Parliamentary Secretary, a constituent of his&mdash;who may have to wait two, three or even four years before he gets his money back on a malicious damage claim.  By that time, allowing for inflation even at a modest rate of 10 per cent, the compensation is worth far less.  This would be a progressive step that I am certain&mdash; without even conferring with my colleagues&mdash;would have the support of this party.  One of the biggest bones of contention is that of windscreens of cars, row after row being smashed in with owners having to wait two or three years for settlement of their claims.  Such claims should not go before judges or into the courts.  They are minor cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to family courts where family law cases might be heard.  These should be set up.  Deputy Esmonde was against the suggestion of Deputy O'Kennedy that they should do away with the formality of the robes and wigs.  Deputy Esmonde's argument was that in order to retain proper public respect for the courts it is well to have those awe inspiring <Col N="1150" /> ladies and gentlemen appearing in their wigs and robes.  My submission is that there is no need to intimidate people when they come into court.  I have been in courts in the United States where justice is being administered in a most informal way, and expeditiously.  A friend of mine who is a federal court judge in Chicago invited me to his court.  I sat beside him on the bench and heard the mohair suited lawyers addressed by the judge.  He said to them: &ldquo;Bob and John, can you guys not get together and come back in a fortnight?  I will adjourn this case for two weeks to see if you can come to some arrangement.&rdquo;</P>

Occasionally I go to a court here to see what is happening, or I may have an interest in a case, or I may go in as a character witness, and I have noticed this definite barrier.  It does not help to get cases through quickly.  In the Chicago court I saw the same judge saying to the lawyers: &ldquo;You were before me two weeks ago.

      <P>I am afraid the Chair may hold me in contempt, but most of the Bills we have had on this subject have been terribly confining, although of great public interest, and I think there should not be any objection if we stray a little.  I objected a little at the beginning of Deputy Esmonde's speech because I believed that what he was saying was more appropriate to UCD or Trinity College than to this <Col N="1151" /> House.  I am not a lawyer, and at the end of the debate it will be interesting to count the number of lawyers and laymen who have spoken.  It is no harm for lawyers to hear what laymen think about them and what the public at large feel about the law.  If a priest has the collar on a person will not talk to him as freely as if he were in mufti.</P>

      <P>No doubt he will be on the bench as a judge wearing a very stern expression one of these days. People have begun to regard the legal profession as a private enterprise business more interested in the technicalities of the law than in dispensing justice.  For instance, if a statement had been taken before 4 p.m. rather than after it, even though the person had pleaded guilty he might get off on a technicality.  That is not justice and it diminishes respect for the law. If the Parliamentary Secretary would accompany me in my constituency I could introduce him to people who would tell him their feelings in this regard.  In Britain the House of Lords is the final appeal court but here there is no such appeal lying with the Seanad.  Judges are independent of the public and perhaps it is important to preserve division between the Judiciary and the Executive so long as justice is seen to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think this Bill goes sufficiently far in an effort to deal with the inadequacy of the number of judges and justices.  It is necessary to have increased numbers to deal with the current crime rate.  It is also necessary to make buildings available and if necessary to turn existing buildings into courtrooms.  With all sincerity I ask the Government without delay to look into the suggestion to establish <Col N="1152" /> night courts in which district justices could take cases.  I also appeal for the establishment of centres in which to keep people appearing before the courts.  To use a horrid cliché, people are very uptight and feeling is very high in regard to these matters.  If a number of temporary bench appointments can be made the Government should make them quickly.</P>
    <P>The gardaí are very restricted in regard to what they can say&mdash;quite rightly there is a very strict discipline on them.  These men are at bursting point because they are on the receiving end of the abuse.  Their job is becoming intolerable.  Whenever I get the opportunity I endeavour to get an officer of the Garda Síochána to meet members of the public and point out to the people that the gardaí want to help them, that they understand their problems and I encourage the people to make citizen arrests.  Another matter which worries people is the book of evidence, which has replaced the old system of the taking of depositions. Those who witness a crime are in terror of giving evidence because the person who is charged can ascertain the address of the informant or the person who intends giving evidence from the book of evidence.  If the informant's name is given it can be dangerous and it would work against the Garda.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan referred to the need for recreational facilities.  A professional youth worker who attended a meeting in my area recently agreed that there was a need for more gardaí and stricter controls and sentencing, but he also felt we should provide recreational facilities.  The Parliamentary Secretary is aware of the problem in our constituency in relation to a gym in the school at Clogher Road.  Because of the lack of money gymnasiums are not included in schools being built and as a result there is no outlet for the natural energy of young people.</P>
    <P>In increasing the number of judges we are getting stricter in the sentencing and imposing greater sanctions on those who commit the crimes but we must balance that at the other end of the scale.  I had a conversation with a garda recently on the responsibility of parents in the homes and he told me <Col N="1153" /> that the signs to watch out for were disobedience to the mother or father or children being cheeky towards old people.  He told me that young people do not turn into vandals overnight. As he spoke shivers went up and down my back because of the amount of time I, like other Members, have to spend with my children.  It is not unusual to hear of a member of a family of a politician in other countries getting into trouble with the law.  That may be due to the lack of control by the father, although in Ireland the women raise the children in an excellent way.  Women in Ireland seem to take over this function, but fathers should play a greater role.  We do not have enough debate on the importance of the role of parents and the importance of knowing where their children are at any time.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Chair's concern.  As long as we have an insufficient number of gardaí our courts will be very busy.  In my view the top priority in the minds of the people of this city is law and order, with prices second and education third. The Government can appoint all the judges they wish but if they do not have the gardaí to back up the people in the first instance they will not succeed.  As a garda on motor cycle patrol passes through an area the young people who see him know that he will not return to that area for at least one hour.  They are aware of the shortage in the number of gardaí. Recently a ten minute interview I gave concerning the situation in <Col N="1154" /> Dublin was broadcast by Radio Éireann but it was condensed to two minutes.  Following the broadcast a fellow councillor, referring to my statement that the Government were burying their heads in the sand in relation to this matter, felt I was exaggerating the problem out of all proportion.  More often than not following an interview on the radio one receives letters from people concerning the topic discussed and on this occasion I received many letters from city people.  I also received many telephone calls.  I asked one caller, who rang within five minutes of the broadcast, to contact the newspapers and acquaint them of his views.  I asked the caller to do that so that we could impress on the Government how fed up the people are with the breakdown in law and order.  Let us back up our Garda and our courts by getting more gardaí.  Let us get the necessary institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended to say something general about the staffing of the courts, particularly arising out of some comments made by Deputy Brennan, but, having listened to my colleague, Deputy Briscoe, I should like to comment on some of the points he made.  I agree with him about the concern of some people in regard to vandalism and petty crime.  The Deputy spoke temperately and did not attach what he had to say to any attack on the Government of a political kind and I accept the spirit in which he made his case.  I accept that there is a good deal of substance in what he has said in regard to public concern in certain areas, but the Deputy will appreciate, of course, that the police force is at its greatest strength since the Civil War by a long shot.  He will appreciate also the reasons why that has to be so.  I am sure the Deputy also appreciates that one cannot overnight expand a police force.  We cannot have half-trained policemen.  The selection process for being a policeman in any decent country is a difficult one and very few of the numbers that apply will have the necessary educational, physical, mental and moral characteristics.  A <Col N="1155" /> prolonged period of training in the technicalities of police work is necessary. In addition, there are organisational difficulties.  One cannot increase the force in a particular area of the city by a couple of dozen men overnight because there is no barrack or office accommodation or living quarters. Within the constraints which lie on us the Government are doing what they can as quickly as they can to meet the serious security situation which has not only a subversive aspect but also an aspect which, perhaps, is not politically subversive but which is far more annoying in ordinary life to the individual citizen.</P>
      <P>I would not wish the Deputy or the House to think the Government are not concerned about the trend which, of course, is not restricted to Ireland but has shown itself all over the western world.  I would not wish anyone to think the Government are not concerned and are not anxious to do their best to halt the trend with the best weapons they can muster.  It is a trend which, oddly enough, criminologists in the utilitarian era predicted would disappear or go into reverse once general affluence arrived.  Something like the contrary seems to have happened.  Affluence, if not general, but more widely spread and better than anything dreamt of 50 years ago, seems to have resulted not in a decrease in organised crime or in petty crime or any other sort of crime but rather in an increase in crime.  The reasons for that are not easy to track.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe Deputy Briscoe has put his finger on one.  He is at one with most criminologists in referring to insufficient parental control, resulting possibly from insufficient parental interest.  That, in turn, is associated with the fact that parents in the 1960s and 1970s are living in a much more complex world, filled with more stresses and more uncertainties than their parents had to face, and many of them take refuge, so far as one can find refuge from such things, in increased social existence and more intense social existence, which means very often more drinking, and they are perhaps less inclined to the modest fireside existence in which family <Col N="1156" /> education was more easily possible and which came naturally to their parents and their grandparents.</P>
    <P>I hope what I am saying will not appear to be in any sense moralising because every Member of this House who is a family man is himself the victim of the stresses and strains and must feel himself to be in a world much more complicated than anything his parents and grandparents had to face.  So far as the Government have responsibility I accept that responsibility and I believe the Minister is doing his best to meet his responsibility. I know things cannot be remedied overnight as, I am sure, Deputy Briscoe understands, but I will convey to the Minister and so will the Minister's officials the general burden of Deputy Briscoe's remarks.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe made several points about the administration of criminal justice.  He appeared to be something of a hardliner&mdash;I do not say that in criticism of him&mdash;in connection with the implementation of the law of custody. He seems to be anxious, by extending court hours into the night or making a justice available at night time, to make it possible to hold persons in custody.  He also mentioned the bail law which he wished to see tightened up either by the Supreme Court reviewing its decision of 1966 or by a referendum which would overrule effectively the Supreme Court decision. Now I respect Deputy Briscoe for taking the hard line.  I am not sure his is quite the best possible case for it, but I respect him for taking it because the world is filled with soft-witted trend setters who grab an easy headline and command instant support from unthinking liberal elements.  Now I regard myself as a liberal but I hope I do not qualify for the other adjectives I have used.  When asked to give their suggestions for dealing with the phenomenon of crime, they say &ldquo;Oh well, let us get at the roots of crime. Let us wipe out the social conditions which create crime.  Let us start at the beginning.&rdquo;  That is quite the emptiest, vapid kind of approach that I know of. It is easy and cheap and worthless.  It is particularly worthless in a public representative.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1157" /> Nobody knows what makes people behave abnormally.  Nobody knows what the roots of crime are.  Nobody knows what makes people behave aggressively in a way which is antisocial and destructive to their neighbours. It is not simply a question&mdash;and everything Deputy Briscoe has said underlines it&mdash;of decent housing conditions, decent living standards, doing away with overcrowding and so on. That is what was thought in the 1890s and early 1900s when Dublin was a festering slum.  It is no longer a festering slum.  There are fine housing estates. I go further than Deputy Briscoe.  Many of the housing estates which suffer from vandalism are being vandalised by their own children, and these are not local authority housing estates.  These are owner-occupied housing estates in suburbs which have what are regarded as desirable addresses.  These estates are being vandalised, as I have frankly said with shame and sorrow at residents' meetings, by their own children. These are not cases where the lunch time trendy groups would say we should get at the roots or that there was a failure to get at the roots of what were conventionally thought to be the roots of crime 50 years ago.  The roots there are something a great deal deeper and possibly they have got something to do with what Deputy Briscoe said in regard to parental control and care &mdash;possibly they have; I am not asserting this because I am just as much in the dark as anybody else&mdash;and possibly the answer is that there is a duty which lies on somebody which that somebody is not accepting.  Of course, that does not accord well with the attitudes of the trendy groups generation. According to them it is not in accord that anybody should be spoken of as neglecting a duty.  The only entity in their world which carries a duty is the State.  Everybody else has rights.  It is the State that has the duties.</P>
    <P>What Deputy Briscoe says is worth accepting as a working assumption. Let us accept it as such rather than assume that when a window is broken, or a child joins a gang, or is recruited by a subversive organisation, it is the dirty old State that is at fault essentially for not providing decent living conditions, for not providing enough <Col N="1158" /> jobs, enough schools and teachers and institutional care of one kind or another.  Let us not always put the blame on the State or on society by and large.  Let us see whether it may be the case that individuals should carry a bit more of the responsibilities they so readily shove off on society as a whole or on the State.</P>
    <P>I found Deputy Briscoe's remarks stimulating and I am inclined to agree with him but I do not agree with what seemed to be his favourable references to the birch.  It sounds pretty horrible but I suppose a case could be made for it if it could be shown that it effected a reformation in the individual punished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say I was advocating the use of the birch.  I was simply stating that in putting the question to people by way of a survey &mdash;I asked what percentage were in favour&mdash;I was getting a play-back as to how people are feeling and people are becoming very extreme.  That is the point I was making.  Unless the State does something to supplement the people the law will get out of control and people will take the law into their own hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true but the Deputy did transit to the House points of view, the strength of which he thought impressive, held by Dublin people at meetings which he attended where the people were heavily in favour of the idea that corporal punishment was the appropriate way to deal with vandalism.</P>

      <P>I am not a criminologist except in a very amateur way, but I know that criminologists, although not unanimous about very many things, are unanimous that corporal punishment does absolutely no good whatsoever irrespective of what class of criminal or delinquent it is applied to. Of all forms of punishment&mdash;imprisonment, fining, corporal punishment&mdash; corporal punishment has the poorest record so far as the repetition of offences is concerned.  It has the <Col N="1159" /> poorest of what the criminologists call recidivism figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Of 100 men sent to prison 40 will be in trouble again. Out of 100 people fined 30 will be in trouble again; of 100 people birched 70 will be in trouble again.  If it is valid to draw a cause and effect nexus between these things at all; perhaps it is not&mdash;it has the poorest record as a method of punishment.  It seems to me that an essentially brutal and brutalising form of punishment, if it cannot be justified at least by the argument that it prevents people from doing the same thing again, cannot be justified at all. While I understand the vindictive feeling or the feeling&mdash;&ldquo;Let us give these people a damn good hiding&rdquo;&mdash;which will induce a residents' association to be nearly unanimous about this, the fact is that it does not, so far as figures will show, improve delinquents.  It may, in fact, do the opposite.  I think many of the points of view expressed in regard to the workings of courts and the workings of the criminal law by lay people or by lawyers&mdash;I do not draw any distinction between them&mdash; in this regard is based on a kind of silent, unspoken premise.  What they are saying in their own minds and what they are trying to make stick as a universal truth, although they do not realise what is in their minds is this &ldquo;The threat of birching or the threat of hanging, as the case may be, would certainly stop me from committing this or that offence, or if I did it once and was birched, I certainly would not do it again.&rdquo;  That is the hidden or inarticulate premise in their minds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my own belief that nature plays a big part in this and that the thing is very largely pre-determined, even perhaps genetically pre-determined.  Therefore, a person whose nature because of his genetic inheritance or because of the way he has been brought up or the environment in which he has spent his years, leans to crime, is not deterred by the threat or by the carrying out of certain punishment, and I believe&mdash;and criminologists are unanimous about <Col N="1160" /> this&mdash;that the least effective form of punishment is corporal punishment.  I will refer later on to something which Deputy Briscoe said in regard to the excessive technicality of the legal system, but those were the things I wanted to say arising out of the specific points he made.</P>
    <P>I want to come back to some points Deputy Brennan made.  I have got, admittedly, the uncorrected version of his speech here in front of me, and I want to refer to a couple of specific charges.  He quoted from <i>Hibernia</i> and, although it is not easy to see where the quotation ends and Deputy Brennan's own views begin, he cited an issue of <i>Hibernia</i> of 30th January, 1976, under the heading &ldquo;Jobs for the boys&rdquo; and he said the article contained a list of appointments made to the bench by the Government.  He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>To my mind they were disgustingly political.  Without a single exception the appointments made have been those of prospective candidates for Fine Gael or the Labour Party, defeated candidates or people who were at one time TD's.</P>
    <P>It may be that he is simply listing the cases which were contained in the article from which he was quoting but if he is trying to tell the House &mdash;and it may come across like this in the papers when his speech is reported &mdash;that all the appointments which the Government have made have been from the ranks of essentially Coalition Dáil candidates, whether successful or not, it is simply wrong, and wildly wrong.</P>
    <P>I have not looked at the full list, but as I sat here making a few notes since the Dáil resumed after Question Time, I thought of no fewer than six appointments of judges, three in the High Court and three in the Circuit Court&mdash; the District Court appointments are so numerous that I would not be able to keep track of them&mdash;who, to my knowledge, never were candidates for either Fine Gael or Labour, and in the case of one or two of them at least, I do not believe they could be said to have had any serious politics whatever, and I cannot ever imagine them being candidates even had the question of their appointment to the bench not arisen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1161" /> If Deputy Brennan had left it at that it would have been bad enough, but he went on to refer to a specific appointment, admittedly not by name, but it would be a very easy matter to establish the name of the member of the judiciary to whom he was referring.  I do not want to maximise the importance or the seriousness of what Deputy Brennan said, but neither do I want to minimise it.  I do not want to run away from it or allow the House to forget the seriousness of what he said here this morning.  The Official Report from which I quote is uncorrected, in the sense that the trivial slips which arise in any transcript have not been ironed out, but the substance of the thing is absolutely clear.  He said:</P>
    <P>The serious view which the public must take of such appointments is not relieved by the fact that one district justice in his first case imposed a fine on a Member of this House that was far above anything justifiable or in any way related to the offence.</P>
    <P>If he had stopped there it would have been a criticism of a judge or the bench in a particular case, which is within the limits of what I think is permissible under the law of this country, but in the next sentence he said:</P>
    <P>It was blatant political victimisation and vindictiveness.</P>
    <P>To say of a judge in any court that an act of his is an act of blatant political victimisation is, I assert, a contempt of the court, and contempt of the District Court or Circuit Court may be an indictable offence.  If, as I believe&mdash;and it is only my opinion&mdash; Deputy Brennan's words amount to the making of an indictable offence, I want to tell him here that he is protected from prosecution for what he said this morning only by his privilege of being a Member of this House.</P>
    <P>The district justice that he referred to&mdash;although he did not name him he can easily be identified&mdash;is a member of the judiciary and just as much entitled to respect and to the benefit of the law which surrounds the courts and guarantees their integrity and independence as the Chief Justice himself <Col N="1162" /> or any member of the Supreme Court or High Court.  That was an outrageous thing for Deputy Brennan to have said.  I admit that in a moment of heat or strong feeling words will come out that one did not intend.  I hope for Deputy Brennan's own sake and for the sake of his credit he will withdraw those words, because they are a disgraceful reflection on a judge or a justice, and as I say, in my opinion&mdash;I do not advance it <i>ex cathedra</i>&mdash;they do and would make up the offence of contempt of court for which Deputy Brennan could be indicted, prosecuted and severely punished if he were to utter those words outside this House.</P>
    <P>I think it is part of the House's convention that the privilege of the House only exists in order that the public interest may allow Deputies to speak their minds freely.  If Deputy Brennan genuinely believes, and is not just saying it off the top of his head, that a judge or justice is guilty of that, then the privilege of the House is there to allow him to say it, but it is a very serious thing for him to say otherwise. If he is just doing it in the context of a general lathering charge against the Government of appointing their friends to jobs, then it is far too trivial a setting in which to make such a charge which calls into question the integrity of this particular member of the judiciary and the integrity of the proceedings which he holds or has held in his court.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan went on to speak about the political appointments which he believed this Government had made. I have spoken of this before in the House and I want to come back to the subject for a little while.  It is true and I freely admit it that most of the appointments to the bench made by this Government have been made, broadly speaking, from among the ranks of barristers who are not members of Fianna Fáil, who never had been members of Fianna Fáil and presumably never would be members of Fianna Fáil.  It is also true, and I acknowledge it with the respect which it deserves, that the former Government did make two important and distinguished appointments to the bench <Col N="1163" /> from among the ranks of barristers other than their own supporters.  One of them had the clearest possible Fine Gael associations and the other one might have been supposed to have some sympathies of that kind.  I respected the former Government for having broken away from the traditions which had prevailed up to then. This Government have made at least one very important judicial appointment from the ranks of potential appointees who was never associated with either of the Coalition parties but was associated with the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Apart from these appointments, which were exceptional, the general rule under the Fianna Fáil Governments in the years between 1932 and 1948, between 1951 and 1954 and between 1957 and 1973 was that nobody was appointed to the bench at any level unless he was a supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I thought that a disgraceful arrangement because it put a premium on what might be only a pretended interest in a political party. It put a premium on people going through the motions of subscribing and making the occasional speech at church gates, though they might have had no interest in politics or in the Soldiers of Destiny.  It was grossly unfair to people who could not find it in their hearts to support Fianna Fáil but who believed in Fine Gael or in the Labour Party. The numbers in the profession in the thirties and forties were far more heavily in favour of Fine Gael than Fianna Fáil; the numbers evened up later on.  It was grossly unfair to them but particularly unfair to people who had no politics.  Deputy Meaney may or may not believe that there are such people in the country.  He comes from a particularly politically conscious county.  There are people who genuinely do not have any politics.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy. Many people are not interested in political parties.  They do not mind who is in or out of office provided they are able to earn their living and bring up their families and are not leaned on too heavily by the police or the tax collector.  People like that, perhaps 25 per cent or 30 per cent, make up the floating vote.  They are people who will change their vote from time to time as they think the country needs it and such people are as heavily represented at the Bar as anywhere else. Even people like that, though they did not carry the original sin of membership of Fine Gael or of the Labour Party, were outside the magic circle and were not entitled to be considered for advancement or promotion to the bench.</P>
      <P>The House will not have forgotten that quite apart from judicial appointments, which are the ones which get the most attention, a far more lucrative source of revenue for the legal profession is State work, employment as a prosecutor or counsel for the State in the various forms of civil or non-criminal action in which the State is involved.  The value of that legal work now amounts to almost £1 million a year.  Admittedly the rise in fees and inflation have pushed that figure up but when Fianna Fáil left office it was well over £500,000 a year. That £500,000 was earmarked like a trust fund for the ranks of Fianna Fáil, with very few exceptions.  Such exceptions were made only in cases of a technical kind where a barrister might be needed in the State's interest who was an expert in patents or in admiralty law or something like that and the Soldiers of Destiny did not happen to have an expert on such subjects. They would then step outside their own ranks and employ a barrister who might be of a different colour from themselves.  Leaving aside those exceptional cases, no one had a chance of ½p of that £500,000 unless he supported or promised to support the Fianna Fáil Party, not just at the ballot box but with his pocket-book and at church gate meetings during by-elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was at the Bar and for years <Col N="1165" /> thereafter up to 1973 there was a total exclusion of anybody who did not belong to the Soldiers of Destiny, who bore the stain of original sin of membership of Fine Gael or the Labour Party.  There was total exclusion of people who had no politics and who could not bring themselves to go through the motions of pretending that they had and this was most unjust of all.  Far more money changed hands and far more mohair suits were bought, holidays to Morocco arranged and Rolls Royces put in custom-built garages on the strength of money which was paid over by the State to members of Fianna Fáil in that setting than was paid to men who were on the bench because of their Fianna Fáil membership.  That practice has now stopped because of the initiative of this Government and particularly due to the initiative of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Since 1974, since the Prosecution of Offences Act, all prosecution State work and other State work, even the non-prosecuting stuff, is spread around equitably through the whole Bar. Fianna Fáil barristers who were high on the hog are still high on the hog but they have to share the froth of the pint with the rest of the Bar now.  They have to put up with the fact that people they supposed would never hold a brief for the people of Ireland are now doing so.  They have not been knocked off the list in the same ruthless way that Fine Gael and Labour and neutral people were knocked off the State list in 1957.  They have not been deprived of a livelihood.  They have not had the experience of having to go home to their wives and tell them that their income has dropped by £5,000 because their politics are the wrong way.  I am proud to work for a Government which can say that much at least about a very substantial reform in an area of the law which, as everybody knows, is resistant to reform and in which the conservative spirit tends to be uppermost.</P>
    <P>All Deputies who have mentioned this have agreed that appointments to the bench, whatever may be said about the political system behind them, have been good in that we have had down through the years a judiciary that could be relied on and which was not <Col N="1166" /> partisan, which was impartial and which did its duty fairly to the best of its ability.  I must endorse that but before I leave the subject of patronage or appointments of a political kind I must say that, while I am against the patronage system in this or any other area, the lack of openings which any barrister or solicitor not of the Fianna Fáil kidney had to take as being part of the professional landscape in the years before 1973 meant that many men grew mature, indeed grew old, without a chance of serving their country from the judicial bench.</P>
    <P>When 1973 came along there was a large backlog of justice to catch up on, a backlog of ability and skill and willingness, of men who under a system of impartial appointments would five, ten and in some cases 15 years previously have been eligible for appointment to the bench.  That backlog had to be caught up with and I do not apologise for the Government for making sure that they righted the balance and that personal and professional injustice to such men was undone. That excuse will not last forever. It is a fair, genuine, sincere and true excuse and I will make a present to the Opposition of saying that I will be disappointed if this Government continue in office beyond the next election or beyond the one after that if various political colours are not to be seen among their political appointments. I hope and believe that they will.</P>
    <P>I accept the point which I made frequently in Opposition and which the Opposition are now making, that it would conduce to greater confidence, or at least to maintaining high confidence, in the judicial system if the element of patronage were removed and if political affiliations of barristers and solicitors at any rate within the four corners of parliamentary democratic allegiance, played absolutely no part in their appointments.  There is unanimity on both sides that the appointments which have been made on the basis of a system, however open to criticism, have been good in the sense that we have had a judiciary which is respected.  Of course some judges are more intelligent than others, some more polite than others, some <Col N="1167" /> more patient than others.  As the Minister prompts me, some are speedier than others.  But on the whole I believe the Irish people accept that the judges have done a good and fair service from a bench which has done its best.  I declare my own belief that there never has been a case in this country&mdash;at least I have never run across one in any of the matters which I had to deal with professionally or academically&mdash;about which I had even a suspicion that the judge or bench of judges had decided in a particular way out of political prejudice or political conviction and that had their former political allegiance been otherwise they would have decided the case otherwise. I declare that as much for the benefit of the judges with a Fianna Fáil background as those with a Fine Gael or Labour background.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say before sitting down is that if that is so the people have been well served by the judiciary.  There has been reason to trust them and to take for granted that even though a judge might be rude, or impatient or slow to take a point or not as intelligent as some other judge, even though he might be many of these things and on occasion all of them&mdash;and these criticisms would not be true of the great majority of judges; even the worst of them would not be true of the great majority of judges&mdash;even the worst of them could not be accused of being prejudiced or biased for political reasons.  If a judge had his own prejudices he would keep them to himself, or rather he would shed them when he climbed to the judicial bench and administered the Irish people's justice.</P>
    <P>If that is so it is because of the ethos which these judges absorb in their earlier professional existence as members of the Irish Bar.  The Bar is a very easy target of fun.  Barristers are conventionally vulgarly regarded as grasping, venal, anxious to pile up bags of fees and it does not matter what happens to the client; it may take 12 years to get his case done and he may be ruined by it.  All these are legends about the legal profession. <Col N="1168" /> Barristers are no more exempt from the human failures of cupidity, laziness or anything else than any other profession is, but they most certainly are no more subject to them than any other profession.  From my recollection of my years in practice I can say that a peculiar thing about the Irish Bar is that they have formed a sort of brotherhood which completely transcends political links and in particular completely transcends religious differences. There was a time when the Bar here was virtually an entirely Protestant, or at any rate a non-Catholic profession.  By, let us say, the outbreak of the First World War the profession was about half and half.  Since that time the religious representation which had been in a majority has fallen 50 per cent or a good deal further, but there is still a very strong representation at the Bar of the minority religious and cultural sections of the community.</P>
    <P>It is easy, and it might be thought pompous, to talk like this about a profession, but I honestly believe what I say and I find it impressive and moving that it can so easily be the case.  In the years that I was there one never heard a man's politics, faith, cultural or social background mentioned or discussed.  They were all engaged in the same profession according to standards which were understood and respected, and these were high standards. You did not deceive a court, or a judge or a jury.  You did not deceive a colleague.  Some people there were cleverer than others and some were perhaps thought of as being cuter than others about cutting corners, but in general high standards were respected and observed, and also levels of courtesy towards one's colleagues and towards the bench and from the bench were expected.  These restraints which grew up in the context of the legal profession are hard to explain to the public and hard to defend.  They very easily raise danger signals in the minds of people who think along such lines. These readymade, trendy court rules easily raise the idea that of course it is a closed shop, and in particular a closed middle-class shop of people whose interest it is that it should remain so and whose ethos, although no <Col N="1169" /> doubt very pleasant for themselves, confers no benefit on the public.</P>
    <P>All of these things are false.  Not all of them are totally false, but the general impression created by such a global conception of the Bar is a false one.  It is not a closed shop.  From my experience of the law school in which I was active until the last general election, the admission standards for the law schools here if anything are a good deal lower in the academic sense than those for the medical, engineering or other professional schools.  In other words, it is easier for an academically poorer student to get into a law school than into any of the other professional schools.  The cost of becoming a barrister is no greater than that of qualifying in another profession.  There may be a concealed social bias in the sense that of course children from socially underprivileged families are children who, by and large, will hear less educated conversation and will see fewer books around them.  They are children therefore who perhaps will get less out of school and by the time they reach school-leaving standard will have fewer advantages of a kind which will get them into and through third level education and out the far side into a profession.  I accept and admit that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say that.  I do not represent them and I am not a solicitor.  I understand that they will make it their business to fix up an apprentice.  I have never heard of anybody permanently denied access to the solicitors' profession, although there may be difficulties and delays because the profession tends to become overcrowded. It is not fair to describe it as a closed shop.</P>
      <P>Nothing of that kind operates in relation to admission to the Bar and it is as easy or easier and cheaper to gain admission to the Bar than to many other professions.  The rather stuffy old fashioned ethos which surrounds the Bar, the wigs and the gowns and so on, is not devoid of benefit to the public.  From my own observation, the wigs and the gowns are only part of a whole set of standards which pervade the legal profession between the Bar and the bench. These customs have a powerful effect, in that, even if a judge is a rogue at heart, he would be ashamed to misbehave in the presence of men who were formally colleagues at the Bar, men with whom he sweated and worked over long hours in the same courts and in the same Library.  That creates a strong professional bond of the kind that would make a person ashamed to misbehave.  It is not altogether dissimilar from the ethos which I have observed at times in this House.  Deputies lambaste one another across the floor but even they recognise that there is a belt below which one does not hit and they are moved by one another's personal misfortunes and would help one another as willingly as they would help a member of their own side, and would consider it disgraceful to be unmannerly to one another outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a trivial comparison, but it will give Deputies an idea of what I mean.  A similar ethos exists in the world of the bench and the Bar, and although it may look very silly and stuffy to the outside world it conveys a colossal public benefit, because it guarantees that a judge will conduct himself, if only because he would be <Col N="1171" /> ashamed to let himself down in front of the men with whom he has spent his whole life and with whom even now he is connected with strong social links, and with whom perhaps he plays golf or goes for a few drinks, and whose children play with one another and so on.  I agree that it all sounds very cosy and it will probably raise hackles on the people who do not believe that there should be any such thing as a middle class, or that if there is, they should be prevented from having their own habits.  Leaving such people out of it, because they are only a passing phase, the Bar is no more perfect and no more above improvement or reform than any other collective human institution but by its ethos, by the fact that they all work together and have to observe certain basic rules of courtesy and humanity in dealing with one another &mdash;from their ranks the judges of the three upper courts are recruited&mdash;it confers a great public benefit.</P>
    <P>The quickest way to bring to an end the conditions in which it it possible to say that a violent Fianna Fáil partisan once he gets on the bench behaves like a judge and that a violent Fine Gael partisan behaves the same way, even towards people with whom he has nothing in common, is to destroy the Bar.  The quickest way to produce conditions in which it can be said that a person is either a Fine Gael or a Fianna Fáil hack, and that no justice is to be had, is to destroy the Bar.</P>
    <P>I have few associations of which I am more proud than being a member of the Irish Bar and I have practised for some years.  Needless to say I am not ashamed to defend my associations. Even if I was never a barrister, or had been disbarred, or had changed my mind about the profession for some reason, I would still say that its peculiar solidarity and the peculiar standards which it is capable of defending quietly, operate as a very powerful constraint on the bench and guarantees what we have been boasting about, namely that the judges will behave impartially.  There are minds inside and outside the media, the public service and everywhere else that are offended at the sight of barristers in <Col N="1172" /> wigs and gowns scuttling around with dusty documents.  Some of them think quite correctly that this is a relic of the days of the English.  We took over these habits from the English but it does not matter whether it is a wig or something copied from the Continent or some ancient Irish headgear that a barrister wears.  These things are not important, they are only the fringes of the thing, but they are part of a brotherhood from which the public reap great benefit and anyone who sets out to destroy or interfere with that ethos will destroy and interfere with not only the profession but also the ethos and aura which surrounds the bench from which the public derive such an enormous amount of real benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had an excellent lecture from Deputy Kelly on judges and the Bar but I am disappointed that we did not hear anything about the Bill, which relates to the appointment of judges.  These appointments are political appointments and this Bill's only function is to make temporary judges permanent. The reason for these permanent appointments was discussed here today.  This measure does not add any extra judges, although the reason for this Bill according to the Minister is the backlog of cases in the civil and criminal courts.  I accept that there is a backlog of cases and that they must be speedily dealt with but I do not believe that legislation providing for the making permanent of a few temporary judges will speed matters up in this regard.  I should be more interested in legislation that would be aimed at simplifying the legal process and in decreasing the cost of litigation for the unfortunate people who become involved in law cases.  Indeed, the ordinary person would need to be well up to get justice in a court of justice because when you have members of the Bar arguing across the floor the person in contention would need to be very careful in what he said if he wished to come out on the right side. In saying that I am not casting any reflection on members of the legal profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all the various Acts it has become <Col N="1173" /> necessary for one to go to court for a variety of reasons which should be capable of being dealt with elsewhere. For instance, under the Land Acts one might have to wait two years to get to court for a decision and, subsequently the unfortunate farmer might have to wait another two or three years to get possession.  If this Bill contained some provision to speed up these cases I would be happy to support it but I am not convinced that as it stands it will have the effect of clearing the backlog that has built up.</P>
    <P>So far as the appointments of judges are concerned, I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that once a man assumes such a post of responsibility it does not matter to which political party he belongs.  We may as well be honest and tell people that judicial appointments are political but we must admit, too, that we have had a fair service from our judges down through the years.  When a man is taken out of the political arena and given such a position he must forget politics and there is no one who will forget politics quicker than the politician once he is removed from that area.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves the very pertinent question as to why there is a need for so many judges and also for so many gardaí but first we must ask why so many of our young people are turning to crime.  I do not know a great number of young people but I am aware of their thinking.  We now have a situation in which our unemployed youth are educated people and this is the breeding ground for crime.  A friend of mine who is a young priest working in one of our cities has told me of the efforts he is making to help those young people whose mothers and fathers are at work with the result that the younger ones who, perhaps, have leaving certificates with a number of honours, are at home all day with nothing to do.  In the case of a boy there is entitlement to unemployment assistance but this is not so where girls are concerned.  It is not possible to keep down the educated brain.  If these people are not given something good to do, the chances are that they will do something that is bad.  In the past our unemployed people were mainly uneducated <Col N="1174" /> also but, fortunately, that is no longer the case.  However, the fact that these people are unemployed leads them to engage in crime.  All the judges and the gardaí in the country will not solve this problem.  The aim should be the development of a crash programme to create employment for our youth. What is sad in particular is that our young people have lost interest in democracy.  Regardless of which party they may vote for in the election, it is my hope that those who are over 18 will exercise their right to vote.</P>
    <P>I recall a time when there were no trade unions to protect people in employment and hearing a businessman lecture on the dangers of communism. One of his listeners reminded him that since he was not paying a fair wage to those who worked for him, his business was a breeding ground for communism.</P>

I want to be entertained but when you turn on the radio or television it is often crime and murder you get.  The young people have lost confidence and until we get a programme to provide work for them, give them money and confidence in themselves we cannot expect to improve the position.  People cannot do without money at present and if they do not get it, I believe we shall have a violent State.  I do not say that our State is too violent but there is no good in giving the impression that everybody can do what they like without control.  We have not sufficient gardaí.  But more judges or guards is not the answer.  The answer is to get the minds of young people occupied. It is wrong to compare the youth of today with the youth of 20 or 30 years ago who were uneducated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, but the Deputy is doing his best to bother me.  I can assure him he is not troubling me in the least.  I support the Bill because judges and guards are essential.  The Bill only makes temporary appointments permanent.  It is well known that all judges are political appointments. I suppose this Bill will ensure that they will be permanent whoever wins the next election but no additional judges are being added.  I want to ask the Minister one question before I sit down.

I want to ask the Minister if something can be done to speed up title cases because, as I have said before, Land Commission cases that have to go to the High Court are often listed for 12 months, with another 12 months in possession. Will this Bill hasten this type of case and will there be any way by which people can secure a title cheaper?  You will not be paid a grant now if you do not have title.  Finally, could the Minister tell us how many hours a week do judges work?  I know a judge must do a good deal of research but how much actual work does he do?  I am asking this so as to know how many judges we need to get the backlog dealt with. There is a serious backlog and even if this Bill is passed will it be cleared up?  My thanks to the Ceann Comhairle and to Deputy Coughlan.  We would have more and better speeches if he came in oftener.</P>

    <Col N="1178" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>A wide range of topics has been discussed on this Bill from law and order to gardaí and many other things but what I have to say is no reflection an anybody individually in the judiciary or in law but is more a matter of discussing the system and how things come about.</P>
      <P>There is still a big gap between the legal profession and the ordinary person&mdash;and I speak as one.  They are still afraid of barristers.  They think it is bad enough to have to go to a solicitor and are deadly afraid of judges. Recently, I was in a churchyard where a very distinguished barrister was buried with a beautiful tombstone over him.  One man said to another: &ldquo;Is not that a beautiful stone over the poor barrister.&rdquo;  The other replied: &ldquo;It was troublesome people who put it there.&rdquo;  We should bear that in mind but I think legal people are ordinary people like ourselves.  I do not know why they are held in this fear but, perhaps, there are reasons for it.</P>
      <P>We are not adding any new judges to the list in this Bill but making permanent some temporary appointments. When discussing that, it is up to the House to suggest ways and means by which the system could work better and to praise or criticise it as we think fit. First, I should like to refer to what Deputy Kelly, the Parliamentary Secretary, said regarding the system of appointments.  Down the years appointments have been by patronage and nothing will convince the people in the country but that there has been a change of Government and that what is happening at the moment is that you have to support the Government one way or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know everybody who is being appointed but some of the top appointments are regarded as people being rewarded for their support of the Government.  I am not discussing the people but the system.  I believe that there should not be patronage in appointments to the bench.  At local council level and on the committee of agriculture I have always opposed the system of appointing instructors or instructresses on a temporary basis where we vote on them.  We have no real right to do that because we do not <Col N="1179" /> even know their qualifications.  Until such time as appointments of judges and justices are taken out of the hands of the Government of the day the ordinary person will believe that it is patronage all the way.  After all, the person who is educated and is brilliant enough and has the ability even if he never belonged to any political party or, if, perhaps, he voted Coalition at one stage, Labour Party at another stage and Fianna Fáil at another stage, and, perhaps, for an Independent candidate on another occasion, should be allowed to rise to the top of the ladder and be appointed to the bench.</P>
    <P>The present system will have to be changed.  There is no point is somebody saying if there is a change of Government in the morning: &ldquo;I was a great supporter of the former Government, I am next in line, and Fianna Fáil will not appoint me.&rdquo;  That would be wrong.  <i>Vice versa,</i> if somebody was due for promotion when Fianna Fáil left office, whether he was for us or not, he should be duly appointed.  We should think deeply about finding other ways of appointing members of the legal profession to the bench.</P>
    <P>I suggest a committee should be appointed with the President of the day sitting as chairman, with the Chief Justice who would know all those people, the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and, perhaps, the leaders of the two main parties as representatives of the ordinary people on that committee.  I throw that out as a suggestion for making a complete change from the present system.  These would be responsible people.  This would guarantee to a person who did not play a prominent political role in any of the major political parties that he would have an equal chance of getting to the top of the ladder and that he would not be victimised because he had not become actively involved in politics.  At the moment, unless these people have been politically active, they do not have a pup's chance of promotion regardless of their abilities.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will admit that members of this Government and previous Governments <Col N="1180" /> have been strongly canvassed by cousins and brothers of barristers. You are open to that once you are involved in public life.  You are asked to make representations.  People are pressurised.  I believe we should put an end to that system once and for all. In the area where I live people believe patronage is involved.  There should be no patronage.  I hope I will see the day when there will be an end to it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should try to reconstruct the whole legal system.  I am an ordinary layman.  I was never in the High Court and I hope I never will.  I should like to see the whole system of bringing people before the District Court changed.  A District Court is held in a local town and the following week in the local paper there is a list of people who were fined or dealt with under the Probation Act for having defective lights on their cars or no brakes or bald tyres or for some parking offence or for having no dog licence or for making poteen or drinking after hours.  If people plead guilty to these offences, why should they have to go through the courts?  If I am caught drinking in a bar 20 minutes after the legal hour and if I admit my guilt to the garda, why should I not be allowed to go to the barracks and pay a fine?</P>
    <P>Very light fines are imposed in the courts for those types of offences. People do not like their neighbours to read about them in the papers.  They become aggressive towards the garda and when a serious crime takes place in the area they will not be helpful if the same garda is investigating it.  I am speaking about rural areas and smaller towns where there are only two or three gardaí or, perhaps, only one. It is not the fine that matters to those people but seeing their names in the papers.  There would be better cooperation between the Garda and the public if the system in the District Courts could be changed.  Too much time is taken up with trivial cases.</P>
    <P>If you are caught driving under the influence of drink and you are brought to court, and if you had over a certain level of alcohol in your blood the man on the bench has no choice because the fine or sentence is laid down. <Col N="1181" /> Would it not be better if you could admit your guilt, hand in your licence for six or 12 months and have it recorded against you?  Perhaps this could be published in some State publication. If you have to go to court you say to your solicitor: &ldquo;I should like to be defended.  I should like to have someone there to represent me.&rdquo;  This takes up the time of your solicitor who is usually a very busy man.  All he does is stand up and say: &ldquo;Johnny So-and-So has instructed me to say he admits the offence.&rdquo;  You are fined £5 or the Probation Act is applied.  That system does not make sense.  I should like the Minister and the Department to have a look at this matter.  If we changed the system we could save the time of the district justices and they could be promoted and do excellent work further up the line.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan asked the Minister how many hours are worked per week by the judges in the various courts. Many people believe they work a short number of hours.  They have to keep themselves in touch with the law.  At this time I believe our judges deserve the best security and protection we can give them.  I do not think the money is all that great.  I should not like to be a judge with a wife and family and having to have somebody to mind them at all times.  These people are open to attack from all quarters.  They have to administer the law fearlessly on the bench.  Whatever protection they are given is not overdone.  I doubt that money makes up to them for missing their freedom.  Times are hard and terrible things are happening.  It takes brave men to sit on the bench and administer the law as we pass it in this House.  Regardless of who appointed our judges, in the main we should be happy with them.</P>
    <P>I should like to see another change in our legal system.  People are brought before our courts for doing damage which runs into hundreds of thousands of pounds.  Once the accused is found guilty he should have to pay compensation to the injured party.  I am sick and tired of hearing of some poor old man or poor old couple at the end of their days being robbed by three or four young thugs who then get a suspended <Col N="1182" /> sentence.  We should ensure that they must pay compensation.  Otherwise they should get a very heavy sentence. What is the point in sending such people to jail where the State has to support them for two or three months, if the injured party does not get compensation?</P>
    <P>I would say we are very soft in our courts.  We are trying to convince people there is good in everybody, even the hardened criminal.  We are trying to say to him: &ldquo;Turn over a new leaf. There is a lot of good in our society. Come back into it in a proper manner and be a good citizen.&rdquo;  I often wonder does that work when I think of the victims and the terrible damage done to some old person or some person living alone by a person who is a thorough-going scamp.  We should concentrate on the compensation issue.  In my part of the country I have seen such people sent from court to court until the compensation was paid and then the case was decided.  In my view that was a great system.  Very often when these people are paying compensation, their crimes can be discussed and they often turn out to be good citizens.</P>
    <P>Juvenile delinquency takes up a great deal of our time and is a great social problem.  In my opinion parents are 99 per cent responsible for this situation.  They are trying to keep up with the Joneses, whether they can afford it or not.  Even the older people are doing this.  Some of them will do without essentials to maintain a good appearance.  That is why I consider we should be trying to educate the parents, not the delinquents.  Teachers will tell you that after the first few days at school they know the type of life led by a child's parents.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have spoken about the increase in crime.  Although the Garda is at the highest strength ever, even more gardaí are required.  I am disappointed more trained gardaí did not come out during the past year. Security is costing a great deal.  We all know that with modern guerrilla warfare tactics a few hundred people can tie down 10,000 to 20,000 troops. That has been proved all over Europe and in Northern Ireland, There is a <Col N="1183" /> limit to what we can do but we are very thin behind the lines, especially in the smaller towns.  Many people realise that after hours it is very difficult to get a garda and so commit crimes.  By the time a garda is available the offenders are many miles away.  I understand that in a few months there will be more gardaí available and not before time.  We all realise that many more gardaí will have to be recruited, trained and sent out on duty.</P>
    <P>In this legislation we are discussing making temporary judges permanent, but will that ease the backlog of work before the courts?  I doubt it.  We must revise the whole system.  I have made my views on District Courts known and on how appointments should be made to the bench.  I look forward to the day when the tag will be taken off these appointments.  No matter who is appointed while this Government is in power, he will be tagged as a supporter of the Coalition parties.  If a man was appointed nine years ago, he will be considered a Fianna Fáil supporter whether he is or not.  These tags should be removed.  These men have done a very good job and we should be very grateful to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the debate so far, one must ask oneself how independent is the judiciary.  As other speakers have outlined their views on this important issue, I do not intend getting involved in it.  I am concerned with the basic situation that is destroying this nation&mdash;mob law, the pile up of problems which need more judges to deal with them, and the boot boys and bully boys who are prevalent in this city and in many major towns.  We must combat these problems.  The increase in the number of judges is not a solution to this problem which is eroding our society. This is a problem to which the Minister and the Government must pay particular attention.  Substitutes of this nature are no solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system of law and order has broken down.  If this Government can be condemned as a failure, it must be in the area of law and order because there is absolutely no law and order <Col N="1184" /> here.  I am not going to go into detail about the various incidents I could tell this House.  People are captives in their own houses; they are afraid to leave their homes at night because of these bully boys, boot boys and mob law.  Now Members of these Houses are being attacked and efforts are being made to intimidate them.  It is very sad to think of the situation which is developing in this country.</P>
    <P>Members who represent the working class areas of this city know only too well the dreadful situation which has been developing for some time.  The solution is not more judges but more police.  The gardaí are overburdened and are not assisted by the Government or the existing judges.  They are doing a great job under very difficult circumstances.  If the judges played their part fully and ensured that justice was done in the many problems brought before them, maybe we would have a more effective and efficient Garda force.  The gardaí are being let down every day in court and as a result they take the easy way out.</P>
    <P>I have read a booklet published lately&mdash;&ldquo;Report and Crime for 1975&rdquo;. According to this report sexual offences decreased from 240 in 1974 to 168 in 1975; rape increased from 29 to 38 and indecent assaults on females fell from 122 to 83.  These figures do not represent the facts because one of the major crimes which is on the increase is rape and it has become an accepted situation in many areas.  The only reason all these cases are not recorded is that the young women and their families are afraid of the disgrace involved.  We all must be concerned about this.  This problem must be tackled in a realistic manner, and as soon as possible by the Garda and the Minister.  Indeed, parents must be educated to know what is the proper thing to do to ensure that the unfortunate victim will not be exposed in the way many of them are in order to get a conviction against known people in a given area.</P>
    <P>The question of robbery occurs all too frequently as we are aware from the amount of armed robberies and robberies with violence and without violence.  We know how many take <Col N="1185" /> place from the statistics given and they do not represent the real situation. There is a real security problem here.</P>
    <P>I know the police would be only too happy to step up the security if they got support right along the line. Because of the vast increase in the number of terrible offences being committed the police are rendered helpless. They do not get the necessary support from the Government or citizens, indeed possibly not from Members of this House, which is all too sad.  The situation must be investigated in an endeavour to ensure that the root of the problem is tackled and that we have a developing situation in which everybody will play their part in ridding our country of these terrible hideous crimes.</P>
    <P>Then there are the cider drinkers and the car stealers.  We know from going through parts of this city and the housing estates by the number of cider and wine bottles discarded and broken that the areas can be pinpointed. In an area where I sit in a clinic on a Saturday morning the place is littered with cider and wine bottles, and again the police are helpless.  Known hideouts should be stamped out by an increase in police activity.  The groups concerned are small but are contaminating the young people in our cities and country with regard to cider drinking, car robberies and other types of robberies that go with rape.  It is the one group of people intimidating a large section of our public.</P>
    <P>Statistics, however accurately compiled, represent a fraction only of the crime.  It is up to each of us as individuals to play our part effectively in ensuring that the Minister is assisted and that the forces of security are assisted in every way possible to eliminate this vast problem.  As an initial measure, I hope there will be a step-up of security by the numbers of police being supplemented to a very large degree. It would constitute a small cost when weighed against the destruction at present being perpetrated.  We note that the value of property stolen in a particular year&mdash;relevant to offences committed with violence&mdash;was over £2,250,000 and, without violence, another <Col N="1186" /> £1,500,000.  That constitutes only the reported aspect of the problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Only if we get to the very root of the problem and eliminate it can we see if there is a need for all the appointments being made.  I have no objection to such appointments if they are necessary to cope with the problem.  In my time I never found any favouritism in appointments; there may have been, or there are, political appointments.  For a Government which built their foundation on law and order they are a complete and absolute failure.</P>
      <P>I would urge on the Minister at this stage, as an immediate effort, to have appointed, not 500 but 1,000 gardaí, if necessary.  Then we shall not have our jails full because the offences will not be committed.  We must assess the cost of keeping these people in jails; probably our jails are bursting at the seams and at very large cost to our taxpayers.  Would it not be far better to have more police, at the same cost to the nation, doing a better job, allowing young and old alike to move through our cities and towns in comfort without the fear of being attacked in one way or another?  Our citizens would then be enabled also to leave their homes without the fear of their property being attacked.  I would ask the Minister to equate one against the other when I am sure he will find the situation demands that more gardaí be recruited not at a cost to the State but with greater security for the State and our people alike.  Once things become an accepted part of life&mdash;just as killing is an accepted part of life in the Six Counties&mdash;other hideous crimes become an accepted part of life as has happened here.  Then it becomes more difficult to create the climate in which they are no longer accepted.  The longer we let the situation develop the greater will be the difficulties for the Minister for Justice, for the Government, the Garda and the other security forces dealing with crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope that some of these <Col N="1187" /> problems would be tackled at the earliest possible opportunity, indeed that they would be stamped out, thereby ensuring that younger people not yet contaminated will be free from the shackles of the cider drinkers, the bully boys, boot boys and, indeed, the other people who endeavour to intimidate the public, the Government, Deputies, the judiciary and so on.  It is time we took a positive line in ensuring that the security forces are adequate to deal with the problems confronting us.</P>
    <P>The reason for crime has been mentioned here by many people and a variety of explanations given.  One of them was unemployment.  Again, would it not be far better if more money was pumped into the system for public works schemes to divert peoples attention from labour exchanges and the activities to which they are at present devoting their time?  During the day they spend their time between the labour exchanges and surveying property and, at night, robbing or damaging that property. We must see that people are drawn out of that atmosphere into one in which their minds will be devoted to healthy activity.  That of work was one suggestion made by Deputy Callanan and others.  But this problem must be tackled in a comprehensive way.  Every suggestion made, however little it may do in ensuring reduction in the rate of crime, merits consideration.  I do not blame the Minister; he is doing a good job in difficult conditions.  But it is a developing problem.  He needs our help and we are willing to help him. We must convince many people that they need not be afraid to come forward any longer, that we will ensure they are protected if they make their contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would now help the Chair by trying to relate his remarks to this Bill which has to do with an increase in the number of judges and justices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only too happy to do so.  But I want to deal with the basic problem which is that of the pileup <Col N="1188" /> of cases not being dealt with.  One walking through housing estates sees too many young people sitting, lying and walking around, which is all too sad.  Many of us know what are their intentions from their attitudes.  Our citizens must be free to walk the streets.  If it is necessary to have more judges appointed to ensure that people are brought to justice at an earlier stage, then I am in favour of them.  I am in favour of anything that will eliminate crime in a broad sense.  There are other measures that must be taken also.  If the appointment of extra judges is the only problem, then appoint them and let crime develop and put more people in jail.</P>
      <P>But that is not the solution.  We must erase crime at its roots.  Built-up areas must be made safe for young and old. All our citizens must feel safe.  We must ensure that people who have a part to play in our society will not be prevented from doing so by vandals, bootboys and bullies.  At the moment the intimidation that goes on in this city and throughout the country is preventing people from playing their part. I know how terrified people are.  Last Monday night I visited a house in my constituency, in Ballyfermot.  I left at 12.30 and at that time of night a person was trying to break into my car who had already been caught breaking into another car.  I called the gardaí, but a number of people are inclined to take the law into their own hands on such occasions because too many people being brought before courts for serious crimes are either allowed off scot-free or get the benefit of the Probation Act.  Gardaí have been working under severe difficulties and have been doing an excellent job. I know a person whose house has been broken into three times and the only solution offered to him was to instal a burglar alarm.  If burglar alarms and steel shutters are to be substitutes for proper policing, it is a shocking situation.  If there is one thriving industry in this city it is the manufacture of burglar alarms.  The only protection for houses in every estate in this city seems to be the installation of alarms.  It is a sorry situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1189" /> I know how the Garda are being harrassed and intimidated.  I hope the Government will make a clear call to the public to support the Garda.  If necessary the Garda should be given overtime so that areas which are unprotected at the moment can be given adequate care.  If the payment of overtime contributes to the detection of crime and the apprehension of criminals, it is money well spent and the Minister will have the support of all parties in this House for the provision of such money.</P>
    <P>I had thought of dealing with some of the security lapses in the past but perhaps this would only bring glorification to certain people.  The Government have been a disaster in the area of law and order.  I want again to compliment the Garda for the number of criminals they have brought to justice for major crimes, and I instance the Herrema case and the theft of pictures at Blessington.  Those people were brought to justice by a police force working under appalling stresses.  It is important that the courts will back them up by imposing proper sentences.  If a man is accused of having a bald tyre on his car or of failing to have a light on his bicycle or a parking offence, a conviction is assured, but in offences involving violence against the person or against property sometimes the accused gets away under the Probation Act.  This gives a sense of disillusionment to the Garda.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Meaney pointed out, there is one way to hit people found guilty of offences against the person or damage to property.  It is to hit them in their pockets, to make them compensate their victims even if it means making them pay over periods of ten or 20 years.  For less serious crimes people have had to pay during a lifetime but many of the people I have been referring to have been allowed out scot-free.</P>

Perhaps this applies only to a small section of the judiciary, to old or overworked people, and indeed many of them are overworked at the moment.

      <P>I have made the points I wanted to make.  I appeal earnestly to all citizens to play their part fully and effectively.  The Minister must ensure that the Garda will get the backup they require and that a situation will be achieved when people will not be afraid to report offences, whether sexual or otherwise. I do not want to see people going around spying but I want to see a situation in which people who have a part to play in the interests of justice will be able to do so and have our sympathy and support.</P>
      <P>Reading the 1975 Garda report I notice that there were 23 murder cases and the number of people brought before the courts&mdash;there were 153 cases of robbery or attempted robbery&mdash;is a clear indication of the excellent work of the Garda operating under severe difficulties.  I accept that many people have been brought before the courts, but in my view a greater number could be prosecuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will see to it that the situation is improved now that he has heard the views of Members of the House.  The appointment of more judges only solves one problem but we also need more gardaí. If we had more gardaí we would not have any need for more judges.  It is a question of equating the cost of a judge against the cost of gardaí.  If more gardaí were on duty there would be less vandalism and vandalism is costing this city a lot of money.  I should like to tell the Minister that <Col N="1191" /> I am on his side when it comes to combating crime in this city.  I am against the boot boys, the bully boys and the intimidators.  I want to see them brought to justice at the earliest moment but when they are brought to justice I want to see jusice done. I do not want to see them getting the benefit of the Probation Act.  I do not want to see them brought before justices who are soft.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister when replying to tell the House how many cases are on the waiting list for hearing in the High Court.  In some accident cases it takes up to four years before a hearing takes place in the High Court.  The delay is deplorable.  A number of my constituents have asked me about the delay in their cases, but I was unable to ascertain for them when their case would come up for hearing.  It is hard on those concerned, widows and families, if they have to wait a number of years before an accident case is heard in the High Court.  If compensation is involved the people making the claim are at a loss if the case is not heard soon after the accident.  I hope the Minister will do something about the waiting period.  I understand that it takes about eight months to prepare a case for the High Court, but then the case is put on the waiting list and it can take three years before it is reached.  In one instance it has taken five years for a case to be heard in the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the provisions of the Bill will not improve the position.  The Bill seeks to make temporary appointments permanent.  I accept that pressure with regard to other law has taken up a lot of the time of the courts and that this may be the cause of the delay in reaching accident claims, but the whole system should be improved.  In many instances the payment of social welfare and other allowances is held up pending the hearing of such claims.  With regard to the judges appointed I should like to state that they have been doing a good job, irrespective of which Government appointed them.  I do not wish to criticise district justices but many of them have treated softly those <Col N="1192" /> charged before them.  Where youths have been involved in robberies district justices are inclined to give the benefit of the Probation Act.  Social workers are brought in to help the court, but I do not know whether they help out or not.  A harder line should be taken with regard to these youths.  Of course, the main problem is that they have no employment and young people are prepared to do almost anything in their spare time to get money.  They turn to vandalism and the destruction of property. There is a tendency now to destroy public property.  This has been brought about because the courts were not hard enough.  They have relied a lot on the evidence of social workers.  Generally speaking, the Garda and the courts are doing a good job.</P>

      <P>This morning I was interviewed on the radio in relation to the business of the House between now and the Summer Recess.  I was asked to assess the quality of the work on which the House will be engaged between now and the Summer Recess and I stated that this Bill was among the least important.  I made that statement on the basis that the Bill was politically motivated.  At that time I had not the opportunity of hearing the Minister but when I studied his speech I was confirmed in the opinion that there was no great urgency about this legislation.  We are going to give government permanency by way of imprimatur to the people who have already been temporarily appointed, but law and order will not be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody suggested to me that the motive behind this Bill was that, following the dissolution of the Coalition Government in 1957, the incoming Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;and, apparently, this was rather unusual&mdash;failed to confirm on a permanent basis the appointment of some Fine Gael supporter who had been appointed in some capacity by the Coalition Government. I do not know whether it was the District Court, the High Court or the Supreme Court that was involved, but I am one of the non-legal participators in this debate and I have tried to delve as deeply as possible into the Bill.  I have examined it in conjunction with the introductory speech of the Minister <Col N="1193" /> this morning.  Apart from ensuring that temporary appointments cannot be cancelled should there be a change of Government, there is absolutely nothing in this Bill.  Section 1 is the really relevant section.  It provides that the number of ordinary judges of the High Court shall not be more than nine.  The figure is seven at the moment.  The number in the Circuit Court shall not be more than eleven. There are nine at the moment.  The number of justices in the District Court shall be increased from 34 to 39.  At the moment there are 39 district justices. There is no increase there.  There are eight High Court judges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Seven, plus one under section 14 of the Law Reform Commission Act of 1975.  That is exactly what the Minister told us this morning. It would appear to me the Minister is himself a bit confused now.  In 1973, as the Minister told us this morning, there was an increase in the number of High Court Judges from six to seven.  Now I find this somewhat contradictory and I hope the Minister will explain the apparent contradiction.  He said this morning:</P>
      <P>To highlight the seriousness of this situation it is sufficient to point out that the average time-lag between the setting down of a jury action and its coming on for trial is now about ten months.  The last occasion on which an increase in the number of High Court judges took place was in 1973 when the Courts Act, 1973, increased the number of ordinary judges from six to seven.  At that time there was a time-lag of about 12 months between the setting down of a jury action and its coming on for trial.  As a consequence of the appointment of the seventh judge this time-lag was reduced by mid-1975 to five months.</P>
      <P>This is where I see the contradiction. The appointment of an extra judge in 1973 resulted in a reduction in the time-lag from 12 months to five months. Now the Minister tells us the time-lag is ten months.  Obviously the situation must have deteriorated again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us that business had increased in the High Court by 151 per cent between 1970 and 1976.  In the same period there was an increase of 143 per cent in the rate of disposal of cases.</P>
      <P>Reference was made today by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach to the fact that something that one of our speakers said was libellous or contempt of court but because it was said here in the Chamber no action could be taken.  Here we are talking about the appointment of the most independent people in the country, the judiciary, and that is as it should be, but I object to the Parliamentary Secretary or to anybody on the Government side saying that we, as legislators, cannot express our honest opinion on the manner in which justice is being administered.  When dealing with appointments like these we should be able to talk about the functions of these people and criticise, in an effort to ensure that the good name and independence of the judiciary are always maintained.  We are talking about 59 independent people officiating at various levels in the administration of justice and the application of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said some of those 59 could be more industrious and more active than others, but we have to take them as they come and it is up to successive Governments to try to pick people who are qualified to do the job.  I have no reason for talking about political hacks in this regard.  The Parliamentary Secretary, having abused Fianna Fáil on the one hand, for continuing to make political appointments, on the other hand credited us with two non-political appointments, non-political in so far as the were pronouncedly non-Fianna Fáil people who were appointed by the previous Government of which I was a member for a little over three years. My experience of the appointment of the judiciary was that it was completely above board with the object of appointing the best qualified people, <Col N="1195" /> among those best qualified people at that time were the two people the Parliamentary Secretary spoke about today.</P>
    <P>However, I think it can be said with great justification that the Fianna Fáil tag cannot be applied to any of the people who were appointed since March, 1973.  I am not finding fault with any of those appointments.  I do not know enough about most of the appointees and very little about others. Nevertheless, I am satisfied the Government have done the best they could by way of making appointments.  Like the man in the street, I will find fault with what the Parliamentary Secretary calls the Bar as such, and I can privately find fault with some members of the judiciary.  I fully appreciate that those people must be independent, but I do not feel I should be inhibited in any way in this House, in dealing with the appointment of judges, in expressing my views on their qualifications for the job or the manner in which the work is carried out.</P>
    <P>I was surprised at the Parliamentary Secretary, above all people, criticising Deputy Joe Brennan here for speaking his mind about the activities of the judiciary, because he was the one man from the Government side who, along with the Taoiseach, came into this House to justify the attack which a Government Minister made on the third arm of the Oireachtas.  He made the case that the President of this country could not or should not be above criticism in this House.  This is an opportunity we get of discussing the judiciary and I do not intend to take the opportunity of being critical of any individual member of the judiciary because I do not know enought about them.  If I had fault to find, I would not be afraid to express it in the House. However, if I or any other member of this party choose to criticise decisions of members of the judiciary, it should not be assumed it is because we are opposed to law and order as it is recognised.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the real purpose of this Bill was contained in section 1.  Getting back to his slide rule review of the increase of the workload <Col N="1196" /> of the variouse sectors of the judiciary, that is, the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court, I notice a rather amazing statistic, one that appears a little illogical.  He said that from 1970 to 1976 the increase in business in the High Court was 151 per cent, in the Circuit Court 30 per cent and in the District Court 43 per cent. Most of the contributors to the debate on this side of the House have commented on what appears to be, certainly in the city areas, a breakdown in law and order in regard to what are normally described as petty offences, breaking and entering and so on.  One of the features of this is an increase in the number of young people upon whom quite a share of money has been spent on education and who, from frustration at not being able to get jobs find themselves committing the oddest offences, and &ldquo;odd&rdquo; in that regard covers a very wide field.  Therefore, I was rather surprised at the Minister's statistic pointing out that the increase in District Court business over the six years had only been 43 per cent, whereas the most significant increase is in High Court business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am saying that is the percentage increase, but the volume of cases that that represents is much greater than the similar volume of cases in the High Court <Col N="1197" /> represented by the 150-odd per cent increase, because of the vastly greater number of cases coming before the District Court than before the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but the increase is put before us in percentage terms by the Minister.  In regard to volume, we are talking about 39 district justices as against nine High Court judges.  Unfortunately, what the Minister has done is to draw the attention of the House to the fact that over the six years there has been an increase, taking the criterion of the District Court, of almost 50 per cent in breaches of law and order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is going out of his way nearly to convey the impression that there has been no increase in breaches of law and order since he took up office.  I am afraid he will find it very hard to get that message across.  One of the things which the Coalition did not promise before the last election was a reduction in the number of judges but they certainly did convey the impression that with the same number of judges and police they could restrict lawlessness.</P>
      <P>This morning the Minister said that there are 1,335 cases awaiting hearing in the High Court.  There has been an increase of 43 per cent in the number of District Court cases though he was able to say that a certain number of these are civil cases.  I should like the Minister to tell us&mdash;I am sure he can produce these statistics&mdash;what part of this percentage increase is a direct result, as his Department sees it, of IRA or subversive activity.  How many of these cases are being brought as a result of subversive activities?  What increase has there been in the normal run of misdemeanours?  We are entitled to that information and we should get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1198" /> I do not see that the measure we are discussing today will in any way speed up justice or improve justice for the people.  If the Minister could say that we will have less lawlessness following the passing of this Bill, then it would be urgent.  We discussed another Bill in this House over a long period and got it through.  It envisaged, in fact, the use of judges for the trial of people for offences committed on the other side of the Border but the powers given under that Bill have never been used.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that section 1 of this Bill was very important but the Bill also contains certain changes in existing provisions regarding the assignment of Circuit Court judges.  I cannot see the need for the section covering the assignment of judges. The Minister said that changes were necessary because of the increase in the number of ordinary judges proposed in section 1.  He said that an opportunity was being taken to consolidate in one Bill all the existing provisions relating to assignments and that section 3 contains certain consequential provisions, including the necessary substitution of a new paragraph.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in section 2 (4).  We will have the opportunity of discussing this in more detail on Committee Stage but I should like to mention it here.  The section states:</P>
    <P>Any judge of the Circuit Court who is permanently assigned to a particular circuit may at any time, if he so consents but not otherwise, be transferred by the Government to another circuit to fill a vacancy for a judge permanently assigned to that other circuit and shall upon such transfer become and be permanently assigned to that other circuit in lieu of the first-mentioned circuit.</P>
    <P>I am giving the Minister notice that I am particularly interested in this subsection and I will be endeavouring to follow it up on Committee Stage. There is a question I should like to ask and I should be glad if the Minister would deal with it in his reply. This provision means that the Government <Col N="1199" /> can, on the recommendation of the Minister for Justice, transfer a Circuit Court judge from one circuit to another.  The Minister, acting as agent for the Government, could send for this Circuit Court judge and tell him that while he knows he has settled down in a particular area he feels that his talents could be better used on another circuit.  He would not tell the judge that he is making a mess of the job in the area in which he is at present serving.  The judge would be told that the Minister and his colleagues would like him to go to Sligo or Galway or some other area.  Of course, the judge would know that he need not go but that he would be frowned on by the Government if he did not do so.  The fact remains that he does have the right to stay where he is.  That is one slant on this.  The situation may be that the Circuit Court judge wants the transfer himself. He may be down in Kerry or Cork and may want to come to Dublin.  It may be that at the present time the Government have no power to enable him to change.  I am not too sure about that.  The more likely interpretation of this provision is that it is to enable a Circuit Court judge to apply for a transfer to another area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing new in this.  It is only re-enacting in consolidated form what is already the provision in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not discuss it when it was introduced before, probably by one of the Fianna Fáil Ministers way back.  Any Minister for Justice would like to retain for himself and for the Government the power to transfer a district justice or Circuit Court judge. This is a reserved function.  When once a judge has been appointed he cannot be dismissed without a two-thirds majority of this House.  That is a great protection for the judge.  It is a protection which Dáil Deputies do not have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is protection for the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The judge is protected in that regard and it is right that it <Col N="1200" /> should be so.  I stand over that provision. It is built in constitutionally.  I do not accept that the Government's hands should be tied in relation to the placement of their judges.  I am saying this with no malice aforethought, so to speak.  We have at present 34 district justices plus five temporaries, making a total of 39 at present and we will have according to the Minister's statement this morning, 39 appointed under the Bill.  It is quite possible that this Government or the next might feel that one, two or three of those district justices on the recommendation of the Minister for Justice or any Minister should be transferred from one area to another.  The same goes for Circuit Court judges but it is more likely to crop up in the context of the District Court.  My understanding is that the Government cannot do that.  My understanding also is that two district justices can come together and jointly apply to the Minister to transfer them.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that section 2 is really a sort of bringing together of something that is already there and which has been included in two Acts already, but I see nothing in this Bill in relation to assignment of duties to district justices, so I wonder what is the arrangement.  My understanding of the arrangement is that a district justice can be transferred by way of swop with another district justice provided he is willing.  The power of the Government is limited in so far as no district justice, Circuit Court judge or High Court judge can be removed without a two-thirds majority.  If the Government feel that a district justice, say, in Drogheda is not doing the job as they would like him to do it, they should have the right to transfer him to Mayo or Kerry or somewhere, where particular circumstances may determine that while he could be doing harm in one place he might not be doing that harm somewhere else.  I am talking in terms of one black sheep.  My understanding is that he cannot be transferred except with his permission.  We have here a Courts Bill and the Minister for Justice in relation to this Bill should not be afraid to come into this House and seek that power on behalf of himself and his Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am offering the observation in all seriousness.  Can the Minister confirm that my interpretation is correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct, yes, and it adds to the principle of the independence of the judiciary.  It would be wrong that the Executive should have the power, so to speak, to discipline judges by arbitrary transfers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, if he so consents, but not otherwise, he can be transferred.  The phraseology of this section should be spelled out far more clearly in that regard.  It should be seen in the enactment that this power to transfer is only a power which the judge himself enjoys rather than a power which the Government appear to have. The impression given in section 2 (4) is that the Government can transfer a judge from one place to another provided the judge consents.  The real situation is that the judge can transfer himself from one place to another provided the Government consent.  That is pretty well an accurate assessment of the situation as I see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister in his term of office over the last four years has had any reason on a personal basis or as a member of the Government to be in any way displeased with decisions of the High Court, Circuit Court or District Court, and I fully accept that being displeased with decisions is not a sufficent reason for a Government to take what the Minister would describe as disciplinary action. We are talking specifically about 59 individuals.  We have some temporary Circuit Court judges at present and as far as I can see from the Minister's speech there is no limit to the number of Circuit Court judges who can be appointed provided it appears to the Government that such a step is necessary. The Bill was not necessary from that point of view.  We have not, as far as I know, reached our limit in the appointment of temporary district justices.  We have five at present and under the existing legislation we can have up to nine temporary district <Col N="1202" /> justices.  The only true purpose there can have been for this legislation is the question of getting an extra High Court judge.  I would be glad if the Minister would tell us why he does not seek this power which basically I have invited him to seek in relation to this Bill.</P>

My information is that there was a deficit of £166,000 on the county council's house building programme <Col N="1203" /> account on 31st December last and that the county council spent money out of overdraft accommodation at the request of the Minister in providing houses last year, despite the fact that the Coalition Government deliberately failed to spend the total amount provided for housing in their capital budget programme for 1976.  I cannot understand how a council with a serious housing problem was allowed to go into a deficit of £166,000 having been asked by the Minister to provide houses out of overdraft accommodation. I believe that the failure to spend this money is due to the fact that the Government could not raise it.  The failure of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to control the price of building and construction materials has aggravated the situation.  The building industry, which has such great potential to relieve the serious unemployment situation as well as the lack of housing for our young population, would be in better condition if the Government had spent this money on the provision of houses, schools, and on the maintenance and improvement of harbours, piers, roads and so on. Most of our roads cannot carry heavy traffic and certainly they will not be in a position to do so within the next year or two.  If the money had been spent on all these things the country would be better off.  This situation is difficult to understand and I believe the reason the money was not spent was that the Government could not come up with the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Far more money will be required now, because apart from inflation more money must be invested in the building industry.  About 50 per cent of our population is under 25 years of age and 40 per cent under 21 years of age.  This means that the need for houses is increasing and will be substantial in a few years.  There has been no real economic or physical planning in respect of the provision of schools, roads, piers, harbours and factories. There is no overall economic plan to aid the building and construction industry.  More money should be provided for the industry.  The kernel of the whole problem is the Government's <Col N="1204" /> failure to cut the cost of building materials.  Rising costs are of great concern to those engaged in the construction industry and to builders providers. It is virtually impossible to quote for any worth while project because unless the materials are put aside at the time of quotation, the quotation could be out by anything between 10 and 30 per cent when the materials are delivered a few months hence.  Last night I quoted examples of price increases.  Nails have gone from 10p to 25p a pound and door knockers from £1.25 to £5 each.  It is impossible for builders and for those supplying builders to make provision to meet these increases.</P>
    <P>In relation to the situation within the Kerry County Council, I am not satisfied with the position and I do not accept for one moment that the Kerry County Council wrote out a cheque for £38,000 and sent it back to the Department of Local Government. My information is that there was a deficit, and I stand over that.  It was unfair of the Minister last night, even if he was speaking off the record to say that Kerry County Council had not spent £200,000 or £300,000 last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more than amazed to see this motion on the Order Paper.  It has appeared a couple of times.  Obviously the Opposition are in poor shape and they have not much to criticise this Government for when they have to be repetitive by bringing up the same motion, despite the fact that they get their answer from the Minister every time.  They seem to be like a punch drunk boxer hitting the ropes and coming back for more punishment.  No doubt they will get the punishment they richly deserve when the Minister replies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Government came into office they undertook a housing programme of 25,000 houses a year.  The Government have concentrated their efforts in the local authority sector in particular, that area of greatest need. As a member of the Dublin local authority I can say that we have got more than our share, as the figures prove.  Only a little more than four <Col N="1205" /> years ago, in 1972, the allocation was £6.5 million, whereas this year we will receive £26 million.  This, in itself, is a clear indication of how seriously the Government regard the question of housing and of the building industry as a whole.  We have not followed the policy of our predecessors in regard to the guaranteed housing programme which was another name for inferior type houses, houses on which in the years ahead vast sums of money will have to be spent in order to maintain them.  When we provide homes we provide good houses.  For years our predecessors talked of centre city development but they refused time after time to sign the plan put forward by the corporation.</P>
    <P>On assuming office the present Minister appointed a housing co-ordinator for Dublin city and county and for the Dún Laoghaire area with the purpose of having houses built in the centre city area.  The result is that there are new houses in some central city areas and there are plans in this regard for Clanbrassil Street, City Quay and the cattle market area, to name a few.  It would have been expedient politically for the Government to say that it would be too expensive to build houses in these areas, that the building should take place out in the country, but we were committed to the preservation of the city centre. We did not indulge in the type of vague promises that emanated from the Opposition in this regard.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil talk of employment but let me remind them that during the halcyon days of the sixties when there was so much talk of great economic miracles, there were created 12,000 grant-aided jobs per year, whereas during a period of international economic recession we have succeeded in providing 21,000 grant-aided jobs. Let us compare this figure with the alleged economic miracles of the sixties.  There is no point in the Opposition endeavouring to tell us that we are falling down in so far as employment is concerned.  Admittedly, there have been job losses but these were in protected industries and, as a result of the blast of free trade it was inevitable that some of those jobs <Col N="1206" /> would go to the wall.  However, the Government in their budgetary policy have been taking steps to correct the situation.</P>
    <P>There is more capital available now for schools, factories and for general development.  During the past number of months there has been a significant upturn in the construction industry. There has been forward planning in regard to factories and, as a result of the various tax concessions, new businesses are opening while existing ones are expanding.  In the months ahead the futility of the Fianna Fáil motion will become more evident.</P>
    <P>Now that we are on the threshold of the recovery that we all knew would come about, there is nothing to stop this Government from getting on with the job of expanding the economy.  There has been a cutback in office development and in major industrial development and, basically, this is the reason for any cutback there may be in the construction industry but the Government are not responsible for that situation because they have been pouring money into local authority houses, into schools development and for such projects as roads and water and sewerage schemes.  The outlook for 1977-78 is good.  The people will not be fooled by the motion that has been tabled by Fianna Fáil.  At the next general election the electorate, having regard to our record in housing and in the various other areas, will undoubtedly give us the mandate to continue with our programme for a further five years.  The Minister for Local Government has proved himself to be the most able Minister ever to hold this portfolio.  His initiative, his drive and his foresight have enhanced his reputation.  He has the ability to get on with the job despite such an obstacle as an economic recession.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that we are embarking again on industrial development and taking into consideration our housing programme, there must be great confidence for the future of the building industry.  In tabling this motion the Opposition are having a last grasp at the straw in an effort to gain some political advantage but <Col N="1207" /> there is no such advantage for them in this.  They are failing miserably in the various motions they are tabling.  The effect of these motions is merely to enhance the Government's standing.</P>
    <P>We, on this side of the House, are looking forward to a general election so that we may embark again on a four or five year planned programme of good housing and that we may be enabled to put new heart into the city. As a member of the corporation I am proud of the development in this area and I compliment the Minister on his achievements in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening we heard Deputies Faulkner and O'Leary deal comprehensively with the housing problem in so far as the national scene is concerned.  There is not much time at my disposal this evening but I shall devote that time to a review of the Dublin situation and to reiterating what I said before in regard to the Government's housing policy.  Their policy must be one of the greatest disasters in the history of the city because it is a policy based on a misconception of how the problems should be solved within the city.  The two requirements were, first, the provision of many new dwellings, and of course many new dwellings have been built.  The second was the preservation of existing housing stocks and this is where the Government are falling down because they cut back on repair grants which makes it more difficult for a person in the city to keep a house in good order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, Dublin Corporation have over 2,000 dwellings under construction and about 19 different schemes, but most of these are in the outer suburban areas.  If we could finish those 2,000 dwellings in a year it would be a major contribution towards solving the housing problem but one must remember that we lose about 1,000 dwellings every year through obsolescence, street widening, bad planning decisions and this reduces the total number of houses provided but it also leaves the inner city almost denuded of houses because the houses lost are naturally in the older part of the city. We always lost some houses; some had to be demolished because they <Col N="1208" /> became too old but I state emphatically that the present Government policy on housing will lead to a major disaster insofar as the rebuilding of the centre of the city is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said time and again that he wanted to rebuild the centre of Dublin, and it is the ambition of many to see this happen, but I think that a close look at the present situation will show that while local authority dwellings are being built in the Dublin area by Dublin Corporation very few are being built in the inner city area and therefore we will see a lopsided housing policy of suburban expansion and suburban sprawl, but the older parts of the city are not being renewed and therefore you will have the social problem arising from an ill conceived housing policy.  You will have disruption and uprooting of families who want to live in the old city areas.  They do not want to move, as they have lived there for all, or the greater part of their lives.  This social upheaval will result because the Government are not carrying out the two essential requirements of a successful housing drive&mdash;building new flats and houses and also preserving as far as possible existing housing stocks.</P>
    <P>We are awaiting a report from the Minister on the condition of the existing housing stock.  So far we have not seen it but any Deputy or member of a Dublin local authority is very well aware of the pressures on the existing housing stock and the number of houses becoming obsolescent due to the fact that in many cases people cannot afford to keep them in proper condition. These houses fall into decay and must be demolished eventually either for safety reasons or because the families have fled from that district. We then see applications for office blocks or other types of development. What we are witnessing is the decay of housing in the inner city areas.  It would be correct to say that there are thousands of unemployed building workers in the city but what I want to deal with essentially tonight is the fact that because of Government policy in cutting back on housing grants they are contributing to the further decay of centre city areas of Dublin.  That is <Col N="1209" /> a very wrong policy both from a planning and aesthetic point of view, but mostly from the social point of view in that we are allowing the city centre to decay further and families to move to the suburbs.</P>
    <P>This can have tremendous ill effects on people who have lived in the older areas such as Inchicore.  Ringsend or inner city areas.  The local authority house in the city now cost about £15,000.  I would not cavil at money spent on flats or houses in the inner city area; indeed I would support the provision of more money for more houses in that area, but this is not happening.  Therefore we will see a greater social problem created for families in this city than will be solved by the housing progress&mdash;if you like to call it that&mdash;in the outer suburbs.  If we lose 1,000 dwellings per year we are compensated to some extent by the number of casual vacancies occurring through families dying out, emigrating or moving to other areas of their own accord.  But the point is: by how much are we reducing the housing waiting list by our present operation? I ask the Minister to deal specifically with this.  Are we reducing the total to any appreciable extent?  We are certainly housing some families in better conditions but, while awaiting the latest figures which will be available next month, I am concerned about the actual waiting list which stood at about 5,000 applications.</P>
    <P>I feel that in the present housing operation we are not cutting into that waiting list.  Therefore, we have young people getting married who may never be able to buy their own houses because the Minister has not increased the SDA loans for a considerable time. He may well say that the new, low mortgage scheme exists but that is very restrictive in its application or as regards those who qualify.  A young couple wanting to get married cannot avail of the scheme nor can they avail of the SDA loan scheme because the maximum there is £4,500 and the income limit is £40 per week.  As I pointed out before, if one qualified under this scheme one could not afford to buy a house and if you could afford to buy the house you would not <Col N="1210" /> qualify.  To all intents and purposes the SDA loan scheme is dead.  I do not know why this should be, why the Government did not put more money into it.  In fact, the Minister said here that he had withdrawn money from that scheme and put it&mdash;I think&mdash;into sanitary services.  The money put into sanitary services was put to good use, but the point is we are not reducing the housing waiting list in this city.</P>
    <P>It may be the fault of economics or the fault of the system, or it may be historical reasons which drive people into the bigger cities.  We will always have migration into the cities and, whether we like it or not, we have to cater for those people.  At present we are not doing that.  We are facing a real crisis.  Young couples have little hope of obtaining a dwelling at a rent they can afford.  Therefore they become the victims of landlords of Flatland who will not even apply for planning permission to convert their houses into separate apartments.  If they did that, they would be entitled to a grant even beyond the limits laid down recently by the Minister.  Because of our laws and because of the colossal demand for housing, landlords are creating flats in their houses without planning permission, not proper flats, not self-contained flats.  What are young people to do who want to get married and settle down and who cannot live with their in-laws?  This burden is becoming intolerable for many of our young people.  What are we offering them? We are not offering them any hope whatsoever.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say he can justify his claims in relation to housing, but I say if he devotes his time to dealing with the housing problem in this city he will find we are offering very little towards the solution of the housing problem.  Most Deputies want to see the housing problem reduced to minimum proportions.  The Government's policy is so disastrous that they are doing more harm than good in the centre city areas of Dublin.  The houses we are losing through obsolescence are not being replaced in the centre city areas. Many houses are now boarded up because the cost of maintaining them is too great.  The local authorities have <Col N="1211" /> to act in the interests of the health of the people.  Very often they have to put a closing order on those houses and say they are unfit for human habitation. Having done that, very often they find it very difficult to offer accommodation to families affected by that order.</P>
    <P>Time and again we on this side of the House have called for a massive investment towards the rebuilding of the centre city area.  There is little sign that this is being done.  About three major schemes are under way.  One of these schemes in my own area was planned as far back as eight years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Were it not for the foresight of the Fianna Fáil Government the Minister would not have some of his schemes under way today. No matter what information the Minister <Col N="1212" /> has been given, the scheme I am talking about was planned eight years ago.  There are probably other schemes in the same category.  This was planned during the term of the previous Government because we saw the great need for housing in the inner suburbs. I speak the truth and not an untruth when I state that.  I defy contradiction on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I defy responsible contradiction. When we criticise the Minister about housing he gets rather petulant and will not listen to criticism.  Anything I say here tonight is said in the hope that he may learn something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not learn from Fianna Fáil preaching to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not preaching. We have a right to speak here on housing.  If the Minister is touchy on the subject of housing, that cannot be helped.  Unless the Minister changes his policy, unless he puts more money into the rebuilding of the centre city area, it will be further denuded of houses.  I do not say it is anybody's fault that we lose houses through obsolescence or street widening, but the point is we should be replacing them as near as possible to where they have been lost. Sociologists tell us that to uproot people from traditional housing areas and send them out into the newer surburbs is not the best social policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise we must have some outer suburban development.  We cannot build all the houses in the city. We want a planned programme and a planned policy from the Government so that, with the development of the new suburbs and the dormitory towns, there will be urban renewal.  This city is going through many changes at the moment.  It is up to us in Parliament to ensure that in rebuilding the city we have a balanced housing programme.  As I say, we have to build in the outer suburban area.  This is inevitable because the population is increasing.  Very shortly we will have over one million people in the greater <Col N="1213" /> Dublin area and therefore we have to build outside the city boundary.</P>
    <P>The Minister should remember the local authority are the only body in Dublin city who can provide housing in the inner city area, because there is very little land left for private development. We see very few private houses being built because the land is not there.  A small number of luxury type flats are being built and I suppose they contribute something to the general housing programme.  The onus is on Dublin Corporation to redevelop and renew the centre city areas.  The Government must back up the efforts of Dublin Corporation to achieve the revitalisation of the centre parts of this old city and real urban renewal.</P>
    <P>This would not only solve the social problem bad housing creates, but it would also give a much-needed fillip to the employment in this city.  Last night Deputy B. Desmond read advertisements for employment in the building trade.  I was glad to see such advertisements, but if every job advertised last night had been filled this morning to what extent would the unemployment figures have been cut? By very little indeed.</P>
    <P>The older part of Dublin, the inner city, needs houses.  Housing statistics may look impressive, but unless we make efforts to maintain existing houses we are defeating our own ends. If you built houses only in the outer suburbs, houses in the inner city area may fall into decay and be converted into office blocks.  When we are in Government we will have an imaginative housing policy.  We will make sure that the people who want to live in the city will be rehoused within the confines of the inner suburbs.  Any Government which has the will can prepare such a policy.</P>
    <P>If we house our families in the outer suburbs we will be making the same mistake made in many crosschannel cities where they allowed houses to be replaced by office blocks and showrooms.  In those cities from 5 o'clock on Friday evening until 9 o'clock on Monday morning the city centres are dead because people no longer come in.  If we are to have a living city, people must live in the <Col N="1214" /> inner suburbs.  I realise the Minister is pursuing a policy which is providing many more much-needed new dwellings, but unless he preserves existing houses, he is defeating his own ends.</P>
    <P>The Minister might consider increasing the SDA loans so that it would be possible for people to purchase houses in the city.  This would ensure that these houses would not fall into decay.  At the moment any house in the city area, no matter how small, is sold for a fantastic price.  The smallest house could cost £7,000 or £8,000.  If one qualified for an SDA loan on such a house, it would amount to £4,500. Where would a young couple find the rest of the money needed to meet the legal costs, furnish the house as well as the deposit?  Might I suggest that the Minister give attention to the renewal of the heart of this city?  When that is done we can boast of the progress we have made on housing.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that there is more to a housing policy than bricks and mortar; there is also a social policy.  One of our greatest social aims should be to fulfil the housing needs of our people.  I would go even further and suggest that if we could end the housing shortage in this city we would get rid of many of the problems besetting a number of young married couples, and older couples too.  The basis of a real social policy is good housing.  We have the workers to build these houses.  We have the building sites in the inner city.  What we need now is the wisdom to map out a programme of a balanced drive on the housing front so that we will have suburban development being carried out, probably to a greater extent than development in the inner city areas; but we must have both together because, if not, we will have a lopsided policy.  Many people living in the older city areas do not want to live in areas many miles outside the city.  Anybody who represents such an area can tell of the heartbreak suffered by these people when they are being moved to the County Dublin area.</P>
    <P>There is no reason for rancour in a housing drive.  We should be uniting our efforts to ensure that we have the <Col N="1215" /> best possible housing for this city.  I am speaking only about this city because Deputies Faulkner and J. O'Leary dealt with this problem as it affected other areas.  I feel very strongly about housing in the inner city.  My remarks this evening were put forward not to score points off the Minister, because there is no sense in that, but to direct his attention to what needs to be done in the centre city areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>A long time ago Homer posed the question: and what so tedious as a twice told tale?  I could tell him that a tale told four times is twice as tedious.  For the fourth time in a very short period we have had a sterile debate on housing.  This time the same group of Fianna Fáil speakers switched to the building industry and made the same tedious arguments with a type of half-truth which is very difficult to refute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am amazed at the abysmal ignorance of some of the people who spoke last night and tonight.  When I was in Opposition I learned that the first thing to do when going into a debate with a Minister, because he would have the benefit of official statistics, was to get the facts, use them, and, without rancour, have these matters dealt with.  That is not Fianna Fáil's way.  They come into this House and from the word go heap as much derision as they can summon by twisting and slanting their own type of statistics to give the impression that they are stating facts.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The last person I thought I would see in this House tonight attempting to make a case about lack of money in housing or failure to do the best for housing in this city and county was any Deputy from Dublin.  I did not dream that Deputy Seán Moore would have the temerity to come in here again and make a case about housing in Dublin because he represents the constituency of Dublin South-East which at the time of the 1971 census had a population, largely working class, of 56,588. During the last 16 years of Fianna Fáil rule the magnificent total of six <Col N="1216" /> council houses was built by Dublin Corporation in Irishtown/Ringsend; six houses in 16 years.</P>

      <P>I am giving facts and Deputy Moore can check them in the corporation if he finds that he does not agree with them.  One hundred and fifty seven houses are now being built at Pigeon House Road on a site acquired by the gentleman who was appointed housing co-ordinator about three years ago, Mr. Molloy, and for which plans were prepared by the NBA in 1975.  There was a statement here tonight that there were plans drawn up eight years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There were not; their is absolutely no truth in that.  There might have been a suggestion that houses should be built there.  Fianna Fáil could never find any money to deal with the working class people of this city; the place for them was way out, as far out as they could bring them.  Deputy Moore has been talking about taking people out of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Of course it was a terrible thing but it was the solution Fianna Fáil had for the working classes of Dublin&mdash;bring them out to the edge of the city.  They went out to places like Ballyfermot, which was out in the country at the time, and they made a fine area out of it.  But the distances such people had to travel in and out of the city were too much; the second and third generation are now getting used to it.</P>
      <P>To hear somebody like Deputy Moore, who should know better, saying that we were preventing people from living in the area in which they would like to live because all their friends and relatives had lived there is utter nonsense.  I am surprised that somebody with the experience he should have should talk like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1217" /> Let us come to the question of what way money is being spent in Dublin. In the year 1969-70 the amount of capital made available to Dublin Corporation from the Local Loans Fund was £6.669 million; 1970-71 £5.077 million; 1971-72 £5.200 million and 1972-73 £6.500 million, a total of £23,446 million for those years.  Then the National Coalition took over.  In 1973-74, our first year in office, the figure was £8.560 million; in the nine months of 1974 £8.500 million; 1975 £11.350 million and 1976 £21.350 million&mdash;a total of £49.760 million in the three years and nine months of the National Coalition.  This year Dublin Corporation will have almost £26 million compared with the miserly £6 million given when we took over. Would Deputy Moore get a ball-frame and start counting because obviously he is unable to count the figures when he sees them.  Otherwise he would not be making such a damned fool of himself here this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>You can have inflation anywhere you like.  Can the Deputy show me how with inflation in a period of four years £23.446 million is equal, in a period of less than four years, to almost £50 million?  I would like to know where Deputy Moore feels there has been an unfair allocation with regard to inflation and Dublin County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We might briefly deal with that because I am sure we will be hearing the sweet voice of Deputy Raphael Burke before the night is out.  In 1969-70 Dublin County got £.806 million; in 1970-71 £.676 million; in 1971-72 £1.537 million and in 1972-73 £3.348 million, making a total of £6.367 million for those four years. In 1973-74 the figure was £2.584 million; in the nine months of 1974 £4.003 million; in 1975 £8.510 million and in 1976 £8.173 million, a total of £23.270 million.  And the figure has gone up again this year.  Therefore, Dublin County Council, like Dublin Corporation, have got at least their share and a little more.  As a matter of fact, the Dublin area got 42 per cent of the entire country allocation last year and I am not apologising to anybody <Col N="1218" /> for having given it.  But I do resent people like Deputy Moore, who represents portion of Dublin city, coming in here trying to decry it instead of standing up and saying, as a Dublin man, that he was happy such consideration was being given to Dublin.</P>
    <P>To take Dún Laoghaire, the figure for 1969-70 was £.175 million; in 1970-71 £.939 million; in 1971-72 £.180 million; in 1972-73 £.397 million; in 1973-74 £.295 million; in 1974, in nine months, £.938 million; in 1975 £1.420 million and in 1976 £1.290 million. Therefore, it has risen from the last four years of Fianna Fáil administration from £1.691 million to £3.943 million in the first three years and nine months of the national Coalition. Anybody who says that Dublin city, Dublin County or Dún Laoghaire are not getting a fair share just does not know what he is talking about.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore talks about the failure to do the right thing with the city centre.  He kept hopping from one foot to the other, like a hen on a hot griddle, asking were we going to do the wrong thing.  He was not quite sure whether the right thing to do was to rebuild the city centre; should be leave it the way it was or should we bring&mdash; he was cute enough not to use the word&mdash;private houses in there, or was there any way in which there would be too many corporation houses built? Was that what he was coming at?  I can tell Deputy Moore that the local authority houses being built now in Dublin and elsewhere are houses in which anybody would be proud to live.  They are not substandard by any yardstick.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is very angry tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They are houses in which anybody would be glad to live.  The ones being built in the city centre will be a monument to the National Coalition Government because they are well built, well planned, well placed and, indeed, they have chimneys.  I might point out to Deputy Moore that it is only a very short time since I signed a number of CPOs for city centre areas. I was horrified to find then that one of my predecessors, a Fianna Fáil <Col N="1219" /> Minister, in 1968 refused to sign a CPO for an area Deputy Moore represents. Had he signed it it is possible that houses could have been built then in the city centre in the swinging sixties when, according to Fianna Fáil, there was money for everything.  They did not seem to spend it on housing the working class anyway.</P>
      <P>Deputy John O'Leary very rightly pointed out that what I said last evening appeared to suggest that Kerry County Council had returned £300,000 last year.  In fact there was a difference involved of £38,000.  The money which Kerry County Council did not use&mdash;&ldquo;saved&rdquo; I think is the word they used &mdash;was occasioned by the fact that they got an authorised £1,710,000 and the actual money spent, taking overdraft into account, was £1,672,000, leaving a difference of £38,000.  If Deputy O'Leary checks that with Kerry County Council he will find it to be correct.  I am sorry that what I said last night could appear as if I was saying that they had in fact returned £300,000 to the Exchequer.  The figure which they did not, and could have, spent was £38,000.</P>
      <P>A number of figures given referred to the amount of money which Deputies said should be expended on SDA loans, and Deputy Faulkner spoke repeatedly of the £30 million which Fianna Fáil would put into the Exchequer in the sweet by-and-by when they got into power. I would remind them that the figure required to raise the loan and income limits to £7,500 and £4,000 would be £30 million.  That swallows up the £30 million straight away, although we have not been told where the £30 million would come from, whether it would come from income tax.  I do not accept the fairy tale that in some way, by playing the two ends against the middle, it is possible to create it out of nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner ignored completely the job creation package in this year's budget which includes an extra £20 million for the construction of schools, other public buildings, roads and factories.  The Deputy should also remember that in January the banks announced that they would make available <Col N="1220" /> a further £20 million for house purchase loans.  I suggest, therefore, that Fianna Fáil should bring their September, 1976, document up to date because it seems to be getting very much out of date.</P>
    <P>Listening to Deputy Faulkner last night one would get the impression that the economic difficulties&mdash;from which, fortunately, we are emerging&mdash;can be attributed entirely to the National Coalition Government and that if Fianna Fáil were in power these things would not have happened.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  If Fianna Fáil were here I would be pitying the ordinary people of the country because I have lived through successive Fianna Fáil Governments in hard times.  I do not know if any of the Deputies who have been talking has had experience of working on a building site during a recession period. I did, and I know what Fianna Fáil do when the chill winds of economic recession hit.  Fianna Fáil decide to do their bookkeeping at the expense of the people at the bottom of the pile. There are more of those in the country, and a little bit taken from each of them can amount to a big lot at the end. That is what they have always done and what they will do again if they get the chance.</P>
    <P>Across the Irish Sea, in the UK, output in the construction industry fell by about 2 per cent in 1976 when work levels dropped by 6 per cent compared with 1975.  In 1974, output fell there by 10 per cent.  According to a recent article in the <i>Financial Times,</i> industrial leaders there believe that there is no hope of an end to the worst postwar recession before 1980.  In the nine EEC countries, increases in housing completions in 1973-75 per 1,000 of the population were recorded only in Ireland and in France.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have been doing a lot of blowing inside and outside the House about what their housing policy would be.  Let us get the facts straight. We must keep repeating this until it is understood by those who made the statements.  In the 16 years of Fianna Fáil administration ended March, 1973, a total of 167,136 new houses were completed, an average of 10,446 a year. <Col N="1221" /> In the past four years the National Coalition Government completed more than 100,000 houses, an average of 25,000 a year.  The extraordinary thing is that Fianna Fáil now try to give the impression that it was their policy to build at least 25,000 houses per year. The position is that a statement made in the autumn of 1971, by Deputy Molloy when he was Minister for Local Government, indicated that the number of houses which would be built would be 15,000 to 17,000 per year in the mid seventies &ldquo;subject to the resources we can generate for the purpose&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We have now passed the mid-seventies and we have been building 25,000 houses plus.  More than 14,000 houses were completed in only three of the 35 years of Fianna Fáil administration.  In their best year, 1972, fewer houses were built than in any of the four years of the present Government's administration.  In regard to the 1972 figures, I repeat that the figure of less than 22,000 houses which Deputy Faulkner mentioned last night would not have been so high were it not that there was no money to pay the housing grants at the end of the previous year and that 2,000 houses were held over because the grants could not be paid for them.  The real figures were 17,000 odd and 19,000 odd.  We will give them the benefit of the 2,000 which they had built in the previous year and carried forward, but if they want to claim almost 22,000 houses they are still over 3,000 houses fewer than our average for each of the four years we have been in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to repeat, because it was challenged last night as on several previous occasions, the exact statement of Deputy Lynch in 1975. First of all, our International rating in dwellings completed per 1,000 population in 1969/73&mdash;average 4.0 per 1,000 &mdash;was the worst of 23 OECD countries. Yet Deputy Jack Lynch contended that &ldquo;There was no necessity whatsoever for a crash housing programme&rdquo;. <Col N="1222" /> We are now well up with the leaders in OECD, with 7.7 houses per 1,000 in 1976.</P>
    <P>Speaking in the Dáil on 17th December, 1975, Deputy Lynch said:</P>
    <P>We undertook in our housing programme, published in the late sixties and early seventies, that by 1972-73 we would have reached 25,000 houses output, which was reached.  There was no necessity whatever for a crash programme as the Minister for Local Government announced.  What has gone wrong is that there are too many local authority houses being built...</P>
    <P>From October, 1973, in the last quarter of 1974 and right through to the last quarter of 1976, we had howling by the spokesmen for Local Government in Fianna Fáil, first Deputy Molloy and later Deputy Faulkner, and by Deputy John O'Leary on one or two occasions, that we were not building anything like the number of houses that were needed and that we could not possibly reach 25,000 in any of those years. They got a certain amount of support at that time from spokesmen for the CIF.</P>
    <P>Eventually we had a working party set up which investigated the way in which the number of houses was calculated, and the extraordinary thing is that we were doing it in the same way as Fianna Fáil had done it in the previous 12 years.  Of course, there was nothing wrong with it when they were doing it.  The working party reported they were satisfied that the figures for 1975 were correct subject to a 3-month time lag for grant cases. Recently, because of the change in the grants system, it became necessary to seek an alteration.  In consultations with the ESB and the CIF it was agreed that the houses connected by the ESB, who would certify they were connected and finished by certain dates, would be taken in future for statistical purposes.  I was surprised to hear some of the CIF people being doubtful about this and saying afterwards that they did not think it was the right way.  In fact, they were a party to the arrangement.  We cannot <Col N="1223" /> have it both ways when it comes to these things.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the amount of money available for housing I should like to repeat that last year we gave out 3,000 more loans under the SDA than were given out in the last year Fianna Fáil were in office.  Fianna Fáil should remember that.  The figure is 6,732 as against 3,781.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to that shortly after the National Coalition took office the amount of money available from building societies was very small, less than £40 million in 1974, but building societies last year produced £100 million and since they have exceeded £21 million of net inflow in the first three months of this year we can expect a higher amount available this year.  In addition, one set of banks put up £20 million.  I know that one, in particular, without publicising the fact, are making money available to customers who need it.  In addition, we have assurance companies and various other ways by which money is made available.  The question of whether or not the SDA loans have been wiped out has been mentioned.  I should like to state that local authorities have 10,000 applications on hands for SDA loans this year and we also have the necessary money coming from building societies available to build houses.  The suggestion that there is no money available is a lot of &ldquo;hooey&rdquo;.  Fianna Fáil would like to make a song and dance about it but the facts are that they are, as usual, talking through their hats.</P>

      <P>The Minister described this debate as a sterile one and I have no doubt that it is but through no fault of ours.  The fact is that to all intents and purposes we have had the same speech from the Minister as we had in previous debates on this topic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister continues to close his eyes to the problems involved and, therefore, any hope we had of an improvement in the situation while this Government are in office has been killed.  The usual effort has been made to put the best possible complexion on a series of financial provisions none of which carries any credibility.  The one noticeable thread throughout the Minister's speech was that he was finding it more difficult to defend his position in regard to the condition of this great industry.  The fact is that 25,000 building and construction workers are unemployed and that 4,000 fewer houses were built in 1976 compared with 1975.  The fact is that there was a drop of 58 per cent in the number of houses built in January this year compared with January last year.</P>
      <P>I am not surprised that the Minister endeavoured to stick to particular instances rather than debate the general problems which face this industry. In relation to the money available for housing, in a year when we are told that money is being made available to create job opportunities and in a year when there is such shocking unemployment, the amount being made available is a scandal.  The figures in the public capital programme show that in 1975, £115.14 million was available and in 1976 the figure was £105.7 million while the amount allocated for 1977 is £102.13 million.  In current terms therefore there is a severe drop of £13 million between 1975 and 1977 or 11 per cent.  If we are to take the figures in real terms we find that the amount allocated for housing in 1975 was £151.14 million, in 1976, £87.1 million and this year it is £74.3 million, a drop of £40 million between 1975 and 1977, or 35 per cent.  That is taking place at a time when employment has fallen catastrophically and when there are long queues of building and construction workers outside employment exchanges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the money allocated towards road improvements and maintenance in real terms because it is only when we take that <Col N="1225" /> money in real terms, that is allowing for inflation, that we get a true picture. We find that £46.4 million was allocated in 1975, £42.9 million in 1976 and £43.6 million in 1977, a drop of £2.8 million between 1975 and 1977, or 6 per cent.  There are 1,000 fewer road workers employed than there were three or four years ago.  Is it any wonder that our roads are deteriorating or that complaints about the condition of roads are so loud wherever one goes. These complaints are made not only by motorists but also by the business community who recognise the need for top class roads if they are to compete in the industrial and commercial world of today.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that the public capital programme as far as the building and construction industry is concerned this year is supposed to contain extra money to improve a job situation which has been deteriorating so rapidly over the past two years.  In that context it is worthwhile considering the figures available.  In 1975, £268.75 million was spent and in 1976 the figure was £292.81 million while allocated for 1977 is a figure of £350 million.  This means an increase of £8.2 million between 1975 and 1977 or 31 per cent on current prices.  I should like again to look at the situation in real terms, allowing for inflation.  For 1975 £268.85 million was spent and in 1976 the figure was £244 million while the amount allocated for 1977 is £255 million, a reduction of £13.6 million or a fall of 5 per cent between 1975 and 1977.</P>

The most recent figures available to us are up in spite of the fact that the Minister for Finance in his budget statement in January stated that the underlying trends as far as unemployment was concerned was in the right direction.  We are now in April and we have a worse figure than we had at this time last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is small wonder that the Minister was unable to attempt to amend our motion.  Deputy Barry Desmond, in the face of 25,000 unemployed in the building and construction industry, endeavoured to make a case for the present deplorable situation.  However, he missed the whole point of the argument made by us because we are not only disturbed by the high unemployment figure in the industry but we are particularly perturbed because we know that this industry, if properly financed, is capable of providing new jobs quickly. It is disturbing that far from producing these jobs the industry is losing jobs at an unprecedented rate.  Deputy Barry Desmond referred to advertisements which building firms insert in the newspapers looking for workers but, as Deputy Moore pointed out, the total number is very small.  The fact is that there are approximately 5,000 firms in the business it would be strange if some advertisements were not inserted seeking employees.  The inroads these advertisements make on an unemployment situation of 25,000 is very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main point made by the Minister to bolster up his case is that over the last four years the Government have built 100,000 houses.  In our final years in office there was a consistent increase in the number of houses completed from more than 13,000 in 1970-71 to more than 15,000 in 1971-72 and more than 22,000 in 1972-73.  Plans had been made for further expansion.  Land had been acquired and houses were at the planning, the tender and the construction stages before the National Coalition took office.  Had it not been for all this careful preparation made by a Fianna Fáil Government the number of houses completed in the term of the National Coalition could not have been built.  From the earliest stage of a housing scheme to its completion takes a number of years.  On an average it takes about three years.  I know of schemes in my constituency one of which is near completion and was begun in 1971 while plans for another <Col N="1227" /> scheme which is about to commence were prepared in 1969.  The simple fact is that for their first three years in office the National Coalition housing operations were made possible by plans which had been prepared by Fianna Fáil when in office.</P>

      <P>The summer months are the most important ones for the industry and, in the course of this <Col N="1230" /> debate, we have shown clearly that the industry is now in a critical condition. It is clear, apart from the serious effect on the industry and the workers employed in it, that failure to settle the dispute would have severe repercussions throughout the economy.  We call on the Government to approach the matter in a positive and realistic manner.</P>
