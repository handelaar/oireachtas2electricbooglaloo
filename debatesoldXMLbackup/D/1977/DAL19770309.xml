    <Title>Select Committee on Health Services: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a Select Committee of Dáil Éireann consisting of 19 members to be nominated by the Committee <Col N="999" /> of Selection of whom seven shall be a quorum, be appointed with power to send for persons, papers and records&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  To consider the appropriate priority, in public spending terms, which should be accorded to the health services in the context of economic and social development generally, the competing demands of the other social services and the readiness of the community to pay for such services.</P>
    <P>(2)  To evaluate the adequacy of the existing services to meet the health requirements of the community, with due regard to demographic and other changes which may affect the demand for health services.</P>
    <P>(3)  To review the effectiveness of the existing organisational structure (including statutory bodies and voluntary agencies) for providing the health services and to identify any waste or abuse in the provision of the services.</P>
    <P>(4)  To review eligibility for the health services in relation to need.</P>
    <P>(5)  To examine and evaluate alternative ways of financing the health services having regard in particular to Exchequer budgetary constraints.</P>
    <P>(6)  To make recommendations on these matters.</P>
    <P>During debates in this House last year on the amendment of the Health Contributions Act and on the Health Estimate, there was, I think, a concensus within the House that a general review of our system of health services in all its aspects was desirable. Those debates touched on possible different ways of conducting such a review, without any definite conclusion being reached on its form. There was, however, agreement that all the interests involved in the complex system of health services should have an opportunity in some way of participating in it.</P>
    <P>The Government have considered different options for this review, one being a body which, as well as members <Col N="1000" /> of this House, would include representatives of the various interests involved in the health services.  However, these are very many and varied and the conclusion was reached that it would be better not to have a very large comprehensive body of the kind which would be needed if this approach were to be adopted.  Accordingly, the Government concluded that the best approach to a review of the health services lay in this House establishing a Select Committee.  I should mention however, that the decision on this form of review should not rule out all the organisations and other interests involved in the health services from making a contribution by way of evidence which should greatly influence the work of the Select Committee.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the proposed committee, which are included in the resolution, have been drafted so as to allow it to look at the health services in the broadest way and to consider all aspects of the services.  In addition, it would try to reach a general conclusion on how the people would view health care as a priority in relation to other services and to look at the effectiveness of the existing structures for organising the services and, of course, the financing of the services.  These are all matters which have been debated many times in recent years in this House and outside it.  I think that the proposed Select Committee should approach its work on the basis of taking as broad a view as possible of the problems arising in providing health care.  We all acknowledge that these problems do exist.  They exist for us and they exist for all developed countries.</P>
    <P>I am aware that my colleagues in many of our neighbouring countries are just as concerned as I am with the difficulties, within financial possibilities, of making available to the people the benefits of modern methods of health care.</P>
    <P>Before putting down the motion, I discussed the terms of reference of the proposed committee with Deputy Haughey and I am glad to say that he agreed with them.  Accordingly, I would hope that the House would give early approval to the proposal to set up the committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> I would also hope that the committee, when established, could make an early start on its work.  In this respect, I might be criticised for bringing forward the proposal to establish this committee at such a late time in this Dáil's term.  However, I would view this committee as having a task which will, for its completion, take some considerable time and, whether it had been set up some months ago or is set up now, it was unlikely to complete its work within this Dáil's term.  The problems which it must examine and the many views which it must consider would rule out its making very quick recommendations.</P>
    <P>I think, however, that it is important that this Dáil should commence this work.  While we cannot anticipate what the next Dáil might decide, there is nothing to stop it reconstituting a Select Committee to carry on from where the one which I now think we should establish had reached. Evidence taken and work done could be taken over by a new committee established by the next Dáil and I am sure that if such a new committee were established, it would have many of the members of the committee which I now propose that this House should set up.</P>
    <P>I do not wish, a Cheann Comhairle, to detain the House further at this stage, and have moved the motion in the confident expectation that the House will agree to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We in Fianna Fáil have decided to support the establishment of this new all-party Select Committee on health and we intend to participate fully in its work and to try to ensure that it will make a worth-while contribution to the development of a sound, satisfactory structure of health services.  We intend to nominate to represent us on this committee a carefully selected team of Deputies all of whom have a very special interest in and knowledge of our health services and who, together, will be widely representative of the various health board areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to express my appreciation of the Minister's approach in discussing with me and agreeing the terms <Col N="1002" /> of reference of the committee and also for his agreeing to discuss the situation in regard to a chairman of the committee.  As the Minister said there must be grave doubt in regard to the value of establishing this committee at this time&mdash;the closing stages of this Dáil.  It is extremely doubtful if the committee can achieve anything worth while before being dissolved with the Dáil.  Nevertheless, as a responsible Opposition it is our duty to support the committee.  In so far as the Minister has outlined what the committee might hope to achieve, we agree with him.  As an Opposition it is our duty to oppose policies and actions of the Government which seem to us to be unsuitable or detrimental and to point out mistakes.  It is for us to indicate where we see neglect, inefficiency, injustice and malpractice on the part of the Government. On the other hand, throughout the life of this Dáil we have supported and encouraged any policy that seemed worth while or beneficial.  We have put forward alternatives suggesting improvements or better lines of approach to various problems and issues.  Sometimes, perhaps, in the hurly-burly of parliamentary debate and processing we may be inclined to forget the underlying fact that the health of our people is of fundamental importance to the community and that the provision of the best health service possible that we as a community can afford is a basic obligation on both Government and Parliament.  In discharging that obligation we regard it as our duty to contribute as fully as our experience, our knowledge and our abilities permit, to the work of this committee.</P>
    <P>There are many areas in the administration of the health services and in the construction of policies in which there is room for disagreement, valid disagreement.  We reserve our right to disagree with the Government on any area of policy or administration where we deem it necessary to disagree or where we think we should criticise, oppose or propose.  I wish it to be understood and acknowledged that the establishment and the existence of this committee will not prevent normal Dáil treatment and processing <Col N="1003" /> of health questions and issues.  The committee must function side by side with the normal parliamentary process and not be in substitution for it.  We will not tolerate&mdash;I do not think the Minister would expect this of us&mdash;any sort of <i>sub judice</i> situation where discussion or debate would be sidetracked on the basis that something was being examined by the committee. It is not our intention to allow the committee to become a blind alley into which controversial issues are diverted.  On the other hand we believe that if used properly the committee can be effective in establishing a great deal of common ground and can be used to ascertain facts, to define problems, to identify deficiencies, to isolate prejudice, privilege and self-interest in existing structures and to set out certain priorities on which, perhaps, we could all agree.</P>
    <P>The time is opportune to look at our health services in an over-all economic context.  An attempt must be made to settle the place health will occupy in the national scale of expenditure, to decide what proportion of annual State expenditure should be devoted to Health.  This year 14 per cent of the current budget will be allocated to the health services.  Health is the largest single item in the current budget, slightly greater than the total amount being devoted to education, for instance. Looked at from another point of view, in 1977 we as a community will devote to the health services the equivalent of 6 per cent of our GNP. We must ask whether these are the right sort of relativities.  Should the over-all expenditure on health services be contained at this level?  If a stated percentage of the GNP were decided on the total amount available annually would increase in line with the national prosperity as reflected in the GNP. Such a system would have many attractions. It would ensure a certain degree of stability and consistency in the State's contribution to the financing of the health services.  A consistent approach in this vitally important area of national economics is absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the incredible mishandling <Col N="1004" /> of the situation in regard to the financing of the health services in 1976 must not be repeated.  During 1976 serious and widespread destruction occurred in this area and hardship was caused as a result of the inept way in which the Minister and his Department approached the health expenditure for the year.  Estimates were published at the beginning of the year which were stated categorically to be final, conclusive and unchangeable and on the basis of those estimates various institutions, agencies and organisations reached certain difficult decisions but towards the end of the year additional amounts were provided by way of supplementary estimate which meant that the hardship, the disruption and the dislocation need not have occurred at all.  That sort of stop-go situation, if at all possible, must be avoided in future. It results from bad budgeting and bad planning.  The ideal approach would be to have a gradually expanding budgetary provision which would be adequate to cater for the existing level of services in any year and at the same time to allow for some element of planned, phased expansion and improvement.</P>
    <P>Some total over-all State contribution could be decided on on an annual basis.  There would arise the question of how services which could not be catered for within that budget could be made available.  This brings in the question of voluntary effort or of some voluntary or compulsory insurance system or some system by way of private payment.  There is a variety of systems in many different countries, all of which will have to be studied and examined carefully by the committee. There is an almost infinite permutation and combination of systems which will present themselves to the committee for examination.</P>
    <P>A committee will have to examine, too, in a very searching way the cost benefit aspect of our health services. We must ask whether we are getting the greatest benefit possible for the greatest number of people possible from the expenditure involved.  It is regrettably true that in recent years very considerably increased expenditure has not brought better value and better services for the people with regard to health.  In many areas the cost <Col N="1005" /> of services has escalated but the quality of the services and their availability has disimproved, so that we cannot have any sort of comforting feeling that it is simply a matter of providing more money.  The lesson in recent years is that escalating costs and increased expenditures do not necessarily guarantee better services for more people.  I am not saying this in a party political sense.  There are far too many bottlenecks, delays and waiting lists in the existing structure of services.  In many cases at present services are theoretically available but in practice the waiting lists are so long that they are not available to the people to whom they are supposed to be available.</P>
    <P>I hope that at an early stage this committee will examine the structure of the general medical service.  We could all agree that there is a very urgent need for a much better administration of that service.  We would also agree that that service is perhaps the basic element in our health services. It is the service to which the greatest proportion of our population have to have recourse.  An efficient general medical service available to those who need it is essential for a proper structure of health services.  There are abuses, maladministration, duplication and overprescribing.  We all know that.  I hope that this select committee will carry out a very detailed, searching and comprehensive examination of the general medical service. There is not much argument now between us as to the level of eligibility for medical cards.  That will derive from an examination of overall costs.</P>
    <P>The only difference there might be between us is in regard to the priority that should be afforded to the general medical service in the allocation of funds as against other divisions of the general health service.  In the idiotic process which we have had to suffer there are instances of rising costs leading to an insupportable level of expenditures, followed by savage, indiscriminate cutbacks.  That sort of process will have to be avoided somehow in the future, because that approach does irreparable damage to the whole structure.  In that regard it is regrettable <Col N="1006" /> that the first thing that suffers in a cutback economy drive situation are the community services.  That is bad economics as well as being undesirable from the humanitarian and compassionate viewpoint.  I hope this committee will examine and devote a lot of attention to how to an increasing extent medicine and health can be brought out to the community, through community care programmes, so that we get away from this indiscriminate cutback situation where because of its nature the community care programmes lend themselves to the greatest retrenchment.</P>
    <P>There are very many areas to which this select committee will devote their attention.  It is important to have this committee.  Ultimately they will be working in a sort of situation where needs are infinite and resources are limited.  No country in the world could afford to provide for its people all the services that are technically and scientifically now available.  It is a question of sorting out priorities and taking tough decisions.  We have a structure at the moment which has its blemishes, its bottlenecks, its waiting lists, its inefficiencies and which has been from time to time subject to disruption and dislocation.  On the other hand it is on the whole a structure which has steadily improved over the years.  I hope the aim of this committee will be to ensure a planned, phased improvement. Since the Voluntary Health Board has been one of the great success stories of our recent health history, I hope the committee will look very seriously at expanding and developing the scope of the voluntary health organisation.  They will also have to give a great deal of attention to other methods of financing health expenditure, of enabling services to be provided in some way other than by direct State subvention.  If we go about it properly the establishment of this committee can be very beneficial.</P>
    <P>While I certainly have to complain to the Minister that this committee was not established at the start of this Dáil, I agree with him that, even at this late stage, setting it up now can have some benefit.  At least it can lay down some guidelines for the next <Col N="1007" /> Dáil.  I suppose the best service this Dáil can render at this stage is that we can put our experiences down on paper for the benefit of the incoming Dáil.  This is one area where we can do so.  It is worth while establishing the committee and getting some experience, in the time left to us, of the scope of the work and at least looking at the lines and the approach the committee might follow.</P>
    <P>Our agreement to participate fully in the work of this committee derives from our determination not to play party politics with health and not to let party political considerations influence our approach to the general welfare and to the people's health.  It was open to us to refuse our co-operation to the Minister in this way, to let him flounder on his own, and to leave him caught up in many of the problems which his ideological approach to health has created for him.  We have chosen not to do that.  We are offering our full constructive co-operation in making this committee work for the benefit of the people.  That is our primary duty as a responsible Opposition. We are fully prepared to co-operate with this committee and we welcome its establishment.  We also welcome the approach of the Minister in offering us full consultation in regard to its establishment and its terms of reference. We hope that if we establish it in that way and in that atmosphere it will, even in the short time left of this Dáil, make a worth while contribution to the administration of our health services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that this committee is being established not because I want to shed any of my responsibility as Minister for Health.  In the ultimate it will be the Government, on my advice, who will determine future health policy.  I welcome the statement of Deputy Haughey in volunteering, as he did previously to me, that they would agree to participate on this committee and to co-operate as fully as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy criticises me for not introducing this motion for the establishment of such a committee long ago, but this emanated from various discussions <Col N="1008" /> held in this House on legislation and on the Estimates.  It appeared clear to me from contributions from the Opposition and from this side that there was a necessity to have a review.  The original idea behind the Deputies' minds when that was introduced was that there would be a review of the health board system.  Indeed, it was suggested when health boards were established some five or six years ago that after that period there would be a review of the health board system.  It was obvious from contributions made in the House that there was a difference of opinion as to whether or not we should retain the present system, try to improve it, or revert to the county system.  My view at that time, although a decision did not have to be taken, was that our responsibility was to improve the present system so far as health administration is concerned rather than change back or try to devise some other system.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has indicated the type of questions that might be asked and the manner in which we should approach various things.  He will agree straight off that the terms of reference are very wide and there will be ample scope for the committee to examine every single aspect of the health service. I do not believe that the establishment of this committee and its workings should interfere with the normal process here in the Dáil whereby Deputies on the Opposition and on the Government benches can criticise or ask questions and not resort to the plea that these matters are <i>sub judice</i>.  I accept my full responsibility in the House and will certainly not avail of that ruse in order to evade my responsibility.  This committee has now been established in what one might call the last year of this Dáil.</P>

      <P>I do not want the Opposition to build a policy for me any more than Deputy MacEntee wanted the House to build a policy for him when he established his committee in 1962.  The Deputy should read Deputy Haughey's speech on this matter when he suggested that it would not be approached from a political point of view.  It is a political matter, but we can understand the difference between what Deputy Haughey wanted and it being, as the Deputy might suggest, making the health services a political football.  It is not my intention to do that and it never has been. All the evidence has been in the last four years that I did not want to make a political football out of it.  However, what Deputy Haughey has said is more or less a summary of what might be considered in this committee, the priorities, the percentage of gross national product which incidentally last year was not 6 per cent but was about 6.6 per cent, but I make no point about that.</P>

      <P>The Deputy did hark back to 1976 and suggested that there was incredible hardship in 1976 for the health boards and various other health institutions.  This is not so.  The Deputy tried to whip up that sort of a campaign in February or March of last year and it fell completely to the ground as far as my information is concerned because the health boards did manage pretty well in 1976 and the standards of 1975 continued in 1976. There were problems for the health boards and the other health institutions <Col N="1010" /> but from hindsight this exercise in trying to identify cases where economies could be made was a good one.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is entirely wrong.  He suggested that another £10 to £15 million would satisfy all the health institutions and then he went on to suggest that I restored that money in a Supplementary Estimate that I brought in some time in December of last year.  This was not an Estimate introduced in order to maintain the 1975 levels in 1976.  There was a Supplementary Estimate of £11.484 million in order to provide for increases in welfare allowances which had nothing at all to do with a restoration, as the Deputy suggested, of the services in 1976.  In that £11.484 million there were also increases in social welfare contributions.  Also included in that were increases in pay and the increased cost of the general medical service because more people got medical cards.</P>

The Deputy's campaign fell very fast and very flat when it was disproved and when the managers of the health boards agreed that, while there was some difficulty in providing economies in certain areas, by and large they managed pretty well in 1976.  It was not such a bad exercise.  It was not punishment. I did not mean it to be punishment or a reduction in health facilities in any of these institutions.</P>

      <P>The Deputy said this morning that more money was not the answer and value for money was the important thing.  I entirely agree with him.  It is a good thing that this exercise was engaged in, in 1976.  The <Col N="1012" /> Deputy also mentioned that people were legally entitled to certain services but the money was not there.  With that I agree.  If one looks at the 1970 Act, the most recent comprehensive Act, one will note that there are many services included in that Act which cannot be given at present because the money is not there.  The Deputy has conceded that quite a sizeable amount of money is provided for the year 1977.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is much more I need say.  Deputy Haughey has given a sort of preview of the work of this committee.  He was pretty correct and accurate in his assessment of what the committee should do.  I want to reiterate that it is not my intention to use this committee as an excuse in this House, or to evade my responsibilities. In the ultimate, when the committee reports it will be for the Government to decide what changes should be made in the health services&mdash;&mdash;</P>

All these things have to be threshed out by the committee.  I have no doubt they will do a pretty good job.  In the heel of the hunt it will be for the Government to decide whether or not the recommendations should be accepted and whether or not they could be implemented and, if so, in what manner.  I look forward to the establishment of the committee and trust that the task assigned to them will be completed as quickly as possible and that the recommendations will be a genuine reflection of the views of this House on the health services generally and particularly the financing of them.</P>

    <Title>Health Contributions (Amendment) Bill, 1977: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1013" /> The explanatory memorandum which has been circulated to Deputies indicates the object of the Bill, the population groups who are required to pay health contributions and the services to which they are entitled.  I do not propose, therefore, to deal again with those aspects in any great detail.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides solely for an increase in the present rates of health contributions and this, of course, is a normal annual occurrence.  Health contributions are 33p a week at present in the case of insured workers and £15 a year in other cases.  The increases proposed in the Bill are 6p a week and £3 a year, with effect from 1st April next.  This is an increase of roughly 20 per cent on existing rates.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the House has already agreed today that a Select Committee be appointed to examine, <i>inter alia,</i> alternative ways of financing the health services.  In the meantime, it is necessary to continue to avail of the existing financing sources which at present supplement the moneys provided from the Exchequer to meet the overall financial requirements of the health services.</P>
    <P>The most significant of these supplementary sources of finance is the health contributions scheme.  It is estimated that the revised rates of health contributions proposed in the present Bill will increase receipts from that source by £2.2 million in a full year and, in the current year, will bring in a total of £12.46 million.  Compared with a total non-capital health expenditure in 1977 of £316 million, this cannot, perhaps, be regarded as a very large contribution towards the cost of health services, but it represents, nevertheless, a substantial reduction in the amount which would otherwise have to be sought from the Exchequer to finance those services.</P>
    <P>Appropriations in aid of the Health Vote for 1977 include an estimated sum of £12.46 million from health contributions. This amount is based on estimates of the additional receipts anticipated from the increase in the present rates of health contributions provided for in this Bill.  The proposed increase in the contributions rates is roughly proportionate to the rise in the cost of the limited eligibility services <Col N="1014" /> since last year, when the rates of health contributions were last revised.  The estimated cost of the limited eligibility services in 1977 is about £220 million, which represents an increase of roughly 20 per cent on the corresponding figure for 1976 of £184 million.</P>
    <P>With regard to this expected increased cost of the limited eligibility services, Deputies will be aware that the provision made in this year's Health Estimate is designed to ensure the maintenance of 1976 health services levels during 1977, and that, in addition, a further £10 million of current expenditure has been made available to improve and develop the health services in ways consistent with the Government's job-creation programme. These additional moneys will be used to open new units already completed or due for completion in 1977 and to provide other specific services which will be identified following consultation with health boards and other health agencies.</P>
    <P>The additional moneys which I have referred to relate to non-capital expenditure only.  As Deputies are aware, I have already issued a statement regarding the health capital programme, for which a total sum of £16 million has been allocated.  This allocation will enable me to provide finances for on-going schemes and £6.8 million for new starts on a significant programme of major developments. As indicated in the statement, this capital programme is expected to provide about 700 additional jobs.</P>
    <P>Over the next few weeks I expect to be able to announce details of the allocations to be made from the non-capital development moneys and the job-creation element associated with that development.  I might add that the same standard of control of expenditure generally which operated during 1976 will, of course, be continued this year, so as to ensure that full value is obtained for the very substantial funds now being provided for the health services.</P>
    <P>All these developments will result in a considerable improvement in the level of services which, in the case of persons in the limited eligibility group, they will obtain for a very modest increase <Col N="1015" /> in the amount of the health contribution they will be required to pay.</P>
    <P>On that score, I should, perhaps, mention a further development in relation to the financing of hospital services which, though not directly related to rates of health contributions, is, nevertheless, becoming a more significant factor in times of high hospital costs.  As Deputies are possibly aware, the Exchequer subsidises to a considerable extent the cost of hospital services provided for persons who have no statutory entitlement to them or who, although having such entitlement, decide to make their own arrangements.  When persons who have &ldquo;limited eligibility&rdquo; for health services are being asked to bear a share of the increase in the cost of hospital services, therefore, it seems only proper that hospital charges in these other cases should be increased also.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, proposing that they be increased by some 30 per cent with effect from 1st April, 1977.  The agreement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to this proposal has been obtained.  I have also arranged with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board that persons insured with them will be afforded the opportunity of increasing their cover, where necessary, when the revised charges come into operation.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note the revised income limit of £3,000 for &ldquo;limited eligibility&rdquo; services which was introduced last year in order to preserve or restore entitlement to health services where the effects of inflation were upsetting the situation.  The revision, in effect maintained the limit at its traditional level in real terms.  It is not designed to make any change in the proportion of the population which has been traditionally eligible for these services.</P>
    <P>When the House was considering the revision of the income limit last year, however, mention was made of certain anomalies in its operation, for example, entitlement limits as between manual and non-manual workers.  I <Col N="1016" /> accepted that this was a matter to which consideration should be given and I have since appointed a working party, representative of the main interests involved&mdash;the medical organisations, the Federation of Employers, the Congress of Trade Unions, the health boards and my Department&mdash;to examine the anomalies which arise in the definitions used for &ldquo;limited eligibility&rdquo; categories and in the identification of eligible persons, and to consider what action might be possible to remove these anomalies during the period when the income limit will continue to exist.  I understand that the preliminary measures necessary to get these various interests involved have now been completed and that the group has recently held its first meeting. I commend the Bill to the House for a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>At first sight this would seem to be a rather simple, straightforward and innocuous Bill.  It sets out to increase the payments in the form of health contribution to be made by those who have limited eligibility for health services.  However, there are a few points I want to make about it to establish that it is of much more importance and significance than it would seem at first sight.</P>
      <P>When this increase is made the contribution will have increased by 50 per cent in what is practically a 12-month period.  When the increase proposed in this legislation is added to the increase made about this time last year the total increase in the health contribution will be a full 50 per cent. Even for this Government, that is not bad, to increase a contribution from a section of the people of this kind by 50 per cent within 12 months.  It is on a par with their performance in other areas.</P>
      <P>This increase was foreshadowed by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech and the income which will derive from the increase has already been taken into credit in the budget arithmetic.  I quote from the speech of the Minister for Finance when he said:</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the Government have decided to defer further action in 1977 on their policy of reducing the Exchequer contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> that is the Exchequer contribution to the social welfare fund&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>The 1977 social insurance contribution increases will be further reduced because we are removing in April an element which was introduced for one year in 1976 to recoup a shortfall in contribution income.  Accordingly, the stamp increase, including an additional 6p for health costs will be about 69p; 42p from the employer and 27p from the employee&mdash;that is much less than in 1976.</P>
    <P>In fact, the stamp is going up by a full 69p this year, 42p from the employer and 27p from the employee and of course this 6p which is described in this legislation makes its own satisfactory contribution to that increase in the cost of the stamp.</P>
    <P>I think that is an erroneous approach by the Government.  It is difficult to establish whether it is the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Health who is at fault in this regard.  It is validly argued today that one of the major inhibitions in the provision of employment is the cost of the stamp and our party are putting forward a proposal that as a contribution to generating employment the burden of the stamp on trade and industry should be reduced.  We have expert economic opinion in support of that proposal. There are economists who argue&mdash;they are probably in the majority&mdash;that one of the greatest single boosts we could give to the generation of employment would be a reduction in the burden of the stamp.  In this regard the Minister for Health is going in exactly the opposite way.  He is adding his own 6p to the increase in the cost of the stamp. It seems to me that this is muddled thinking and represents a disoriented approach to the whole problem of employment.</P>
    <P>The increases which the Minister proposes in this legislation will bring in £2.2 million in the current year.  On the other side of the fence the Minister claims credit for an expenditure of £6.8 million which he says will create 700 additional jobs.  Where is the consistency in that approach?  On one hand, he is spending Exchequer money to create 700 jobs and at the same time <Col N="1018" /> he is putting 6p on to the cost of the stamp to get in £2.2 million which will undoubtedly have a detrimental effect from the point of view of employment. Would it not be very much better if he is providing this additional money of which such great play was made at the time of the budget to assume this £2.2 million into that?  Would that not have been a better and more consistent approach?</P>
    <P>One would like to know a little more about the 700 additional jobs which the Minister hopes to create by the extra expenditure.  What sort of jobs will they be?  The Minister was arguing with me recently in the discussion on the motion to set up the Select Committee about what happened in 1976.  Whatever else may be said about 1976 there is no doubt that throughout the structure of the health services there was a serious shortage of personnel. There was serious talk of wards in hospitals closing down because of lack of staff.  Throughout the health services in the different bodies and institutions these cut-backs and economies were felt in the shortage of personnel.  We all know of wards in hospitals in this city that are seriously understaffed, particularly from the nursing point of view.  Will these 700 additional jobs be created in that sphere?  Shall we have more nurses or will these jobs be of the maintenance or general labouring type? The Minister should have been more forthcoming in that way.  In any event it seems to be a convoluted approach to be bringing in this legislation adding 6p to the stamp on the one side and on the other purporting to spend additional money on our health services in the creation of new jobs.</P>
    <P>Despite the brave front the Minister puts on it in his speech, the simple fact is that this is another impost on the unfortunate middle class&mdash;I am referring to the skilled tradesman, technician, clerical worker, that group of people who have, in some way or other, to meet all their outgoings out of their own resources and who get very little assistance in any shape or form to meet increases in the cost of living.  They will be further imposed upon by what the Minister is doing here.  It is not just what he is doing in the legislation but this additional thing <Col N="1019" /> which he announced in his speech for the first time.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be disagreeably surprised to learn that he proposes to increase the cost of hospitalisation by a full 30 per cent.  That will be immediately reflected in the premiums of the Voluntary Health Insurance contributors, that section of the community who have no other way of providing for illness requiring hospitalisation than through the Voluntary Health Insurance.  About 500,000 people would be in very dire straits were it not for the magnificent and efficient contribution which the Voluntary Health Insurance Board make to our health services.</P>
    <P>Here by an unprecedented act, something about which we were not forewarned, the Minister is again increasing the cost of living for this unfortunate section of the community. This approach is reprehensible.  I have already outlined that, in my view, increasing the stamp in any shape or form, or for any purpose, is bad from the overall employment point of view.  But in this regard there is a grievous error in economic principle by the Government.  It is axiomatic that the two basic economic problems which confront us today are unemployment and inflation.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil yesterday and again this evening we will be discussing the exorbitant increases in prices by CIE, RTE, ESB, and so on, which the Government are inflicting on the community. A constant, continual procession of price increases faces our unfortunate community through Government action.  The Government are, theoretically, committed to the reduction of inflation.  We cannot begin to cope with our economic problems, to reduce unemployment, to get economic progress and development until our inflation is under control.  Other countries have done that.  It should be a basic element in the approach of the Government in all their thinking and planning to do nothing which will contribute to the generation of inflation.</P>
    <P>Here we have this positive step by the Government adding to the cost of <Col N="1020" /> living, adding a further price increase to a large section of the population. In my view, therefore, the Minister is wrong in principle in bringing forward this proposal.  The increase he is proposing in the health contribution is wrong, as is the increase he is proposing in hospital charges which will result in increased voluntary health premiums.  It is muddled, convoluted and erroneous thinking on the one hand to be doing these two things and on the other to be purporting to create new jobs by spending additional money on the health services through some as yet undisclosed mechanism. That is my main criticism of this legislation and of what the Minister said when introducing it.</P>
    <P>As I said, at first sight it might seem that what he has done is not of any great importance because it is only increasing the health contribution in the case of those who have limited eligibility by 6p a week.  That does not seem to be a great deal and the Minister probably hoped there would not be any comment about it.  I want to emphasise that it is wrong in principle and represents a seriously muddled approach to our present economic situation by the Government.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of his speech the Minister indicated that he had set up a working party to go into this question of the anomalous difference between manual and non-manual workers.  I want to avail of this opportunity to emphasise the difficulties that this anomaly causes and the amount of anger it generates among those affected. I want to ask the Minister in particular about a situation which was drawn to my attention where non-manual workers, who were voluntary contributors prior to 31st March, 1974, at which date the limit for insurability was abolished, subsequently became compulsory contributors.  I believe such people should be entitled indefinitely to limited eligibility.  There is a great deal of confusion about the situation because many of them who are now over the limit of £3,000 per annum are in some cases being denied access to limited eligibility.  I do not know if the Minister could have that anomaly dealt with immediately or whether it is something that could be dealt with by <Col N="1021" /> the working party but it is causing a great deal of resentment.  It is clear from the legalities of the situation that the people I referred to should be entitled to limited eligibility indefinitely, even though they are non-manual and have gone over the £3,000 limit.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the Minister's attention to another type of person.  There is a fairly sizeable number of people who are, to all intents and purposes, manual workers but because of the very fine distinctions drawn in the administration of these regulations, they are classified as non-manual workers, although very often they are doing exactly the same sort of work as the people beside them who have the benefit of manual classification.  A great deal of hardship can arise in the case of the number of these people.  I would refer the Minister particularly to the situation where the member of a family has a serious, lasting, long term illness.  I am thinking now of cases where the illness would not come within the long term illness scheme.  There are many illnesses which are long term and lasting which do not come within that scheme.  The family who find themselves in that situation endure very great hardship.  They cannot go to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board because they will not be taken on.  If they are taken on, it will be only on condition that that particular member of the family is excluded or, if that member is included, the disease will be excluded.  The Voluntary Health Insurance Board, with the best will in the world, cannot offer them any assistance. At the same time, because of those rather tortuous decisions about the distinction between manual and non-manual and because they are slightly over £3,000 a year, that family will not qualify for limited eligibility.  They are really in a very difficult hardship situation. Something should be done as quickly as possible to deal with this anomaly between manual and non-manual over the £3,000 per annum limit.</P>
    <P>That is only £60 a week.  It is not so long ago when we would have considered that was a very good income but it is not very much at the moment. It becomes less and less with every day <Col N="1022" /> that passes with the constant savage increases the general public are being subjected to.  I want to emphasise that this regulation is causing a great deal of hardship among a fairly wide group of people.  I have mentioned two categories and I am sure other Deputies can mention others.  I suggest to the Minister that immediate action is necessary here.</P>
    <P>We are opposing the passage of this Bill for the reasons I have outlined. We are not opposing it because we regard the increases proposed in this Bill as particularly Draconian.  Nobody can argue that 6p a week is a very serious impost; I am not arguing that. I am arguing that this increase, taken with last year's increase, amounts to a total of 50 per cent increase.  I am also arguing that the principle is wrong and that the Government at this stage should not be taking any positive action in any area to increase costs, add to the cost of living and add to inflation.  The Government should seek to go in the opposite direction in regard to any action they take.  If they cannot reduce costs in any area they should be determined not to increase costs as they are doing to hospital charges, as announced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>We are also opposing this Bill because it represents an increase in costs for a section of the general public without any increase in benefit.  People do not mind paying more if they can see that some new service or benefit will come their way as a result of the increased payment.  That is not the case here.  The Minister has tried to infer that there will be some vague type of improvement as a result of the extra budgetary expenditure to which he has referred.  I cannot see that. This is a simple taxation measure, an increase imposed on this unfortunate section of the community to bring in a miserly £2.2 million into the arithmetic of a budget which has a deficit of £200 million odd anyway. For those reasons we propose to vote against the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this Bill it is appropriate to mention in passing the many different aspects of health that can be covered by a Bill of this <Col N="1023" /> kind.  When one refers specifically to the hospitalisation and possible treatment situation one must say that perhaps the most efficient way of providing this is through health contributions as distinct from private means. This Bill is increasing the amount paid each week.  It replaces any possible private financial commitment undertaken by a patient.</P>
      <P>There are many aspects which should be considered here.  This does not refer completely to the treatment of the person who is acutely ill.  It refers to all different aspects of institutional and hospital care in particular from homes for disturbed and handicapped children, Cheshire Homes, voluntary institutions of different kinds, hospitals and geriatric homes throughout the country. It is a very small amount to be asked to give, 6p a week or £3 a year, for the amount of institutional care that is provided in return.  One can appreciate what Deputy Haughey said about the increase in the cost of living but I do not think the people have ever considered health as a cost of living factor, particularly when it relates to in-patient care.  Although, statistically, it might appear that this represents an increase of 20 per cent on the previous year's contribution it would be facetious for us to attempt to say that it represents a massive increase in the cost of living. If that is the basis for the Opposition statement that they are opposing this Bill it is not a very sound one.</P>
      <P>There have been unavoidable increases in the cost of maintaining hospital beds and running the health services before one even considers the medical personnel, drugs and equipment involved.  Costs have increased so dramatically in the past decade that the personnel in hospitals are attempting to do projected financial commitment figures for the year ahead.  It is no secret that it is an embarrassment to hospital management boards that they are continually in debt and that they have not got an adequate cash flow to keep up with inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody wishes to see any increase in contributions&mdash;I am sure the Minister is no exception&mdash;but the only alternative is a decrease in the facilities <Col N="1024" /> available.  If the increase was 6.1p a week perhaps the Minister would be able to provide all the scanners that have been asked for by different hospitals. There could be a great increase in the diagnostic facilities in our hospitals if they each had a scanner machine. It is possibly the greatest breakthrough in medicine this century but we are almost the only country in Europe that has not got one; not that Europe provides any great criterion to go by.  We still have not provided our patients, hospitals and diagnosticians with this equipment.  I believe it is the Minister's intention to provide this equipment as soon as it is financially feasible.</P>
    <P>When we speak of an increase of 6p per week we must consider that if that increase were 6.1p we would have sufficient money for the provision of these machines.  That is the kind of money we are talking about.  Over the years health legislation and Estimates have become a type of football which is used by politicians, particularly those in the legal profession who seem to have a particular desire to dissect, operate and amputate the health services. This seems to be a fashionable fad with the over-elaborate front bench of the Opposition.  I think every legal member of the Fianna Fáil Party who can read or write is on the front bench and the party is unusual in that.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention Item No. 5 on the Order Paper, the new committee being set up to examine the health boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter has been disposed of this morning in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his statement on this legislation referred to it. I want to say how welcome it is and how important it is that when health contributions are increased the efficacy of spending should be continually examined and monitored to see that the optimum benefit is obtained for all. It is no secret that health boards and health administration have become bureaucratic, over-elaborate and cumbersome and any move to improve efficiency is to be welcomed, otherwise we will have to continue increasing contributions and continue to prop up <Col N="1025" /> health administration with a financial type of cotton wool.  This would in no way improve the services available to patients.</P>
      <P>One might mention in passing that our country is possibly at the top of the league in regard to the number of hospital beds and the number of nurses and medical personnel per head of the population.  It is well known that we have more hospital beds, more nurses and doctors per head of population than any other country in the world. One can see in the Arab countries now that money is not the sole criterion for the provision of health services.  They are short of personnel and the United States also is short of hospital beds and medical personnel.  It is only when one looks at these countries that one can see the tremendous wealth we have here.  We can see the tremendous dedication of nursing and para-medical personnel and the unique application and tenacity of consultants in this field.</P>
      <P>I was quite disturbed last December when I saw that some nurses going for interview for employment abroad were intimidated.  I made representations to the Minister for Labour and in his letter of reply he stated:</P>
      <P>While the advertisement in December last was not racialistic as was the case in 1975, the Anti-Apartheid Movement nevertheless objected to it and they got in touch with my office and intimated that it was their intention to place a picket on the hotel during the hours listed for the interviews.  I had my officials inform the hotel of the Movement's intentions and might I add of my abhorrence of South Africa's racialist policies.  Later the hotel manager 'phoned to say that they had decided to cancel the arrangements for the interviews.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is abhorrent that any individual or third party group should be allowed to interfere with Government Departments and allowed to interfere with our nursing profession to the extent of the deprivation of interviews.  We are going to spend part of the money being raised in health contributions to train nurses to a high level of efficiency and it is abhorrent that when <Col N="1026" /> they seek to obtain employment and tend the sick in other countries a third movement can interfere and appear to use the offices of a Government Department. This is a very serious and malignant occurrence in our society. Two wrongs never make a right.  In the past Ireland sent many people abroad in differing capacities.  Perhaps one of the greatest contributions Ireland makes to other countries today is the provision of highly trained medical personnel.  These are humanitarian people of whom we can be very proud.</P>
    <P>I do not want to digress too much from the contents of the legislation.  It is with a degree of satisfaction that we can look at the improvements in health administration which have occurred during the past few years. The setting up of this very powerful committee will, I am sure, bring about further improvements.  Recently we saw the unfortunate spectacle in the United Kingdom when McKinsey, who had been paid £25 million or £30 million to advise the Government on the administration of the health services, came back after three years to tell the Government that they had given the wrong advice.  In typical bureaucratic fashion they were reemployed to inform the Government about where they had given the wrong advice.</P>
    <P>These tendencies can occur in socialist medicine where one takes the human factor out of the health services. Perhaps one of the best things that ever happened in this country is that we never went in for socialist medicine in the way that the United Kingdom did.  The United Kingdom possibly helped this country and other countries by showing the drastic mistakes which can occur when one attempts to socialise such a personal thing as the treatment of patients.  The Minister has my full support for this legislation.  I would ask him once again to be vigilant in regard to the improvements that have occurred and will occur and the facilities, particularly diagnostic facilities, throughout the world in the field of medical technology. Early diagnosis is vitally important and I would emphatically urge the Minister to purchase body and <Col N="1027" /> head scanners for the hospitals concerned as soon as possible. I know the Minister appreciates the value of equipment and these scanners represent a most important step forward in diagnosis and subsequent treatment this century.  Each day there are people flying over to London to have the benefit of this equipment.</P>
    <P>In the general medical services there has been an increase in the population of 38 per cent where holders of medical cards are concerned.  Perhaps there is need for close vigilance.  I do not believe people deliberately abuse medical cards but there may be some who are inclined to over-use them. The health medication refund system is a very good system but it might be examined because I have a feeling that it would be cheaper to give 90 per cent of the population completely free medicines as against the percentage covered at the moment.  I say this because of the administration involved in the scheme.  There is no doubt that the refund even in the case of a single prescription often costs more than the actual medicine.  We should try to move away from institutionalised medicine and get back to more personal medicine. A great deal of the time of general practitioners is taken up with writing. Today there is more use made of the pen than there is of the stethescope and this is proving most frustrating for medical practitioners.  The amount of time spent in actual writing has increased very dramatically over the past few years.  The pattern grows more insidious day by day.</P>
    <P>There is a list of long-term illnesses which are covered.  I would suggest that rheumatism and asthma should be included in this list.  The scheme is an excellent one and its success is possibly unparallelled.  The framework is already there and the list could easily be extended.</P>
    <P>The voluntary health insurance keeps its administration costs down to 8 per cent of gross income.  When one compares that with 80 per cent administration cost in the United States and the United Kingdom this is a tremendous <Col N="1028" /> achievement and one would wish to see as much encouragement as possible given to the VHI.  There could be a sliding scale.  Account should be taken of inflation and, if that were done, a certain hardship would be alleviated.</P>
    <P>Once again, I congratulate the Minister on this Bill and on his achievements to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not aim to speak with the same authority or at the same length as the three speakers who preceded me who have in their own right an association at executive and professional spokesmanship level with health services which I do not have.  I propose to comment, therefore, on three specific matters or aspects of the health services which I encounter quite often while I operate in my political clinic. One has already been referred to by Deputy Haughey when he spoke about the position of the non-manual worker. In the Finglas area&mdash;I think this would apply probably exclusively to men, though I am not too sure but, as yet, the case has not been presented to me by any woman&mdash;you have the case of Nicky Lyons or Paddy Murphy who started working in some concern at the age of 16 and served in that concern for the past 40 years.  During that time he was practically an insured worker. In his case the situation arose some years ago that in deference to the contribution which he had made to the firm and, more important, because the firm had recognised his declining health, he was put into the non-manual category and employed and paid accordingly.  As a result he has gone over the £3,000 limit.  His financial position and status in the company has changed but his state of ill-health has not.  He finds himself now getting very little award for all the contributions he has made and where other people could go to the VHI when he goes he is told that because of his state of ill-health he is not acceptable. The result is that he finds himself in a situation where, even though he is suffering from a heart condition, for instance, and has been told by his doctor that an aspect of his ailment is that he must not have anxiety, fear or worry, he has hanging over him an <Col N="1029" /> increase of 30 per cent in hospitalisation cost.</P>
      <P>When we talk about 30 per cent on something small we need not be afraid of it.  Nobody fears the imposition of 6p all that much but in the case of the non-manual worker I referred to who knows that a bed in a hospital can cost from £70 to £80 per week he must now pay an extra 30 per cent, bringing the cost for a week in hospital to £100.  The national pay agreement gave him 10 per cent of an increase but who will make up the 20 per cent for him?  I hope the Minister will be able to tell us that he will direct the working party he has set up to pay attention to the growing body of people who find themselves in the predicament I have outlined.  Such people get nothing from the national services, are not acceptable to the VHI but the cost of the service increases by 30 per cent. At the same time they get only a 10 per cent pay increase.  The psychological effect of that on such a person must concern the medical profession. The people in question, generally speaking, have just emerged from the stamp paying classes.  From that point of view and having regard to the proximity of the Minister to the trade union classes and associations I am confident he will pay regard to their plight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should now like to refer to people lower down the age ladder, children in our schools who for the last three or four years have been waiting to avail of orthodontic services from our health boards.  Apart from the medical aspects we are all sympathetic towards the child who for one reason or another&mdash;perhaps he or she was a thumb-sucker&mdash;has teeth disposed in such a way as to cause bother and ambarrassment.  That child should qualify for a certain priority in our service but when I questioned the Minister about this I was informed that there was a queue of about 1,000 children in the Eastern Health Board area alone for this service without any hope of the position improving.  It is a very expensive service.  Children who are entitled to the service at national school are not entitled to it when attending secondary school.  Children <Col N="1030" /> are leaving national schools at 12 years of age and, in certain circumstances, even though they have been waiting for years to avail of this service, when they reach 14 years of age they do not qualify for it.  The parents of many are not in a position to pay for it.  The real tragedy is that the service is such that it works wonders on the children so affected and afflicted.</P>
    <P>Looking at a budget of this size it is a reflection on everybody in the House that, notwithstanding the fact that a relatively small amount of money would improve the service, so many children must go without it. Having passed from national school it will not be possible for many of them to benefit from that service, one which would make them healthier and more comfortable about themselves. An old Chinese philosopher said on one occasion that we should always be careful not to watch the stars so long and so closely as to disregard what is on the ground or at our feet. I do not think we move around the people enough to see the problems they have.  We can talk here about percentages and the achievements of one Government as against another but we tend to lose sight of the fact that that which it is all supposed to be in aid of is not improving in the fashion or manner which we all desire.</P>
    <P>Having isolated the orthodontic service, I do not want to give the impression that the normal dental services are anything to boast about.  They are equally bad but to some extent the problem there can be corrected at a later date.  I have endeavoured to pinpoint the position of children needing orthodontic services.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the question of the provision of glasses for young people and for old age pensioners. There are waiting lists and delays of up to a year before a person who has been certified as needing glasses can get them.  Is this the great health services we are talking about on the local and the national level?  Personally it does not matter to me what name we give to any service; I am concerned about what it means for the people.  I know of young children and elderly people who have been waiting for <Col N="1031" /> glasses for as long as 12 months and others have had to wait for appointments for equally long periods.</P>
    <P>If one asks a question one is told by the Minister that there is a scarcity of professional people in this area.  We are told that advertisements have been issued but that it is not possible to get suitably qualified people.  That is the excuse that is often given in respect of dentists and orthodontists.  If that is the position the Minister should consult with the universities and tell them he is not happy with the situation. He should tell them that arrangements must be made for a flow of graduates to satisfy the home needs.</P>
    <P>In passing, I wish to point out that I am a member of the council of the Kevin Street College of Technology and we have there what is regarded as a very high-class course in ophthalmics. The standard of entrance is the same as that required for university. We have students there who spend four years studying ophthalmics only but as yet they have not been accepted by our health boards.  I do not understand why this is so.  I can understand if people in that area may be concerned about their own position.  However, where there is an admission by all concerned that we have not the professional people to service the demand the Minister should look at the situation.  Irrespective of who is vexed or pleased he should concern himself with the recruitment of suitably qualified people.</P>
    <P>I was anxious to pinpoint those three matters and I hope by avoiding any suggestion of what any one Government did or did not do in the matter of provision of services I may have been able to help the Minister to appreciate my sincerity in making my case.  I have looked forward to the opportunity of referring to the three aspects of the medical services about which I am not happy.  I could continue at much greater length talking about other aspects but my philosophy is that if there are 100 things to be done, while there is no hope of doing all of them together if we succeed in satisfying three at least we are on the road to partial success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make my contribution to the debate in the spirit indicated by Deputy Tunney which has been commendable and helpful.  Perhaps we might lay down a new economic law in relation to health, namely, that health is an area where demand increases in accordance with supply rather than the other way around.  There is absolutely no limit to the supply in terms of problems.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tunney raised matters in two areas which jogged my memory and which indicate the extent to which we have progressed and for which all Governments may be credited.  He referred to the situation with regard to spectacles.  I wear glasses.  It was a long time before I discovered I needed them and when it was found out at school that they were necessary my father had to pay for them.  The fact that there is a queue for glasses, even though it may be long, indicates the extent we have come in that direction. That the queue is there is something to be regretted but we should be slightly proud of the fact that at least people can get into a queue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tunney's contribution with regard to orthodontic treatment was valuable and worth while.  I had a problem in that regard and I had to wait to go to work in England before I could get treatment. However, I am making these points as a slight contribution to what is a much wider and broader problem. Deputy Haughey postioned it correctly in his own contribution when he referred to this Bill in the context of budgetary policy and I cannot disagree with that.  I agree completely with that approach.  This is an ancillary to the budget, just as certain measures announced yesterday and also in the Minister's speech must be seen in the context of overall budgetary policy. While the amount to be raised this year might be regarded as nugatory, it must be seen in the context of the overall deficit which is of the order of £200 million for this year.  As the year <Col N="1033" /> goes on it may work out to be much less but there is also the possibility that it may be much more.  For that reason any Deputy must take into account the fact that measures that are designed to bring down the deficit, no matter how unpalatable they may be for the individual concerned, must be considered as welcome in the over-all economic context.</P>
      <P>I say without any element of party point-scoring that this time last year the Opposition were asking for a decrease in the budget deficits.  The burden of the argument put forward this morning would lead to an increase in the budget deficit.  There is a little inconsistency there; perhaps it is unintentional but it exists.  As I understand the main spokesman for the Opposition, he makes the point that the opposition to the Bill will lie on the principle that even though the 6p is in itself small it must be taken in the context of the other increases which are in fact a tax on labour and for that reason will lead to a diminution in employment prospects for the coming year.  On the basis of expert advice they say reductions in social welfare contributions will lead to greater employment, but presumably the expert advice therefore also advises that increases in social welfare contributions will lead to a diminution in employment and that is the reason why it is being opposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an interesting argument, but I do not think there is much empirical evidence to justify it.  Very often one gets into areas of economics like this where one runs on a lot of <i>a priori</i> assumptions which do not have much empirical justification.  I think the case could legitimately be made that there are economies where there are far greater and far higher imposts on employers in respect of labour with much higher labour contents and with much smaller unemployment figures.  There should be empirical evidence to justify the argument being put forward.  In respect of both employer and employee contributions, we are away behind the European average contributions in economies which have far higher standards of living than ours and which also have been spectacularly successful <Col N="1034" /> compared to us in dealing with the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Bill has to be seen in the context of a general inflationary situation. I do not think any Government, particularly in an election year, wants to inflict&mdash;Deputy Haughey used that verb&mdash;price increases on the public. However, it is untrue to say that other countries have got their inflation under control and that this Bill is a consequence of a situation where inflation has not been controlled.  One has only to look across the water to the United Kingdom to see an economy in a situation where both high levels of unemployment and of inflation coexist and where the prospects are that there will be an upward surge in inflation over the latter half of the coming year. While it is true that one or two countries have been spectacular in reducing the rate of inflation, one does not refer too often to the medicine which is prescribed for reducing the rate of inflation, medicine which I would have no hesitation in saying would be unacceptable to the Irish people.</P>
    <P>For example, <i>The Irish Times</i> recently contained an article showing that the Swiss economy had got the rate of inflation down to 1 per cent, and therefore a Bill of this nature would have been unnecessary.  The article also said, however, that unemployment in Switzerland had risen from a nil figure to 30,000 and that those 30,000 people had no social welfare services to help them through that unemployment period.  It did not mention that some 300,000 so-called guest workers had been permanently sent home from that economy.  That is a way of dealing with inflation, to cut real levels of income or to cut the level of employment provided you can export those who will be unemployed. If you cannot do that then you are confronted with the situation with which we are confronted here, that is to say, a society that is not prepared to accept certain levels of unemployment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>How did sacking 300,000 bring down inflation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not prepared to accept certain levels of unemployment <Col N="1035" /> and at the same time they continue to demand, legitimately, the services to which they have become accustomed, and not only to demand that but to demand increases and improvements in those services.</P>
      <P>There is a problem here which runs right to the very heart of the democratic system.  There are tensions here which will be very difficult for any Government to handle.  The fact that we agreed earlier without division to establish a committee is in itself an indication that many Deputies recognise that there are tensions which transcend party differences because of the strains which have been put upon the democratic system in answering the demands which people are putting upon it.  Quite clearly there is a limitation to what the democratic system can supply by way of services, of which the health service is a central social component.  I think we recognise that here in this House.  It is the reason many of us have the desire to take the matter of health out of straightforward party politics.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been brought about probably by four different factors.  Inflation is certainly one of them. Another matter was referred to in Motion No. 5, something which will cause us increasing problems in the future, that is, the matter of demographic growth.  Deputy Byrne referred to the huge increase in the child population. We again have had verification of this population evolution in the paper delivered last week by someone from the Central Statistics Office showing that we are in the middle of an unprecedented population growth, which at this moment is placing great strains on the health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the issue of the complexity of medical technology, which simply means it costs more to provide the same range of services than five, ten or even 20 years aog.  There is, too, the problem to which Deputy Byrne referred of over-bureaucratisation, which is something I am very glad to see will be the subject of all-party scrutiny in this House, and perhaps it might be as a result of the examination of the health services by this committee <Col N="1036" /> that future Ministers for Health, from whatever side of the political divide they may come, will not have to ask, even at a time of high inflation, if such exists, for increases of this order, and that this House will be able to see to it that there is greater efficiency and effectiveness.  I believe there has been over-bureaucratisation in the health service, perhaps born out of an era where the belief was that bigger is ever better.  I do not think that bigger is ever better, and we are going into an era now where we will hold to the reverse principle.</P>
    <P>There are certain key questions which this Bill and the debate generally raise and which I do not think can be answered or should be answered in the context of the debate. Perhaps they could be dealt with in the calmer atmosphere of the committee. Deputy Haughey at one stage mentioned ideological floundering.  It is not a bad thing to flounder there occasionally so that we may pose for ourselves fundamental questions: should there be free health services and for all?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Can there be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Or can there be? Exactly.  If there should be&mdash;and there cannot be due to economic conditions &mdash;what sort of means test should be employed to determine who is eligible and who is not eligible?  Separating the eligible from the non-eligible always involves an element of injustice and inequity.  Deputy Tunney was quite right in bringing forward to the House a number of such instances.  We are all confronted with these every day of the week, and who is to say to a person: &ldquo;I am sorry.  The limit of eligibility ends there and you are just beyond it.&rdquo;?  What are the principles upon which we must determine where the element of eligibility ends?  The Deputy is perfectly right in saying it is a cause of great social concern and tension, not only in individual cases of genuine hardship but, for example, in respect of eligibility for the general medical services, particularly for persons who are paying taxes and who see others enjoying services for which they themselves are not eligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1037" /> An arbitrary figure beyond which the percentage of the population encompassed by this service cannot go has been laid down.  I do not know what the justification is for that percentage. I am not aware of any philosophical exposition in regard to it but I think everyone here will realise that to exceed it would lead to a situation where the service itself would be put in question.  These are questions that we must ask ourselves in the context of this Bill and, hopefully also, in the calmer atmosphere of the all-party committee.</P>
    <P>The Bill raises the question of how the health services should be financed. Should they be financed totally by way of taxation or by way of insurance or by a combination of both?  The answer to this question would depend on one's ideological attitudes towards society. How are we to deal with the problem of people who are sick?  Do we say that free health is a matter of right or do we say that it is something for which the individual must provide in which case it would be a matter of insurance or of relying on one's resources?  Alternatively, do we say that society has an obligation towards certain categories only?</P>
    <P>This Bill is a short-term response.  In saying that I do not intend criticism but what we have is a hotchpotch system that has been created on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  We have dealt with problems as they have arisen but we have not tackled this area in a systematic way.  For that reason, while the Bill can be regarded as a short-term response we can today welcome what was done before.  I refer to the establishment of the working party to examine various anomalies in the health service.  I welcome in particular the announcement by the Minister telling us that there has been established a working party to examine the anomalies that arise in regard to the definitions used in respect of eligibility. There are times when one would need to be a medieval philosopher to justify the various divisions that exist between manual and non-manual workers. These distinctions are a reflection of the <i>ad hoc</i> approach which governs our society's attitude to the development of the health service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1038" /> In the meantime, as some Deputies have said, we must continue to improve the range of the health services within the limits of available moneys. The great task of the party as individual political entities and of this House as a reflection of the people's will is to identify areas of greatest need and then to ask ourselves whether we can provide the resources with which to deal with the situation.  I agree totally with Deputy Byrne when, speaking in the context of long-term illnesses, he advocated the inclusion of asthma.</P>
    <P>As a medical practitioner, he made the point that there is much difficulty in regard to definition in so far as this condition is concerned but of all the illnesses to which we must pay attention, asthma must loom very near the top in terms of people who experience this real problem and which very often is the cause of much distress particularly in respect of children when the families are not eligible for medical cards.  Adding this illness to the list would bring about great social good. Therefore, I urge the Minister to have asthma included at the earliest moment possible.</P>
    <P>I agree, too, with Deputy Tunney when he says that the lacuna in the age groups for eligibility in respect of children must be closed off as quickly as possible.  It is ludicrous that a child is eligible while at primary school but becomes ineligible on leaving that level and going on to second-level education. There is an unintentional gap there which nobody wished to create there which has arisen out of the very nature of the system we are trying to operate.  I trust that the Minister will give his early consideration to this question.  Perhaps we could make a substantial and significant improvement by providing that all children under a certain age, irrespective of the incomes of their parents, were entitled to free medical service.  Perhaps we might specify all children under school-going age without that provision being taken in the context of the general medical service.</P>
    <P>A society which has a large number of children and which places the family very high in terms of respect as a <Col N="1039" /> social unit must try also to protect and sustain particularly the younger members of the family.  To fail in this regard is to engage in a contradiction.  I am sure that all parties here would support a move to provide that all children under a certain age level be entitled to free medical services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne made a valuable point in respect of examining the possibility of free medicine being an alternative approach to the current system of refunding on drugs.  He made the point that, perhaps, the administration cost of the current system might be put towards financing free medicine for about 90 per cent of the population. This debate has resulted in that valuable point being made.  It is something we had not thought of before.  On first hearing it sounds very attractive.  Perhaps it is a financial possibility.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that the availability of more money does not necessarily mean better medical treatment. All of us have voiced concern in regard to the efficiency and the efficacy of the health services.  We are all determined on means of ensuring that in the future there will be greater efficiency in this area.  The message should go out from this House that as the body responsible for voting moneys, there is an air of anxiety, of questioning and of doubt as to whether we are achieving the best value for moneys expended on the health service.  I trust that this, too, will be a matter to which the all-party committee will give attention.</P>

      <P>The Minister has told us that this provision is to allow for increases in present rates of health contributions and that this is a normal annual occurrence.  During the past few years the health contribution has been increased from £7 to £18.  Having regard to this increase, we must examine the level of the services in order to ascertain whether they are improving or deteriorating.  Those of us who are members of health boards have been hearing continuously for a number of years past of efforts to maintain the level of previous years having regard to budgetary restraints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we actually doing that?  Is that <Col N="1040" /> good enough?  When one examines the waiting lists for dental, ophthalmic and all other treatments one would think that we would have to do better.  To maintain them at that level is not sufficient.  Deputy Tunney dealt in detail with the problems regarding secondary school children.  This is a growing problem, where we have a vacuum between the ages of 12 and 13 and the age of 16, when they qualify for a medical card.  Children's health can be seriously affected during those formative years.  Many people are waiting for orthopaedic treatment. Some of them have to wait for years. Their condition is deteriorating so that, when they are eventually called for treatment, their joints are crippled. A great effort should be made to remedy this situation because many of those people are suffering severe pain.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the increasing number of people who are qualifying for medical cards.  Because of reviews that are being carried out at present by the health boards I doubt if that will be the trend in 1977.  I believe there will be a reduced number of medical card holders.  Reviews that were carried out a number of years ago in rural areas related to poor law valuation.  They are now related to farm income.  Most if not all of the assistance officers who are assessing means are assesing farm incomes very highly.  People come to us daily telling us that their cards have been recalled following a review.  This can create severe hardship.  There are cases of young married couples with families whose children require continuous medical attention, but they do not qualify for medical cards.  The health boards should be fairly liberal in their allocation of medical cards in respect of these children.  It would eliminate a lot of hardship.</P>
    <P>The stamp has been increased by 6p per week.  It looks very small, but the total cost of the stamp has a serious effect on job creation.  This is a real problem.  The health boards should also devote more attention to the provision of home help.  This service could be expanded to good effect.  It could be used to curtail the institutionalisation of old people.  Many old people could remain at home if they <Col N="1041" /> had sufficient home help.  In relation to the curtailment of services I brought to the Minister's attention last January the need for the provision of a welfare home in Monaghan, where we have a large number of geriatric patients.  The three institutions that we have at present&mdash;St. Mary's and two private institutions&mdash;are not adequate to cover the demand.  I had hoped that the Minister in his capital allocation would have given consideration to this proposal.  I am sorry that the Minister did not do so, because there is a real need here for a welfare home.</P>
    <P>In our health board's recent budgetary review for the year we had a list of job creations.  The Minister mentioned today that there would be in the region of 700 jobs.  I doubt very much if that number will be created. The Minister will be getting communications from local bodies and probably from the health board in relation to the hospital at Monaghan. They need more nurses, laboratory assistants and x-ray attendants.  They also need an additional surgeon, an additional gynaecologist and an additional anaesthetist.</P>
    <P>Asthma is a big problem, especially in relation to children.  Many people believe that it is very hard to get a definition of it, whether it is a long-term disease or a short-term disease. There are many types.  Attention should be paid to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation must be seen in the context of previous legislation of a similar type.  There seems to be a continuing escalation of costs without an adequate return of services for these costs.  Previous speakers have indicated that on 1st January, 1975, contributions were in the range of 26p a week or £12 per annum; on 1st April, 1976, these were raised to 33p a week or £15 per annum.  In March, 1977, we had a further increase to 39p a week or £18 per annum.  This was simply a device to collect money, a further system of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to hear the Minister making reference to this working party but I would refer him to his speech of <Col N="1042" /> last year when he spoke of having set up an interdepartmental committee consisting of people from the Departments of Health and Social Welfare to examine the financing of the health services.  At column 264 of Volume 289 of the Official Report for 24th March, 1976 he said: &ldquo;I expect that they will be in a position to submit their report by the summer.&rdquo;  That was the summer of 1976.  Could I inquire whether this report has been presented as yet, whether it is available? Perhaps the Minister will say that it was an omission on my part that I failed to see this report coming before the House or missed its circulation. I hope the Minister will refer to this.</P>
    <P>If we speak in terms of increased costs, surely people in return have the right to expect further services.  After all, if one pays more one can anticipate receiving more, but what extra services will there be?  I can see as I saw last year only queues and further waiting lists.  At this point I would like to pay tribute to the dedication of the medical personnel in my constituency who are working in many cases in substandard circumstances and conditions, providing the services to the best of their ability.  I am sure this is the case in various other areas throughout the country.  That surely must make one think of what can be done in this field if they were not hampered.  I hope the Minister will make extra capital available for proper facilities.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the Minister has not decided to raise the upper limit this year, has he given a great deal of thought to the number of people who will become ineligible for services because they have gone over the limit?  Last year when he was raising the limit he said that one of the reasons for doing so was that if he did not a huge number of people&mdash; I forget the exact number&mdash;would become ineligible.  I wonder as a result of the limit not being increased how many will become ineligible.  Further hardship will be created for these people and for their dependants.</P>
    <P>Could I, through the Ceann Comhairle, ask the Minister if by failing to <Col N="1043" /> raise the limit at this stage, he is not creating an anomaly which he would hope that this working party that he has mentioned will have to resolve?  Is there a double edge to this?  I regret that many of the anomalies that were mentioned last year in this debate apparently have not been resolved some 12 months later.  We have the promise of a working party and I suppose they have had one meeting.  I would like to know when the meeting was.  Was it very recently?  I hope it was not simply an inaugural meeting just to fulfil a commitment to this Bill.  I do not think the Minister would have that in any case, but I hope he will clarify the position.</P>
    <P>Last year I spoke of difficulties that people were experiencing after they had made a payment of £15, and now £18, to the Revenue Commissioners for limited eligibility and in return they obtained a receipt from the Revenue Commissioners.  Many people seemed to think that this receipt was some form of certificate of eligibility for the following 12 months, and on being hospitalised many of them were to discover that their income went above the limit, and so a difficulty was created. The Eastern Health Board, dealt very favourably as far as they could with the cases I brought before them, but there is difficulty there which could be resolved if medical cover for a person and his dependants could be the same as the life of the receipt from the Revenue Commissioners, that is for the 12-month period.  I hope the Minister will refer back to that.</P>
    <P>Regarding geriatrics, we have a fairly good service in some areas for the ambulant aged.  The welfare homes provide excellent service and they seem to be working at a very low cost or economic factor, but what of the non-ambulant citizens for whom there is no place in a welfare home, who must, possibly because of the inability of their kinsfolk to look after them, end up in some form of private home or hospital?  In respect of this I would like to speak about the level of services available to the health boards in a purely financial vein.  I gather that these people would be somehow classified as coming under section 54 of the <Col N="1044" /> Health Act, 1970 which deals with in-patient services at choice of patient and so on.  I quote:</P>
    <P>A person entitled to avail himself of in-patient services under section 52 or the parent of a child entitled to allow the child to avail himself of such services may, if the person or parent so desires, instead of accepting services made available by the health board, arrange for the like services being provided for the person or the child in any hospital or home approved of by the Minister for the purposes of this section, and where a person or parent so arranges, the health board shall, in accordance with regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make in respect of the services so provided the prescribed payment.</P>
    <P>In many cases the senile aged and the non-ambulant aged come within this category, and this section indicates that people may have a choice of venue. However, we know that beds for long-stay geriatrics are simply not there, and therefore there is no choice except between individual homes that are approved by both the Department of Health and the relevant health board under different regulations.  The sections refers to the prescribed payment. Would the Minister let me know what the prescribed payment is?  What is the maximum subvention the Eastern Health Board may make for the maintenance of a long stay patient in this category?  I believe it is something in the region of £15 per week.  People who are providing this service, this form of home, are claiming&mdash;and I believe they have a very valid claim&mdash;that a subvention of £15 per week is not nearly adequate.  I wonder if those people are being overlooked within section 54 and somehow being grouped together as section 51 patients.</P>
    <P>Section 51 provides:</P>
    <P>In this Part &ldquo;in-patient services&rdquo; means institutional services provided for persons while maintained in a hospital, convalescent home or home for persons suffering from physical or mental disability or in accommodation ancillary thereto.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1045" /> Am I interpreting this section and the category of patient correctly when I say they are short-stay patients and that their stay may be for a duration of six weeks or 12 weeks?  I gather the Minister is allowing the Eastern Health Board to increase the subvention for this type of patient.  Has the Minister agreed to increase the subvention for the services provided for the type of person who comes within the ambit of section 54 of the Health Act, 1970? It is vital that this should be done. There is a little confusion about it.  I hesitate to say it is deliberate.  The health board are coming in for a certain amount of blame.  I do not think that is right in this case.  The section clearly states that the health board shall, in accordance with regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make a payment.  There is also the famous section 31.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister obtained the consent of the Minister for Finance to increase this subvention?  Has he approached the Minister for Finance and expressed the need for an increase in this subvention?  If a health board in this case can subvent to a maximum of £15 or, by squeezing a little extra, to a maximum of £20, the old age pensioner who has a GMS card retains a small portion of his pension for sundries, the little knick-knacks such a person would require.  He does not require many but he might want a certain number of cigarettes&mdash;I suppose I should not say that at the moment but this type of person is usually old and cigarettes are probably the only consolation he has if he is non-ambulant&mdash;or some chocolate, or a magazine, or something of that nature, and the balance of his pension is paid in conjunction with the subvention from the health board which must be sanctioned by the Minister with the approval of the Minister for Finance.  In many cases this makes a grand total of £25, £24, £22 or even £19, but I gather never greater than £28 a week.</P>
    <P>I know I am dwelling on this subject for a long time and I sincerely hope the Minister will come back on it.  It is an area which is very much <Col N="1046" /> in the news at the moment, an area in which there seems to be a great need. In my own district, in south County Dublin and in County Wicklow district there is a severe shortage of beds for long-stay geriatric patients and people are being accommodated in private hospitals and private nursing homes.  Let us consider what would be a realistic subvention.  Is £28 per week &mdash;and this is possibly the maximum figure drawn from those two sources&mdash; an adequate figure for a 24-hour, seven-day TLC, tender loving care, service?  When one relates it to costs of weekly stays in hospitals or even in welfare homes, one finds it is very difficult to do it for that figure.</P>
    <P>In many cases people who operate essential services are trying to maintain patients on as little as £18 or £19 per week.  I do not think that is possible. We should show a greater appreciation of their efforts and we should utilise the present system to the full.  In dealing with this situation the Minister may say a son or a daughter may contribute a certain amount and then it becomes a three-way contribution. From inquiries I have made&mdash; and I met representatives of these homes very recently&mdash;very often the only relatives these aged people have might be nieces or nephews who have their own commitments.  A great deal of clarification is required.</P>
    <P>This Bill speaks in terms of services. Here is a vital service for the aged.  It would appear to be the policy that, when people are no longer able to cope and provide for themselves, provided they are in reasonable health and that they are ambulant, a place will be found for them in a welfare home.  Indeed, these welfare homes are magnificent.  They are a wonderful idea.  They allow people freedom. They can express their own individuality. They do not suffer from loneliness as do many of our aged people who live alone.  They have company, comfort, warmth, heat.  I hope we will see more welfare homes in other centres.</P>
    <P>In Wicklow we look forward to the opening, possibly next month, of a welfare home in Arklow.  We may be considered lucky to have one in Bray <Col N="1047" /> and another in Arklow.  I hope we will have a third because we have many aged people in the county, many of whom are living in very remote areas, areas of very difficult terrain. Even if it were only for the winter months I would hope that these people could be offered accommodation and warmth which would build them up over the lean and most difficult period of the year for them.  I have dealt with this matter at greater length than I had intended but I hope the Minister will also deal with it at length and spell out precisely what his Department will do or permit health boards to do on behalf of these aged people. I know that the Minister is very concerned knowing that this case was brought to his notice before by people representing the Private Nursing Homes Association.  He said then that he would examine the position and do what he could.  I hope that when replying to this debate he will be able to give an adequate answer stating how he will do so.</P>
    <P>I want to speak now of the hardships experienced by many people to whom previous speakers referred. Only yesterday I met six young men working with CIE at the Broadstone Depot and who were formerly insured. They then received promotion which meant they were classified as non-manual. They now find they are over the upper limit and see that they have little or no cover.  Cover will perhaps remain&mdash;is it for 18 months?&mdash;after they go over the limit.  They see coworkers, possibly with a similar type of income, but in a different classification who, because they are termed manual workers, remain covered by the health contribution.  This is a difficult position for the six workers mentioned.  They are lucky in that they know about it in advance; somebody has interpreted the system for them and shown them their position but this does not meet their needs.</P>
    <P>Later today I hope to be able to put a representative of this group in contact with the Minister's Department so that they can state their worries that they are no longer entitled to hospital in-patient and out-patient services.  This is not because their income has become <Col N="1048" /> sufficient to enable them to provide these services for themselves, their wives and families but because of reclassification. If £3,000 is to be the figure, I would ask the Minister why he does not propose to raise this upper limit and I ask him to indicate the number of people who will be ineligible because of the limit not being raised.  It seems to be a system under which one month you are in and the next month you are out.  In that context I welcome the working party that has been set up.  I wish it success and I hope it will reach early and satisfactory conclusions. The system seems to be piecemeal in some respects at present and it is extremely difficult for people to decide unless they are dealing with it on a regular basis who should be termed manual and who should be non-manual and it makes such a difference from the point of view of eligibility for health services.</P>
    <P>I had another case very recently of a man employed as a counter-hand in a hardware store and he also does a good deal of outdoor work.  He fills up the dockets, goes out and locates the material and helps to load it on to a truck for delivery to the customer. Should he be classified as manual or non-manual?  Where does the distinction lie?  Is it too legalistic?  Is there any breakdown in respect of the proportion of a person's time spent on manual and non-manual work?  I asked this person how he saw himself and he replied that he was a certain amount of both.  Is he another person who is caught up in the complexity of the system?</P>
    <P>It is vital that this matter should be cleared up as to who is manual and who is non-manual.  It is not sufficient to await the findings of the working party; the difficulty could be resolved earlier.  The Minister is aware that certain anomalies exist and I exhort him to try to rectify them even before the findings of the working party emerge. Why wait if there is hardship for people at present if it can be identified and rectified by a stroke of the pen, of if it is not as simple as that, by a short regulation?  This side of the House would welcome a provision that would help people <Col N="1049" /> involved in a situation not of their own making or choice and who are concerned to know what their exact position is.</P>

      <P>The position concerning the eligibility for medical cards of non-contributory old age pensioners was explained in a statement which I made in reply to a question by Deputy Kitt on 25th May, 1976, Official Report, Volume 291, No. 1, columns 8 to 11.  The position remains that the holder of a non-contributory old age pension could have an income which would place him outside the medical card guidelines but that, in a great majority of cases, persons who are in receipt of such pensions at the full rate are clearly within the guidelines and consequently qualify for medical cards.</P>
      <P>While I am aware that a notice which is issued to pensioners by the Department of Social Welfare advises the recipient that if he wishes to obtain a medical card he should apply to his health board, I do not know of any statement in regulations under the Social Welfare Acts to the effect that persons in receipt of non-contributory old age pensons are automatically entitled to medical cards.</P>

      <P>It is presumed that the Deputy's question relates to the payment of unemployment assistance to smallholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1055" /> Approximately 960 smallholders registered at local offices of my Department in County Mayo will not benefit from the increased rates of unemployment assistance which will become payable from the beginning of next month as their valuations fall between £10 and £20.  Some 140 smallholders in County Mayo with land valuations over £20 have been notified that they will no longer be entitled to unemployment assistance on the notional basis of assessment from 30th March, 1977.  Smallholders in this latter group may, however, qualify for unemployment assistance on the basis of a factual assessment of their means under the general provisions of the unemployment assistance scheme.</P>

      <P>The point is they are not getting the increase on a notional basis.  As has always been the case, if a farmer opts for a factual assessment he is entitled to do so.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The way the Deputy phrased the question would tend to distort the situation, not intentionally, but it could happen.  If a farmer wishes to go for a factual assessment as opposed to a notional assessment, he is assessed factually.  He may qualify for a full pension or he may qualify for a reduced pension but on the same basis as any other recipient of social assistance.  There is no distinction whatsoever.  The farmers to whom the Deputy refers in his supplementary question may find that if they go for a factual assessment the benefit will be reduced and that it is beneficial for them to go for a notional assessment, but they have the option.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy on 2nd November last in reply to a previous question concerning the implementation of the provisions of the Act mentioned, it was decided to defer the making of the ministerial order which is necessary to bring the provisions of the Act into operation, as negotiations were in progress between the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board and the appropriate unions regarding the conditions of employment of the staff concerned. I understand that the unions and the board agreed to refer the claim jointly to the Labour Court and the outcome of that reference is now awaited.  Meanwhile I am pleased to say that I recently received an assurance from the Local Government and Public Services Union that they would co-operate fully in the implementation of the new legislation and I understand that the other union involved will be meeting shortly to consider the matter of implementation.</P>
      <P>As I assured the Deputy on the occasion of his previous question, I am most anxious to have the Act brought into operation at the earliest practicable date.  The existing home assistance scheme will, of course, continue in force until the new supplementary welfare allowances scheme comes into operation.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will certainly give me credit for trying to have this very worth-while legislation introduced as a matter of urgency.

      <P>As I explained to the Deputy in my reply, there are two unions concerned.  One union, the local government officials' union, have communicated <Col N="1059" /> that they are now prepared to implement the scheme.  A meeting of the other union concerned is to be held in the very near future and I am hopeful that a similar result will emerge from that meeting.

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was decided by an appeals officer that the person concerned was not entitled to an old age, non-contributory, pension on the ground that he did not fulfil the statutory condition as to residence.  This condition requires that a person must have had a total of 15 years' residence in the State of which at least five years were subsequent to his attaining the age of 50 years.  The person concerned has not completed five years' residence in the State since he reached the age of 50 years on the 1st October, 1959.</P>
      <P>The appeals officer's decision is final save where there are new facts or new evidence, which would warrant its revision.

    <P>The capital development grant is used mainly to provide grants for the purchase of new fishing vessels but the amount available includes provision also for the capital improvement of existing vessels, for incentive grants and for capital investment in the board's boatyards and ice plants.</P>
    <P>The advances from the Central fund and the board's own resources are used to provide loans for secondhand boats and smaller sized new boats, for the capital improvement of existing vessels, for fishing gear purchases and for capital investment in the boards own boatyards.  It is not possible at this stage of the year to give a detailed breakdown of these grants and loans as between the various headings.  The above funds will be supplemented by loan finance from Irish banks for larger new fishing vessels.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that applicants for secondhand boats are finding it very difficult to get the necessary finance from BIM and are in the position of having to go to the bank for loans on which they must pay higher rates of interest?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied in this regard but the question is one of loan finance from the Irish banks to BIM for this purpose.  The process of scrutiny in relation to applications of all kinds is slow.  I am making representations in an effort to have this process speeded up.  The slowness existed before I came on the scene.  It is a feature of the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the question is not one of slowness but of outright refusal as a result of there not being available sufficient moneys for secondhand boats?  Will he accept, too, that the purchase of secondhand boats is a very necessary step in the expansion of our fishing fleet as young fishermen, of <Col N="1063" /> necessity, buy secondhand boats initially?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the purchase of a secondhand boat can be the very important first step for a young fisherman but I would not agree with the Deputy as to the reason for the delay in reaching decisions in regard to accommodating applicants.  Any of us who has had occasion to make application to a bank for a loan has had to wait for a decision.  I cannot interfere with that situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries if, in view of the serious position of the fishing industry due to depletion of stocks, he will consider making grants available to enable fishermen who so desire to adapt to industrial and other types of fishing which are not traditionally carried out by this country's fishing fleet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>An Bord Iascaigh Mhara operate a grant and loan scheme for adapting and improving fishing boats.  An approved applicant is eligible for a grant of 25 per cent and a loan at the current subsidised interest rate of 8 per cent per annum. As part of their overall policy for the development of the sea fishing industry the board encourage fishermen to fish for species other than those traditionally fished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister telling the House that grants are available for fishermen who wish to change from the traditional type fishing to other types of fishing and can he say when these grants were introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>A grant scheme is available for adapting and improving fishing boats.  Therefore, a skipper who wished to adapt his vessel for a type of fishing in which he had not engaged in previously would be eligible to apply for both the grant and loan.  To give an example of the situation&mdash;for engines, winches and line haulers a skipper owner is asked for only 7½ per cent while other persons are asked for 15 per cent.  The grant in this case is 25 per cent and the loan as agreed in each case subject to a maximum of 67½ per cent of total <Col N="1064" /> cost is at a subsidised interest rate of 8 per cent for not more than ten years. In respect of electronic devices&mdash; radio, sonar, echo sounder, radar and decca navigator&mdash;the minimum repayment is 25 per cent while the grant, too, is 25 per cent and the loan as agreed in each case, subject to a maximum of 50 per cent of total cost, is at a subsidised interest rate of 8 per cent subject to variation, for not more than three years.</P>
      <P>In the case of decca navigator the facilities are related only to the cost of installation and necessary ancillary equipment which is not the subject of any rental agreement.  In respect of structural development&mdash;for example, hold insulation, improved accommodation, improved wheelhouse and so on&mdash;the terms are: grant, 25 per cent, repayment 25 per cent with the loan being on the same terms as for electronic equipment.  These aids are not specifically for the purpose referred to by the Deputy but they help in that regard.</P>
      <P>BIM, particularly since the decline in herring stocks, have been encouraging fishermen to diversify their fishing activities to include varieties for which they have not fished formerly, for example, sprats, dogfish and blue whiting.  Advice is given by the board in methods of fishing for these species and occasionally specialised gear is made available for this purpose.  Where finances permit, fishermen are subsidised to engage in exploratory fishing for these species.</P>
      <P>An example of this activity is the recent effort by BIM to encourage fishing for sprat for human consumption off the south-east coast.  The board succeeded to the extent that six fishing vessels transferred to sprat fishing in the area at the close of the herring season by arranging a market for the catches of sprat made by the vessels. The results to date are encouraging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board hope also to extend these operations in the near future to other varieties such as blue whiting, ling and dogfish.  It is understood, however, that the finances available to BIM at present will not be sufficient to enable them to subsidise fishermen who wish to engage in such fishing either by providing gear or by guaranteeing the <Col N="1065" /> fishermen minimum earnings while they are so engaged.  The latter may be what Deputy Gallagher is trying to establish. It is of course a matter for the board to decide how their allocation of funds is expended.</P>
    <P>The Department have strong reservations about encouraging industrial fishing, for example, aimed fishing for fishmeal. Fishermen generally share the Department's view in this regard.  The problems with industrial fishing is the use of small mesh nets which result in by-catches of immature fish of commercial species.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that long reply but it was totally irrelevant to the question I tabled.  In his original reply the Minister said that grants were not available in respect of adapting to new types of fishing. Having regard to the fact that stocks of fish of the traditional types are dwindling to such an extent, will the Minister ask BIM to make available the necessary moneys to enable people to adapt to other types of fishing, particularly industrial fishing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are doing that but one of the problems in regard to industrial fishing is, as I have said, the by-catching of immature fish of known valuable species.  If, for instance, in the process of industrial fishing millions of young herrings were caught, the effect would be very bad in the context of the conservation of that species.  The same would apply in respect of plaice, for instance.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the situation in Dundalk.  The Deputy, who lives there, must be aware that that flooding has been a problem there for the last 50 years at least.  There was an abortive Bord of Works scheme carried out in 1927, dredging was done in 1947, banks were raised in 1964, piping was put in at various times, and so on.  The last piping was done in 1975 with the approval of the Department to borrow £55,000 for the purpose.  This is not something that has just happened.  I am aware that it is causing a lot of trouble, but until Louth County Council and Dundalk Urban Council make up their minds about what should be done the matter cannot be considered further.</P>

      <P>All exports of milk and beef products from the European Community are <Col N="1071" /> subject to an export subsidy which represents the difference between the Community prices and the world prices obtaining for these products.</P>
      <P>Surpluses of milk and beef produce in the Community may be given free of charge each year to Third World countries under the Community's food aid programme.  For 1976 the Council of Ministers approved a food aid programme for the supply of butter oil and skim milk powder to a large number of Third World countries and to organisations such as the Red Cross. In the 1976 food aid programme, 45,000 tonnes of butter oil and 150,000 tonnes of skim milk powder were allocated to the Third World.  The programme for 1977 has not yet been approved by the Council of Ministers.</P>
      <P>EEC stocks of intervention beef currently amount to about 300,000 tonnes, of which 60,000 tonnes in the form of preserved products would be suitable for use as food aid.  No special export subsidy exists, however, for sales to Third World countries.  Only preserved beef is really suitable for use as food aid for Third World countries.  We would of course support measures to dispose of Community stocks to Third World countries on terms favourable to such countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department are aware of these allegations.  They very actively investigate allegations, even when they are not made to the Department, but when they come across them published in any way.  Some of these allegations are the subject of legal action which the persons affected are now bringing against the persons alleged to have ill-treated them.  Some of them are not regarded by the Department as substantiated.  In one case the Department were specifically asked not to pursue the matter.  In general the Department keep a very close eye on these allegations.  The Deputy can be assured that if it appears appropriate to raise these matters they will be raised.</P>

      <P>I can appreciate it if the Parliamentary Secretary is suggesting that possibly this case may be <i>sub judice</i> in the sense that inquiries might be made into it by the British. The answer the Parliamentary Secretary has given does not seem to justify not putting an inquiry to the British Government in a case which has got the extraordinary amount of publicity this case has already got.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to shelter behind the <i>sub judice</i> rule but I am not saying that the cases which we have refrained from commenting on to the British are before the courts <Col N="1073" /> or are going to come before the courts. We have not, in any case, been directly approached by any of the persons alleged to have been ill treated in police custody in the North, the area to which the question appears to refer. If we were directly asked to intervene different considerations might arise but we have not been directly asked to intervene.  Even though we have not been asked we do keep a close eye on them.  Of all the cases we have seen not all are regarded by the Department as substantiated or perhaps even as capable of being substantiated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the public commitment given by the British Attorney General at the Strasbourg hearings that the ill-treatment and techniques which are complained of in these reports would not be continued, does the Parliamentary Secretary not think that it was incumbent on the Government themselves to communicate, as our question asks, with the British Government to ensure that the undertaking which was offered was now being acted upon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will admit that whatever we are accused of we cannot be accused of lack of diligence in pursuing the matter of police interrogation in the North of Ireland to the point of severe embarrassment to others.  I agree that if the allegations now being made were substantiated and if it was shown that the interrogation methods which the British Attorney General promised would no longer be used were still being used, it would <Col N="1074" /> be highly relevant.  We are not satisfied that that is the case.</P>

The practice is to follow these up and if possible to contact the solicitor if there is a solicitor acting for any of the persons concerned.  The conclusion which the Department have reached at the moment is that some small number, I emphasise a small minority, of the recent cases may have substance in them and there is a small number in which the persons concerned are bringing legal action against the people who have been alleged to have ill-treated them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware of the recent 30 per cent increase in cable TV rental in Bray town; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien) Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am so aware. On 2nd October, 1976 notice was published of a petition to the High Court <Col N="1076" /> for the winding up of the company which held the cable television licence for the area in question.  This petition was not proceeded with because negotiations were concluded for the sale of the cable television assets of the company to RTE Relays.  The sale was conditional on the consent of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to the transfer of the licence and to the application of RTE Relays standard rental charges, that is, the charges which apply throughout their systems generally, in the area covered by the licence.  I gave the necessary consents.</P>
      <P>I might add that the National Prices Commission were consulted about the application of RTE Relays standard charges and raised no objection.  However, in accordance with the commission's suggestion the charges are being increased in two stages, from 1st January, 1977 and 1st January, 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must agree that the people who receive the service in Bray town regard it as being an excessive increase, from £7.20 per half year fee to £9.30 per half year fee simply because of change of supplier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts would appear to be that the previous supplier was unable to remain in business on the basis of the fees provided.  The matter came before me only in the form of whether I was prepared to consent to the transfer of the licence or not.  If I had not agreed to the transfer of the licence there was a likelihood, indeed a certainty, of interruption of cable television service in the area.  I take it the Deputy would not wish me, therefore, to have refused consent to the transfer of the licence.  That is the only problem.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that if there was a supply at <Col N="1077" /> the £7.20 rate&mdash;the supply was not discontinued in the following week&mdash; the rate of £9.30 was an excessive increase?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that those views will be fully considered in the event of proposals for the closure of any rural sub-post offices.  I should add that the closure of rural sub-post offices was regarded by the National Prices Commission's <Col N="1078" /> consultants merely as an area of possible cost-saving and that they recognise that it would require an important policy decision to proceed with it.  No such policy decision has been taken and I have at present no proposals before me for such a decision.  I should add that the Post Office Users' Council took into consideration the possible closing of uneconomic sub-post offices in sparsely-populated areas and so forth and they said &ldquo;We consider that each case should be treated on its merit as there might be important social aspects in country districts which should be taken into account in addition to those relating directly to post office services.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I assure the House that my Department will continue to take these important social aspects into consideration in each individual case and that each individual case will be considered on its merits.  There is certainly no question, as might be inferred from some newspaper headlines, of any contemplation of mass closures of post offices. That is not contemplated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>With regret I am unable to accede to that request.  We have had six continuous weeks now dealing with this Bill.  I have missed two meetings of the Council of Ministers. <Col N="1093" /> While I appreciate Deputy O'Malley has pressures on his time, I have pressures on mine also in other areas.  With regret I must decline to accept his suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair will appreciate that I have facilitated the Minister on a number of occasions in regard to a Bill which is at present before a committee of this House, as well as having facilitated him in relation to Bills and other business over the past year or two.  It has been the tradition of this House, within reason, to facilitate the Opposition spokesmen.  I recall when I was Government Whip on numerous occasions putting back business which was urgent from the Government's point of view in order to facilitate the spokesman concerned, in some cases for, perhaps, two or three weeks, because of his non-availability at the time for one reason or another.</P>
      <P>I would have hoped that tradition could have been maintained and that the Minister would, even at this stage, see his way to agree to a request which is not unreasonable.  We have now reached Report Stage and only Report and Final Stages are left.  In the nature of things there cannot be a lengthy debate on Report Stage of any Bill because, in general, speakers can only speak once.  In those circumstances, there is every reason to believe that if Report Stage is taken on Tuesday, 29th March, the Bill could be completed on Wednesday, 30th, which would be quite reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that in the past few weeks at least this Bill has been dealt with on only one day? If that caused the Minister to miss a <Col N="1094" /> meeting of the Council of Ministers, could not the Bill have been ordered for a day other than the Tuesday on which it was held so that he would not have had to miss it?  Further, in view of that fact, does it not appear that there is not an undue rush so far as the Minister is concerned in having the Bill completed?

      <P>The position is that over the past three or four weeks the Bill was ordered, as Deputy Colley said, on one day only during each week and that day was the shortest day of all, Tuesday, when a maximum of three-and-a-half hours are available for public business other than Question Time.  If the Bill were as urgent as the Minister now seems to suggest, or if the ordering of it on Tuesday interfered with his attendance at meetings of the Council of Ministers, surely it could have been ordered for Wednesday when a much longer day would have been available and it would have been possible to get through it more quickly.  In those circumstances, would the Minister not follow the tradition of the House and agree to my reasonable request that the Bill be taken on 29th March and hopefully&mdash;although there could be no guarantee of this&mdash;completed on the following day, 30th March.</P>

The instructions from our party Leader are: &ldquo;Whatever business the Government order, fall in line with it and let us not be left open to the <Col N="1095" /> charge of having impeded business in any shape or form.&rdquo;  This is a serious Bill.  An agreement has been made. Our spokesman has not been able to get appropriate answers from the Minister over a long period.

      <P>Before lunch I said that this was simply a money raising taxation measure.  Since last year we have seen a 50 per cent increase from £12 to £18 per annum without a corresponding increase in extra services or facilities.  I then went on to deal with care of the aged and spoke of the ambulant geriatrics who are very adequately looked after in welfare homes.  I then dealt with the non-ambulant geriatrics who are cared for in private nursing homes. I asked the Minister if he would provide adequate subvention for the maintenance of these people.  I would like to pay tribute to the public health nurse.  She plays an extremely important part in meeting and providing services under this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister agrees that quite a few people qualify for services but there is a huge backlog that has to be dealt with.  I <Col N="1100" /> had hoped that if there was an increase in the number of social workers and public health nurses that backlog might be eliminated.</P>
      <P>In my constituency there are huge numbers awaiting dental treatment and assessment.  This is not the fault of the senior dental surgeon and his staff. They do tremendous work but they are handicapped by the huge numbers who are entitled to services and, in addition, the conditions under which they work impose limitations on them. It appears that two of the 700 new jobs the Minister mentioned will be coming to the constituency; I understand we will have a dental officer and a dental assistant.  However, even though it is some step along the way it does not go far enough.</P>
      <P>At the moment we have wonderful lay personnel who do tremendous work.  We also have extremely zealous and dedicated religious people who give much of their time to this work but as the numbers in this group decrease the costs and charges for health will soar.  This is a factor that I hope will be brought before the new committee. I hope the Minister will tell us what financial commitment he is prepared to make, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, to the health board in the way of adequate grants for the maintenance of geriatrics in private nursing homes who offer an excellent service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Having heard the Chair's ruling with regard to Deputy Murphy's speech, my contribution will be brief.  If it were left to me to decide whether this Bill should be accepted, I would be inclined to oppose it because the people I represent will not be getting full and reasonable health benefits.  I refer to the situation that exists in relation to the county hospital in Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people who make contributions to health or other services expect that those services will be as good as in other areas.  For this reason they must be concerned about the way the contributions are being used.  I understand the advice given by Comhairle na nOspidéal to the Minister was that the maternity services in Roscommon <Col N="1101" /> County Hospital be withdrawn.  If these contributions are used to implement that decision, they will be put to a wrong use and, to a certain extent, to an illegal use.  I understand that section 41 of the Health Act 1970 does not empower Comhairle na nOspidéal to decide on the closing down of any institution.  I have also been advised that section 38 is the operative section for the use of this money when it is contributed by the people concerned. Under that section there is an obligation on the Minister and on the health board to provide hospital services. Having made a decision that they are necessary and must be supplied, the Minister asks Comhairle na nOspidéal to advise him on the staffing.</P>
    <P>Section 41 of the Health Act, 1970, states:</P>
    <P>(b) The functions of the Council shall be&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) to regulate the number and type of appointments of consultant medical staffs and such other officers or staffs as may be prescribed, in hospitals engaged in the provision of services under this Act;</P>
    <P>It is obvious that they have no legal power to decide on the closing down of maternity services in the hospital. This is something that rests solely with the health board with the permission of the Minister.  I should like to know from the Minister in his reply if he has prescribed for Comhairle na nOspidéal the duty of making the absolute decision as to whether maternity and gynaecological services should continue in Roscommon County Hospital.</P>
    <P>Section 38 (1) says:</P>
    <P>A Health Board may, with the consent of the Minister, provide and maintain any hospital ... under the Health Acts, 1947 to 1970.</P>
    <P>I submit that this is where the authority lies in relation to deciding on the closing or regrading of hospitals. Subsection (3) of that section reads:</P>
    <P>A health board may and, if directed by the Minister, shall discontinue the provision and maintenance of any premises provided and maintained by it under subsection (1).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1102" /> Here, again, I have no doubt that the people I represent and the people that this Bill will ask to contribute under the Health Contributions Act to the maintenance of those hospitals would expect and believe that nobody but the Minister would be the final authority on this matter.  Subsection (5) of section 38 reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister shall not give a direction under subsection (3) in relation to the discontinuance of the provision and maintenance of a hospital, sanitorium or home save after having caused a local inquiry to be held into the desirability of the discontinuance.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister indicate when that local inquiry will be held in Roscommon so as to comply with subsection (5) of section 38?  This is a very serious problem and it is one which it is alleged politicians coming into this House regard as purely political, with the interest of influencing votes at future elections.  In my present state of mind I do not think that charge can be made against me.  I am a medical practitioner operating in north Roscommon. No doubt a large number of the people in my area will have to make contributions under this legislation for the maintenance of those hospitals and, having made their contributions, they would like to think that the hospital services provided for them would not alone be adequate but be within a reasonable distance of them so that they could reach them with a reasonable amount of comfort at the most unpleasant times of the year. Otherwise some injustice will be done to them by asking them to make contributions under this legislation in the circumstances that the alternative offered to them is to travel, perhaps, 60 to 70 miles to receive maternity assistance and maternity treatment.</P>
    <P>It may be suggested they will find alternative accommodation which may be provided for them in Sligo, which is the nearest hospital to north Roscommon, and that those contributions will be used for providing that accommodation. However, this accommodation is not there at present.  I am fully aware that all the maternity accommodation of the Western Health Board <Col N="1103" /> is taken up at present and I think it is true to say that without the maternity beds in the Roscommon County Hospital the Western Health Board have not sufficient maternity beds under their control to cater for the needs of the area.  This is a basic medical fact which, as far as we are concerned, takes all this out of the realm of politics.</P>
    <P>A further proof of this is that the Minister has stated on a previous occasion that he had intended, as a first priority, to help the Western Health Board to extend Castlebar, and that the second priority was the extension of the number of maternity beds in the regional hospital in Galway.  No doubt the money he proposes to collect through this legislation will be used for those purposes.  The fact that he is proposing to establish extra maternity beds indicates without any argument that there are not enough maternity beds there at the moment.  Without providing the extra maternity beds, and removing the 26 beds that are in the Roscommon County Hospital, he will aggravate the situation and will be coming back to this House for a further increase in the health contributions so as to overcome the problem.</P>
    <P>In regard to the proper use of the moneys that will be collected by this legislation I hope the Minister will inform the public who will be paying the contributions that he is prepared to make use of the powers he has under section 38 of this 1970 Health Act.  I understand that the CEO will make use of his legal powers&mdash;I have not been talking to him but this is what I gather from the local papers &mdash;to decide that the unit will continue and then the Minister will be faced with making a decision whether it does or not.  I suggest he must make a decision to keep those beds and that, if he decides to discontinue them he must hold a local inquiry in accordance with subsection (5) of section 38.</P>
    <P>The local inquiry is not defined fully in the subsection but I have no doubt it will be the type of inquiry which will be accepted by the people as a full inquiry into all the facts, <Col N="1104" /> figures and the difficulties and responsibilities that a hospital unit would have in the community.  If that is properly conducted, I have no doubt the Minister will be persuaded to accept the decision of the CEO and at that point I submit that he asks the advice of Comhairle na nOspidéal as to what the staffing of the unit should be.</P>
    <P>I agree there is this difficulty of having one obstetrician-gynaecologist or two obstetrician-gynaecologists in a unit in relation to the number of people who are in the hospital.  This, I agree, is a proper consideration in view of the fact that a Minister has to seek authority in this House for requiring people to make contributions for the maintenance of not alone the hospital but the people who will staff it. Comhairle na nOspidéal may say to him that there must be two of those people, that there is no justification in the circumstances for having them and that people should not be asked to contribute for this purpose.  However, they have already agreed to establish one surgeon in it and I believe they could start with one obstetrician-gynaecologist. I have no doubt that, if the services are provided there on a proper basis with qualified people, over the years, with the return of the people of the catchment area to the hospital when proper services are provided for them, and with a further increase in population in the area, eventually the establishment of a proper maternity unit with two obstetrician gynaecologists will become a reality.  Then, the Minister will be justified in coming here to seek support for this legislation and subsequently, with the legislation he will be justified in asking my constituents to contribute to these funds.</P>
    <P>I apologise that frequently during my contribution I have used the phrase &ldquo;contributions to the health services&rdquo; but I expect the Chair will understand my position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to make a short contribution to this debate and to emphasise what appears to be an anomalous situation in one regard. Some of the increases announced by the Minister are extraordinarily large. <Col N="1105" /> He has announced that it is proposed to increase hospital maintenance charges by 30 per cent with effect from April 1.  In a way this can be compared with the 20 per cent increase in the cost of stamps and the extra 20 per cent or £3 referred to in section 2 of the Bill.  The Minister mentioned that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had sanctioned this proposal.  Indeed, the latter seems to be sanctioning all proposals for increases. The Minister for Health and Social Welfare went on to say that he would arrange with the VHI that their subscribers be afforded the opportunity of increasing their cover to provide for the revised charges.</P>
      <P>The headlines in today's papers refer to the increases being sanctioned for Members of the Oireachtas but to endeavour to put the matter into perspective I might cite what the increase envisaged in VHI contributions, for instance, will mean to me.  My annual contribution is in the region of £150 so if I increase that by 30 per cent I will be paying an extra £45 per year or, almost £1 per week.  That represents an immediate and extra diminution of any extra benefits I may receive by way of salary.</P>
      <P>My purpose in speaking this afternoon is to suggest to the Minister some ways in which savings in expenditure could be effected which would leave it unnecessary for him to seek so much money from those in the limited eligibility categories as well as from the workers who must pay the piper all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case I want to cite concerns a constituent, the holder of a medical card, who came to me recently to complain that, after a visit to his local dental clinic where he was given a prescription for medication in respect of pains in his gums, he was charged almost £3 by the chemist to have the prescription compounded.  I am not a member of a health board but my understanding of the situation in so far as medical cards holders are concerned, is that they are entitled to have their prescriptions compounded free of charge.  However, I took the complaint up with the appropriate officer in the Midland Health Board and he referred me to the senior dentist at the clinic <Col N="1106" />&mdash;Deputy Haughey tells me this is the person known as the orthodontist&mdash; and he, in turn, explained that there was a problem here and that in order to have the prescription compounded free of charge the person concerned should have taken it to his doctor who would have duplicated it.  The man could then take the duplicate to the chemist who would not charge him for the medication.  Otherwise the medical card holder is treated as a private patient for the purpose of the prescription.  The orthodontist told me that there is a problem in this area and that although they have been endeavouring for some time to have the situation resolved with the Department of Health, they do not appear to be getting anywhere.</P>
    <P>Is it the position that the medical profession are opposed to a change in the regulation in this regard?  In any case, the point I am making is that there is wastage in this area and I should like the Minister to refer to the position when he is replying.  Is there a need for a middleman in respect of such prescriptions?  Does this not represent unnecessary expenditure in that the doctor is paid under the Health Acts in the same way as if the medical card holder had consulted him about some health matter?  This practice represents an additional £2 or whatever is the figure agreed between the Minister and the doctors in that regard.  It is an additional charge falling for payment under this Bill.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I am making all this sound very complicated but I see no need for a doctor merely to fulfil some regulation to have to duplicate a prescription written by a dentist. Can the Minister explain why that is so, or whether there is an objection from the dental side?  Is it possible to have this thing looked at?  A tremendous amount of money must be spent by the various health boards.  This is only my experience of this operation. I was told by the senior dental surgeon who spoke to me about this, that this <Col N="1107" /> is a very costly extra as he sees it, that has to be met by my health board.  I presume it is the same all over.  I am drawing the Minister's attention to this with a view to seeing if the practice could be eliminated.</P>

      <P>Possibly Deputy Lalor knows exactly what the case was.  I could not follow it.  Apart from the various people who were involved in providing orthopaedic treatment, the fact is that nobody who holds a medical card should have to pay, as Deputy Lalor said, £1.50.</P>

      <P>I will inquire into it. The Deputy also suggested that this might be the practice in other health boards.  I will look into that as well. I thank the Members of the House who contributed today on the Health Contributions Bill.  The one noticeable thing was that there was not much if any mention at all of the amount of money provided.  The tenor of the debate about this time last year was to the effect that there was not sufficient money.  I do not know whether Deputies are satisfied or gravely surprised that there has been a pretty steep increase.  We talked this morning about possible extravagances, waste and so on in the health services but the speeches requested and demanded that more money be provided for this, that and the other.  I do not object to this nor would any Minister for Health.  There are reasons for these demands to which I will refer later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give the House some idea of how health expenditure has increased in recent times.  I will take it from 1972-73 merely because health has been my responsibility from March, 1973.  I do not make comparisons to throw them in the face of Fianna Fáil or anything like that, because there are factors which necessitated the increase in the cost of the health services.  In 1972-73 the amount met from the Exchequer was £76.7 million.  Over the years that increased by fairly substantial amounts until it is now £299.7 million&mdash;that is for non-capital expenditure.  In the <Col N="1108" /> Book of Estimates the figure is for £289.7 million but the figure I have quoted includes the £10 million which the Minister for Finance announced in the budget would be allocated to the Department of Health for specific purposes.  That increase by any standards, I suggest, is an indication that we are meeting our obligations towards the health services and that we are improving them.  Capital money has risen from £6.6 million in 1972-73 to £16 million.  This includes £6.8 million for new starts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey and I are at variance as to what the GNP would be in 1977.  Far be it from me to challenge the figures that he gave in the absence of certain information. Over the last four years the percentage of health expenditure of gross national product rose from 4.8 per cent to over 6 per cent.  I said 6.5 per cent this morning.  It may be proved right or wrong, but it does not matter at this stage.  It will be very pertinent, as suggested by Deputy Haughey, when he comes, within the Select Committee, to consider the overall health services. It will be seen that health expenditure has risen very rapidly in recent years, not alone in money terms but in terms of a percentage of the gross national product.  The services have improved rapidly.  The House agreed this morning that it was time to take stock and to assess the future of health care.  This view has been expressed over a period by all sides of the House and I feel that all parties should have a chance to participate in discussion through the representatives which they nominate.</P>
    <P>The number of personnel engaged in health services in this country is not widely known.  I am not referring entirely to people employed by the health boards, but also to those in all the health agencies.  The number has risen by 12,000 from 1972 to 1977. That is a pretty substantial increase. These people represent a big proportion of the population and are giving extremely good service.  I will give a few examples of those increases. These will not make up the total of 12,000 extra to which I have referred, but it will give an indication of the <Col N="1109" /> improvements that have been made as far as personnel is concerned and more importantly as far as the services are concerned.  In 1972 the amount spent on home helps was £150,000.  It may be that the scheme did not get off the ground for a few years, but at that time, in 1972, the expenditure was £150,000.  Deputies have stressed the importance of home helps and the desirability of keeping people out of institutions, particularly old people. This is also reflected in the number of home helps that we have at present who constitute a substantial portion of the 12,000 extra jobs.  There are now 4,800 home helps employed in the health services by the various health boards whilst in 1972 there were only 500.  Deputy Leonard mentioned this and advocated that more home helps be employed.  I can safely assure him that even within this year there will be an increase in the number of home helps.  There have been an extra 100 junior hospital doctors, 150 extra laboratory technicians, ten additional senior dental officers and 35 additional wholetime dental surgeons.  If money and numbers employed are any guide it must be admitted that over the past four years there has indeed been a vast improvement in our health services.</P>
    <P>There was not much mention today of the number of people covered by medical cards or complaints about withdrawals.  Inevitably there will be withdrawals during the year, but people will be inclined to think about withdrawals rather than the number of people newly issued with medical cards.  That has shown a substantial increase in a great benefit to those covered by medical cards.  Again I quote figures to show the improvement there has been.  In December, 1972, there were 864,106 people covered by medical cards and that represented coverage of 28 per cent of our population for all the health services.  This in December, 1976, had risen to 1,193,909 which now means that 38 per cent of the population are covered for all the medical services.  I know there are many on the border line who have £1 or £2 above the amounts laid down by the chief executive officers, but of course there will always <Col N="1110" /> be hard cases, not alone in this group but in the middle income group as well.</P>
    <P>When I took office there were guidelines set down by the CEOs and they differed vastly right across the country. As a result of questions asked here in the Dáil and of having the matter raised in other places I decided that I would see the CEOs to try to ensure that the guidelines would be uniform. That is the case now and there is no difference between the guidelines in any part of the country, in any of the health boards or in any of the counties. These guidelines are reviewed at least annually.  There was a time when the review would not take place for well over a year or perhaps two or three years.  Now, having regard to the increase in the consumer price index and to the movement as far as wages are concerned, not alone are these guidelines reviewed annually but they are reviewed twice during the year because conditions can change in a year and it is only fair that they should be reviewed as they are now, twice yearly.</P>
    <P>A big question that concerns us all is the rising cost of the health services and whether or not value has been achieved. It is very difficult to say whether or not that is so.  I have made several comments on this during the past year in the Dáil and at various medical functions, and I hope there is an awareness amongst all those who are practising in the health services, particularly the health boards, of the importance of giving value for money.  I am afraid there are sub-organisations in the medical profession who do not seem to have appreciation of money and costs.  I will not say that this is widespread but there are some who do not seem to think in terms of money at all but who believe that if something needs to be done, improved or introduced, all they have to do is ask for the money and it will be given to them.  As a result of the taking away of the health charges from the local bodies over the last four years when these charges were reduced each year&mdash;they are now nil&mdash; we have a situation where the health boards have no responsibility, or else a minimum, maybe 1 or 2 per cent responsibility, for health expenditure. It was Government policy, a good <Col N="1111" /> policy, to take these health charges away from the local rates, and the health boards have behaved responsibly as far as the submission of estimates for the health services is concerned. However, it does leave the Minister in the invidious position where he pays for all these services and the public representative has not the same responsibility as he had when the local rates provided 40 per cent of health expenditure.  Members of the health boards, many of whom are members of county councils, were very much aware of the impact on the rates when the health charges were part of the rates.</P>
    <P>In so far as value for money is concerned, we have endeavoured within the Department by circular to the health agencies, health boards and so on, to emphasise the importance of value for money.  In order to try to reduce the drug bill we also have had a working party on drug prescribing and their recommendations are now being implemented.  I hope and trust that those engaged in prescribing will have regard to the cost, but not of course by reducing the quality as far as the patients are concerned.  I also have in the Department some additional staff employed to see how the money is spent and to try to improve management in the health services.  Outside consultants have been and will in the future be helping us in this regard.  This aspect of the matter will also be looked into by the Special Committee which was agreed to this morning.</P>
    <P>We should not think that we are the only country in the world faced with rising costs and rising expenditure, particularly in the last decade or so.  It is a world-wide problem, it is a problem for our nearest neighbours and certainly a problem in the USA where health care expenditure had quadrupled in the last ten years or so.  Therefore it is apparent that governments must try to solve this problem and we too must tackle it in any way we can. We must not alone provide the best services we can but we must try to get them at the best price we can in the interest of the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> I appreciate the attitude of those who are demanding more and more services, more and more hospital beds, more and more attention and who are demanding that the waiting list be reduced.  Increased demand is a reality.  It seems to be pretty limitless.  It has been brought about mainly by two factors.  Improved techniques and technology are responsible in themselves for a growing demand.  About ten, 15 or 20 years ago technology and techniques were not of the high order they now are.  There was nothing to be availed of, so to speak.  Now people believe, and rightly so, that most ailments are curable.  The results of tremendous research have shown that many ailments which were previously regarded as chronic are now curable. There is also the factor of improved knowledge among the population of the value of health care.  This has led to a growing demand as well.  Another small factor which must be mentioned is that people are becoming much more aware of their entitlements under the health services and are duly presenting themselves to their doctors and various other members of the medical profession.</P>
    <P>There is no sign of the demand slowing down to any extent.  On the contrary, it is increasing rapidly every day.  I should like to give two examples, and very deserving ones.  There has been an explosion in the demand for services for the mentally handicapped which I believe is to be welcomed. It reflects the growing social concern about the needs of the mentally handicapped.  As I said in this House before, people do not now tend to hide this type of illness, and rightly so.  I was appalled on one occasion on visiting a house where there was a mentally handicapped child to discover the child was put away in some remote room so that the neighbours would not see the child.  As in the case of TB years ago, people now freely recognise that this illness is curable.  They realise treatment, occupational therapy and general care are provided for the mentally handicapped. Progress has been made in that respect.  I say progress.  I certainly would not say the problem is solved. <Col N="1113" /> In the past four years, 1,000 residential places were provided for the mentally handicapped.  That still does not meet the needs of the nation but it can be described as a pretty good improvement.</P>
    <P>Yesterday we had a question about hip replacement.  The demand for hip replacements has also been increasing. Over the past few years new techniques have been employed to help persons who found it very difficult to move about let alone to walk.  We also have the problem of drug prescribing to which I referred a few minutes ago. It seems to me that doctors and those in the profession who may prescribe drugs should give consideration to the amount of drugs and the cost of the drugs they prescribe.  It is very difficult to resist demands most of which are genuine.  I have given two examples and I could give very many more.</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion that health costs should be met from a national insurance scheme instead of from taxation as at present.  A working party has been set up on the financing of the health and social welfare services and I expect there will be a report this year.  If we are to move from taxation financing to weekly insurance premiums we will have to raise something like £316 million from those premiums, that is, if the insurance scheme is to cover all the costs. Even if we assume that the insurance scheme would cover only half&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year I tried to confine the debate to health contributions. When the Chair challenged the Opposition with being out of order they made a request and it was acceded to, and we had what were, in effect, <Col N="1114" /> Estimate speeches.  I do not propose to keep the Deputy much longer.  I was just saying what I think.  I was saying it without prejudice or criticism of anybody. I was stating the facts as I see them and the problems which confront us.</P>
      <P>Even if the insurance scheme were to cover only half the health expenditure, £158 million would still have to be raised in that way and the balance provided by the Exchequer.  This is not in deference to what Deputy Haughey said but I have completed what I wanted to say generally.  The Select Committee will look into this matter as well.</P>
      <P>The Deputy was quite unfair when he said the increase of 6p per week represented an increase of 50 per cent in 12 months.  I do not know how he got that figure.  This is the second increase since this time last year.  The 1976 and 1977 increases combined would be 50 per cent but that would cover a period of two years.  I do not think there can be much of a quibble about the extra 6p, particularly when one has regard to the pattern of the increases over the past six years.  On 1st October, 1971, when the scheme was commenced the weekly contribution was 15p; on 1st January, 1975, it was 26p; on 1st April, 1976, it was 33p; on 1st April of this year it will be 39p.  An increase in the contributions from 15p in 1971 to 39p in 1977 cannot be regarded as being exorbitant. For those who receive the services it is pretty good value for money, not alone in respect of insured workers but also the other two categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also asked what kind of jobs will be created.  I referred to the sum of £7.5 million.  The extent and number of jobs which will be created by this additional finance which was allocated in the budget cannot be determined until final decisions are taken on the allocation of this money. Deputies are possibly aware that there are discussions going on&mdash;many of them may be finalised now&mdash;with the health boards to see what proposals they have and what the employment content is. Some people believe this is money that will go to the top bracket of the medical profession but this is not so.  The <Col N="1115" /> number will run into many hundreds and the personnel involved will include public health nurses, social workers, child care staff, home helps, general nurses, para-medical staff of all kinds, maintenance staff, domestic staff, staff in homes for the mentally handicapped, doctors and dentists, to mention just some.  This will enable a considerable improvement to be made to the services also; it is not merely job creation but also means of improvement in the health services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey also referred to the burden of voluntary health insurance through the increase of 30 per cent in charges.  VHI premiums are subject to income tax rebate which greatly benefits many contributors and I believe that private patients, even with the increase, still meet only half the economic cost in the major teaching hospitals.  Deputy Lalor complains that it will cost him possibly another £1; I am sure he does not regard himself as the average salaried man but I think he would certainly agree that he would get good value from the VHI.</P>
    <P>If one takes a man and wife and two children with no eligibility for treatment in a semi-private room&mdash;I think this would be a typical example&mdash;the voluntary health insurance would amount to £106.50.  The tax rebate would be about £37.50 and the net cost £69 per year.  I would not consider that an undue burden considering the cost of hospital services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey also asked me about non-manual workers who were voluntary contributors before 1974 and said they should be entitled to limited eligibility indefinitely.  This is one of the matters that has been referred to the special committee that I mentioned this morning.  This anomaly being specifically raised will be specially considered by the working party of the FUE, the Medical Association and the trade union movement.  Many of us can see anomalies in that respect and also as regards manual and non-manual workers.  It is no consolation for me to say that this distinction between manual and non-manual workers has obtained for many years. It is one of the anomalies in this <Col N="1116" /> scheme and it is also being considered by the working party.  It has been examined by the Department and discussed with the CEOs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy referred to the inadequacy of payments to homes caring for geriatric cases in the Eastern Health Board areas.  I am informed that health board officers met the private voluntary hospitals and the nursing homes association yesterday.  I do not yet know the outcome but I shall be sure to look at the report as soon as it is produced or as soon as there is an approach to my Department.</P>

      <P>Deputy Murphy also said he hoped that the first working party meeting would not be simply an inaugural meeting.  I do not know what his point is; there must be an inaugural meeting but I want to assure him that this was not intended as a formality.  It is the intention to get to work straight away on this difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Leonard referred to a delay in orthopaedic treatment especially in the case of hip replacements.  There are such delays because new techniques have been developed and many more people are presenting themselves <Col N="1117" /> for this operation.  Facilities are being improved by the addition of new units and by appointing extra staff.  There is an addition to the accommodation being provided at Navan; the unit at Galway is being improved and a new unit for the north west is proposed. In respect of the north west two extra orthopaedic surgeons will be required. That will cut down the waiting list to some extent but will not entirely eliminate it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney suggests that extra orthodontists be employed in the public health service.  Up to now the health boards gave priority to improving the ordinary dental service.  I believe that money will be available this year to recruit orthodontists but they may be difficult to recruit.  I can assure the Deputy of my interest in this matter and will certainly do all I can to help to ensure that extra orthodontists will be employed.  Whether they can be recruited is another matter.  The Deputy made the same point regarding provision of spectacles. He suggested that they be supplied through opticians who would test sight. The use of opticians as against doctors or ophthalmologists in prescribing glasses is being considered but it was deferred last year because of financial considerations.</P>
    <P>Many other matters were raised in the debate including one specific and intricate one mentioned by Deputy Dr. Gibbons.  If I may be forgiven for not dealing with it now I can promise that I will comment by way of letter to him on the problems that he posed. Finally, I do not think anybody can be dissatisfied with the amount of money being devoted by the Government to the health services this year. There will be a very substantial improvement not alone in the personnel but in the services themselves.  Unfortunately, last year it was not possible to do everything all of us would like to have done due to financial considerations. I am satisfied that as far as 1976 was concerned we managed to keep up the standard of health care.  This year we can improve it not alone on the non-capital side but also on the capital side.</P>
    <P>There will be many hundreds of new jobs which should benefit individuals <Col N="1118" /> and the various professions.  It pained me last year not to be able to open certain institutions which had been completed in 1976 but now I am in the position where I can not alone open those units but I can also open those that will be completed and ready for occupation in 1977.  I should say in case there is any confusion about it that £6.8 million of the £16 million which were allocated for capital purposes have been devoted to new starts on major projects at a cost of £4.6 million.  These would be projects at a very advanced stage where tenders had been invited or accepted.</P>
    <P>I have also introduced a system where as a result of allocations made to the health boards amounting to £2.2 million the boards may at their discretion engage in work on capital projects that would not cost more than £25,000 and that would be completed this year.  It will be within their discretion to decide how that money will be spent.  That is estimated to entail 700 new jobs, most of which will be in the building and ancillary industries.</P>
    <P>Approximately £2.5 million will be devoted to new health facilities either already completed or due for completion in 1977.  It is estimated that 800 additional jobs will be created by the opening of these new facilities.  The staff to be employed will include doctors, nurses, para-medics, domestic staff, residential care staff and maintenance staff.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the House for the manner in which they approached this measure and the proposal to establish this select committee. I am confident that 1977 will show a very big increase in the services that were restrained in 1976.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That it be an instruction to the Committee on the Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Bill, 1975, that it has power to make provision in the Bill in relation to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) the establishment of an Employment Equality Agency, having functions in relation to the said Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Bill, 1975, and the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974.</P>
      <P>(ii) compulsory re-instatement or compulsory re-engagement in relation to cases of retaliatory dismissal under the said Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Bill, 1975, and the said Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and</P>
      <P>(iii) any other matters incidental</P>
      <P>The purpose of the motion is to permit the moving of amendments that would make provision in the Bill in relation to the establishment of an Employment Equality Agency having functions in relation to the Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Bill, 1975, and also having functions in relation to the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974.  The amendments will also refer to the compulsory re-instatement and compulsory re-engagement in relation to cases of retaliatory dismissal under the Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Bill, 1975, and the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to move this motion because the amendments are additional and depart somewhat from the provisions of the Bill as originally before the House.  The Employment Equality Agency will have both an investigative and overseeing role. First, it will have the function in the public interest of identifying and seeking out areas of discrimination where they exist.  It will also have an enforcing function to ensure that the terms of the legislation apply in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To achieve this the agency will carry out formal investigations and it will have power in connection with these investigations to require the production of information.  The agency will then either recommend changes in practices or issue nondiscriminatory notices requiring those <Col N="1123" /> who are infringing the provisions of either of the Acts to cease such unlawful practices.  Of course, if there is persistent discrimination the agency may seek an injunction from the High Court to ensure that the person in breach of the law desists.</P>
    <P>The agency will have the sole right to institute proceedings in cases of discriminatory advertisements.  Where advertisements in their format or language break the provisions of the legislation the agency can institute proceedings.  The agency will also be able to assist individuals in the preparation and presentation of their cases where special circumstances justify it.</P>
    <P>I hope the agency will have an important role as educator in generally promoting equality of opportunity.  It will be a source of information about legislation and about the remedies available to those who suffer, or feel they suffer, discrimination and it will conduct research into the areas in which the law applies as well.  Guidelines and codes of good practice in the light of investigations carried out by the agency will be published.</P>
    <P>During the debate on this Bill Deputies accepted the need for such an educative central organising agency and the purpose of this motion is to meet the need expressed in this House and elsewhere.  The agency will consist of a chairman and ten ordinary members to be appointed by me.  Of the ordinary members two will be workers' members, two employers' members and of the remaining six members three will be representative of women's organisations.  The staff of the agency will be civil servants provided from the offices of the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>A similar agency, the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission, was established in the United States in 1972.  In Britain the Equal Opportunities Commission of 1975 carries out similar functions and in Northern Ireland the Equal Opportunities Commission came into power in 1976.</P>
    <P>I would hope the agency will monitor progress towards the elimination of discrimination in employment under the Equal Pay Act and, based on this legislation, make recommendations <Col N="1124" /> to the Government of the day for any amendments that may be considered necessary.  The agency will, of course, be independent of the Government in its work.</P>
    <P>Another reason for moving this motion is that the remedies for retaliatory dismissal for those pursuing claims on equal treatment under this legislation or for equal pay under the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, are being brought into line with the remedies under the unfair dismissals legislation. The Bill, as originally put before the House, provided for either monetary compensation or that reinstatement may be recommended.  It is now proposed that the remedy will also be available that one may order re-instatement or order re-engagement if the Labour Court findings support these remedies.</P>
    <P>I referred to these amendments on the Second Stage of the Bill in December, 1976, but it is necessary, in accordance with Standing Orders, to move this motion to give an instruction to the committee empowering it to make these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new approach in introducing a Bill of this nature, that half of it is brought forward at a particular time and then, when the many inadequacies of the Bill are seen, to decide, by way of motion, 16 or 17 months later, to introduce the bones that were missing from the original Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I support the need for social legislation, this Minister and this Government have been overplaying, for cheap political gain, much of the legislation that has been introduced here.  This Bill is a glaring example of it.  About ten days prior to the West Mayo by-election which was held in November, 1975, this Bill was circulated and the Second Stage ordered. It took approximately 12 months to reach the Second Stage and when the Second Stage was reached the bones to which I have referred as being missing from it were agreed by all sides of the House to be missing.  The Bill was presented to the House without the Employment Equality Agency referred to in the motion, or a similar body, either a new section of the <Col N="1125" /> Labour Court specifically to deal with this legislation or at least a body of some sort to deal with the many problems that will arise under this legislation.</P>
    <P>We shall not be opposing the motion simply because it gives us the opportunity of discussing on Committee Stage all the amendments proposed. The Bill introduced in October-November, 1975, deliberately excluded the necessary bones because it was expedient to have some measure circulated before an electoral contest.  This is to be deplored.</P>
    <P>If this Government have failed in any area and if this Minister has failed in any area, I believe it to be in the area of equal opportunities and equal rights for women generally. There has been the disastrous backtracking or reneging on the commitment by this House to equal pay under the 1974 Bill.  The Equal Opportunities Bill which was expected to follow fairly quickly on the 1974 Bill is now being used as a political tool to convince some of the electorate that something is being done.</P>
    <P>The number of amendments alone in this Bill prove how ill-prepared or how far from being ready was the initial Bill as circulated.  My party have no objection to this motion so that we may get to Committee Stage. I am very pleased, in fact, to see the official representation in the House is all ladies.  The only worry I have now is the danger of discrimination being exercised in the opposite direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the innovation.  I am glad to see them here. I have no objection to the motion but I am very critical of the necessity for this motion because of omissions from the Bill as presented to the House. I believe that Bill should never have been circulated if it had not been properly researched and prepared at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a great deal of social legislation passed in recent times.  Each measure was improved because of the <Col N="1126" /> attention given to it here on Committee Stage.  The amendments to the Bill indicate very clearly that much more time and detailed examination must be given to this measure than was given to others because of the inadequacies of the Bill as presented.</P>
    <P>There is hardly a section or subsection of the Bill that has not been amended for Committee Stage.  The additions are numerous, and the Minister referred to the setting up of the Employment Equality Agency.  I am not sure that he should not have given time to examining, wherever possible, the establishment of such an agency under the wing of the Labour Court or a new section of the Labour Court in order to keep as closely related as possible to the activities of the agency under this Bill.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that in the Unfair Dismissals Bill the powers of the redundancy tribunals have been extended to cover cases under it.  The one fear I have about all this social legislation is that we would have here a pattern somewhat similar to that in Britain where the effect of some of the social legislation has been the number of trivial cases being brought before these bodies involving the State in enormous expense.  We must investigate the size of this body.  The Minister said it would consist of a chairman and ten ordinary members.  My party and I would question very seriously the necessity for such a large membership of this agency in the initial stages. The greater the number on it the greater the cost to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Again, I accuse the Minister of a certain amount of window dressing here.  In regard to setting up the equality agency, the Minister says there would be two employer representatives, two worker representatives and six appointed by the Minister, three of whom would represent women's organisations.  I believe the Minister is playing nicely to women's organisations.  It is important that three members be women, but I question very seriously why this House should give such extensive power to any Minister in this Government to appoint a chairman and six members to this agency.  We have seen from experience <Col N="1127" /> what kind of appointments have been made to date.  They are all political.  The first essential for the seven members we are talking about here will be that they be supporters of one or other of the parties forming the Government.  Nobody else is given any opportunity in relation to this type of agency at the present time.  For that reason the numbers proposed here must be studied in detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that in relation to the two workers' representatives the Minister has not stipulated that at least one must be a woman.  I am amazed, too, that in regard to the two employer representatives it is not stipulated that one be a woman.  Yet in regard to the six ordinary members the Minister says that three must be representative of women's organisations. I have no objection to a greater proportion than 50 per cent of the membership being comprised of women.</P>
    <P>Giving the Minister power to appoint six members means in effect that ministerial appointments will dominate this agency completely.  If there is to be a fair expression of views, a fair opportunity of adjudication on whatever differences may arise under the Act, it is imperative that there be equal representation of the workers', the employers' and the State sides and that there be a neutral chairman.  The chairman will not be neutral, though, in so far as politics are concerned.  We know from experience that he will be appointed from one of the political parties, that perhaps he will be a card-paying member or a well known supporter of either of the Government parties. Later we shall be discussing the question of compulsory re-engagement in regard to cases of retaliatory dismissal. The relevant Bill has far-reaching consequences.  Certain sections of it will create anomalies because we are saying that there must not be discrimination against either sex or even between people of the same sex.  There are sections in the Bill into which not enough thought has been put in relation to the <Col N="1128" /> difficulties that will be created.  We have no objection to the motion but we shall discuss the details on the Bill itself.  The Bill was inadequate in its original form but there are amendments now which result in its being put into better shape.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" /> In page 2, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;the Agency&rsquo; means the Employment Equality Agency established by section 27;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment provides for a definition of the agency which will be known as the Employment Equality Agency.  Amendment No. 51 provides that the agency will be established by affirmative order.  As I said in putting the motion we have just dealt with, the agency will consist of a chairman and ten ordinary members to be appointed by me and that of those ordinary members, two shall be workers' representatives and two employers' representatives, while of the remaining six which shall be nominated by me three shall be representative of women's organisations.</P>
    <P>In a matter of this kind I do not know whether we should concern ourselves about the sex of the members. What is important is that the representatives be authentic representatives of the organisations nominating them. If a woman were available for the post she would probably be nominated by the organisation representing the women, but obviously a man could be nominated also.  Unfortunately it is not always women who are the best advocates of women's rights.  I merely make this point because the Deputy implied that there was an innate virtue in women being nominated to these posts.  It is important that women's organisations are given a natural place when certain vacancies are to be filled by women's organisations.</P>
    <P>Such matters as terms of appointment, disqualification, resignation, remuneration, powers of removal, replacement of members and the procedure for filling casual vacancies are set out in the Schedule.  The staff will be civil servants and the agency will be on the same lines as agencies with similar functions in other countries, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the US, which was established in 1972 for enforcement of the elimination of discrimination, the Equal Opportunity Commission in Britain and a similar body in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 70 provides for <Col N="1130" /> the agency to be established on a date other than that of the coming into operation of the Act.  It is our intention that the agency be provided with the resources required to effectively carry out their functions.</P>
    <P>Under the affirmative order procedure any proposal of the Government in regard to the date of the establishment of the agency will require to be supported by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 71 provides for a Schedule that sets out the rules and regulations applicable to appointments of members and staff, procedures for filling casual vacancies and so on. Paragraphs 1 to 16 of the schedule lay down provisions governing the composition of the agency.  Each ordinary member will be a part time member and shall hold office for five years on terms and conditions as laid down by me in agreement with the Minister for the Public Service.  Sitting Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas are not eligible.  Any member of the agency who is adjudged a bankrupt, or sentenced to imprisonment or convicted of felonies will cease to hold any office.  Those are the main points that arise and it is up to the Deputy to make any points he wishes under amendment No. 71.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I expected this to be a complicated debate.  It is a pity this Bill was not brought in in a more compact form to make it easier for Members of this House to participate in the discussion and to understand why the Bill is necessary.  We all accept that a Bill giving equal opportunity to all irrespective of sex is desirable and the simpler that Bill when introduced the better for everybody. At the moment as I see it we are discussing amendment No. 1 in the name of the Minister, setting up the Employment Equality Agency.  I need not refer further to it, I can do that by way of the amendments and under amendment No. 71 itself.  Here I see a major departure from what I would like to see as a compact body to determine the cases that will be referred to it under this measure.  If <Col N="1131" /> my amendments are taken in conjunction with amendment No. 71 which deals with the Employment Equality Agency it will be seen that the first amendment asks that in paragraph 2 the number referred to of ten ordinary members be reduced to six.</P>
      <P>I see this as a desirable improvement in this agency.  An agency of 11 people is too big to adjudicate on the type of matters that will be placed before it. All sides should be equally represented by ordinary membership on that committee. The chairman will also be a ministerial appointment.  Thus under my proposal the Minister will have an opportunity of appointing three people to this agency.  At some stage a quorum of five is referred to.  Can the Minister explain how if 11 people are appointed to this body, and only five are necessary for a quorum to carry out the full functions of the agency it is necessary to have 11? I do not want the Minister to reply that in order to be sure of having five or six present it is necessary to appoint 11.  If the people appointed are not in a position to attend reasonably regularly except in emergencies, these people are not fit to be appointed to such an agency.  It is an important agency.  If 11 people are appointed, seven at the pleasure of the Minister, it is not enough that six of that group may be absent and yet the business can go ahead normally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a new agency which will be handling what undoubtedly will be delicate, difficult cases, initially at least, in relation to alleged discrimination in equal opportunity, in relation to advertising, and employment agencies and so on.  Many of these matters will be of a very delicate nature.  Who does the Minister intend to appoint?  Why does the Minister need to appoint seven people to an 11 member agency?  I do not believe the Minister is entitled to have the power to appoint so many people and yet to say that five will form a quorum for the purpose of the business of the agency.  This is an admission by the Minister that there is no necessity for 11, except that it <Col N="1132" /> gives him an opportunity to appoint people that he may like to rest a political laurel or favour on.  My second amendment states:</P>
    <P>In paragraph 9 to delete &ldquo;six, three of whom shall be representative of women's organisations&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;two,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In case anybody is not clear, it is the &ldquo;six&rdquo; that is being deleted.  In other words, the appointment by the Minister of six people.  The Schedule says that the remaining six, three of whom shall be representative of women's organisations shall be nominated by the Minister.  I believe that the Minister should only have power to nominate two more, in the interests of the employers' representatives, the workers' representatives and in the interests of this agency working satisfactorily.  The smaller the number appointed to such a committee the better.  We all know that where committees have been set up the committee with the smaller membership, provided the attendance was reasonably good, was a far more effective committee than the committee with a large membership.  A large number on a committee such as this, where quite a number of different points of view will be expressed, and where there may be confrontations on a very delicate issue, would not be desirable.  The third amendment is that 50 per cent of the ordinary members shall be women.  I was interested to hear the Minister say that he saw no validity in this point. I thought the Minister would have said that I should have assumed that both employers' representatives and workers' representatives were women.  That is the answer I expected to hear.  I need have no fears in that respect.</P>
    <P>I take the point that the greatest champion of women's rights may well not be a woman, but regarding the Employment Equality Agency for the purpose of this Bill it is important that both workers and employers realise that under the Bill they have a responsibility to have 50 per cent.  In other words the Minister's opinion that the man may be a better champion can be preserved by the workers' organisation or the employers' organisation nominating a man and <Col N="1133" /> a woman.  This will solve the 50 per cent and will give him the opportunity of nominating one or two women as he sees fit.  That is the way it will work more effectively.</P>
    <P>Those three amendments are connected and on them there is another very important consideration.  Amendment No. 71.7 reads:</P>
    <P>The chairman shall be appointed by the Minister either in a whole-time or a part-time capacity and shall hold office for not more than five years ...</P>
    <P>This Government are at the end of their tether and in a very short time there will be a changeover.  It will be unfortunate for the Member from this side of the House who will have to assume the responsibilities of this Minister and will have to take over an agency consisting of 11 people most of whom will be politically opposed to the Member taking over if we do not have a fair representation on that agency.  Amendment No. 71.8 reads:</P>
    <P>The chairman shall be paid, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, such remuneration and allowances and expenses incurred by him as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, may determine.</P>
    <P>Therefore the chairman may be whole-time or part-time.  The ordinary members may be part-time.  There will be undoubtedly in the early stages quite a number of meetings and many points to be discussed.  Is it in the best interests of this State at this time, with our economy as it is, to appoint 11 people or to appoint seven people? Here is a way we can save on four appointments, part-time maybe, but between remuneration for their part-time service and expenses for attendance we would be making a worth-while saving and yet we would have an agency capable of dealing with the points of the controversies that may be brought before them.  For that reason I push very strongly the amendments to the Schedule.</P>
    <P>The Schedule is long and there are many points in it that I must ask the Minister about.  This is my first experience in opposition of seeing a <Col N="1134" /> new agency as such being set up.  Will the Minister say that the points I will be making were contained in a previous legislation and are in line?  The Minister seems to have fairly substantial powers under this Schedule with regard to this equality agency. For example, amendment No. 71.4 states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may at any time remove the chairman from office.</P>
    <P>That should be qualified.  No Minister from either side should have that kind of blanket power at his pleasure or whim, to be able to remove a chairman doing an effective, fair and good job in that capacity.  This kind of power being placed on Minister's shoulders is dangerous because it does not say that the chairman may be removed for lack of performance or because of a breach of regulations. It simply gives the Minister blanket power.  This Government have removed one of the nation's finest soldiers from a position of trust as chairman of a body and replaced him by a man far less adequately equipped to deal with the Army pensions situation than that fine soldier was.  How can we be sure that this kind of power placed on this Minister's shoulders cannot also be abused?  Is that new or is it in line with previous legislation?  If the answer is that it is in line with previous legislation I demand that at this stage we progress and that we amend that to mean that only under certain conditions can the Minister exercise this power.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 71.3 states:</P>
    <P>The chairman may at any time resign his office by letter addressed to the Minister ...</P>
    <P>Is this really necessary?  Surely we live in a free society.  Surely the Constitution preserves the right of the individual to decide if he wants to resign or if he wants to discontinue operating because his health prevents him or his time does not allow him or he does not like the position.  I fail to see the necessity for that provision.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 71.5 states:</P>
    <P>Where the chairman or an ordinary member of the Agency becomes <Col N="1135" /> a member of either House of the Oireachtas, he shall, upon his becoming entitled under the Standing Orders of the House to sit therein, cease to be the chairman or such ordinary member.</P>
    <P>That is desirable.</P>
    <P>There are many questions attached to this agency that must be answered by the Minister.  We will be coming to other points on it and other amendments in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the quorum. Amendment No. 71.21 establishes that:</P>
    <P>The quorum for a meeting of the Agency shall be five members.</P>
    <P>We are appointing 11.  This is wholly unnecessary from an effective point of view, from a cost point of view and from a fair distribution point of view, yet we say that any five of that 11 can deal with the business placed before that agency.</P>
    <P>That covers my points on Amendment No. 71.  Perhaps I should allow the Minister to comment on what I have said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>On the general question of a quorum a necessary element to have in any committee of people working together is that there be a certain minimum figure.  That minimum figure not being reached at any meeting, no business may be transacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My feeling about this figure of 11 people on the agency governing body is that we require representation, obviously, from trade unions, employers' interests and women's organisations. If we look at the number of women's organisations in the country it is important that some places be set aside for them because it is their campaign over the years that has contributed largely to the fact that this House is legislating in this area today. I gave a good deal of consideration to the composition of the membership of the agency.  I was concerned to provide a balanced group of representative persons who would be able to carry out the function assigned to the agency and the number was decided <Col N="1136" /> to meet that objective.  I am anxious to encompass in the membership of the agency as wide a selection of the principal women's organisations as possible.  Obviously, it is not possible to provide for all of them.  That is why I believe the requirement that three should be reserved for women's organisations is important.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald made the point that there should be so many women in the agency.  In deciding in advance that the sex of a person in the agency is an important guide to the person's dedication and suitability, we must be wary in case we fall into a kind of discrimination in reverse.  I am against the philosophy of a token woman representative on any body.  The idea may be put forward with sincerity, but one does not advance the cause of women in our society by suggesting that a woman must carry out any job or task.  The principal philosophy behind the membership of the agency is that people should be chosen for the job on grounds of merit and ability to carry out the functions assigned to the agency, and not on grounds of sex.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the majority of the people in the agency will be women, but I do not think that should be the prime requirement.  Members of the agency will be chosen for their suitability and ability to do the job. Appointing women on grounds of sex does not advance the cause of equal rights for women.  When Deputy Fitzgerald made the point that so many places should be reserved for women, I am not suggesting he was not putting that idea forward in the best interests of women's equality but one could very easily fall into the trap of nominating women <i>qua</i> women.  In the long term that may not be doing a service to the women's movement.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked about the composition of the Schedule, the powers, and so on.  That is based on the relationship of the chairman to the Minister as set out in the instrument setting up the training authority.  We can come back to that on Report Stage.  I will be quite willing to swop ideas with the Deputy on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On the composition of the Schedule and where it came <Col N="1137" /> from, I thought that would possibly be the answer.  This is a new type of Bill covering discrimination and we should look very carefully at the composition of the Schedule in this Bill setting up the Employment Equality Agency.  I reserve the right to submit amendments on Report Stage to any paragraph or section of the Schedule.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister was sincere in what he said but I would be inclined to assume from what he said that there were not enough women adequately and suitably qualified to be appointed to the agency.  I agree that the prime qualification should be suitability.  I am afraid I cannot be sure that will be the case while the Minister has power to nominate six women.  He has very neatly and very cleverly used the fact that three will be from women's organisations.  He has not said where the other three will come from and he has not said from what women's organisations they will come.</P>
      <P>Many of the women's organisations have contributed immensely to the progress we are making, slow though it may have been over the past four years.  To be fair, all of them cannot be represented.  I have no doubt that, whatever three are selected, their political persuasion will be taken into consideration. I would have no objection to saying that two of the people appointed by him would be from two of the women's organisations.  The Minister is arguing in two different directions. On the one hand he is saying it is important that three women should be appointed from women's organisations, and on the other hand he is saying the first essential for appointment must be suitability and qualifications. I agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister did not intend to convey the impression that not enough suitably qualified, or prepared, or experienced women would be available.  Basically, that was the line of argument he used to oppose the amendments I recommended to him.  My amendments would effect an improvement in the Bill.  I see absolutely no necessity for 11 rather than six members.  On the argument about the quorum being five, I understand the point the Minister makes but we are not talking about a committee. <Col N="1138" /> We are talking about an agency with specific functions in relation to discriminatory acts under this legislation. It is not like an ordinary body being set up.  A quorum of five can deal with all the aspects and yet we are appointing 11 members.</P>
    <P>If workers' representatives are appointed to this body normally we will find that two such representatives will not be missing except in cases of emergency, or when they cannot make it for some reason.  They will take their responsibilities seriously.  The employers' representatives will be in the same position.  They will take their responsibility seriously and will not be missing unless it is completely unavoidable or completely impossible for them to be there.  Where will the missing people come from?  They will come from the very big number of people being appointed by the Minister.  That is one of the reasons why I object to six being appointed by the Minister. I am quite satisfied with the reduction from six to two and that those two, if the Minister so wishes, will be members of women's organisations.  I see a difficulty for the Minister in how he will select two or even three of the organisations, because there are many more organisations who deserve to be recognised for the contribution they have made to the little progress we have had towards equal rights for women.</P>
    <P>I see absolutely no reason why we must have ten members and a chairman on that body.  No argument used by the Minister has convinced me that this is necessary.  The functions assigned to the agency by this Bill are far-reaching for a new body.  I believe functions are defined in the amendments, something I have not come across in previous legislation.  From memory the word &ldquo;functions&rdquo; is defined by way of an amendment to include powers and duties.  In other words, the agency we are appointing will have powers and duties assigned to them on the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>This agency must be of the highest calibre, comprised of people with genuine and dedicated interest.  I fully support the Minister on this and the initial qualifications.  I also believe <Col N="1139" /> these qualifications can be found in both sexes but it will be somewhat amusing if we are to pass legislation setting up an agency under this Bill to eliminate discrimination when the only women's representatives we can be sure of having in the 11 people are the three members of the women's organisations mentioned by the Minister. If my amendments were accepted, we would have 50 per cent representation at least for women.  I believe this to be a sensible development but we must be seen to be sincere in setting up this body and if we have 50 per cent representation for women among the ordinary members, then I think we would be setting up an agency that would be smaller, more appropriate and more effective and would cost less to the country than the 11 mentioned by the Minister where only three places are guaranteed to women.</P>
    <P>I appeal very strongly to the Minister to accept my amendment particularly as regards the reduction of the number.  I have not yet heard why there should be six appointees of the Minister.  He has said that three of them will come from women's organisations. Why not go further and appoint all six from women's organisations? There are many more organisations than that.  I am disappointed that the Minister has not accepted what I thought were obvious amendments.  I think I have advanced many reasons in favour of these appointments.  We are spending a lot of time on the agency; I think it is important; it is a new venture.  On Report Stage I reserve the right to move amendments to any of the paragraphs in the Schedule.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, in setting up such a body one must impose some trust in the Minister of the day that he will carry out the duties imposed on him, that he will appoint people who will adequately discharge the functions assigned to the agency.  That I propose to do and I presume any other Minister would seek to do likewise.  I do not agree that it is necessary in the interests of the women's equality movement that any of our legislation should set down a fixed quota based <Col N="1140" /> on sex implying that the sex of the person is the criterion that must be uppermost.  I have every confidence that women will be found for the majority of these posts but it would be to announce in advance one's fundamental feeling that women were not qualified for a task such as this if they were to form a fixed quota.  I believe that giving a quota of appointments to women does not advance their cause and I believe that instead our criterion should be the effectiveness of the people to be nominated.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is right in saying that there are a number of women's organisations. It would be impossible to cater for all of them but it is, I believe, correct that in apportioning places in the agency, the governing body, a certain number should be set aside for the women's organisations.</P>

Amendment No. 2 is next and I observe that amendments Nos. 43 and 48 are related and I suggest that amendments Nos. 2, 43 and 48 be debated together with separate decisions if required.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;dismissal&rsquo; shall be taken to include the termination by an employee of his contract of employment with his employer (whether prior notice of termination was or was not given to the employer) in circumstances in which, because of the conduct of the employer, the employee was or would have been entitled to terminate the contract without giving such notice, or it was or would have been reasonable for him to do so, and &lsquo;dismissed&rsquo; shall be construed accordingly;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to clarify that a dismissal, whether retaliatory or non-retaliatory, can include the concept of constructive dismissal, that is, those cases where the employee is forced to leave her job because of the compulsive nature, perhaps, of the circumstances of the relationship with the employer.  There is a similar provision under the Unfair Dismissals Bill and the effect of amendment No. 48 is to make a similar provision <Col N="1142" /> under the Equal Pay Act. Amendment No. 43 arises as a consequence of amendment No. 2 since the concept of constructive dismissal applies to both types of dismissal, retaliatory and non-retaliatory.</P>

We have it now and we have it in the Unfair Dismissals Bill where the tribunal agrees that the person concerned was right to pursue the matter.  There is that right of reinstatement.  The concept of dismissals is referred to because it is obviously a very important element in equality employment legislation.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is to ensure that employees of harbour authorities, health boards, vocational education committees and committees of agriculture come under this Bill.  The <Col N="1143" /> parliamentary draftsman was doubtful that any of them came under the description of &ldquo;officer or servant of a local authority&rdquo;.  On his advice we inserted this amendment to ensure that they were included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the amendments I welcome.  The Minister has gone part of the way but not as far as I expected him to go.  He is obviously closing the gap that existed in this Bill.  He is covering the officer or servant of a local authority who came within the meaning of the Local Government Act, 1941.  Here he has included servants or officers of a harbour authority, health board, vocational education committee or committee of agriculture.  This is progress from the Bill as originally introduced.</P>
      <P>We must realise that there are more amendments to this Bill than there are sections.  Why did the Minister not include the Garda Síochána and prison officers?  In my opinion these are two glaring omissions from the definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; and should be included.  I have deliberately not referred to the Defence Forces because I could see difficulties being created there.  However I see no reason why the Garda Síochána and the prison officers have not been included in this amendment.</P>

    <P>I submitted this amendment because I failed to see why &ldquo;employer&rdquo; has not been defined in this Bill when it has been defined in other social legislation. No doubt the Minister has a very good reason for doing this but it seemed to me to be an omission.  Two sectors of the social spectrum are included. We have just been discussing the definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; and hopefully we will have an opportunity later of discussing an extension of it to include others.  Why is &ldquo;employer&rdquo; not defined in this Bill as it is in other social legislation?</P>

Subsection (2) says that &ldquo;in the conduct of a particular investigation the Agency may, with the approval of the Minister, employ one or more than one person having qualifications which in the opinion of the Agency relate to that investigation&rdquo;. That is understandable.  In other words, they will have experts available. To what extent does the Minister see one person carrying out an investigation?</P>
      <P>Subsection (4) is the one I query most.  It says:</P>
      <P>An investigation shall not be conducted in relation to the selection by the Local Appointments Commission or the Civil Service Commission of a person for appointment to an office or position.</P>
      <P>Even if I were prepared to accept&mdash; and for the purposes of making my point I am prepared to accept it&mdash; that the Civil Service Commission be excluded, the powers of the Local Appointments Commission are very far-reaching.  In our definition of &ldquo;dismissal&rdquo; as amended, we are talking about officers or servants of a local authority a health board a vocational education committee or a committee of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not true to say that the Local Appointments Commission are responsible for the appointment of very many people, particularly the officers of local authorities?  Are we now excluding the people so appointed or are we saying that this equality agency cannot <Col N="1147" /> examine or investigate appointments made?  Appointments and promotions will be very closely linked, as those of us who are familiar with the local authority scene know very well.  We will find an assistant county engineer probably applying to the Local Appointments Commission for a position as chief assistant county engineer and the appointment being made by that body.  Is the person so appointed excluded from investigation in that case?  I am not happy with subsection (4) of this amendment.  I have not put down an amendment on it at this stage because I thought on Report Stage we might be able to tease out the weakness I believe to be in it.  The Minister may well have a valid answer to the point I am making.  I am concerned about that kind of appointment because we would be including some officers of local authorities and excluding others.  In my opinion this would be undesirable.  This applies equally to health boards and other bodies.  I am citing the case of the local authority in support of my point of view.</P>

      <P>Regarding amendment No. 57, here we are talking about the terms of reference for investigation.  There are quite a number of important amendments tied up with amendment No. 4. This is why I thought that for expediency we could have dealt with these on another occasion.  This is not possible and we have to comply with this. We must look at the terms of reference for investigation.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 57 states:</P>
      <P>In page 11, before section 27, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>33. &mdash;The Agency shall not conduct an investigation until the following <Col N="1148" /> requirements have been complied with:</P>
    <P>(a)  terms of reference for the investigation shall be drawn up by the Agency or, if the investigation is one which the Minister has required the Agency to conduct, by the Minister after consultation with the Agency;</P>
    <P>(b)  notice of intention to conduct an investigation shall be given by the Agency by a notice published in at least one daily newspaper circulating in the State unless the terms of reference refer to a specified person in which case the notice shall be given in writing to that person.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to elaborate on what is contained in paragraph (b). What does he mean by an investigation being published in a daily newspaper? Is that the type of investigation that one person can be appointed from the agency to do?  An investigation in relation to an individual I take to mean in relation to an employer or employee.  I should like the Minister to elaborate on the question of the intention to conduct the investigation and how it may be conducted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the powers of the agency are both investigative and educative and obviously by publishing the intention of investigation this would be in conformity with the functions assigned to the agency.  Where, of course, terms of reference of the particular investigation named particular persons or an organisation obviously these would have to be named and invited beforehand to such investigation.</P>

      <P>There is a lot of content in amendment No. 58 and it basically refers to the agency's power to obtain information and documentation and summon witnesses.  This is very necessary and important to ensure that the investigation would be worth something.  There are questions I want to ask about the amendment itself.  Paragraph (2) of amendment No. 58 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A notice under subsection (1) shall not be delivered unless the <Col N="1149" /> Agency has obtained the consent of the Minister to the delivery, or unless the terms of reference for the investigation specify that the Agency believes that a person named in the terms of reference&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  has discriminated or is discriminating,</P>
    <P>They obtain the consent of the Minister. Is this really necessary if the agency are convinced that a person or firm are discriminating?  Surely the agency should have the power to operate on their own?</P>

      <P>When we adjourned last night I was pointing out that the main reason we have had these price increases over the last three years has been that the Government made no attempt to deal with the energy crisis.  Although Deputy Bruton, the Parliamentary Secretary, blamed the green £ for the escalation in prices he at least conceded that the energy problem was one of the main causes for that escalation.  The energy problem has been with us since October, 1973.  In October of that year oil products <Col N="1151" /> to the Irish consumer were running at £200 million per annum.  They are now running at between £600 million and £700 million.  The Government have taken no action of any kind to deal with this problem.  It is the Government's responsibility.</P>
      <P>Last night we were told that we should have a policy on price increases. For the information of the Parliamentary Secretary, we are the Opposition.  The Government are the people elected to deal with matters such as this.  Theirs is the responsibility. Not only have the Government failed to deal with the energy problem but they even contributed to making the problem more serious than it need have been.  They imposed taxation on oil products.  First of all, it was petrol and then in the 1976 budget all oil products were taxed making the problem that much more serious for industry.  We have had three or four very wasteful years as far as this Government are concerned from the point of view of energy.</P>
      <P>Energy is all important for the ESB. There is talk of a further 10.47 per cent increase in ESB charges due to a large extent to the cost of oil.  The turf harvest last year was much better than it was in previous years.  More peat was available to the ESB.  What was the effect of that on ESB costs? If more native fuel is available it should be possible for the ESB to cut down costs.  On what date did the ESB apply for permission to increase charges?  Was it in October?  The increase has been granted.  We claim it should not have been granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many other increases have been sanctioned by this Coalition Government. Because we were attached to the outer UK zone system that was the justification for the price increases granted in the case of petrol over the last three years.  Now, despite being included in the outer UK zone system, petrol here costs 10p per gallon more than the dearest petrol in Britain. Surely we ought not to be paying 10p a gallon more than consumers are paying in the UK.  This is yet another area where the Government have <Col N="1152" /> failed to take any action.  We have other costs imposed on our industrialists, costs which make them less competitive and aggravate an already bad employment situation.</P>
    <P>Over a year ago, when An Bord Gáis was being formed, we advocated that this natural gas should be made available through a national grid to industrialists and others.  We argued that it should not be made available to the ESB because the ESB would waste almost 75 per cent of the thermal value of the gas.  We argued that a national grid should be established to make the gas available for domestic use in certain towns between Cork and Dublin and also for industrial purposes. That would have resulted in low cost energy.  This has been done very successfully in Britain, so successfully that the Coal Board and the electricity authority were seeking 12 months ago a tax on natural gas.</P>
    <P>We should utilise every natural resource for the maximum benefit of our people.  Natural gas would definitely have created low cost energy in certain areas and the result of that would have been more employment.  At the outset of the energy crisis in October, 1973, and subsequently, we said it was the duty of the Government to make the country self-sufficient in refining capacity.  It takes three years to set up an oil refinery.  It is now three and a half years since we said this should be done without delay and we are now in a worse position than we were then because oil is costing a great deal more. Surely common sense would dictate that by being self-sufficient in refining capacity we would have some control over the supply of oil and the cost.  It is not difficult to realise what this would mean to the ESB.  Instead of having to buy oil from Russia or the Middle East at exorbitant prices we would now be in a position to supply our own fuel oil to the ESB. That would be a tremendous boon to domestic and industrial consumers, but instead of setting about achieving this they have done nothing.</P>
    <P>As well as wasting almost 75 per cent of the natural gas to which the board will have access the ESB are now contemplating the erection of a new generating station at a cost of <Col N="1153" /> between £50 and £60 million.  Based on annual reports of the ESB over the years I believe this money will be borrowed from outside the sterling area. It appears, from the most recent report, that ip in every 4p, or 25 per cent of every ESB bill, is going towards the foreign borrowing between capital repayment and readjustment of interest rates due to the fall in the £.  In spite of this the ESB are permitted to borrow more.</P>
    <P>If the board were permitted to borrow more money to supply low-cost energy the consumers would get some satisfaction from that action but they are borrowing to waste a natural resource which could be of great importance to our economy.  In those two instances the Government have failed to take proper action.  Very definite action will still have to be taken in the areas of the refining of crude oil and the utilisation of natural gas in order to deal with our energy problem.  That problem will stay with us even though the Government hope it will disappear overnight.</P>
    <P>After the next general election Fianna Fáil will set out to tackle these two problems.  By creating more refining capacity we would not only be establishing control over its supply and cost but we would also be helping to create more downstream industries which normally spring from an oil refinery.  We would also be creating more employment.  Instead of accepting any application for price increases we would be attacking the very base of the problem by creating more buoyancy in the economy and improving the employment prospects of our people, unemployed or otherwise, who must bear the price increases such as those sanctioned last week.  Those increases included a 25 per cent increase granted to CIE in respect of bus fares and a 26 per cent increase in suburban rail fares.  It is interesting to note from the statement of the Minister for Transport and Power that the total cost of the increase in school transport will be £300,000.  Based on his own figure of £11 million for school transport it represents approximately 3 per cent extra for school transport this year.  How then can CIE justify an increased cost of 25 per cent <Col N="1154" /> for users of the Dublin buses and 26 per cent for those who use the rail service in that city?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the issue of prices, if we are to be effective in controlling them it is necessary to try to unravel different causes and indicate quite clearly which we cannot influence and which we can influence. In relation to the ones we can influence it seems to me to be extremely important that we tell the truth about the situation and that we have a rational debate and not one which releases forces in society which could be destructive both on the price front and on the much wider front.  Other Deputies have referred to some of the major external causes which, apart from enumerating, I am not going to repeat.  The external causes include the inflation we have had to grapple with during our period in Government and the very dramatic increase in the price of oil.  Deputy Barrett told the House that the extra cost amounted to hundreds of millions of pounds over the interval.  Other commodities expanded in some cases by hundreds of per cent as well.  The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Bruton, gave some figures on that last night.  He also made reference to the downflow of the £ and of the historically high interest rates which exist in London, not out of the considerations of the requirements of the cost of money in our economy but for the sake of defending the £ sterling.  All those have inflationary effects on us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major domestic sources that we can influence are the rate of evolution of wages and the rate of evolution of Government spending and, therefore, of taxation because these two are closely related.  Before going on to the question of wages and taxation and the realities of our circumstance <i>vis-à-vis</i> other places I should like to add another cause which is relevant to our period of office.  It is the growing free trade between us and the other eight countries of the Community.  While we had some movement towards free trade with the UK, and considerable movement under the AIFTA agreement in the late sixties and early seventies, we <Col N="1155" /> had uniquely in the period of office of this Government the dramatic freeing of trade in relation to an area where prices are very much larger than ours. That, in relation to the commodities we imported, had an inflationary influence but so of course had it an influence in relation to the price paid our farmers and, therefore, in the price that consumers pay for food.  Since we validly are now in a free trade circumstance with the UK and with the other seven member states it is proper now to make comparisons in that free trade circumstance and where the prices of many things, especially food, are settled centrally in the Community.  The comparison I should like to quote is from the <i>Evening Press</i> of 3rd March, 1977. An article in that issue stated that once again Dublin remained at the bottom of the price league in a survey of the nine Common Market capitals for a basket of ten basic foods.  The basket costs £5.20 in Dublin compared with £9.14 in Brussels, the dearest.</P>

      <P>Since great play has been made about the cost of butter I should like to put the cost of that item on the record.  It was 53p per lb in Dublin, by far the cheapest of the nine. The nearest rival is London where it is 57p per lb.  Dublin milk prices were by far the cheapest of the nine capitals. Our price was 8p compared with 26.5p in The Hague.  It is relevant to make those comparisons after hearing the speech of Deputy Andrews last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" /> I should now like to talk about two important internal forces, wages and public spending.  With regard to wages, that is something we can influence if we get a calm, reasonable and decent social atmosphere.  The essential thing is that wages must not increase more rapidly than gross national product in real terms because if they do a larger section of GNP is moving into wages and is, therefore, moving out of investment and out of growth.  I have already indicated that I believe that growth in the public sector is the key to price control.  I shall deal with that later.  This leads me to refer to something Deputy Andrews said last night. I know that in political debate any sort of accusation of bad faith or cheating towards politicians seems to be permissible but I want to protest on behalf of the Government and also on behalf of the National Prices Commission and the staff of the Department of Industry and Commerce against the accusation that we deliberately held up the publication of the December report of the National Prices Commission, that we cheated with it and, therefore, that we were not playing fair with the workers' side in the voting on the national wage agreement.  The obvious inference was that if that was done to them they had the right to break the agreement. It was a move designed to produce wreckage on the wages front and it is fair that I put a few facts about it on the record as well as repudiate the suggestion vehemently, which I do.</P>
    <P>The November report was published on 28th January, 56 days after it was sent to me.  The December report is the one which we are concerned with and about which the accusation was made.  If the December report were to have been published before the day the national wage agreement was accepted it would have meant that it should have been published less than 25 days after the November report, at a holiday period and when the Government were preoccupied with the budget. The interval may reasonably be compared with the 56 days for the November report.  I put those facts on the record not because I personally am particularly affronted by accusations of bad faith from the Opposition&mdash;I <Col N="1157" /> am used to that&mdash;but because it is an extremely damaging accusation in regard to the maintenance of order on wages which is one of the most important contributions in the controlling of inflation.  It was both a wrecking and an inflationary accusation and that is why I have spent this time in dealing with it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the effects of taxation in the public sector, I am not going to talk about these matters in any great detail because the Minister for Transport and Power is here and will contribute to the debate.  However, if one calls for the avoiding of the price mechanism in regard to electricity, transport and broadcasting, the only other mechanism is increased State subsidy which involves a very large amount of money.  I am not talking about subsidies on food but subsidies on the State sector companies.  They are already large but if they are made bigger it is done by higher taxation. They are already at and even beyond the limit and I welcome the reduction in taxation in the budget.  If we are to have the kind of economic growth that will solve all of our problems we will have to reduce taxation as a percentage of GNP, not increase it. Therefore, the suggestion that one interferes with the market mechanism and puts more and more State money at the disposal of these companies is not a solution to the problem but is an inflationary suggestion itself.</P>
    <P>Yesterday Deputy Andrews referred to OECD statistics on the relative inflationary performance of different countries in the Community and in the 22 countries of the OECD.  Since it was raised by Deputy Andrews it is proper that I reply.  Much as the Opposition may hate it, I will remind them again of what we inherited.  I will remind them of the last quarter before we came to power and I will use the OECD figures.  In the quarter November, 1972 to February, 1973 we were inflating more than twice as fast as the UK.  For that quarter the UK figure was 1.8 per cent and our figure was 4 per cent, at a time when there was no world crisis, no explosion in commodity costs, no devaluation of the £ and no adjustment with regard to <Col N="1158" /> the EEC.  It was 4 per cent here and 1.8 per cent in the UK&mdash;less than half as fast.  Let the Opposition remember that.  It is what we inherited.</P>

In the period of three and three-quarter years from 1973 to 1976 we inflated 1 per cent less fast.</P>

      <P>More interruptions. The half year before we came to office <Col N="1159" /> and up to the present is more interesting still because in that half year the UK inflated at 4.1 per cent while we inflated at 5.5 per cent.  However, in the most recent half year the roles are reversed.  Our inflation was 5.8 per cent while their rate was 6.8 per cent.  In the circumstances I have described we are moving down the rank and instead of inflating more than twice as fast as Britain&mdash;a condition we inherited&mdash;we are now inflating more slowly than Britain.  A whole number of countries that did not come above us in the inflation league of the OECD which Deputy Andrews mentioned are now before us in the league.</P>
      <P>I shall not refer to the level of subsidies because this has been dealt with. In place of argument I heard Deputy Andrews bleating about bread, butter and flour.  It is no harm not only to remind the House but to remind the electorate that the present Opposition on two occasions on their return to office removed or reduced food subsidies. They did it in 1952 and in 1957. On those two occasions the subsidy was removed from bread, butter and flour.</P>

      <P>In regard to price control in general if one uses the existing mechanism&mdash;we have used it much more extensively than our predecessors as was indicated by the Parliamentary Secretary yesterday&mdash;to rob enterprises of profit one has inevitable consequences. The first of those is that you simply de-industrialise.  If you de-industrialise you disemploy.  In our circumstances if you de-industrialise and disemploy, you depopulate. During our period of office we have had a net inflow into the country and we have had the most rapid growth in population the country has had for more than a century.  We are coping with more people than the country has coped with in living memory.  If you make demands that do not permit industry and all sorts of enterprise to re-capitalise and reequip, you are killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.</P>
      <P>That is great stuff at a crossroads. It is great stuff to quote the profit margin but it is destructive of the whole economy, the population and our industry. In regard to the State companies I will make the general observation that when you get a shrinking level of production and, worse still, a shrinking economy and a shrinking population, with certain fixed things that you have got to maintain, a fixed number of telephones, of miles of railroad, a fixed number of buses that have to run at certain times and all those things, then you are spreading the costs over fewer and fewer users.  The way to help on the prices front in the public sector is by economic growth. Then you have more and more people spending more and your overheads are spread.  This is inescapable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contribution to the costs of State companies in the recent recession came because of a diminished volume of economic activity.  The cure is the opposite.  Therefore the cure by economic growth this year will be four per cent in terms of GNP.  The stimulus given to that economic growth by the budget and by taxation reductions is precisely the sort of stimulus which makes the best possible contribution to controlling costs in the State sector, <Col N="1161" /> which is necessary.  It is a public service and it is essential that those costs are spread over the largest number of people, each spending the largest possible amount of money.</P>
    <P>We are a little fragile economy that has almost completed its five annual adjustments to free trade.  If we tell the truth we can have a stable, balanced and sensible atmosphere inside the country with a reasonable evolution on the wages front and a reasonable evolution on the taxation and public expenditure front because we have not released uncontrollable forces.  If we behave decently and truthfully and reconcile different sectors of society we can prosper.  If, on the other hand, we exaggerate, if we raise impossible hopes, if we decry things, if we present them in the blackest possible light, if we do our utmost, for example, to wreck a national wage agreement, then we release impossible hopes for wages and for public expenditure, requiring greater taxation.  We have then the precise causes of releasing another wave of inflation.  It seems to me that, far from having any suggestions to make about the control of inflation, for perfectly obvious reasons in an election year the irresponsibility of the Opposition is tending, unsuccessfully, precisely in the direction of producing the inflation they purport to decry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I welcome the late conversion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to overtaxation of business and industry.  If we look back over the policies pursued by this Administration we can see that the problems we have today were brought about by the overtaxation of business and industry the Minister is talking about now.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce stated that before we left office we were inflating twice as fast as Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Coalition published a 14-point plan shortly before they came into office.  Among the objectives of that plan were control of prices, control of inflation, bring down prices and halt redundancies.  We were told that the new cabinet was one of the most brilliant cabinets in Europe.  If they had <Col N="1162" /> the information that we were inflating twice as fast as Britain before we left office they should have set about controlling inflation.  They either made a false promise in their 14-point plan or they did not know what they were talking about.</P>
    <P>The situation we are facing at the moment and the reason for the introduction of this motion is because the Government have failed to see the basic causes of our having the highest inflation rate in Europe.  We have to cast our minds back to the time the Coalition Government took office to see the pattern of what exactly took place.  We know that the fiscal measures they introduced over the past two years were disastrous as far as economic expansion is concerned.  We know that without economic expansion there will be a contraction of money flowing into the Exchequer and finance will not be available to keep desirable services financed.</P>
    <P>I believe the Coalition Government started off on the wrong platform. They embarked on a scheme of excessive borrowing.  They borrowed for non-productive purposes.  All those non-productive purposes have to be financed.  Much of the taxation which was introduced in this year's budget will go to finance and service the loans which have been spent on unproductive purposes during the past four years.  It is the unfortunate taxpayers who will have to carry this burden.</P>
    <P>The policies pursued by the Coalition Government have created unemployment, caused redundancies and contributed to a great extent to the rate of inflation today.  In January, 1976, when inflation was rising to between 20 per cent and 25 per cent and when prices were increasing roughly in the region of 20 per cent, they introduced a budget which was the most disastrous budget ever produced in the country.  The high inflation we are experiencing today is a direct result of the 1976 budget.  Many of the increases that have been announced over the last week can trace their origin to the 1976 budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in January, 1976, stated in the House that he would have a budget deficit in the region of <Col N="1163" /> £327 million.  In order to balance that he imposed huge taxes on cars, petrol, beer, wine and spirits.  The direct result of that budget was that it increased the cost of living between 4 per cent and 5 per cent.  Most people at that time were aware inflation was rising, prices were increasing, our goods were becoming uncompetitive so that we were failing in the British market and were failing to attract industries to create employment. Yet the Minister for Finance embarked on this disastrous budget from which the country is suffering today.  If it was necessary to impose such taxation at that time well and good, but in 1977 the Minister has stated in this House that the deficit at the end of the year was only £201 million. A sum of £126 million excess taxation was imposed in a year when the country had rampant inflation.</P>
    <P>Surely that must have had a disastrous effect on all aspects of the economy over the past 12 months, especially during 1976.  Of course it discouraged industry from coming in here.  That is why there is so much unemployment.  It caused massive redundancies.  It affected the standard of living, and the trade unions were compelled to seek increases for their members to keep in line with rising prices during 1976.  If the Minister had used common sense at that time and if his projections were accurate, as they should have been, he could have reduced taxes by £126 million, which would have had a beneficial effect on the whole economy and particularly on prices.  The wage structure, on the one hand, and the Minister's increased taxation, on the other, are the main causes of our difficulties today.  The underlying inflation is there and will continue to be there during 1977 despite the wage agreement negotiated recently.</P>
    <P>It is all due to incompetence, despite what the Minister for Industry and Commerce may say about imported inflation.  I am prepared to concede that there was a certain amount of imported inflation, but I am certainly not prepared to concede that the total inflation over the past two or three years was imported.  The Government must take <Col N="1164" /> responsibility for the price rises which have taken place over the past fortnight or three weeks.  There have been astronomical price rises in transport. Thousands and thousands of Dublin city workers are affected.  Due to the corporation's siting of houses, workers have further to travel by bus every morning, from Ballyfermot, Tallaght, Finglas and such places, into the city. How does the Minister reconcile the figures in the national wage agreement, which gives roughly an 8 to 10 per cent increase in incomes with such an enormous increase as 25 per cent in transport?  Is there anything dishonest in stating that?  This vast increase in bus and train fares for Dublin city workers will have an adverse effect on their standard of living, if it is borne in mind that they must use transport five or six days a week.</P>
    <P>The same argument applies to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  If there was ever a scandal in regard to price increases by a Department it must be in connection with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  A 25 per cent increase in telephone charges and a 13 per cent increase in postal charges have been sanctioned recently. Since February, 1973, up to and including the charges which will come into operation on 1st April, there has been an increase of 137 per cent in telephone charges and of 138 per cent in postal charges.  That is after four years of Coalition Government.  When that is contrasted with the 14-point plan for curbing prices and inflation, the hypocrisy of the present Administration will be evident.</P>
    <P>There might be some justification if it could be said that people had a reasonably good service from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, but anybody who has to use the telephone experiences utter frustration.  The Minister did not apply to the National Prices Commission for his increases.  In answer to a question yesterday he told me there was no obligation on the Department so to apply, which there is not under the regulations.  The people who have had telephones installed pay a substantial amount for this service, between rental and other charges, and they are paying for a service they are <Col N="1165" /> not getting.  I am not by any means criticising officers within the Department. There is an excellent staff in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. It should be borne in mind that there is a work force of about 24,000 people employed in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  That is a large concern. It is the largest Department and contains more than half the total number of civil servants.  It is a Department that needs constant attention.  If there was any private enterprise with 24,000 under its control it would demand the undivided attention of its managing director at all times.  Telecommunications are of vital importance to the private sector.  In business and commerce it is a key facility in the expansion of our economic base.  This country has the worst telephone system in Europe, which does not provide great encouragement to foreign investors to come here.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not giving his undivided attention to such a large Department as this.  He must be there to boost morale or else, as in any other business concern where the manager or managing director does not give a lead, the enterprise will decline.  The onus is always on the head man to give a lead and set an example.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has not given that lead.  Instead, he directs his attention to other Departments with the result that his own Department has suffered considerably.  That Department is much too important to be neglected in this way.  After four years of the Minister's administration we have reached the stage of total increases of 137 per cent and 138 per cent respectively. Such a situation is not indicative of a healthy sign in the Department. I am not in any way criticising the personnel within the Department but they are entitled to the full-time attention of their Minister.  Matters such as these are of vital importance to our economic development and it is the economic development situation that dictates whether prices can be kept at a reasonable level.  If the proper climate is not created within the economy there can be no hope of creating the necessary wealth to relieve the burden on the weaker sections of the community because if sufficient <Col N="1166" /> moneys are not accruing to the Exchequer those in the social welfare categories cannot be helped.</P>
    <P>When we consider that prices have increased by about 85 per cent during the past three or four years and compare this increase with the increases that have been given to old age pensioners and other social welfare recipients, we realise that the standard of living of those people has been reduced. I know of many old people living alone in my constituency and for whom meat and other foods are a luxury of which they might partake at Christmas time, if they are lucky enough.</P>
    <P>All of this has arisen from the Government's failure to control inflation. Failure in this regard must result in continuous price rises and, consequently, in the disastrous situation in which we find ourselves.  However, there was some sign of conversion in the last budget.  We are very pleased and complimented that the Government should have adopted some of the recommendations of our White Paper on economic policy.  If they had adopted and implemented all of our recommendations, we would be in a much happier situation.</P>
    <P>Let us take the changes in the taxation system as announced in the budget.  It is an interesting exercise to consider the adjustments that have been made in this area.  We find, for instance, that a single man, irrespective of his income, will receive much more by way of tax relief than will a married man who has two or three children.  In the latter case the tax saving as a result of the new structure will be £62 a year or, approximately, £1.18p a week while the single man earning from £15,000 to £20,000 per year will have his income tax reduced this year by about £40 per week.  That structure is wrong.  It is obvious that the standard of living of a man earning, say, £3,000 to £4,000 per year will be diminished considerably.  On a recent radio programme the Minister for Industry and Commerce said it was hoped to keep inflation at about 15 per cent this year.  I do not believe this will be possible and that the figure will be more likely to be in the region of 18 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1167" /> If there is a decline in purchasing power there will be a decline, too, in retail sale.  This trend is likely to manifest itself about mid-year.  It must happen in a situation in which inflation is running at between 15 per cent and 18 per cent while incomes are increasing by 10 per cent.  This situation is bound to affect industry, too.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to a recent publication of the National Prices Commission and he went on to imply that there was no undue delay in this regard.  In this context let us consider some dates to show the periods of time that elapsed from the date on which the relevant letters were sent to the Minister and the issuing of the publications.  The letter in respect of March last was received by the Minister on the 14th April while the date of the publication was May 13, a delay of four weeks.  In regard to April the letter was sent on the 7th May while the date of publication was June 14th.  In the next case the letter was sent on June 8th while the date of the publication was July 9th&mdash;again, a delay of four weeks. On the following occasion the letter was sent on July 8th and the date of the publication was August 13th, a delay of five weeks.  There is always one publication for the months of August and September.  In that regard the letter was sent on October 7th while the date of the publication was October 17th.  That was one-and-a-half weeks after the letter being received.</P>

That is the situation we shall find ourselves trying to cope with when we get back into office. The people of this country will realise exactly what has taken place over the past six weeks, first the budget and then the deception.  I can assure the Minister that the majority of the people in this country know exactly by now what the budget contains.  The Irish people cannot be fooled.  That type of deception has never worked in the past and will not work in the future.  If these facts were revealed to the people at the budget and during the negotiations at the national wages agreement, they would have much higher regard for the Government for their honesty.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> In the few minutes left to me I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Opposition are again indulging in the luxury of speaking without responsibility.  At their recent Ard-Fheis we had the experience of the Fianna Fáil Party advocating schemes which would cost about £150 million, and at the same Ard-Fheis they demanded that taxation be reduced by £50 million and condemned borrowing as being irresponsible. The week before last we had the Fianna Fáil Party in here demanding that railway facilities be kept in operation irrespective of cost.  They said the people were entitled to them. Well and good.  Last week the same party were here protesting loudly against the proposal to increase fares to keep those very same services in operation.  How inconsistent can they get?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prices that are the subject of this motion were vetted and scrutinised and approved of by the National Prices Commission and the NPC were satisfied that these prices were justified before they recommended them.  Indeed, <Col N="1174" /> one of the national daily newspapers, the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 3rd March, 1977, stated that to criticise these prices or to pretend that something could be done about them was counter-productive because it raised hopes that there was some form of action which the Government could take to alleviate price rises when there was in fact none.  A leading article in the same paper on 9th March said that no Government would introduce or approved of these price increases in an election year after a popular budget if that could be avoided and it went on to say that of course it could not be avoided.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I will be concluding in five minutes. One point I would like to deal with as Minister for Transport and Power is that the Opposition have made no attempt to say what they would do about these prices, with one exception. The spokesman for Transport and Power, Deputy Barrett, speaking last night and dealing with the proposed increase in the ESB charges gave his recipe.  It is not a new one from Fianna Fáil.  He stated that the ESB should have been told to cut their current costs and to curtail further capital expenditure.  I would like to ask Deputy Barrett where he proposes to cut the expenditure.  Is it in the work that is going on at Poolbeg generating station here in Dublin, which is the most efficient in Europe? Is it at the Tarbert extension in County Kerry across the Shannon?  Is it at the Aghada new generating station or at the Marina station in Cork?  These are the proposals he has put forward. Maybe he proposes to ask the ESB not to proceed with the line from Tarbert to Galway underwater across the Shannon and overland through County Clare.  These are the proposals that Deputy Barrett asks this House to adopt in lieu of increasing ESB prices&mdash;to curtail current costs and to stop all further expenditure.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, would it not be very difficult to know, unless you had an Order Paper in front of you, if you had been listening for the last 15 minutes or so to the Minister for Transport and Power that this debate was about inflation? Would not one be very proud to <Col N="1177" /> be a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, because there was virtually nothing else that the Minister could talk about except the Fianna Fáil Party?  One would never dream that this country at present had the highest rate of inflation in Europe and indeed in the 27 OECD countries.  The only thing the Minister for Transport and Power and his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, could talk about tonight were the defects which they found in the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is not surprising that they do not like to talk about the fact that this country is now in the banana republic league.  The banana republic was defined some years ago as one of those South American countries where you had astronomical rates of inflation every year. When somebody inquired as to what was an astronomical rate of inflation the reply was anything in excess of 20 per cent.  That is the situation we are in today and we are the only EEC country in that situation.  The Government are the men who have us in that situation.</P>
      <P>There are no greater problems afflicting this country today, and afflicting more people in it, than the problems of inflation and prices.  Yet there is not one member of this Government sitting around the Cabinet table who has any responsibility for that problem, because the responsibility has been shifted for the past two years to the most junior Parliamentary Secretary in the Government&mdash;he is not in the Government of course; he is attached to it&mdash;who is not entitled to attend Government meetings.  When discussions take place at Cabinet level, when various Ministers have various proposals to make about increases in all the sorts of things&mdash;and we have seen increases in the past week or two not by private industry but by Government Ministers themselves&mdash;there is no one there to cry halt to all that. There is no one who has responsibility for that situation.  Is it any wonder, therefore, that we are in the mess we are in today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, we were very honoured that the Minister for Industry and Commerce saw fit to grace us with his presence this evening for 20 minutes. <Col N="1178" /> He ducked in and said his little bit.  He gave another lesson in how to use statistics dishonestly and ducked out again.  That was his contribution to prices and the problem of inflation in the past two years.  That was his contribution during 20 minues of dishonest statistics.  In the terribly short time I have on this matter as a result of the mess the Chair made of the whole situation, I have not time to deal properly with these things, but I should like to give as one example of the dishonest use of statistics, in which there is no better practitioner in this country today than Minister for Industry and Commerce, his comparison of the price of a basket of groceries in Dublin and Brussels.</P>
    <P>The Dublin basket costs £5 odd and the Brussels basket costs £9 odd and he said, therefore, the people of Dublin are almost twice as well off in terms of prices as the people of Brussels.  How stupid does he think we are?  Does he think we are as stupid as some of the people who trot into those division lobbies behind him every time?</P>

      <P>The wage rate in Brussels bears not the faintest comparison to the wage rate in Dublin. Therefore, the price of commodities in Brussels and the price of commodities in Dublin most certainly cannot be compared, and would not be compared by anybody who tried honestly to use statistics or comparisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We might as well take an example of wage rates in Brussels which are topical in view of what happened <Col N="1179" /> yesterday, or today, or whenever it happened.  Let us take the comparison of the wage rates of a Member of this House and a Member of the European Parlaiment which sits in Brussels.  I understand a Member of this House gets £5,300 odd and it is about to go up to £5,800 odd, subject to tax I might add.  The equivalent in Brussels gets £20,000 a year free of tax.  By God, if I had £20,000 a year free of tax I would not mind paying £9 for my basket of groceries which I can get in Dublin for £5.  I would be a hell of a lot better off in real terms and my standard of living would be enormously higher.</P>
    <P>To give another example of the kind of salaries which are quite common in Brussels, the job which the Minister for Industry and Commerce tried so hard to get and spent so long trying to stab in the back the present Commissioner for whatever he is, Mr. Burke, in trying to get it, pays £40,000 a year tax free.  Is there anyone in this country getting £40,000 a year tax free, apart from the Bula beneficiaries and their potential income which will be considerably in excess of £40,000 a year tax free?  I venture to think there is no one else in this country with that kind of salary.  This is proof of the dishonest use of statistics in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is a past master.</P>
    <P>I made a list of the things which have gone up in price since 1st January of this year.  When I came to the eleventh item I discovered I probably had only about half of them.  They are so common now, and so fast moving, and coming on top of one another so often, that unless you retain an enormous number of cuttings and handouts and so on, it is impossible to keep a proper record.  This list shows that in this year alone the great majority of those items which were savagely increased are not items which are affected by the green £ which the Parliamentary Secretary told us last night was the root of all our evils or by the new word we got from him last night, the oligopolies&mdash;that was another great problem for us.</P>
    <P>The third &ldquo;in-word&rdquo; this week, in <Col N="1180" /> case the House did not know because this Department are a great Department for &ldquo;in-words&rdquo;, is bunching.  We are told we always have bunching in the spring.  It appears it is necessary for all these firms to put up their prices in the spring.  Why should television licences go up in the spring any more than in the autumn?  What seasonal factors affect them?  What has the green £ to do with television licences for colour or black and white sets? What has the green £ to do with the ESB?  What has it to do with CIE? What has it to do with car insurance? What has it to do with cement?  What has it to do with social welfare stamps? What has it to do with health stamps? What has it to do with cigarettes?  In all this list I have here the only things I can see it has anything to do with are bread and flour.  What has it to do with telephone charges?  What has it to do with postal charges?</P>
    <P>Is it not a fact that most of these things are not in the domain of private industry?  They are in the domain of the Government themselves.  When they are faced with a big problem like CIE wanting to put up fares, which are already far too high and bear hardest on the weakest members of the community, what do they do?  They shrug their shoulders and say &ldquo;There is nothing we can do about it&rdquo;, instead of trying to tackle the problem in CIE or in the ESB in the way in which Deputy Barrett has suggested at great length.  Not at all, all that sort of thing is impossible and they shrug their shoulders and say &ldquo;We are not interested. Let it happen.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All this comes from a Government who, if they were elected on any one single plank above all others, were elected on the plank that they would control and stabilise prices.  When the Minister for Local Government was asked to explain exactly what he meant by that he said stabilisation of prices meant maintaining them at the level at which they were on the day they became the Government.  That was four years ago.  Today, in general, prices are just fractionally under 90 per cent above what they were on the day some small number of the people were gullible enough to swallow that lie.  I can <Col N="1181" /> assure you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that they will not be gullible enough to believe anything they hear from <Col N="1182" /> those benches opposite in the general election which is coming up.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lalor gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the matter of a school strike in Portlaoise vocational school.  In accordance with Standing Orders, the Dáil must adjourn not later than 9 p.m.  By agreement, Deputy Lalor may speak for ten minutes and the Minister for five minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Chair this morning to give me permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of the pupils strike which is at present taking place in the vocational school in Portlaoise and if the Minister for Education would take steps to intervene with a view to settling it.  I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for granting me that facility.</P>
      <P>This strike, which commenced yesterday morning, was brought about because the Laois Vocational Education Committee on Monday last, 7th March, decided to advertise again for a headmaster in the Portlaoise Vocational School.  This was in replacement of an advertisement placed three years ago next month by the same committee.  With the possible exception of one or two, all the pupils have refused to attend school since that decision was taken.  I am also informed that today these pupils were joined outside the school by many parents. Because of the serious implications for these students, almost half of whom will be doing intermediate, leaving and commercial examinations in three months time, I am appealing to the Minister to intervene forthwith to resolve this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This strike arises from a court <Col N="1184" /> action, which, in turn, arose from the intransigence of the majority of the members of the Laois Vocational Committee over the past three years. Yesterday the Minister took issue with me describing them as a maverick committee and countered by saying that it was properly appointed under the Vocational Education Act.  I agree, but I will ask this question: have this committee performed the statutory duty for which they were set up?  Justice McWilliam says they have not.  That being so, the only thing left for the Minister to do is to dissolve the committee.  He has power to do this and his predecessor threatened to do it.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is new to the Department but over the last few days he must have had an opportunity to study the file on this and he must be aware of the background to the problem in Portlaoise.  I raised this question with Deputy Burke, then Minister for Education, on the 18th July, 1974.  I indicated that the Laois Vocational Committee were not going to be bound by memorandum V.7 when making their recommendation. At that stage, almost three years ago, the then Minister said he had told the Laois committee he would not sanction their improper nomination. Since then they have been fighting to try to get their improper nomination accepted by hook or by crook.</P>
    <P>On the 15th November, 1974, I raised the matter again.  In the meantime the majority of the committee had been thumbing their noses at the Minister.  He sent out a directive to the committee on the 18th September, 1974, and they treated it with contempt. The Minister wrote to the chairman, then Deputy O. J. Flanagan, on the 4th October, 1974, appealing to him to obey the rules.  On the 15th October he had a reply from Deputy Flanagan telling him to go to blazes.  The patient Minister got his secretary to write again to Chairman O. J. on the 23rd October, 1974, and threatened that he had no alternative but seriously to consider invoking the relevant powers conferred on him by the Vocational Education Acts.</P>
    <P>Chairman O. J's reply at that stage was again contemptuous with the result <Col N="1185" /> that the Minister finally wrote on the 5th November, 1974, spelling out that the committee's responsibility was to nominate Mr. William Phelan for approval by the Minister, as Mr. Phelan was fully qualified.  It might be well to quote from the then Minister's statement on the adjournment debate on the 11th February, 1975. At columns 167-168 of the Official Report the Minister said:</P>
    <P>No further progress has been made in the matter despite further correspondence between my Department and the committee.  The central point at issue, which was conveyed by my Department to the VEC in a letter dated 5th December, 1974, is that notwithstanding the availability of the candidate who fulfils the requirements for the post of principal in accordance with the committee's own advertisement and in accordance with the relevant terms of the Department's Memorandum V.7, the VEC have persisted in proposing that the post be filled in some form or another by a candidate who does not comply with the requirement applicable to Portlaoise Vocational School that the person appointed should have not less than five years whole-time teaching experience.  It has been stated unequivocably to the committee in that letter that while there is a candidate available who satisfies the conditions for appointment as principal in accordance with normal procedures, I, as Minister for Education, will not sanction the filling of the post on any other basis.</P>
    <P>That was spelled out clearly and categorically by the then Minister.  I am asking the present Minister to stand over his predecessor's promise in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to a parliamentary question which was answered by the Minister on the 15th November, 1974.  At that time he had not had an official reply from the chairman or the CEO.  On that occasion the Minister gave the House an idea of his thinking when he said &ldquo;I intend taking steps in the near future to remedy the situation once and for all&rdquo;.  At column 1577 on the 15th November, 1974, the Minister invited me to wait and see.  I told <Col N="1186" /> him that they were still playing ducks and drakes with him.  On 11th February, 1975, the Ceann Comhairle gave me permission to raise the matter on the adjournment.  I outlined the history until then and was strong in my condemnation of the conduct of the majority of the committee.  In his reply to my remarks the Minister stated: &ldquo;The Deputy has given a fairly accurate version of what has happened.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is as fair as the Minister could have been.  We both agreed on the necessity of having something done about that committee.  At this stage the committee sought legal advice on their position with a view to continuing to challenge the Minister and finally, in sheer frustration, William Phelan, the man who should have been appointed, took action against the committee and, as I see it, he won the case hands down.  I am afraid the Minister was wrongly briefed yesterday when he said that Mr. Phelan's right was not upheld by the court in question.  The Minister should study this matter further.  The committee are still obstreperous.  I submit that the Minister should forthwith dissolve the Laois Vocational Education Committee and appoint William Whelan as principal.  This appointment is urgent for the sake of the pupils.</P>
    <P>I met officers of the student body on Saturday last and I learned from them of their anger and frustration at their treatment over the past three years.  Discipline in the school has gone to blazes.  I was very impressed by those young people.  They asked me to convey their opinions to the Minister and ask him to study the examination results in their school in 1976 so that he can get the full picture of the way in which they are being improperly and ineffectively educated. Those boys and girls&mdash;seven of them representing the student group&mdash;spoke to me about strike if last Monday's meeting did not appoint Mr. Phelan. They support him because he is a respected figure in Portlaoise.  He is a leader and an organiser and a dedicated disciplinarian.  As a responsible local leader I instructed those students &mdash;I did not ask or implore them&mdash;not to go on strike, irrespective of what <Col N="1187" /> happened last Monday.  I told them that nothing would be achieved for them by taking this strike action.  I appealed to them not to move in this way.  I told them I would fight the battle for them, and I was disappointed yesterday to learn that they had struck.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the solution to this.  Let him do what his predecessor wanted to do two years ago and let him not be misguided by the Minister for Defence.  On Monday night I was given a copy of a petition which was drawn up and signed by over 2,000 residents in Portlaoise between Friday last and 4.30 p.m. on Monday appealing to the committee to appoint Mr. Phelan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of going back over the history of this sorry affair which, as the Deputy said, has been going on now for nearly three years.  It came to a head when the case taken by Mr. Phelan was heard in court in mid-February.</P>
      <P>Mr. Phelan claimed:</P>
      <P>(a)  A Mandatory Injunction directing the first-named Defendants (the Co. Laois V.E.C.) that they shall take all necessary steps to appoint the Plaintiff (Mr. Phelan) to the position of Principal of the Portlaoise Vocational School and submit his nomination and appointment for the sanction and approval of the Minister for Education, and if sanctioned and approved, that they shall appoint him to the said position.</P>
      <P>In relation to that claim alone Mr. Justice McWilliam in his judgment delivered on 28th February, 1977, stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, the Plaintiff was not appointed by the Committee and, whatever may be the view of the Department or the Minister about the recommendations of the selection board, my attention has not been directed to any provision in the Vocational Educational Acts, 1930 to 1962, which requires the Committee to appoint the Plaintiff under <Col N="1188" /> the circumstances which have arisen. Therefore I will refuse paragraph (a) of the Plaintiff's claim.</P>
    <P>At this stage it would not be fair to any of the persons involved if I were to make any statement here without seeking legal advice in this case as to the consequences of any action that may be taken by the committee.  As Deputy Lalor has said, the committee did meet on Monday last and they decided to advertise the post.  Since then my Department have got in touch with the CEO in question and instructed him not to advertise the post.  I want to be sure that any action which the committee take conforms with the judgment handed down by Mr. Justice McWilliam.  The judgment in its certified form will not be available for some weeks yet.  It was reported in the newspapers and I have a typescript here of what was stated in court, but the actual certified document will not be available for some time yet.  When that comes to hand I intend to discuss with the Attorney General whether the action they propose is in conformity with the judgment handed down by Mr. Justice McWilliam.  At the moment neither Mr. Parsons who was the principal or &ldquo;acting principal&rdquo; occupies neither of these positions, but neither did Mr. Justice McWilliam say that Mr. Phelan occupies the position, as was claimed by Deputy Lalor both yesterday and today.  Mr. Justice McWilliam did say that steps should be taken forthwith to fill the position. I want to find out exactly what action is proposed and then to discuss with the Attorney General whether the action proposed is in line with Mr. Justice McWilliam's judgment.  Therefore it will be some weeks yet before any action is taken to fill this post.</P>
    <P>I understand that the students of the school were on strike yesterday and today in support of Mr. Phelan.  Those students are not advancing Mr. Phelan's case.  Because of the reasons I have stated, no action is being taken until the legal formalities have been gone through and the students should return to school.  I was glad to hear Deputy Lalor say that he appealed to them to go back to school.</P>
