      <P>On the Order of Business, something happened yesterday which I would like to raise.  I did not pursue it further yesterday, not wishing to be disorderly and recognising that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was unhappy with the situation.  But, in the debate yesterday, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle ordered speakers between Government and Opposition in a manner which he said was in accordance with precedent.  Precedent, going back over the Official Reports that I have been able to go back on when Fianna Fáil were on those benches and we were in Opposition with the Labour Party, is, in fact, for an alternation of speakers between the parties.  When I pointed that out, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle then suggested that the numbers in the House were grounds, a suggestion never made previously.  It seemed to me that, first of all, any such change in procedure would at least require out of courtesy to the Leader of the Opposition notification of the change but, in any event, as it is against precedent, I would ask that the matter be reconsidered and, by agreement, speakers alternate in the way that is traditional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to raise the same matter.  I went back only as far as 1957 and there is definitely no precedent that would support <Col N="1558" /> the ruling of the Chair yesterday that there should be a change in the order of speakers.  That is further reinforced by the fact that, when the discussions between the three Whips for the arrangements of the opening and closing of the debate were being made, the matter was never raised at Whip level and, in fact, the time allocated by order of the House is in proportion to the normal procedure adopted previously by all your predecessors: the Taoiseach had three-quarters of an hour for opening the debate, the leader of Fine Gael had three-quarters of an hour and the leader of the Labour Party had three-quarters of an hour.  The same arrangement has also by order of the House been made for the closing of the debate.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, where Standing Orders are not specific, the only guide the Chair has is precedent, and this precedent is one that has been rigidly adhered to in all matters appertaining to the business of the House by all your predecessors.  I think you should very seriously consider now the decision made yesterday and revert back this morning to what has been the procedure up to yesterday afternoon.</P>

      <P>May I make one comment?  There are two Opposition parties and they number roughly 60 Members of the Dáil as against over 80 Members on this side.  If we follow the logic of what both Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Cluskey have just said then, if there were three Opposition parties, we, with 84 seats, would be entitled to one speaker in four.  If there were four Opposition parties we would be entitled to one speaker in five.  There was a time when there were three, four or five Opposition parties here and they did not get the same right to speak as a preponderance of Government Deputies. Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Cluskey were quite happy to lead their parties in here on the basis of a system of election which is called proportional representation.  If that system were followed to its logical conclusion here we would have eight speakers to every six from the opposite side.  I think the suggestion that they, single <Col N="1559" /> parties with their total combined numbers far less than the combined numbers on this side of the House, should get one speaker each for every one from the Government side is an audacious claim and I certainly would resist it.</P>

      <P>If I might just make one further point.

      <P>Since the Deputy was allowed to make a further observation I am, I think, entitled to the same facility.  I understand that one of your predecessors, not your immediate predecessor, when a similar situation obtained in the House with two Opposition parties and only one party in Government, called on speakers in the kind of debate that should be going on now, in strict order&mdash;one Government, one Opposition&mdash;without any regard to the number of Opposition parties.</P>

      <P>It is disorderly to attempt to raise the Chair's ruling without notice in the House. Deputies must know by now that if they disagree with the rulings of the Chair and wish to pursue the matter they can do so by motion on written notice.  A Deputy can also have any matter of procedure discussed at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
      <P>While I do not intend to allow rulings of the Chair to be raised in a disorderly impromptu fashion in the future, I will say in this case now that it has been commented on that each Member in this House has the same right to have his voice heard and the 83 members on the Government side have equal right with the 64 members on the other side to speak on any subject before the House.</P>

      <P>Any working arrangements the Chair may adopt can never destroy that fundamental principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the present motion the Chair is calling speakers from Government and Opposition alternately.  When the last Government were in office they got <Col N="1561" /> equal time to answer their opponents. Now they would deny the right to the present Government to get the same treatment by the Chair.</P>
    <P>Apart from this consideration, surely elementary justice and fair play require that the Government side must be given the same opportunity as its opponents to make its case and to answer attacks on it.  If, as Deputy Cluskey has said, the Fine Gael and Labour Parties are separate parties with different policies, surely that makes all the stronger reason why the Government side must have the opportunity to answer each speech from each party.  Having said that, the Chair has not now consulted, nor will in future, consult anybody on the manner in which it should conduct its ruling.  I am here to give fair play to every Member of the House in accordance with what I think is the right proportions. There are times when Deputies do not offer in turn.  It is possible to go back on the records and find that maybe six members from the Opposition side were called without a Government speaker offering.  That does not establish a sequence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked up the Official Reports and I found that one of my predecessors took part in a similar discussion to this, and I would refer the Deputy to Volume 252, column 765, of the report dated 10th March, 1971, in which the Chair ruled: &ldquo;The practice mentioned by the Deputy never existed.&rdquo;  The matter was discussed in the volume I have just mentioned.  If it happens, it happens as a result of the Chair trying to allocate suitable time to a debate.  There may be times when four Deputies will speak from that side of the House.  If two Deputies subsequently offered from this side, I would call both of them in order to afford an equal opportunity.</P>
      <P>This is a matter which should not be discussed here, and as Deputy FitzGerald said that he would bring it up with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, that is the place to discuss it.</P>

      <P>I share concern at the partisan tone that crept into the Chair's remarks, which I have never heard in this House before.  I am shocked at part of what the Chair said. While it is not the function of the Ceann Comhairle to consult, it would be a matter of courtesy to do so, if a precedent of 20 years' standing is not to be overturned.  To allow us to enter into the debate without even giving us the courtesy of saying that it is the intention to overturn that precedent is something which I also find impossible to accept.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that there is precedent and if there is any reference there which may be taken as having political overtones or undertones it is because the Chair must have regard for the political divide in the House in order to do its duty properly.

      <P>I cannot accept the Chair's statement that there is no precedent because we have gone back through the records and they show alternation except in cases where Deputies did not seek to speak.  There have been occasions when that has happened, as the Chair rightly said. Apart from when that happens the precedent is for alternation between parties and I think the Ceann Comhairle knows that.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That the Dáil at its rising this week do adjourn for the Christmas Recess.&mdash;(The Taoiseach.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is customary at this stage of a Government's lifetime that we should talk about the end of the honeymoon of the Government.  I am very much afraid that the present Government's honeymoon is following a pattern which is all too evident in many Irish honeymoons.  There have been a few splendid nights, the unfortunate bride is now chewing her nails in the hotel bedroom while her husband is out gallivanting around the town drinking all the money he had saved for the fare home from Salthill. This is the situation in which the present Government find themselves. The truth of this situation will be borne in on the Irish people before long.  Unluckily, the Irish Constitution, although it does not provide for divorce of the civil kind, provides divorce of the political kind in general elections.  I have no doubt that a political divorce will be arranged in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During yesterday's debate speakers from the other side chided the Opposition for being naïve and for talking as if we expected the Government's entire programme to be implemented within six months and they chided us for not producing policies of our own.  I can guarantee that my party in the period between now and the next general election will produce policies which will command electoral support.  It might be remembered that it was not until comparatively lately in the lifetime of the last Dáil that the present Government produced anything that might remotely be called a policy.  The Government have been chiding us for our alleged lack of policies.  If the Government ask us where are our policies, <Col N="1564" /> can we not ask them where their Ministers are?  It is extraordinary that in a debate of this kind, which is effectively a motion of confidence in the Government, we had to date, apart from the Taoiseach, only the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and they could not be described as the most weighty members of the Government.  Where are the others?  I suspect that they are locked in mortal combat upstairs over a rapidly evaporating financial cake as they seek to get a larger slice for themselves in an attempt to honour a small proportion of their election promises.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in opening this debate surprisingly, and unlike many other members of his party, did not blame the present level of unemployment on the previous Government. The Taoiseach blamed it in part on the recession, for which the previous Government was not by any means responsible as it was of an international and uncontrollable dimension, and he blamed it in part on the distribution of our population.  That problem could not be laid at the door of the previous Government either.  When talking about the need to provide jobs the Taoiseach said that the stability of society is at stake.  There are two ways of looking at the unemployment crisis. One can look at it in the pessimistic way in which the Taoiseach looks at it: that we must provide jobs because if we do not society will tear itself to pieces.  This is an unworthy and a negative way to look at it.  We need to provide jobs not because society will tear itself to pieces, if we do not, but because it is everybody's right to have a job and because the task of providing jobs for everybody is a challenge which any Government should be proud and honoured to face up to.</P>
    <P>On the question of employment generally there has already been a substantial failure on the part of the Government to meet the simplest, most basic and most factual of the commitments that they made in their manifesto, a commitment to reduce the level of unemployment by 5,000 by the end of 1977.  It was not a commitment <Col N="1565" /> towards 5,000 new jobs; it was a commitment to reduce the level of unemployment by 5,000.  On the best available figures the level of unemployment has been reduced since the Government came into office by something over 2,300 jobs, and many of those jobs, it is now evident, were created as a result of budgetary strategy adopted by the last Government and by the general betterment in the economy which had partly national and partly international dimensions.  To show how few of those 2,300 jobs the Government can claim credit for let us look at one simple figure.  A week after the Government came into office the unemployment figures were reduced by 500.  Where did these 500 come from?  They were not all Fianna Fáil TDs or Ministers, although it may have appeared like that at the time.  This reduction in the unemployment figure occurred not because the Government were in office or because the identity of the persons sitting in the State cars had suddenly changed, but because the economy was heading that way.  It has been heading that way ever since, as it was before the general election.</P>
    <P>When we look at the longer-term figures in the manifesto and tot them all up&mdash;and these again are figures for reducing unemployment, not the creation of new jobs&mdash;we realise that the Government have undertaken to reduce unemployment by a grand total of something like 80,000 by 1980. Taking as our base date the date on which the Government came into office we realise that if the Government are to honour that commitment they will have to reduce unemployment to a net figure of 30,000.  The lowest that unemployment has ever been in the history of this State and under several extended periods of Fianna Fáil Government has been 60,000.  It has been twice the figure to which they propose to reduce it now in less than four years. With Deputy Cluskey I wish them well, but I doubt very much their ability and competence to deliver, not just because the job is difficult in itself&mdash;it would be as difficult for us as it is for them&mdash;but because their approach to the question of job creation or unemployment cannot give any reason for optimism on this scale.  This is not just <Col N="1566" /> optimism, it is pie in the sky.  The only possible basis on which they could reach that figure would be to accept the figure of 160,000 unemployed as given in their manifesto, but they are precluded from using any figure because the Minister for Economic Planning and Development has already gone on record in this House as saying in answer to a question from Deputy M. O'Leary, &ldquo;I see no reason to change the basis on which the unemployment statistics are calculated&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the Government are still popular.  A recent survey carried out and published by RTE indicated that the Taoiseach was extremely popular and that the Government as a whole were also popular, but when you examine the fine print of that you will see that in some areas things are not going as they should be. People approve far more of the Taoiseach than they do of the Government and even now less than half of the people polled think of the Government as doing well in any single key area.  In two key areas, the provision of jobs for young people and industrial relations, for reasons which I do not need to go into here, more people think the Government are doing badly than think they are doing well.  The Taoiseach is more popular than the individual Members of the Government. I wonder if the Taoiseach personal popularity in some sense cloaks the strong sense of dissatisfaction with their performance in key areas.  The danger here is that ultimately we are not governed by referendum or by democracy but by general election, and the Taoiseach ability to act as an asset to his part is not indefinite.  He is mortal like a men, and his party cannot rely indefinitely on whatever pulling power he may have to cement them together through the difficult years that lie ahead.  The Taoiseach would not indefinitely be a lifebelt for a disorganised and incompetent administration.</P>
    <P>Referring again to jobs and job creation I would like to refer to another portion of the Taoiseach speech when he put on record a fundamental aspect of Fianna Fáil policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1567" /> He talked about a climate for growth when he said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The second part of our strategy involves the creation of conditions in which the private sector will take over as the primary agent of growth and generate additional sustainable employment.</P>
    <P>This is precisely what Fianna Fáil see as being a certain amount of investment in the service industries, a lot of pump priming to private industry.  As a member of this party I must point out my belief that private industry has failed in the past and will fail again in the future if it is relied on virtually solely as the agency which will generate employment.  We need a balance between public investment and private investment.  It is our contention that that balance has never been sufficiently directed in favour of the public sector.</P>
    <P>Getting back to the Taoiseach's speech, unless I have misread it I did not see any notable contribution on the subject of the famous consortium, and we are entitled to ask the question has this white elephant gone the way of its predecessors to the graveyard in the sky?  Again on the question of industrial development we are entitled to ask the Government, on the Bula question, what are they going to do about it?  The State have 49 per cent in Bula and 49 per cent in Tara.  It may be argued that that is substantial. We may have 49 per cent of these enterprises, but are the Government going to give it back to private industry? It was stated in the debate on Bula that if the Government had been in power at the time State equity participation would not have been achieved.  We must have a clear statement from the Government on their industrial strategy in areas like this.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to the more specific area which is my personal responsibility on these benches, the area of education.  Looking at what has happened since the general election, I sometimes ask myself whether the broad shoulders of the Minister for Education are being made to bear a disproportionate share of the burden <Col N="1568" /> of fulfilling the Fianna Fáil election promises.  In the Taoiseach's speech, the education area was virtually the only area to which he referred with any confidence as an area in which new jobs have been created by the reduction of the pupil-teacher ratio in secondary schools and in vocational schools.  It is true that a certain number of jobs have been created by the introduction of a new scheme for graduate teachers in primary education. Even here the Taoiseach over-states the case.  In his speech he gave a figure of 400 graduate teachers.  The actual figure which was available last week and must have been available to him is 320.</P>
    <P>Even though these 320 people are being paid a salary as of now, the point is that they are only in training. They will have to complete their training satisfactorily before they go into the schools to start teaching. Remember there are only 320 of them.  One of the great claims by the Government when they came into office was that there would be 600 of them.  Through successive episodes of mismanagement and hesitation, this figure has been reduced to approximately half of what the Government originally said it would be.</P>
    <P>On the question of higher education there has been some movement.  The Minister for Education has raised the higher education grant to a maximum total of £500.  This may take the edge off the protests by the students, the parents and the university authorities, but it does not by any means go far enough to meet the real needs of the situation.  The real needs of the situation are only partly the cash needs of the individual students.  They are partly also related to the eligibility criteria on which the allocation of grants is made.</P>
    <P>In so far as the cash needs for students are concerned, the Government are still saying they are expecting students to live on £7 a week. That is an improvement, but it is not enough.  Even if it is an improvement, it is a cheap improvement because, by failing to raise the eligibility limits, the eligibility criteria for access to these <Col N="1569" /> grants, the Government are making a gesture which is very much larger in appearance than it is in reality.  You could raise the grants to £1,000 and you would not exactly save money but you would not have to spend very much more than if you refused to raise the eligibility limits.  In a time of rising money incomes more and more people will find themselves outside these limits.</P>
    <P>It is true, as the Minister for Education said when he made this announcement, that you cannot raise the eligibility limits and criteria in the middle of an academic year.  The Government have been in office since before the beginning of the academic year.  They could have taken a decision on raising eligibility limits well before the last date student applications for grants are made sometime in September, I believe.  I suspect the delay on this issue until the last sitting week of the Dáil in this session is precisely related to that fact.  The Minister and the Government had to wait until the closing date for applications had passed so that they could raise the amount of money for the grants, a cheap enough gesture if you are not going to make any more people eligible to avail of them and simultaneously say you cannot do anything about eligibility criteria because we are now in the middle of an academic year.</P>
    <P>On this whole topic I should like to refresh the memory of the House with a reference to a speech made by the Taoiseach, one of his better speeches in Opposition, when he addressed a meeting of the Maynooth Historical Society at Maynooth College on Thursday, 3rd March, 1977. He said that the present level of student grants, even allowing for the projected increase of 16.7 per cent next October&mdash;that was the increase announced by Deputy Barry&mdash;does not allow for inflation since the last realistic review.  He said his party promised such a realistic review so that young students will not have to bear a disproportionate degree of hardship.  He said that even more important was an immediate review of ceiling levels for the allocation of <Col N="1570" /> student grants.  He said the present levels were totally unrealistic and must be reviewed in line with a very severe inflation rate.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach established in that speech a clear order of priorities.  The level of grants is important but even more important is the ceiling level. What the Government have done is to tackle to some extent only the less important of these two areas and to leave the more important area, because it is the more expensive one, to another time.  Whatever about the reference to inflation&mdash;and here as in so many other things there is the appearance of commitment without the substance&mdash;in order to avoid the kind of scenes we have had over the past few months, the very minimum the Government can and should do is to institute, in co-operation with the Union of Students in Ireland and the higher education authorities, an annual review mechanism so that studies are not disrupted, the Minister's time is not unnecessarily wasted and grants are raised in an appropriate way.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to the general question of the Government's incomes policy and specifically to the effect upon incomes of some of the steps promised in their manifesto and which they have now brought into operation.  The first of these is the question of rates, which we were told in the manifesto, and since, is linked directly to the Government's plea for a 5 per cent voluntary limit on income raises next year.  It might be argued that there is little difference between Government and Opposition on the question of the rates, but that is not necessarily the case.</P>
    <P>It is true that there is a difference of timing.  What is not so clear is that there might not have been other differences in the implementation of the scheme.  The Government have taken off the rates on all domestic dwellings. There is a very good case&mdash;and had we been in Government I would have been making this case very strongly&mdash; for confining that concession to owner-occupied premises.  The net effect of giving a rates waiver to many premises which are let out in flats is to provide a cash bonus to the property <Col N="1571" /> owner, not the tenant.  The more properties such a property owner has, the more he will benefit from this financial concession.</P>
    <P>The latest available figure for the number of householders occupying rented accommodation, according to a Parliamentary Question answered by the Minister for the Environment on 13th December, other than local authority dwellings, is 96,884 as set out in the 1971 census.  I doubt that the figure has gone down.  It has probably gone up.  We are talking, in other words, about 100,000 households, and goodness knows how many people that comprises the huge majority of whom, I suspect, will not benefit from the Government's policy on rates.</P>
    <P>Incidentally we are also talking about the poorest of the poor, the people who benefit from a total or a partial waiver of rates.  In 1976, again according to a Parliamentary reply from the Minister for the Environment on Thursday, 1st December, 17,875 people were entitled to partial waivers of rates and 24,000 people to total waiver of rates.  I do not know what the practice is in local authorities other than the Dublin County Council, but I suspect that everywhere in the country the means test adopted to decide whether somebody is entitled to a waiver of rates is very severe and you have to be practically destitute before you will get a concession of this kind.  These are the people who will not get any benefit from the concession announced by the Government.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the question of car tax.  In reply to a question on the 6th December, 1977, the Minister for the Environment said that there are approximately 750,000 cars in the country, of which approximately 540,000 were 16 hp or less.  Of these 750,000 cars, only two-thirds were in the private car category.  If we assume that the same proportions exist for cars under 16 hp we will see that 30 per cent of the Government's concession on car tax is a direct subsidy to industry because these are company cars.  We will also recollect that the pattern of car ownership in this country is very sharply distinguished between the west and the east.  Car <Col N="1572" /> ownership in Dublin is practically double what it is in Mayo.  This is a concession which gives more to the people who have more.</P>
    <P>The same is true of the Government's income tax concessions.  At the moment on the present level of income allowable against tax, a man with a wife and two children can earn about £1,700 before becoming liable to tax. Very large numbers of people are not earning very much more.  According to a Parliamentary Question on the 24th November, there were 500,000 incomes, about two-thirds of the total, of less than £2,500 a year.  These people are paying tax of maybe £20 a year.  They will include probably all the people who are not paying rates. They will include probably a substantial proportion of the people who do not have cars.  Their net benefit from the Government's incomes policy will be of the order of 45 pence per week.  Not only is their net benefit so low, but there is a very distinct chance that any raise which puts them over the £50 a week limit will actually leave them worse off.  They will now lose in terms of take home pay because the rise will put them over the £50 level and they will have to pay another £1.87 in social welfare contributions.</P>
    <P>The Government are creating a new and bitter poverty trap into which inevitably an increasing number of people will fall.  During the period of the last Government there was hostility in Opposition on behalf of the lower paid to very necessary increases in social welfare payments because they felt their standard of living was threatened and that they were personally subsidising these increases.  This was not and never should be the case.  The kind of legacy that it left is going to pale into insignificance beside the emotions that will be experienced by people who find that now because they get a raise they will have less money to take home.  There will be substantial numbers of people in that category.</P>
    <P>When we look at the Government's incomes policy overall, and especially those of us who are doing well out of it, we should ask ourselves: if I am <Col N="1573" /> doing well out of it, who is doing badly?  This is the question legislators should be asking themselves and posing to the electorate.  I believe firmly that the main parameters of the Government's incomes policy are such as to ensure that the people who are doing well out of it will not have to find the cash in another way.  Those who are doing badly are precisely those who have the least strength to bear the burden.  This is, and always has been, the hallmark of Fianna Fáil's economic policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to this debate yesterday and today and it has taken the usual trend.  People on this side are trying to put up the best case they can for the famous manifesto and people on the other side are trying to bore holes in it.  I really do not know if we are doing what we should as legislators.  We had a general election. The people decided that this Government should rule for the next five years.  When I was in Opposition the then Government admitted that I always gave credit where it was due and criticised if it was necessary.  I may be unique in this House and I may be a bad politician because I like to give credit where it is due and do not like to be too severe a critic.</P>
      <P>I will take a look at the Taoiseach's statement, which must be looked at objectively.  The Government have been only six months in office.  There are a number of things in the manifesto which admittedly could be done by the stroke of a pen and they have been done.  I was astonished to hear the last speaker criticise some of those matters, for instance, the raising of the higher education grants and not increasing the income limits.  I agree that the income limits should be increased, but the Opposition should give the Government a chance.  If, this time two years, the income limits are not increased, then let the Opposition lacerate the Government.  I pressed hard for increased education grants because I thought they were not high enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was in Opposition a famous phrase was quoted time and again&mdash;&ldquo;you had 16 years to do it&rdquo;.  The <Col N="1574" /> Coalition had four years to increase the income limit.  It was increased last year but not by a very great amount. We must be fair when criticising.  We want to give the public the impression that we are here to offer constructive rather than destructive criticism.</P>
    <P>As I said, I have the name of being unique and being a bad politician.  I do not mind having that name if I am a good citizen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a politician who is inclined to be critical of both sides of the House.  We are living in an age when we have a very educated electorate.  Soap box politics are out.  I am one of the older generation and have seen all that.  Now we must produce the goods.  As I said in another debate this Government have a mandate to carry out their manifesto.  If they do not do that we could lose 20 or 30 seats at election time.  People now vote for what they are told and if the goods are not delivered the people will let you know how they feel.</P>
      <P>Nobody can say that the Minister for the Environment has not made a good attempt to do all he promised. I heard criticism of the £1,000 grant. I do not see why it should be criticised. Very few people were getting the old £900 grant.  Only very small farmers qualified for it.  Now everybody buying or building a new house for the first time is getting a £1,000 grant.  Nobody is suffering.  I cannot see why this grant has been criticised, because it has been welcomed by practically everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was said yesterday by an Opposition speaker that we were discriminating against the man who could have got a grant previously.  Prior to this if a single man had an income in excess of £1,950 he could not get a grant. Two years ago the procedure was changed.  At one time anybody could get the State grant but there was a change made in January, 1976, and from then onwards unless a person qualified for the two grants he got <Col N="1575" /> none.  It is obvious to everyone that an income of £1,950 is very low.  People will now be entitled to a grant of £1,000 and, therefore, nobody suffers.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker said that the abolition of car tax was discriminating against the poorer section.  In the west of Ireland practically everyone has a car.  It is not regarded as a luxury because people have to use it to travel long distances to work.  Many people from my area travel 30 miles to Galway and it is quite common for two members of a family to have a car.  It must be admitted that many cars were not taxed because the owners could not afford it.  Everyone must insure his car but the tax is another matter.  The abolition of car tax had enormous appeal and I regard it as a good move.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing loans, time and time again I appealed to the previous Minister to raise the loans.  I had great respect for him but I am afraid my appeals did not succeed.  In order to qualify for a local authority loan a person could have an income of only £2,350.  The loan of £4,500 was completely inadequate and in many cases people had to give their deeds as security.  I am delighted that the promise made in the Fianna Fáil manifesto has been implemented and credit is due to the Minister concerned.  He is doing a very good job.  The matter of education was mentioned.  The Minister for Education has done worth-while work.  He has created quite a number of jobs and he has increased the grant for higher education which I agree was totally inadequate.  I hope the Minister will increase the income limit.  It must be admitted that he has made a good start in his Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health is doing a good job.  He is creating new jobs in the health boards.  I agree with speakers who suggested that it might be a good idea to examine the health boards. They are very large bodies and it could be said that they are somewhat out of touch with people.  If county councils had as much money available to them as the health boards have now I wonder if they would do a better job.  They would be nearer to the people, and <Col N="1576" /> this is what true democracy is about. The personnel in the health boards are decent people but their organisations are very large.</P>
    <P>On many occasions I have made suggestions to the former Minister for Health on how money could be saved for the State while providing a better service for many old people.  If a person takes into his house and cares for someone who is not a relative he will be paid for that, but many restrictions and limitations are imposed when the person is a relative.  County homes throughout the country are filled with old people.  It costs approximately £50 per week to keep each person.  Many of these people should be at home, and if the allowance in respect of their care was increased the situation would be improved considerably.</P>
    <P>In St. Brendan's Home, Loughrea, there is a long waiting list for admission. There are many people in that institution, and in similar institutions throughout the country, who should be cared for at home.  If an aged parent falls ill quite often it is impossible for their children to care for them at home. If relatives were given, say, £15 more in addition to the old-age pension to keep old people at home it would save the State a considerable amount.  At present the old age pension is retained by the county home and they give back £2.50 to the pensioner.  The county home will retain about £10 but it costs much more to keep aged people in the institution.  If an allowance of £15 or £20 were given to the relatives they could care for the old people in their own homes.  I am as much a socialist as anyone in this House.  Unfortunately in our world today money talks all kinds of language.  If the money were available to the relatives the old people would be cared for in their own homes and beds would be available in our institutions for those who are really in need.  I had great respect for the former Minister for Health who was a thorough gentleman but I am afraid I could not get him to adopt my suggestion. I do not know if I will have more success with the present Minister. By adopting my suggestion the State would gain a considerable amount.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1577" /> The question of employment of young people is one of our major problems and I should like to hear constructive suggestions from all sides.  Yesterday evening an Opposition speaker made a good speech on this matter, and he referred to the danger to democracy if young people are not employed.  I dealt with this subject in depth when we were discussing the Bill relating to industrial development. Members of this House may not be sitting here in the future if they are not able to provide work for young people in the next ten or 20 years.  In his speech the Taoiseach referred to the uneasiness felt in Brussels with regard to the number of young people who were unemployed. I put forward a few suggestions about this problem.  They may not have been heeded, but at least I had the courage to say what I thought.</P>
    <P>There will have to be some control on automation within the Community, on this question of replacing people by machines which is not absolutely necessary.  I mentioned the other day that shorter working hours will have to be introduced with, probably, less overtime.  These are the things we will have to do to employ an increasing number of young people in Europe.  I understand that we happen to have the largest number of young people within the Community under the age of 25.  This is a complete reversal of the wheel.  When I was a young fellow the priests used to preach that people should get married young; there were no young people in the country; they were all old.  The clock has turned right around in a very short period.  Are we now prepared to meet that situation? Should we not retain and utilise the best brains in the country?  That is why I said I would not criticise the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  God knows he needs a chance and he should be given every help from both sides of the House.  It is not a question of Fianna Fáil or the Opposition; it is the whole question of democracy that is at stake if we fail our young people.</P>
    <P>I will touch on the subject of industrial relations.  This is something the larger unions must examine.  I am <Col N="1578" /> not a trade unionist but I am very much in touch with them in my area where there are perfect industrial relations; that is why I know so much about it.  Anywhere there is a factory with one union there is usually to be found good industrial relations.  I would pose the question to the larger unions: are they keeping in touch with the man on the factory floor?  That is something on which they should examine themselves.  Why are all these small unions getting into industry all over the country&mdash;because there is a lack of confidence felt by the man on the factory floor that if a union gets too big, just as anything that gets too big&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps so; I think even the Taoiseach expressed that view.  Perhaps we are in a very dangerous situation with a majority of 20.  Perhaps the Deputy is right.  I would be inclined to agree with him in the interests of democracy.  But it is up to us here to ensure that we do not allow power to go to our heads, because we have complete power.  Mind you when people hold too much power there is that danger.</P>
      <P>I am in close contact with members of trade unions.  I know the small union fellow who comes in and says: &ldquo;Listen, there is nobody looking after you; these fellows are way above you; why not come and join my union when you will be made an officer immediately.&rdquo; This is the inherent danger and where the rivalry starts on the factory floor.  I know of a few industries in my town where there are perfect industrial relations but they are dealing with one union only.  When this rivalry occurs inside&mdash;the same goes for farming organisations or anything else&mdash;it can be the greatest cut throat situation of all time.  I would ask the larger unions to seriously scrutinise how they disseminate information; how they deal with the man on the factory floor; have they enough representatives on the ground to inform them when something is about to happen so that they can act beforehand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the last speaker that the <Col N="1579" /> State should be more involved. Whereas I believe we should give every support to private enterprise, the task is so big now, without the State getting involved, it might create an impossible problem.</P>
    <P>The west of Ireland telephone communications are abominable.  The first question any industrialist coming to this country will ask is: what is the telephone service like?  The answer is that it is shocking, and I would ask the Minister responsible to seriously examine the situation.</P>
    <P>I come now to retaining people on the land in agriculture.  I shall try to be as brief as possible.  Every Deputy who spoke made the case that it was important&mdash;because of the raw material we have here&mdash;that we should have industries wedded to agriculture. I agree with all of them.  Every Deputy who spoke made the point that it was important to keep as many people on the land as possible.  Deputy Bruton made a very good speech, when he referred to the expanding development category proposed in our manifesto. That is the most important part of our manifesto, that we propose to abolish that disgraceful, humiliating tab of &ldquo;transitional farmer&rdquo; into which category 80 per cent of our farmers fall.  In that context the word &ldquo;transitional&rdquo; meant&mdash;just for a transitional period we will give you a certain amount of money until you go.  It is as simple as that.  The figures for the whole country at present are: commercial farmers 4 per cent; development 16 per cent and transitional 80 per cent.</P>
    <P>In our manifesto we proposed that the transitional farmer be abolished.  I made the suggestion&mdash;and I think the IFA afterwards agreed with it&mdash;that if we could not do that we should have a pre-development scheme, something like the old small farm scheme.  If we could achieve this target we would be doing the biggest favour for our farmers, that is, that the whole question of the transitional farmer be done away with, when we would have rather the expanding, development farmer, any man working to a plan.  I should like somebody to allay my fears in this <Col N="1580" /> respect, because we will become full members of the EEC on 1st January next.  Part of that directive&mdash;even though it was never enforced&mdash;states that, after that time, only for a certain number of years will certain types of farmers be entitled to any support at all.  What I am worried about is that, within that time if 15 per cent more of those farmers reach development status, or even 20 per cent, that would leave us with a ratio of 60:40.  Could we reach the stage that, in six or seven years time&mdash;in accordance with that directive&mdash;the other 40 per cent, who had not reached that status, would get no support at all?</P>
    <P>I maintain the only way people can be kept on the land is by the means stated in our manifesto, that is, to do away with the &ldquo;transitional farmer&rdquo; altogether, that any farmer working to a plan should be entitled to the full grant available to development farmers at present and that he would also be favourably considered as regards land.</P>
    <P>I shall not have time to go into the whole question of land settlement, which is very important.</P>

      <P>When we are discussing the state of the nation at the end of the year it is a pity we have not more time available to us.  On the question of the importance of land settlement to this country I had reservations when the Departments of Lands and Agriculture were amalgamated.  The situation was entirely different at that time; there was no EEC then.  There was never a necessity for a man to be in charge of Lands with the idea of trying to keep as many people as possible on the land.  As I stated also when I was in Opposition, the Minister for Agriculture spends half his time in Europe.  Therefore, no matter how good he may be how can he look after Lands?  It is just not possible.  I am hoping somebody will be put in charge of Lands and, by God, he will have to work because this is what is needed at present; we must get our farmers more land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a suggestion of setting up some kind of development committee <Col N="1581" /> on the whole question of land, that these people would have a panel available to them.  I think Deputy Killilea mentioned yesterday that there is a place for the Land Commission. We might not always agree with the Land Commission; they may do things with which we do not agree. Surely no Deputy here would say that local people should have a say on who should go on the panel.  It has been suggested that our advisers, with local people, would place people on a panel and that they would give State grants and loans to people to buy land.  I would say that about 30 people in my parish would qualify for that panel.</P>
    <P>Suppose 30 acres go up in that area are you going to have those 30 people competing with one another for those 30 acres?  There must be some kind of committee in which local people are not involved.  The local advisers must not be involved.  They are there to give advice to the farmers, and farmers will lose confidence in their adviser if they are used to say who should be entitled to land and who should not be so entitled.  These are aspects that must be considered seriously when the report is available after Christmas.  I look forward to very lively debates here.  I shall certainly be giving my opinion.  I will not drag my feet on matters relating to land or anything else.</P>
    <P>The aim should be to put as many people as possible on the land.  I hope that can be done.  We have two classes of farmers, development farmers and commercial farmers.  The development farmer should get all the grants available. Remember, it is the man who is important, not the acreage.  If a farmer seeks a loan the bank manager is more interested in the man than he is in the security he has to offer.</P>
    <P>With regard to a sheep policy, such a policy is vitally important, and I wish the Minister well in any efforts he makes to get export markets.  Sheep numbers are almost half what they were in 1965.  They are down from 5,500,000 to 3,500,000.</P>
    <P>There is, too, the question of money for drainage west of the Shannon.  The Dunkellin River has put hundreds of acres out of production in my constituency. I hope something will be done about the tributaries of both the Suck <Col N="1582" /> and the Dunkellin so that these acres can be brought back into production.</P>
    <P>I understand the regional fund will be increased.  I trust it will be accounted for separately and not just go into the maw of the Exchequer.  I trust the moneys will be spent where they should be spent.</P>

      <P>I would like to give credit where credit is due, and I think that is due in quite large measure to the restraint with which the Government party have conducted themselves. Despite their victory they have not been overbearing, insolent or unmannerly towards their defeated opponents.  I give that degree of credit for the way this Dáil is turning out. It is also in part due to the very low profile many Ministers are maintaining &mdash;a pancake shaped profile one could call it.  It may be a sensible thing to do but I think it is one of the reasons why people may perhaps be disappointed later on at finding so little done and one of the reasons why this session so far has been so civilised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The style of this Government should be by now becoming evident.  Deputy <Col N="1583" /> Callanan spoke a moment ago about the Government being elected for five years as though the five years were still to run, but I would remind him that about 10 per cent of the Government's term is already up.  We are not any longer starting out on a long road. About 10 per cent of the time of an ordinary Dáil is up, perhaps much more than that if some crisis of a kind I cannot now foresee were to arise, but certainly enough time has elapsed for us to be getting an idea of what the Government's style is going to be. What I would like to know in examining the Government's record so far is whether they have shown any sign of radical thinking or radical planning on our major problems.  I have in front of me the Fianna Fáil manifesto, and I would be a fool if I did not occasionally peep into it to see what is going on and then measure them by their election promises.  But I do not attach a great deal of importance to this footling manifesto or to whether or not this or that achievement promised has been reached.  It is a question of whether the country is being led in the right direction, and in the long term it is a question whether the long-term major problems are being faced in the right way.</P>
    <P>I list these problems&mdash;they are not by any means all economic and I am sure the House will not disagree with most of them&mdash;as chronic under-employment, chronic energy vulnerability, chronic 100 per cent dependence on the stability of neighbouring economies, chronic difficulty in deciding for ourselves in a way that would satisfy everybody what is an appropriate calculus of social justice and social distribution, a chronic ambivalence in the minds of many people in regard to the sphere covered by the idea of law on one side and violence on the other, a chronic bad conscience about national objectives and a guilty feeling that we have not done as well as we should have in regard to reconciliation of the Irish peoples and the saving of the Irish language as those who founded Deputy Hussey's party and my party once hoped and, finally, a chronic ministerial ineffectiveness in <Col N="1584" /> formulating political decisions and making sure they are put into effect.</P>
    <P>I shall give an example of the last thing, which is one of the most serious problems we have got.  Politicians are full of answers until they get into office. Once they get in files rain down on their desks and they are covered like children in a snow storm by files and this is the reason for delay and for not making decisions.  We have seen that here in the last two days.  We have seen the Minister for the Environment, in regard to firm promises about absolutely firm commitments endorsed by his leader about a motorway in south County Dublin, still awaiting a report of some committee before he can give a final commitment and actually build this motorway.  We have seen the Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, over the last two days&mdash;I regret uttering a jibe at his expense yesterday because I have had great consideration and courtesy from him during these last few months and I am sorry I said something to offend him&mdash;in reply to repeated questions from these two parties give instance after instance that something was under consideration, under earnest consideration, being considered in depth.  In other words, he himself was not making the decisions. Maybe he is not able to make the decisions.  I do not blame him for that because he cannot have all the facts at his finger tips.  But decisions are not being made or, if they are being made, they are being made by other people for him.</P>
    <P>The third example&mdash;it is a very serious one and within my spokesmanship&mdash;is that Government party policy in the clearest terms before the election promised there would be weekly publication of comparative household prices and we heard the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy say here the other day that that had not been achieved because his Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn, had not succeeded in twisting RTE's arm into showing this material.  The Minister has a statutory power here.  He said it would not be appropriate to use it here.  I did not like to challenge him because the Chair was getting testy at my repeated <Col N="1585" /> supplementaries.  Why would it not be appropriate?  Is this not a thing that would interest the people far more than prohibitions on RTE under the very same section in regard to the dissemination of subversive material?  What an excuse for a man who is supposed to be the cutting edge of this Government, that Deputy Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn had not been able to persuade RTE to do this simple straight-forward thing.</P>
    <P>That ministerial impotence runs right through the performance of the Government and bears on all the chronic problems that I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>We all operate under a kind of presumption that the recession from which we have just emerged was a once off disaster like the famine or the flood and that it cannot happen again.  We are convalescing from a very serious recession, from a disease which does not leave one immune as some diseases do to its incidence thereafter.  Some event over which we have no control could throw the Western world and ourselves into another recession, and then what will we do?  Our strategy should be directed not towards providing a few thousand instant service sector jobs but should be directed towards making ourselves self-sufficient and independent as far as is possible of what goes on outside this country.  There has not been much sign from this Government that they are giving any radical thought to the chronic problems. Since July virtually the whole work of the Dáil has been to do with unfinished National Coalition legislation. Coalition Bills have been reinstated as they stood, or else some of the entrails were removed and put into the form of a new Bill as was done with the ground rents measure a few weeks ago.  The only other legislation passed was routine continuation stuff which was uninteresting and had no contentious value whatsoever.  There has also been self-decorating legislation intended merely to upgrade the titles of office holders.  The seven Parliamentary Secretaries were promoted not because of anything they do, but in title. I wish them well, but they have been given promotion as though this was <Col N="1586" /> a major step.  It is like Snow White giving a little kiss to the seven dwarf before they set off in the morning. Where is there a trace of serious public service reform in that gesture. The changing of the name of the Department of Local Government to the Department of the Environment sounds a lot grander, but of what use is it? That kind of thing is contemptible coming from a Government which promised to do the devil and all to get the country moving again.  These retitlings and reshufflings within Departments and Ministerial offices, is about the only original legislation which this Government has produced.</P>
    <P>Everybody here is concerned with our chronic unemployment.  There were four legs of the Government's platform in this regard set out in their manifesto.  I do not believe that my party should spend the next four years waving this manifesto, and I have no intention of doing that, but we were shackled to our 14 point programme, of which we achieved 11 or 12, and for some time I did monitor this Government's performance by reference to what it promised to do and what persuaded the people to elect them.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party had four specific proposals in relation to job creation.  The first of them was in relation to direct job creation, but when the Minister for Finance was asked on the 24th November by Deputy Bruton to give details of these direct job creations he could give no details later than the 30th September.  The Minister's figures to that date were that about 1,900 jobs had been filled. The Minister did not say that a very large number of those jobs were jobs for which financial provision had already been made in the 1977 budget of the National Coalition.  Nineteen hundred jobs, even by the end of September, and discounting what jobs were already provided for in any case, is a far cry from 20,000 jobs that were promised in the first year of the Fianna Fáil administration.</P>
    <P>The second leg on which the Fianna Fáil employment platform rested was the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  It was a campaign which would switch 3p in the £ from imports to home products that <Col N="1587" /> yield 10,000 extra jobs, according to the manifesto.  In reply to a question put by me on the 7th December, it emerged that that campaign had not yet been planned let alone launched. That campaign has missed the Christmas selling period.  That is obviously a period that any selling campaign should try to catch.  That is a time when people throw restraint to the wind and buy all round them.  What can be made of the sense of urgency, the sense of crisis, the sense of necessity for a crash programme of a Government which can allow the Christmas period to come and go without putting this &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign into effect?  I am not trying to throw cold water on it, but I cannot see how this campaign alone can produce 10,000 jobs.  I do not see that there is an extra dimension of cleverness that some advertising agency will be able to think up, which will distinguish this campaign so radically from previous campaigns, so that 10,000 new jobs will be clearly attributable to it.  I do not wish to discourage the Government. By all means let them promote the buying of Irish goods, but let them get on with it, particularly since they have attached this national figure of 10,000 jobs to this part of the programme which has not yet even been planned.</P>
    <P>Thie third leg, the Industrial Development Consortium which was heralded in the manifesto as a Seán Lemass type of industrial development consortium, has not been planned either.  It has not held a meeting.  It is not a consortium in the accepted sense of the word.  A consortium is a business partnership; it is there to do business; there is a pooling of resources and a sharing of the risks and profits.  This thing is only a committee.  It is clear from the Minister's replies and remarks about this on the Industrial Development Bill that this is not designed to be more than a committee. Committees can do useful work, and from inquiries I made in relation to semi-State bodies I believe that this committee could do useful work in co-ordinating the activities of semi-State bodies and preventing them from walking on each other's toes.  I hope it <Col N="1588" /> will do useful work.  This was intended to be the answer to the National Development Corporation which originally the Labour Party and then the National Coalition advocated.  At least a National Development Corporation, if it can identify useful tasks can go out and do them; it can spend money and employ people.  This consortium is a pale shadow of that, and to dignify it with the name of Seán Lemass is contemptuous of the memory of the late Seán Lemass.  This humble consortium has not yet been set up.  The Minister told me on the 7th December that arrangements for the establishment of the consortium were well advanced but had not yet been completed.  I know the Minister is very busy, but surely it is not impossible to call a meeting of a consortium which has no statutory base, which does not need any money and will not be getting any money.  What is the problem about that?  It is because they cannot think of anything for this consortium to do. The arrangement is to try to find some useful, visible task for the consortium to do that will not leave it in the absurd situation of the next leg of the employment action team, which has turned out 800 athletes.</P>
    <P>Its first lot of cogitations has produced 800 PT jobs.  I do not want to deride PT any more than I want to deride &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo;, but how serious a response is that to our unemployment problem?  The first raft of proposals by this team chaired by a distinguished athlete produced 800 athletic jobs.  They are not wealth-producing jobs, they are wealth-consuming jobs.  That is the complaint I have about the job creation programme of the consortium, and I want to include in that some of the things my Government did.  Job creation as a social rescue operation and perhaps even as a constitutional rescue operation, should be undertaken in an area where wealth can be produced because that is what we are depending on.  No one is going to feed a nation of clerks and PT instructors.  Someone has to grow the food, to produce the clothes, to build the houses and import all the stuff which will be paid for with visible, palpable exports which people in other <Col N="1589" /> countries want.  We cannot go on a job creation spree&mdash;it has been a very Olympic operation so far&mdash;which simply creates essentially service sector jobs, the icing on the cake, while leaving enormous quantities of wealth unexploited.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Minister for Agriculture here.  If I say something absurd he will have a chance to put me right because I do not claim any expertise here.  The jobs created by any Government ought to be related to our economic needs and resources and the jobs created ought to be, as far as possible, wealth-generating jobs and not jobs which simply consume wealth. That programme has rested far too much on the titles, on names which are voguish sounding.  &ldquo;Consortium&rdquo; sounds grand and you can dazzle people with it.  &ldquo;Action team&rdquo; sounds even better, but what do they boil down to?  A pitiful handful of real jobs created and all of them in a wealth-consuming sector.  That is a lackadaisical approach, and I miss the sense of urgency and crisis which the Opposition at the time created, quite rightly.  The Government's use of the expression &ldquo;160,000 unemployed&rdquo; was dishonest.  If there were 160,000 unemployed in May or June there are 157,000 unemployed now.  This is a marginal improvement if it is an improvement. Even a thing like the British temporary employment subsidy, which has been instrumental in throwing hundreds if not thousands of people out of work in the clothing, textile and footwear industries here, elicited from the Minister for Industry and Commerce last week when I questioned him nothing more than the reply that he had twice protested in Brussels about it.  This is a concrete case of people being thrown out of work because Irish competitiveness is being impaired by this subsidy which the British are giving to firms in danger of closure.  That means that Irish firms cannot sell competitively even in the Irish market, let alone in Britain or further afield.</P>
    <P>Scapegoats are being set up for what is going to be a failure by the Government, who are failing not because I belong to Fine Gael and would have been saying this anyway, but because <Col N="1590" /> their strategy in regard to job creation is directed the wrong way.  The unions are one of the scapegoats, and I instance the case of Ferenka.  Another is the private sector.  Private employers may think they are holding hands under the table with the Fianna Fáil Government but they are in for a rude shock.  They are not going to escape without punishment from that Government, and this is building up already.  Every other day the Taoiseach or some Minister puts out a script in which he talks about the unemployment problem and says that the Government alone cannot solve unemployment, the Government alone have not the answer; it is up to the private sector to take over.  The Government will prime the pump and then it is &ldquo;over to you&rdquo;.  It is over to us to mind our own money in the supermarkets and not be expecting the Garda to do it.  It is over to us to bring up our children properly and not expect the police to control vandalism. If things get worse we will know where to put the blame.</P>
    <P>I am going to give the Government four constructive suggestions in regard to an unemployment programme.  They are not original and I have used them several times before.  No-one need expect miracles.  Firstly, agricultural activity must contain a huge employment potential.  I am not relying on my own eyes or ears or virtual total ignorance of the subject in saying that Dr. Tom Walsh, Director of An Foras Talúntais, pointed out on 18th November that there are three-and-a-half million acres of land lying almost derelict in this country.  What is the employment potential in reclaiming that land and utilising it?  I am not a doctrinaire socialist but I am not afraid to say that I would not mind direct State involvement in that area.  Let the State prime this pump.  The State already owns 100,000 acres of land via the Land Commission.  Let the State start even taking on conacre, or change the law so as to enable estates with less than full freehold to exist in the registry of lands.  Let them acquire land and let them initiate directly programmes of reclamation and then of utilisation, of growing the foodstuffs which we have to import annually&mdash;<Col N="1591" /> the cost was £50 million this year.  I can see all kinds of difficulties here for the Minister for Agriculture. Objections will rain like snowflakes upon him, but only something radical like that is going to seize the people's enthusiasm and get them behind a wealth-producing as well as a wealth-consuming programme.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I would like the State to give serious thought to the promotion of modest-sized local co-operatives.  In urging that upon the Minister I have the authority not merely of the men from An Foras Talúntais but also of Fr. McDyer, a man with no axe to grind except to look after his own parish and his own people, but who has shown what is possible in a disadvantaged area.  He said in a paper which he read in Cork about a month ago that he could envisage 800 small local co-operatives, but I am not talking about enormous ones with turn-overs of millions of pounds.  I am talking about small local efforts each creating employment for 200 people. That is a crude model which cannot be taken literally.  It is Utopian, but it corresponds roughly with the way people should be made to think by the Government.  Any legal obstacles in regard to the formation of a co-operative society should be swept aside.  People should not be afraid of organising in this way.  They organise for charitable, religious and political purposes.  There are credit unions and all kinds of local undertakings which indicate an enormous explosion of unofficial, non-Government-directed energy.  Why can people not be locally organised for their economic survival as well as for the provision of jobs for their children?</P>
    <P>My third suggestion is somewhat trendy.  There are large possibilities in the short rotation forestry in which so much interest has now been created from the energy point of view.  On the energy front, short rotation forestry is still experimental and it may be that, unless the price of oil goes up very high, it will never be really economic. It has got alternative industrial uses and it is very labour intensive.  I hope this economic plan, when it arrives, <Col N="1592" /> will contain a recognition of this possibility.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is a large possibility for work in waste recovery and waste recycling, another trendy idea, not mine, not original, or anything like that, but one which is conspicuously absent from the Government's programme and manifesto.  I am not a bit ashamed of putting it forward in a country like this which finds itself importing waste paper from America. Imagine a ship-load of waste paper coming from the United States into the Dublin docks.  Every time we buy half a dozen eggs they are packed, as I understand it, in an imported carton made of waste paper.</P>
    <P>The employment possibilities implicit in these four suggestions have the severe political nettle lurking among them that they do not measure up to the job expectations and the career expectations of a very large secondary school population.  The Taoiseach hinted at that political nettle in his speech only a month ago. If they do not, the expectations of the people will have to be changed.  The world does not owe us a living. German workers will not get up at six o'clock in the morning, work very hard and be three times as productive as our workers, so that we may be a nation of clerks and physical training instructors.  No one will look after us except ourselves in the long run.</P>
    <P>I do not mind this footling manifesto. What I am afraid of is that the Government might succeed in fulfilling some of its heads and then regard their task as done.  That task is being planned in the wrong direction and in the wrong way.  I hope when we see this economic plan which we have been promised after Christmas, it will incorporate plans for employment based on real productivity and the generation of real wealth.  We will worry and fight about how to distribute it later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme the Government put before the people in the pre-election manifesto recognised the key role agriculture can play and must play in the recovery of the national economy.  We have the potential to be <Col N="1593" /> one of the world's greatest producers of the most basic foods in demand in the biggest consumer markets.  It is vital that we exploit the potential we have, and I have every confidence in the ability of our farmers to respond to the opportunity they now have to contribute in full to the effort needed to get the economy back on an even keel.</P>
      <P>It is already clear that the farming community are well set for expansion in the years ahead.  As we have already been told by the Taoiseach, 1977 has been a good year.  The likely out-turn for the year can leave no doubt that we are at the start of a period of expansion.  The value of the gross national agricultural product is expected to be up by about 30 per cent.  There will be an increase in the volume of output of about 9 per cent, which is direct contrast with 1976 when output fell.</P>
      <P>This increase in volume, coupled with the greater prices available for farm produce, is expected to give an increase of approximately one-third in family farm incomes in 1977 as compared with the year before.  After allowing for inflation, the increase in family farm incomes in real terms will be in the region of 15 per cent.  Nearly every sector of agriculture has registered an improvement this year.  Milk, beef and grain have been the main contributors but the pig industry and horticultural producers have also shown up well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a number of years now the volume of milk production for processing has been rising steadily every year.  This trend has been maintained in 1977 and I expect an increase as big as 10 per cent will be recorded in the years ahead.  Even at that, I am certain we are nowhere near the limit of what we can achieve in milk production.  Although the average cow yield has been improving over the past few years, there are still a great many low yielding herds throughout the dairying industry.  Our aim in the years ahead will be to try to bring all these closer to the standards of the better producers.  This will mean better incomes for many of the smaller farmers <Col N="1594" /> who rely on milk production as their main source of income.</P>
    <P>Disposals of cattle from farms will be about 20,000 more this year than last year.  Most of the extra output of cattle has gone for slaughter in meat factories.  For the coming year the market outlook for beef is promising. With the end of the transitional period, producers should be able to look forward to a strong and firm demand.</P>
    <P>Cereal output for 1977 is expected to exceed one million tons.  This is a record.  For 1978 the Government are encouraging farmers not merely to maintain but to expand the tillage area.  Producer prices generally have been particularly buoyant this year.  It is plain that, given reasonable prices and market stability, farmers will respond and expand production.  I am confident this will be reflected in performance in the coming year.</P>
    <P>While producers' prices increased very significantly in 1977, the cost of inputs such as fertilisers and feedstuffs have not advanced at the same rate, and the ratio between output and input is therefore favouring farmers.  This must stimulate a greater use of basic inputs and should give us a further increase in output next year.  At the same time, capital reinvestment in stock, grassland improvement, better farm buildings, and land reclamation is being maintained at a high level. These investments must lead to better husbandry, better management and better returns for farmers.</P>
    <P>As I see it, farming is ready to embark on a new era of expansion.  It is ready to fill the vital role assigned to it in the Fianna Fáil programme to speed up the economic recovery. Farmers realise now that increases in support prices over the next few years will not be of a kind we experienced in recent times during our annual accession increases.  That period is behind us and most farmers know it.  We must get away therefore from the idea that improvements in farm incomes can come only from further price increases. Present farm prices and the prospect of stable market outlets fully justify expansion.  There is plenty of scope for improving incomes through greater productivity, better milk and <Col N="1595" /> crop yields, better stocking rates, better husbandry to reduce the incidence of disease and especially in the case of calf mortality.  Farmers can and must help themselves in all these areas and I will do all I can to ensure that the Government will back them.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the EEC have published their agricultural price proposals for 1978-79.  As usual, they are very complex and will have to be carefully examined over the next few months.  I cannot give the House many details about them now.  I made it quite clear at the meeting of the Council of Ministers on Monday last that the price package eventually agreed must compensate producers for rising costs and permit the continued development of agricultural production.</P>
    <P>The sheep industry is one sector of farming which has not benefited from our EEC membership.  As Deputies will have read, when I was in Brussels last week I was able to continue the talks I have been having with my French colleague in recent months on the subject of access to the French market for our sheep meat in the new year.  I cannot say much about these talks at the present time but I am satisfied that we made useful progress and I am hopeful that we will reach an early and satisfactory outcome.</P>
    <P>In simple terms what I want to see is that on the 1st January Irish lamb can enter the French market, as it is legally entitled to do, and that we get the best possible price for our exports to that market.  I am conscious that a sudden big increase in the supply on the French market, especially if quality suffers, would be very much against our interests and against the interests of producers.  The need to maintain quality will be a permanent consideration when the market, as we hope, opens to Irish producers.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say more just now. Producers in the meat trade here are being consulted and I hope the whole question will be settled next week. Such a development would stimulate farmer confidence in the long term future of sheep production and put it on a more competitive footing with other farm enterprises.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1596" /> Also in Brussels this week the Council of Ministers had a preliminary discussion on the proposals made by the Commission for modification of the structural directives.  In presenting their proposals the Commission have given recognition to the special problems of poorer regions, and this is a step in the right direction.  I welcome in particular the proposal to give assistance for both arterial and field drainage in the west as we requested Commissioner Gundelach when he was in Dublin and since then.  I am glad to see our representations to him have borne fruit in the case of provisions being made for drainage in the west.</P>
    <P>Drainage can contribute more to the viability of farmers than any policy of land redistribution and it can make an immediate impact.  I hope, there-fore, that this proposal will be adopted quickly.  If it is, I intend to have a special effort made to accelerate drainage activity in the west.  My Department and the Office of Public Works can co-operate to this end and I will be asking the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Hussey, to make this matter his special concern.</P>
    <P>With our present high unemployment I consider it important that greater assistance should be made available to all those farmers who rely solely on agriculture for their livelihood in the foreseeable future.  This will be my aim in the discussions on structural measures in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>The question of special assistance to Mediterranean areas in France and Italy was also before the Council of Ministers last Monday.  I made it my business to point out that the difficulties encountered by the disadvantaged areas in France and Italy can be matched by similarly disadvantaged areas in Ireland.  We got an intimation from the commissioner that he recognises this fact and will take due cognisance of it.  It is, however, proper to recognise that there is an increasing awareness in the Community of the problems of the poorer regions.  As I said, we have had an acknowledgement from the commissioner that he is aware of these circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am glad my decision to introduce a beef carcase classification scheme has <Col N="1597" /> been supported in the industry.  It will make our beef more competitive particularly on continental markets and will give exporters the opportunity to supply to required specifications.  I believe also that it will help producers to recognise the importance of producing quality products, and it has been accepted by the farming organisations with acclaim.</P>
    <P>Although it is only a week since I last spoke on the subject of disease eradication, I make no apology for referring once again to this important topic.  The fact that we live on an island is our first defence against disease. In the matter of epizootic diseases which are the scourge of many continental countries, we have a very enviable position.  It assures access for our livestock products to most world markets.</P>
    <P>We still have a long way to go before we can be satisfied with our progress to date in combatting bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis.  I regard the struggle against these diseases as the greatest challenge I face as Minister for Agriculture. I am determined, given the complete co-operation of farmers and their organisations, to make real progress towards the goal of eradication. We have to get away from the stagnation and indifference which have plagued these schemes in recent years. General rounds of testing will begin in January.  We must be determined that 1978 will go down as the year when we turned the corner in disease eradication. I appeal to everybody involved in the livestock trade, perhaps most of all to farmers and veterinary surgeons, to see that these rounds are carried out promptly and effectively.</P>
    <P>I am always hearing reports of time wasted and difficulties being encountered because adequate testing facilities on farms are not provided. The least a herd owner worthy of the name should have is a decent cattle crush, for which grants are available from my Department.  Cases have also come to my notice of herd owners not presenting all their livestock for testing. Apart from the fact that this is a breach of the law, farmers behaving this way are only making a mockery of the eradication schemes and ensuring <Col N="1598" /> that reservoirs of infection remain amongst our herds.  The full rigours of the law will be applied in any cases that come to my notice.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions recently I expressed the view that the rates of compensation for reactors are inadequate and are badly in need of adjustment. The Government have now agreed that there should be significant improvement in the compensation provided.  In the case of reactor cows, farmers have to pay high price for replacements.  To help them in this, the rate of compensation will be increased from £85 to £130 per cow or in-calf heifer.  Because of the low carcase value of small and young cattle it has also been decided to raise compensation for animals of less than 400 lbs deadweight to £100 from £55. There is not the same need for an increase for heavier animals which normally realise fairly good market prices.  Therefore, compensation for these will increase marginally to £60. These increases will come into effect when the new round of testing starts in January.</P>
    <P>I also intend to provide for hardship cases in the coming round.  This will not be paid out of a special fund as heretofore but will be met out of the ordinary Vote provisions.  I shall be consulting the animal health council about the criteria to be applied.</P>
    <P>I am determined to press ahead vigorously with the eradication of animal disease.  As I said, the full rigours of the law will be applied in the event of breaches of disease regulations. We can no longer afford to tolerate irregularities or evasions.  They are not in the best interests of the farmer and are grossly unfair to his neighbours whose livestock is put at risk.  Disease does not disappear or go away of its own accord; it has to be eradicated and this requires action by the State, by veterinary surgeons and by the farmers.  The State has spent many millions of pounds in disease eradication campaigns and the results achieved are unsatisfactory.  The situation cannot continue indefinitely.  The State cannot be expected to go on paying out large sums of money year after year without achieving any really effective results.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1599" /> During the next few months I intend to have the whole programme of disease eradication examined thoroughly.  The position of farmers and the part they should play in the disease eradication programme will have to be considered fully.  While I do not wish to anticipate the outcome of the study, significant changes in the whole approach cannot be ruled out of consideration.  I want to emphasise now the need for all concerned to tackle the disease problem with renewed drive and determination.  At their meeting this week the Council of Ministers approved the regulation providing for Community aid for accelerated disease eradication programmes in member states.  This is an added reason for taking effective steps now in order to get on top of disease problems.  All concerned will have to play a part.</P>
    <P>My views with regard to the National Agricultural Authority established by the previous Government are already on record.  I expect to introduce legislation as early as possible to provide for the amalgamation of the advisory and training services.  An Foras Talúntais will be retained as a separate autonomous body in the form in which they have operated successfully up to now.  I have already set in motion the procedure for preparation of the amending legislation and I am confident that I shall be in a position to put definite proposals before the Government very shortly.  All going well, this should enable me to introduce amending legislation in the Dáil early in the new year.  I do not wish to anticipate the debate on the legislation but I am convinced that under my proposals expansion and improvements can be achieved in such a way as will enable the advisory and training services to make the maximum contribution to the advancement of Irish agriculture. The expertise is already there. What is needed now is a more effective structure in which they can operate and flourish.</P>
    <P>Our pre-election manifesto placed particular emphasis on the need for more intensive processing and packaging through to the consumer stage.  The <Col N="1600" /> food processing industry is a vital link in the food chain between farmer and consumer.  It has a special contribution to make both by increasing the value of our exports and by giving employment in rural areas.  Employment on farms has been declining but the critical factor is the rate of decline. The slower the rate of decline the more jobs will be preserved on farms that might otherwise be lost.  Provided these retained jobs are economically productive they are surely as good as, if not better than, alternative jobs created in industry or services.</P>
    <P>Growth in agriculture is an objective that must be pursued in the national interest.  I am determined that all efforts in the development of the industry will be concentrated towards the achievement of the greatest possible rate of expansion.  The contribution that agriculture can make to the economy, to employment and to our balance of payments depends on the achievement of these objectives.  The more rapid the rate of growth the greater the contribution that farming can make to national employment. This employment will be further augmented if we can exploit every opportunity to intensify the processing of the raw materials on our farms.  This must be the road to follow in the future.  I intend to work with farmers to make sure that we make the best possible contribution to the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lipper</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the three Deputies who were yesterday elevated to the office of Minister of State.  While I do not know them personally, I want to assure them of my full co-operation during their term of office.  I wish them well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the contributions from the Government side since I became a Member of this House I must conclude they are still celebrating their outstanding victory in the general election.  It is blatantly obvious from their speeches that they think they can afford to be very complacent because they have a large majority in this House and can win every vote.  I should like to remind them of a significant statement made here on 5th July by a very experienced legislator, a man who held most responsible portfolios <Col N="1601" /> in previous Governments.  The words of this Member merit serious consideration by all.  He warned the Government that if they did not fulfil their promises to the unemployed, if they did not create jobs for them, they would not be in power for four or five years as is so confidently assumed now.  He told them that after a year or 18 months, if not sooner, the unemployed will take to the streets and force the Government out of office. The words of that distinguished Member of the Dáil should be carefully considered.</P>
    <P>Much has been said and written about Ferenka.  I wish to make it clear that I know the workers of Ferenka and their families and, like the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, I know of their problems. These workers are as good as the best to be found anywhere in Europe.  They have received a fair amount of flak, but how justified has been the criticism? Let us examine the reasons for the strike, a strike that is now conveniently being used as an excuse for closing the factory.</P>
    <P>Men were asked to clean toilets. They refused and they were suspended. There was an unofficial stoppage but this was resolved and the men returned to work.  The shop stewards of that unofficial stoppage were singled out for victimisation.  Hence the protracted strike.  Surely this is not the best way in which to treat workers. How can management expect the goodwill of the men when they hand out such shocking treatment, such abuse of all human standards of good industrial relations and, most serious of all, the disgraceful attempt to degrade the human dignity of the Irish worker?  Any time there was occasion to go to personnel with a complaint, no matter how trivial, the workers were met with a blank refusal.  Apparently the manager of personnel there was known as &ldquo;Mr. No&rdquo;.  Of course, it is not generally known that a team of reputable consultants were seconded to carry out an in-depth investigation into the poor industrial relations within Ferenka as far back as 1973.  Following a most thorough investigation a comprehensive report was prepared <Col N="1602" /> and presented to top management in the Netherlands.  It contained a very critical account of incompetence on the part of local management which was never refuted by the top management of Ferenka in the Netherlands or in Ireland.  Worse still, no corrective measures were taken.  Therefore, what chance of success was there within that factory, bearing in mind this type of disgraceful disregard for the dignity of the worker not to mention his rights under our Constitution?</P>
    <P>The real danger is that workers at Ferenka could be blamed very easily for the failure of the Government to attract further investment to our region. I want to make it perfectly clear that this is not the case.  I should reiterate that the workers at Ferenka are among the finest that could be found anywhere in Europe.  All they need is proper management and they can produce the goods.  Remember, over 2,000 men have come and gone since the Ferenka factory opened.  Most of them have told me that the conditions prevailing within that factory were similar to those of the old workhouse times when men were treated like peasants with little or no regard for their feelings as human beings.</P>
    <P>Let me make it perfectly clear also that this is no reflection on the unions involved.  They were fighting a very difficult struggle from the beginning; their task was never easy.  In fact I would say it was next to impossible in view of the attitude of management, which was anything but enlightened. Whether the blame rests in Holland or in Ireland is of little consolation in this unfortunate chapter in the history of industrial relations in Limerick.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt the sincerity of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy when he strongly pointed out the seriousness of the unemployment situation in Limerick.  Might I say, as a member of the Opposition, all of us in public life in Limerick were concerned but we are even more concerned today.  Apart from the Ferenka tragedy I have been listening to rumours now for the past week or so of another 200 jobs perhaps being lost in the city of Limerick when a company of soldiers will be wiped off <Col N="1603" /> the register at Sarsfield Barracks.  I wonder what is happening in Limerick. Why should Limerick, as a community, be expected to sit back and accept such suffering and misery in the form of unemployment and hardship?  I do not believe it would happen in any other part of the country; people would stand up and be counted in defence of their rights to live and to work.</P>
    <P>That is why I am convinced that if the creation of jobs promised to the unemployed is not fulfilled we need not think we are going to enjoy a honeymoon period of four, four-and-a-half or five years: the workers of this country will take to the streets and will put every one of us out of office.</P>
    <P>I do not see any great point in holding an inquest here or anywhere else into the closure of Ferenka.  Neither do I see any point running with cap in hand to the almighty multinationals who, as has been proved around the world, constitute a serious threat to any government and to the democratic way of life which is our hard-gained tradition.  What is needed is action, and I mean immediate action.  I am not looking for surveys or anything else that might take months, even years to materialise.  I am seeking desperate action to deal with desperate circumstances. I want to see the huge plant at Annacotty opened again to provide employment for the people of the area. I do not know if it is possible.  But that is what I want explored to the limit in a manner that will lead to action and not merely false hopes.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate the serious concern and deep human interest felt by my colleagues.  I know they do not wish to give the impression in any way that this is a political football.  I am not prepared in any circumstances to take any part in anything that could be regarded as making a political football out of this, the worst industrial tragedy in the history of Limerick, where we have workers equal to those to be found anywhere in the world.  Let there be no misunderstanding in that respect.  I call for immediate action by the Government. Accordingly, I make this desperate appeal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1604" /> I am not here merely for the sake of looking into problems in the past or of finding pleasure in blaming anyone. There is too much of that taking place to the detriment of our country, a country that could and should be the best in the world.  I call on the Government to try to get a united front in so far as this terrible tragedy is concerned, to get these 1,400 people back to work, as a priority; to find ways and means of regaining the massive employment lost to our city for reasons which continue to elude most of us.  To mention but a few of our industries, there are those such as the clothing factories and also Clover Meats and Cleeves.  Let us stop the placation of multinationals at the expense of our heritage and the dignity of our people. Let us come together to fight what I regard as the biggest challenge facing the country in its industrial history.  I would go so far as to call on the leaders of all sides of the House to come together, to show the nation the way forward and end recrimination once and for all.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to criticise workers, unions and, possibly, Governments. Removed 120 miles from my city, criticism without a sound basis and the hope of a lesson is of little value.  What I believe is needed now is unity on the national front without political wrangling. Every idea offered to save the plant should be and must be explored to the very utmost.  We must not forget the families, the wives and children of the men affected by this tragic closure. They too are human beings.  They are intelligent people.  They were doing their share to improve their own lot and the lot of this little country of ours.  They are the people who ultimately wield the power and, if there is blame to be levelled at any of us, they are the people who at the next election, no matter how soon or how remote in time, will tell us who is wrong and who is right.  Thank God, we have a democratic way of electing Governments here and giving power to people.  Long may it remain so.</P>
    <P>One of the worst features of this closure is the plight of the apprentices. Fourteen of these now find themselves unable to finish their training.  I appeal <Col N="1605" /> to the Minister to make special arrangements to ensure they will not be the victims of this closure.  If the Minister makes a special appeal to employers in the electrical and engineering fields asking them to facilitate these young people in finishing their time so that they will qualify as fully-fledged tradesmen I am convinced there will be an immediate response, and a response that will show at least the goodwill that still remains.  The first year, second year and third year apprentices will be catered for by AnCO training centres and the regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>The idea that the plant should not have been located in Annacotty is completely and utterly ridiculous. Limerick and the mid-west region are ideal locations for industry.  Despite all the unfavourable publicity in the Ferenka case the record shows that our area is one of the very best in the country from the point of view of trouble-free working in very large industries. There are several large industries which are foreign owned and controlled and which are highly successful. It should be made clear that we have in the Limerick-Shannon region large industries doing better than their counterparts in other countries. Ask any of the successful industrialists in the area and you will find that Limerick workers are easy to train, quick to learn and, indeed, among the best in the world.</P>
    <P>Again, I regret what happened to Ferenka.  It is a great tragedy.  Certain statements were made here during the debate on the motion on Tuesday, 6th December.  Shocking insinuations were made by a Deputy that obsolete machinery was installed in Ferenka and that the money for the new machinery went into a sister industry in Germany.  Is the Deputy suggesting this happened through a Government agency?  It is very easy to make statements like this, and what I would like to know is what substance there is in them.  If there is substance in them then people have a right to have the full facts made known. People should be told whether or not the Government or their agents were negligent.  If they were negligent they must know they were negligent.  I find <Col N="1606" /> it very difficult to accept that a criminal act like this could be perpetrated without the Government's knowledge and it would be interesting to know what their reaction was.  It is easy to make these charges within the confines of this House where privilege is enjoyed and those making such statements are protected.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy issued a warning that we will not have many more strikes of the Ferenka type.  If Irishmen&mdash;presumably he meant women too&mdash;did not sit down together and talk to one another and have a bit of sense certain steps would be taken. I am sure the Minister must appreciate that there is good reason for the high degree of unofficial strikes in industry, and there is nothing to be gained from making threats such as the Minister made.  Many could interpret that statement as nothing short of blackmail of workers.  I do not believe for one moment the Minister intended the statement as such.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and his colleague, the Minister for Labour, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, will have to work much harder if they believe they can just wish away one of the greatest scourges we have in Irish industry. As a worker and a trade unionist&mdash;something I have been all my life&mdash;I should like to put on record the fact that no worker wants to go on strike, because every worker knows only too well that he will be the loser, no matter what the result.  Workers know full well that the greatest weapon they have at their disposal is the picket.  They are also well aware that the moment they have to use the picket it in itself becomes a failure.  Take it from me as a worker, workers and unions go on strike as a very last resort, and the unofficial strike is used generally because of the bullying tactics of management in dictating far too hasty, cruel and unjust decisions, not to mention many wrong decisions for their own good.</P>
    <P>More often than not there are long delays in having cases brought before the Labour Court even at conciliation level.  When the cases are finally <Col N="1607" /> brought before the court there is a long delay for the result.  These delays cause tremendous frustration.  The unions and the workers' representatives are very often blamed for doing nothing when they have gone through all the available channels.  It is because of the frustration caused by official delays that unofficial strikes flare up.  This is not intended as a reflection on the Labour Court, which I believe is inadequately staffed.  Most of the workers there are grossly overworked.  Because of this they are not as efficient as they should be.  When I attended the Labour Court last year, the Court retired for three minutes and we were warned not to leave the room as we would not be able to get back in.</P>

      <P>The long delays in the hearings are leading this country into bad industrial relations.  The sooner we recognise this, the sooner we can look forward to some progress in industrial relations generally.  I strongly urge the Government to increase the staff in the Labour Court, to expedite all cases and to give the unions and the Labour Court every chance to have disputes heard within a reasonable time.  It is difficult to convince workers that everything possible is being done to have their cases processed through the Labour Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House should note that very often far too few union members attend their meetings.  The militant members always attend, of course.  We cannot blame the unions for this state of affairs.  The trade unions can convene meetings but they cannot force their members to attend. The Minister for Labour should sit down with the representatives of the unions and industry and carefully consider the idea of experimenting with having regular half hour monthly meetings of trade unions in places of employment where members will attend with the blessing of the employers. This could be a useful exercise. From my experience I believe that this would certainly reduce the <Col N="1608" /> number of unofficial strikes.  An appeal could also be made to managements to look into their departments of staff relations.  Staff relations are of paramount importance.  Those responsible for good staff relations should know every worker by his Christian name.  It is their duty to foster and promote good relations and be at all times impartial. This is an area of industry where the deep understanding and appreciation of human problems, held by most Irish women, is invaluable. I urge the House to encourage women to show to a male dominated society that they can do a far better job in industrial relations.  I believe women will succeed where men have failed miserably.  If my suggestions could be put into effect we would rarely have official strikes.</P>
    <P>I do not envy any of the Ministers their portfolios.  They have very difficult jobs, and I wish them very well.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach in introducing this debate put the emphasis on unemployment.  Emphasis has been put on unemployment from all sides of the House.  This emphasis shows the dedication of the Government to solving this problem. No country in the world except totalitarian countries are without unemployment, but we do not accept their methods.  Democratic countries will always have marginal unemployment, but there are acceptable standards.  The unemployment rate here at the moment is unacceptable, and as the Taoiseach said the whole stability of society is at stake in this problem.  I sympathise with the parents whose growing families are seeking jobs.  They have a very difficult task.  It is very depressing not to be able to help more of the people who come to me with unemployment problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach outlined the steps the Government has taken to create <Col N="1609" /> employment in the construction industry. The construction industry offers the best opportunities for investment and development so as to create a society where employment will be available to those who seek it.  It is a reflection on our society that while people are queueing for dwellings other people are queueing at the employment exchanges to obtain benefits. There is a great contradiction here. The late Mr. Eamon de Valera would have said that if we could not solve the problems under the present system we should work outside of it.  We should deeply examine any causes which are hindering our efforts to create employment.  We should examine the construction industry from the labour and employer sides, to see if anything is holding back the expansion of that industry.</P>
    <P>We are all aggrieved that so many young people, because they lacked proper accommodation when they married, find that their marriages have failed.  Bad housing is a major factor in the down-grading of the marriage rate.  If these young couples get proper accommodation they may have to pay exorbitant rents for it.  If they do not get proper accommodation and have to live with in-laws there may be more trouble there.  We have not enough dwellings to meet the demand and despite the achievements of the present Government in this regard the demand for housing is as great as ever. The Government should first tackle the financing of the housing drive by increasing loans, by giving grants, by generally encouraging the building of more dwellings, and in this way, in cidentally, provide employment.  We are not building enough dwellings.  A figure of 25,000 houses a year is good, but if we are going to break the back of the housing problem in a reasonable time we must encourage people to provide their own accommodation and local authorities must be put in a position to build many more houses.</P>
    <P>A fact of housing which must be tackled is the provision of well-run hostel accommodation for the thousands of young people who come each year from the provinces to cities like <Col N="1610" /> Dublin.  We talk of &ldquo;flatland&rdquo;, and I know from my constituency canvass at election time the conditions in which many young people live in these flats. Many of them are being exploited by landlords who are charging exhorbitant rents.  The landlords may say that because of rent restrictions they cannot keep their premises in proper order.</P>
    <P>I would like to see local authorities and even private enterprise providing hostel accommodation which is well-run and modern even to the point of being luxurious so that such young people would not be condemned to living in insanitary flats and houses in the city.  When they come here and enter employment their wages are fairly low and they are put to the pin of their collar to meet the rent.  I hope people at the top of the construction industry will look into this matter.</P>
    <P>Three or four years is a long time out of a person's life to have to wait for housing, and many young people cannot stand the strain of living in a flat.  When they have children they come under the censure of the landlord. They live in cramped conditions and when the family comes along they are in an even more cramped condition while they are waiting for the local authority to provide housing or until they can buy a house.  We must take some blame for this social evil, because even though the Government have tried strenuously to reduce the backlog of housing they have not succeeded.  People nowadays marry younger than formerly.  They want housing earlier and they want higher standards.  If we solve this social problem we will in fact be solving the two problems of lack of proper housing and shortage of jobs in the construction industry.  With a lot of goodwill from employers and trade unions, the construction industry, with Government backing, can ensure that these problems will be swept away.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has warned us solemnly that the stability of our society is at stake because of unemployment, and a contributory factor is the dissatisfaction of many people on the housing waiting list.  Every year <Col N="1611" /> in Dublin alone many houses become obsolescent and cannot be kept in repair at an economic price or they may have to be demolished for street widening.  The housing problem will never be completely solved.  People say that if you build too many houses you will cause further unemployment later on.  This will not happen.  Only living cities have housing problems.  We have to overcome the great bulk of these. If you eradicate bad housing you are going to eradicate grave social problems also.  If the goodwill we have at the moment determines the Government to press ahead with plans for job creation, this time next year we will be able to look back and say that there is a job well done; that we have not solved all our unemployment and housing problems but we have perfected the means which will help us to do the rest in a reasonable time.  We can do it, but we must recognise the enormity of the problem. We must call on the goodwill of the Government, the employers and the trade unions.  We may well then be on the road to recovery and a new prosperity.</P>
    <P>The building industry offers the best opportunity for the creation of a climate of growth.  Apart from the building of dwellings, there is a demand for materials, furniture and everything that goes to the making of a home. These spin-offs will increase the momentum of the drive towards recovery and greater prosperity.  My suggestion about unemployment is that we must expand the construction industry so that it can absorb many people leaving the land and give us the houses and flats we need so badly for families and for young people coming from the provinces.</P>
    <P>Industrial relations have been mentioned. The Government and the Minister for Labour are very well aware of this matter.  Deputy Lipper was quite right when he spoke about strikes. Once a strike takes place, the unions and the workers have lost.  The threat of a strike is effective but once you implement that threat you have lost the battle.  The men lose their wages. They are on strike pay which is not <Col N="1612" /> equal to the wages they were drawing. Ill-will is created every day the strike goes on.  We need to look at the Labour Court and our industrial machinery to see how we can prevent strikes.</P>
    <P>We must look at the trade union movement and the employers' side also to see where are we falling down between the two of them, and how we can eradicate the &ldquo;them versus us&rdquo; attitude.  We should say to the employers and the trade unions that we are all in this together.  If a strike takes place there are no real winners.  We are all losers.  The economy loses.  The man who is trying to keep his home together loses.  The employer loses his profits and his means of livelihood. In our own interests, we should come together and try to remove the &ldquo;them versus us&rdquo; attitude which is crazy in this modern age, especially in a country like ours which is underdeveloped. We are not like the United States or West Germany or Japan.  We have not got a powerful economy.  We have a fairly weak economy, but it is capable of being greatly developed.  If we gave more time to resolving our industrial relations problems, it would be another step towards greater prosperity.</P>
    <P>We must keep a sense of proportion. We hear about strikes through the media, but thousands of our factories are working all the time without strikes.  Because there is no trouble in them, we do not read about them. Some of our firms reach as high a level as firms in any part of the world in the matter of industrial peace.  When we talk about industrial relations we are talking about human relations.  The man on the shop floor does not change. He is the same man as he was outside. The same goes for the employer.</P>
    <P>When we get into a confrontation situation we lose our sense of proportion and it is a fight to the end. Recently we lost many jobs.  No side was blameless.  Having attributed blame to every side, it is time we stopped talking about it and planned for the future.  It must never happen again.  In the trade union movement we have a very powerful medium for industrial peace.  Many people say the trade unions are too strong.  When the <Col N="1613" /> late Seán Lemass was asked many years ago were the unions too strong he said they were too weak.  Our troubles come from weakness.  In some cases negotiations are successful, the problem is solved on paper to the satifaction of both sides, and one man appears outside the factory with a placard on unofficial strike and workers refuse to pass that picket.  We are back to square one and we add to our list of man days lost because one person can stop people going to work.</P>
    <P>When I speak of trade union strength or weakness, I feel the Congress of Trade Unions must be strengthened.  It should be the fountain-head of power in the trade union movement.  I do not believe in the Government interfering in these matters.  If we had a proper system, the Government would not need to interfere and the unions and employers could solve their own problems.  In this State, Governments generally are benevolent.  We do not tend towards dictatorships.  We have to depend on the goodwill of people in industry.  We must try to bring it home to people that an unofficial strike can cause tremendous suffering and destruction. The Congress of Trade Unions should be able to ensure that where a union by a majority vote in a secret ballot have accepted a decision, that decision will be safeguarded and nobody has the right to disrupt the majority decision of a union.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lipper suggested that trade unions should be allowed to hold their meetings on the factory floor.  This happens already in some cases.  What he had in mind probably was a works council, which they have in many continental factories.  If management want to make a change, the council meet&mdash;the trade unions give them their blessing&mdash;and management have to tell the council why they want to make the change and, unless they convince the council that the change is for the better, the change will not be made.  That is why these continental countries are prosperous.  Not only do they work hard to produce goods but they also work hard to ensure that there is no disruption by unofficial strikes or by any strikes.  This is a voluntary agreement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1614" /> A recent happening which was published in many parts of the world has done us harm.  The year 1978 gives us an opportunity to redress that harm and to show that there is peace in the vast majority of our industries.  Some of our industries have an amazing record of no strikes.  Be it noted that they are the most successful firms.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lipper also referred to the fact that women might do better in industrial relations than men.  That may be so, but there is no reason why they should be.  It does not matter whether we have men or women in charge of human relations, if goodwill exists we will have peace.  We cannot depend on a fairy queen or a wizard waving a magic wand and solving all our problems.  We must face facts.  Employers and trade unionists are in this together, and unless we face this fact we will have trouble.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to Northern Ireland and gave the heartening message that things are improving there.  There are fewer killings, bombings and outrages.  I hope that before the end of next year there will be peace there.  Of course, it must be peace with justice and justice for all sides.  When we talk of our people in the North we mean all the people.  We can discuss with Northern politicians the problems of the people who have no jobs, no proper housing and are suffering from ill health.  These are the basic problems facing this island and we can solve many of them with mutual goodwill. We must prove to the people of the North that we have concern for their welfare and are prepared to sit down at any time to discuss their problems.  Nowadays there is sufficient goodwill to help overcome these problems.  Earlier this year Dublin councillors went to Belfast and Belfast councillors came to Dublin to discuss mutual problems.  We understand each other better now and as a result are better friends.  I hope 1978 will see an end to the real problems of the North.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): In the short time at my disposal I would like to put at few matters on the record.  One thing has emerged clearly from this debate, and that is that the National Coalition Government managed the economy carefully and well between 1973 and 1977.  They brought us through one of the most severe international economic recessions that hit the world for half a century.  We handed the economy over to the present administration in good shape.  There is no denying that. It has not been denied in this debate nor has it been denied by economic commentators or economists.</P>
      <P>The next point that emerges clearly from this debate is that Fianna Fáil are having second thoughts about unemployment. They have no solution for it.  They are preparing the way for failure to deliver on their promises in regard to the creation of employment. The Taoiseach is reported as saying that the very stability of our democracy depends on the provision of employment.  Deputy Callanan also spoke about the danger of dissatisfied youth, and Deputy Moore followed on the same lines.</P>
      <P>The greatest danger to our democracy lies in the danger that politicians should mislead or disillusion our youth, or that they should hold out to the young people great expectations which they could not fulfil.  I want to charge the Fianna Fáil Party and this Government with having been guilty of shabby, shady and disgraceful conduct in the promises they held out to the young people before the last general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They promised full employment, higher and full education grants with a very relaxed means test, and a full programme for youth with all sorts of amenities, if Fianna Fáil were returned. They have not delivered on those promises and it does not look as if they are going to deliver.  The sad and tragic thing for this country would be if our very big population of young people, as a result of the failure of the Fianna Fáil administration to deliver on youth, should become disillusioned with politicians and with the democratic system.  There is a serious <Col N="1616" /> obligation on this Government to deliver on their promises to the youth.</P>
    <P>There is no good in Deputy Moore coming here and saying he has sympathy for the parents of young people who cannot get jobs.  In view of the promises made before the election and the statement in the election manifesto that tens of thousands of jobs were there for the creating of them, sympathy is no use.  Jobs are required. Time does not permit me to develop that point further.</P>
    <P>The next question I want to mention, in my capacity as Fine Gael spokesman on the environment, is the proposal to abolish rates.  The abolition of rates on private houses and other hereditaments in that category has my full support.  This party removed the health and housing charges from the rates during our term of office. In that way we kept down the rates by up to £3 or £4 in the £.  In our last year of office we started to reduce in an orderly way the rates on private houses by 25 per cent, intending to complete the job this year and next year.  We did that without in any way taking away from local democracy or from services provided by local authorities.  As an election gimmick and in a desperate effort to get into power, Fianna Fáil said they would remove rates from houses entirely and in one operation beginning on the 1st January next.  They are going to fulfil that part of their promise.  I hope they also abolish the rates on schools, residential schools as well, without any qualification.</P>
    <P>What they did not tell the people was that they were going to put local government into a straitjacket, that they were going to tell the local authorities how much they could spend and on what they could spend it.  They did not tell the people that they were going to reduce substantially the services provided by local authorities.  If I had the time I could go into this in great detail.</P>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question I put down yesterday, I was given details of the rates struck by local authorities for the past seven years with particular reference to variations in one year as compared with another. <Col N="1617" /> I have time to deal only with last year.  I find that only nine county councils out of 29 were able to keep to the figure of 11 per cent and that about ten were far above that figure.  I shall give some examples.  One county council had an increase of 16.9 per cent last year and others increased by the following amounts: 19.9 per cent; 21.9 per cent; 17.8 per cent; 17.3 per cent; 16 per cent; 18.7 per cent and 17.8 per cent.  Dublin Borough Council increased by 16.5 per cent; Limerick by 16.7 per cent and Waterford by 13.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>All these authorities are being told by the Minister for the Environment that they must confine their increase to 11 per cent.  I have time to give only a few examples of the consequences. Kildare County Council were told by their county manager on 7th December that because of the Minister's circular it was necessary to reduce his carefully prepared estimate by 57 per cent.  The result will be a reduction of £155,248, in the amount to be spent on county roads, a reduction in public lighting of £5,000; a reduction in water maintenance of £10,000; a reduction in respect of sewerage maintenance of £3,000; a reduction in public assistance of £36,300 and a reduction in the health grant of £35,900, making a grand total of £245,448.  The result of that circular issued to all local authorities is that there will be a wholesale cutback in services with a consequent reduction of employment.  That was not promised by Fianna Fáil before the election.  Promises and sympathy are no good from the Government. They must deliver on their promises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is apparent from the Taoiseach's opening statement in this debate and from other statements by Government spokesmen that unemployment is recognised as a serious problem by the Government and one that should be tackled.  Such a recognition on the part of any Government obviously is a necessary prelude to the adoption of correct policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be conceded also that this Government have committed themselves to very specific annual reductions up to 1980 in the numbers on <Col N="1618" /> the unemployed register.  They recognise the social evil of unemployment and, in addition, they have solemnly committed themselves to specific reductions in the number of unemployed for this year and for the succeeding years of their administration.  That is a necessary prelude to the adoption of realistic policies to advance towards solution of the problem.  The administration should be legitimately concerned about the malevolent effects of unemployment for the population generally and especially for the category for which they voice such great concern, the young people.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to identify the nature of the problem and to be concerned about the ill-effects on the community generally.  This is commendable and admirable and so far as expressions of concern go this is the most concerned administration on the issue of unemployment. Some people might say it is perhaps too soon to expect anything but expressions of concern from a Government who have been in office for only six months.  We have had many speeches from them.  In this debate the Taoiseach expressed his concern once more and, in doing so, he joined with most members of the Cabinet who have voiced their concern on many occasions in the past six months. The Minister for Labour has set up what he calls an employment action team.  We have not had any results from the team as yet but it has been established and the Taoiseach referred to it at the start of this debate.</P>
    <P>It is fair of Opposition spokesmen, even six months after the Government have taken up office, to ask for some evidence of action.  I am not raking over the embers of the election campaign when I refer to the 5,000 jobs pledged by the end of 1977.  In referring to that pledge I am confining myself to criticism of present shortcomings in the activities of the Government. I am criticising a lack of progress towards the fulfilment of employment targets set for 1977.</P>
    <P>This is the last day of this session of the Dáil and we can say with some certainty that the first instalment of the Government's undertaking to reduce unemployment by 5,000 will not <Col N="1619" /> be honoured in 1977.  They have another undertaking of a 20,000 reduction next year.  Perhaps that will be honoured but on the evidence of the first instalment of their programme one must entertain serious doubts.</P>
    <P>The downturn in the latest unemployment returns&mdash;it stands at 4,362 on last year's return for the same week &mdash;cannot be attributed to any action by the Government.  If any credit is to be given for the definite, if still unsatisfactory, improvement in employment that has taken place this year it must go to the budgetary action taken by the outgoing administration at the beginning of the year.  I am assuming the Government do not wish to rest on the withered laurels of a defeated administration.  I am assuming the Government are interested in the effects of their own actions on a subject that is of such vital concern to the members of the Cabinet.  I assume that they would not be satisfied with a situation&mdash;on a subject so dear to them, one of such seriousness to them &mdash;that they would rest on the budgetary actions of that administration in tackling the problem of unemployment. On their own actions, their own measures, what works have been carried out by them since July, apart from speeches?</P>
    <P>On the unemployment question we look in vain.  There is the employment action team which, so far as I have been able to observe, has been prolific only in expressions of concern to date. Its structure is very unreal, its purpose very vague.  I read of proposals in the last week or two that we would see suggestions or recommendations for the employment of physical training instructors&mdash;a laudable objective&mdash; but nowhere near the youth target in employment set for the work of that employment action team.  Remember that the establishment of that employment action team&mdash;with so few actions or positive proposals to its name as yet&mdash;is cited as a main plank to prove this Government's commitment to settling unemployment at present.</P>
    <P>I take it that this administration, so anxious to settle this problem, so sure of their superiority over the remedies <Col N="1620" /> of the outgoing administration, would not take to their credit actions undertaken by the previous administration in relation to the undoubted improvement that has taken place in the area of unemployment, unsatisfactory but an improvement nonetheless.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, I think, concedes that some credit must be given to that administration, which was so culpable in many respects, if we are to believe Ministers of this Government.  There is some grudging tribute paid to the work of that defeated administration in the Taoiseach's speech when he says:</P>
    <P>What is even more encouraging is that employment in industry continues to rise.  In the second quarter it was 6,500 higher than a year earlier.</P>
    <P>&mdash;the second quarter is scarcely the quarter of the Fianna Fáil rule in this year.  The Taoiseach continues:</P>
    <P>For the year as a whole, numbers at work should show an average rise of about 7,000.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach finishes this paragraph:</P>
    <P>This is the sort of foundation on which we can build if we manage our affairs properly.</P>
    <P>As a member who served in that outgoing administration, not one member of it would begrudge the present one their ambition, in the Taoiseach's words, to build on the &ldquo;foundation&rdquo;, the foundations of our budget; we would not begrudge them that ambition, that budget which laid such very sturdy foundations in the amounts on the capital side, in job investment, for expansion and recovery, a recovery fuelled by rising exports, of products that were competitive in price.  If, in the Taoiseach's words, they are building on that foundation at least they are going in the right direction.  But they are not speaking of their handiwork when they speak of that foundation. Again, to quote the Taoiseach:</P>
    <P>We have not come into office to repeat or perpetuate the confusion and despondency of the past four years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1621" /> There is the comment at the end of the Taoiseach's speech that this is a Government of &ldquo;leadership, of courage and conviction&rdquo;.  If those words of the Taoiseach are to be taken in their literal meaning&mdash;that they are not out to perpetuate the confusion, despondency, the half remedies, the policies that did not fully work of the last administration, as they would see it&mdash;then it must follow they are under-taking to reduce, by 5,000, the numbers unemployed in 1977.  That is an undertaking based on policies brought into being by this administration. They contend that these undertakings and policies are additional to any good wrought by the budgetary actions of the National Coalition.</P>
    <P>It might be considered somewhat unfair on our part to chide this Government on lack of progress on the employment front so early after six months, in their career as a Government. But so specific have been their undertakings in the area of employment, so certain have they been that their policies and remedies would be additional to those of the outgoing administration, that criticism on lack of progress in this area at this time is deserved and legitimate.  It is fair to say that the earliest casualty in the economic programme on the job creation front appears to be this administration's undertaking to reduce unemployment by 5,000 this year.  The recent statements by the Minister for Finance, for one&mdash;a very comprehensive reply was given in this House to a Parliamentary Question recently&mdash; show that progress to date on job creation makes it abundantly clear that the target set at a 5,000 reduction will not be reached this year.  The likelihood of reducing unemployment by 20,000 in 1978 is even more remote on the evidence of policies propounded so far in their first six months in office as we come to the end of the last day of this session.  The fundamental weakness of the Government's proposals to stem unemployment is that they contemplate no institutional change, no new gathering, no new mandate given to the State sector. They appear to be basing their policy on a total reliance on short-term increases in jobs in the public sector, <Col N="1622" /> a response which, in our view, would prove to be inadequate.</P>
    <P>Speaking about the present administration's lack of institutional innovation in dealing with the question of unemployment it is regrettable&mdash;and gives us an interesting insight into the way they view the trade union movement that whilst the members of this administration who, after all, are so talkative on the subject of the need for co-operation from the trade unions in the wage and salary sector; who are so anxious to secure their co-operation, ever counselling them on the need for moderation&mdash;that whilst the Government are anxious to secure the co-operation of the trade unions when it comes to moderation in wages and salaries, there appears to be no two-way traffic in ideas, in solutions or suggestions on how our performance in the job creation area can be improved. The trade union movement have repeated to this Government, indeed asked them quite recently, to go ahead with the establishment of a national development corporation, something we would have proceeded with.  The most recent meeting with the trade unions at which this recommendation of Congress was referred to was that of 23rd September last.</P>
    <P>In discussing with the Government and Ministers concerned with the economy, the trade unions at that meeting again suggested the advisability of setting up that national development corporation as an aid to tackling unemployment.  Just as promptly that request of the national trade union centre was turned down by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  As he told them at the meeting, it was his intention as per manifesto to establish a consortium, a consortium which, as he has explained in the House and elsewhere, would not be a new organisation, not that everything has to be totally new in this area.</P>
    <P>This cannot be described as innovative. It will simply be a gathering of existing State organisations that will meet periodically.  From what one can see of the description of the working of this consortium, it is another example of the kind of spreading bureaucracy <Col N="1623" /> which increasingly seems to be the Government's only organisational innovation to the genuine problems of unemployment. The employment action team now has grown into a committee of 25.  As the committee spreads in numbers, its proposals become fewer and any action appears to be converse to the size of the committee.  There-fore, it is not unfair to suggest that many of the Government's responses take the form of appointing yet one more committee, suggesting fancy names for the kinds of committees being set up&mdash;in this instance it is a consortium; in the case of the Minister for Labour's pet, it is the employment action team.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Taoiseach touched on the subject of the national agreement. As someone who had responsibility for liaison with the social partners in the events that led to the ratification of that national agreement, I would be the first to say to the House that that national agreement would not have been possible without the general understanding that every action possible to reduce unemployment would need to be taken by the Government of the day.  That is why the National Coalition accepted the submission of the Congress that a national development corporation should be established.  It is also one of the reasons why we decided to go ahead with the establishment of the National Manpower Authority.  I would also be the first to say that, though our national agreement was not as ambitious as the comparable British social contract, and nothing as ambitious was envisaged by the unions, the employers or the Government, yet the ratification of the 1976 agreement by the trade unions would not have been possible without the tacit acceptance, understood by all who participated in the negotiations, that a binding obligation rested on the Government to manage the economy in the direction of job expansion.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see the present policy proposals for tackling unemployment leading to any lasting improvement. Their proposals are for the <Col N="1624" /> immediate and short term, concentrating overmuch on short-term expansion in the public service.  Their proposals cannot be described as serious policy inputs on the steps that need to be taken if unemployment is to be reduced in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that they are committed to specific reductions in the unemployment register, it is difficult to see how the results they seek will be obtained, though I readily admit that what I call the Bingo politics which brought this Government to power make it difficult for the spending profligates of June last to become the economic statesmen of December, who are now lecturing the trade unions on the virtues of moderation.  Anyone who holds a responsible view on the matter will not contest the need for moderation in incomes if conditions in which employment is to expand are to be maintained.  Wage and salary earners must not be asked to carry the burden of moderation on their own.  If we are to have moderation in the economy next year and if we are to seek the ideal conditions for job expansion, lectures must not be addressed solely to the trade unions on the advantages of moderation.</P>
    <P>I believe that national agreements have notably contributed to the standard of living, particularly the last national agreement.  I am glad to note that in his final words the Taoiseach takes back charges that were made earlier in the House that the last national agreement had not led to an improvement in the standard of living of the wage and salary worker, and he quotes trade union information to the effect that it did lead to an improvement in the standard of living of those covered by that agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Unemployment is a subject of much concern to the members of this administration and their concern is voiced daily.  It cannot be gainsaid that the national agreement, particularly the last national agreement, has been the most important contributory influence on this <Col N="1625" /> year's improving employment position. Without it, it would not have been possible to see the all-time high record gained in exports.  This is why the outgoing administration fought and worked so hard in getting a national agreement in liaison with the social partners that would lay a secure foundation for job expansion.  We would be the first to admit that the recovery which has been notched up this year in the economy on the jobs front is far from satisfactory.  We would agree with the Taoiseach that unemployment is still intolerably high, but we were going in the right direction and we at least had the courage to accept the kinds of innovative changes that are lacking in the present proposals.</P>
      <P>It was our desire to ensure that moderation should apply in regard to wages and salaries.  The burden must not be placed unilaterally on the shoulders of wage and salary employees without similar moderation being exacted from other elements in the community. In this connection, if the intention that was announced by the Tánaiste at a recent dinner to review both the capital gains tax and the wealth tax leads to a decision to fundamentally alter the regulations, I believe he will be endangering the securing of support for moderation on the part of wage and salary earners.  I do not know whether the Tánaiste is winding-up for the Government, but I hope that at the earliest opportunity he will spell out clearly his intentions in respect of both the wealth tax and the capital gains tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of moderation in relation to that agreement.  Moderation is essential if we are to improve conditions for job creation.  I would go further and say that the growth forecasts for the economy of 6 per cent in 1977 and 6¾ per cent in 1978, which are realistically drawn up and put forward by such organisations as the Central Bank and ESRI, provide a genuine basis for an increase in real incomes for salary and wage earners in the negotiations at Employer-Labour Conference level.  I doubt if the recent statement by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development enhances the possibility of securing that <Col N="1626" /> kind of free agreement on a real incomes increase that would also allow for job expansion.  His statements make nonsense of previous Government statements, which were to the effect that acceptance of the Government's proposals would result in an average range of income increases of from £8 to £10 per week.  As a result of the disclosures of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development in the Dáil it is now clear beyond any shadow of ambiguity that all previous Government statements setting out the feasibility of income increases ranging from £8 to £10 per week must be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>Apparently, if we are to believe that Minister who is in charge of the Government's economic thinking, those Government spokesmen who have advocated acceptance of the 5 per cent plus tax reductions have been assuming all along that such elements as the reduction in rates, the abolition of car tax and the reduction by £1 in the cost of the insurance stamp are an integral part of the Government's tax offer.  Single people, who constitute a large category amongst taxpayers, will receive virtually no increase if the Government's proposals as we know them on the tax front are endorsed. Wage earners with large families will suffer a similar fate, receiving nominal increases, if the disclosures of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development are to be believed.  I assume they are to be believed because he is in charge of Government thinking in this area.</P>
    <P>On the Government side it is important that if they are to get a moderate increase agreed freely this year they must revise the kind of tax offer they have been offering up to now because it is clearly not adequate.  In calculating the rate of inflation at 7 per cent for next year the Minister for Economic Planning and Development appeared to take advantage of the reduction in rates twice over, since it is included by him both as an element which contributes to holding the projected rate of inflation next year at 7 per cent as well as contributing to the cash package he has been advocating up to now.  Even <Col N="1627" /> when using the reduction of rates in this double fashion there are many who contest the forecast of an inflation rate next year of 7 per cent.  If I remember correctly, the ESRI do not believe that figure.  At any rate it remains the hope of all who are seriously committed to the achievement of full and sustained economic recovery that success will attend the talks for a new national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>Negotiations which have such crucial consequences for future progress in the economy require a spirit of straight talking and dealing if satisfactory results are to be obtained.  Statements on the taxation front which appear to be extremely unfair have been made by Government Ministers with the nominal hope of improving and enhancing the climate for agreement have succeeded in doing the reverse.  Unnecessary misunderstandings have been created.  I question the wisdom of Government Ministers announcing before talks have opened what the detailed cash components of a final settlement should be, but if such a course is adopted, as it has been by the Government, then the settlement figures proposed by the Government side must be clearly seen to be supported by incontestable factual material.  The present improved economic situation makes it possible that a real increase could emerge in the present talks, not the increase lifted so far on the tax figures from the Government but it is possible that a real increase could emerge that would not endanger the prospect of job expansion later.</P>
    <P>Since this is the Government whose members have initiated the process of publicly declaring their settlement expectations then it is opportune at this point that the Government Ministers should review the basis of their present tax offer.  It is said that this is a Government enjoying a honeymoon period; they may be coming to the end of it but they are still enjoying it. Recently the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs attended their first European Council meeting.  I do not think the convention of observing <Col N="1628" /> a honeymoon period for a new Government should deter us from the task of realistically assessing their performance thus far.  In relation to that attendance at the European Council meeting one may legitimately ask whether the cash figures agreed by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in respect of our contribution over the next few years, and their agreement on what will be coming to us from the regional fund, meant that they have given over the principle of reallocation of resources within the Community. It is a fair question to ask whether the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs were sufficiently consistent in arguing for a massive transfer of resources in finance, manpower and technology from richer to poorer regions at their first meeting of the European Council.  The policy of going to Europe for the summit meetings and coming away with a slight improvement on the cash benefits, to us obviously will be attended with diminishing success in future, especially with the prospect of fresh entrants to the Community, Greece, Spain and Portugal.</P>
    <P>Early in the life of this administration we must assess performance and cast judgment on the performance on issues encountered by the Government thus far.  In talking about meetings of the European Council fisheries come to mind.  One longs for the simple Fenian purity of the 50-mile national fisheries limit enshrined in the motion tabled by the present Minister for Foreign Affairs when in Opposition last year.  He sought an exclusive 50-mile zone.  The election manifesto also makes a reference to the fisheries question. It is put in the form of a credo in the fisheries section.  The manifesto stated that Fianna Fáil firmly believed that to protect the livelihood of our fishermen a 50-mile off-shore limitation on foreign trawlers and factory ships was of urgent necessity.  That is almost akin to the renewal of baptismal vows.  The motion moved by Fianna Fáil last year called for the reservation exclusively to Irish fishermen of a 50-mile zone.  Now, instead of the unambiguous assertion of what we understood to be the case in the manifesto and in the motion debated here <Col N="1629" /> last year, there is talk of a fall-back position.  I do not know what figure the fall-back position is, but it is certainly a departure from what I understood to be the unambiguous policy announced in the manifesto and contained in last year's motion.  I do not know, whether through all this talk of a fall-back position, it is not too fanciful to foresee the Minister for Fisheries finally protecting the rights of our fishermen by obtaining for them limits which extend only so far as the paddling limits off our beaches.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister for Agriculture has any fallback position in relation to his negotiations in the agricultural area, but I would like to point out the contrast between what the electorate took to be simplicity, clarity and lack of ambiguity in the Fianna Fáil catechism which won them the last election, namely, the manifesto and the reality.</P>
    <P>The electorate understood the taxation provisions quite clearly spelled out.  Yet we learn now that the taxation provisions are dependent on other matters being agreed.  Unhappily the electorate has learned that the so-called manifesto is as complicated as the <i>Talmud</i> or the <i>Koran</i>, needing a great deal of interpretation, with ambiguities lurking in every clause and paragraph. That manifesto in which every line was filled with goodies for the gullible is now, we find, a very complicated document indeed, needing a good deal of interpretation and contingent on a number of circumstances coming about and being fulfilled.  Trade unionists must accept moderation. Our European partners are implicated when it comes to bargaining. Unemployment largely depends on general virtue.</P>
    <P>If there was any theme clearer when this administration was in Opposition it was that, if they were elected to Government, they would be a Government with all the answers, a Government which believed that Government action on its own could bring about desired results.  Somehow there was a hope on the part of the electorate perhaps when the &ldquo;real Taoiseach&rdquo; was back in office things would be different and certain problems would be solved.  He has, after all, the magic <Col N="1630" /> wand of his 20 majority.  He is now flanked by 25 Ministers, the strongest mandate in the history of the State. Yet, in his opening statement on this debate, close to Christmas, he brings unhappy facts to the attention of the House.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Manifesto are a package.  They cover incomes, prices, taxation, welfare and employment. The pleasurable items cannot be abstracted and the rest discarded.  We are not living in easy times and any action of ours based on the supposition that we are would be folly.</P>
    <P>I like the emphasis.  &ldquo;We are not living in easy times and any action of ours based on the supposition that we are would be folly&rdquo;.  That is the Taoiseach speaking, with a majority of 20 and 25 Ministers.  That is the Taoiseach who won the election on a manifesto which declared that most solutions lay within our own grasp and most of the problems which the outgoing administration encountered could be resolved by a Government with leadership, conviction and courage.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach implied these are the attributes of the present administration. Many of us in the last administration suggested that the problems were not as easy of solution as our opponents seemed to believe and that a good deal of community co-operation was necessary to overcome them. Extraordinary events which affected costs and prices at home were talked about by the then Opposition as if the Arabs and the oil crisis did not impinge on our economy.  Indeed, listening to them, one would think the Arabs were living in a county in the country and were susceptible to our control, such was the ridicule with which the then Opposition treated the Government when dealing with fuel and energy costs.</P>
    <P>We know that things like unemployment, prices and industrial relations require, as well as leadership, a great deal of co-operation from the general public as a whole.  It is on this Government's head that the illusion has been created that all problems affecting the electorate can be referred to Merrion Street for solution.</P>

      <P>It is the Government who have created this illusion. One would have thought that a Government of such strength, ministerial talent, and with such a large majority, could have handled a local issue like Ferenka in a more satisfactory way. What did we see?  We saw division. We saw two Ministers fumbling a job that should have been a job for one Minister.  One may fairly ask, in the wake of the Ferenka tragedy, what is the role now for the Department of Labour?  Is there any role for the Department of Labour and its master when all other solutions to an industrial problem have failed?  We had the statement from the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy saying that it was none of the Government's business, resulting in 1,400 jobs being lost in Limerick.  Who now is Minister for Labour?  Is it Deputy Dessie O'Malley who is Minister for Labour for Limerick, and does he deal with disputes in his constituency when other solutions have failed?</P>
      <P>I am not saying the State should intervene in all disputes.  The Government should remain out of as many disputes as possible and leave the existing agencies to resolve them.  Intervention is often unavoidable and, looking up the record, I find I intervened as Minister for Labour in major disputes on 25 occasions.  When the Department of Labour was established by Mr. Sean Lemass one of his primary concerns was that it should play a role in industrial relations when other solutions failed.  We now have a Fianna Fáil Government in the main traditions of that party and yet we find the present incumbent saying it is none of his business to intervene even when all other solutions have been tried and failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I saw on our television screens where a former member of a Fianna Fáil Government discovered very late in the day that his idol had feet of clay.  Increasingly we see this administration, with its majority of 20 and its phalanx of extra Ministers of State, beginning to fail as it encounters problems.  Despite the Government's <Col N="1632" /> majority and the way voting goes, it will be our task here constantly to assess their performance in fisheries, industrial relations and unemployment and bring them to book on the basis of the undertakings they gave in the book that brought them to power.</P>

      <P>The Ashbourne, Dunshaughlin and Summerhill sewerage schemes will serve respectively 450, 110 and 60 houses initially and are designed to cater for 1,100, 600 and 175 houses ultimately or an equivalent sewerage load.  Treatment proposed is surface aeration with settling tanks prior to discharge to the Broadmeadow River in the case of Ashbourne, oxidation ditch and slow sand filtration prior to discharge to the Skayne River in Dunshaughlin and oxidation ditch with clarifier prior to discharge to the Cloneymeath River in Summerhill. Estimates of cost are: Ashbourne £340,000, Dunshaughlin £160,000 and Summerhill £65,000.  Consultants were not employed on Dunshaughlin and Summerhill, while Messrs. Jennings <Col N="1633" /> and O'Donovan, consulting engineers, were employed in the preparation of the Ashbourne scheme.  Meath County Council have been asked to forward details direct to the Deputy on the amount of fees paid in respect of the Ashbourne scheme and also to provide estimates of the likely duration of construction work on each scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>As I announced today, I will be prepared to consider applications for new house grants under the scheme which was in operation up to 5th July, 1977, from persons who had entered into a contract to purchase a house or flat, or whose dwelling was commenced&mdash;that is, the foundations were poured&mdash;at any time prior to 26th May, 1977.  The earlier concession announced last September was limited to houses commenced after 31st December, 1976.  This arrangement will operate only for the period ending on 30th December, 1977.  Applications must be received in writing in my Department not later than that date and payment will be made provided the dwelling is satisfactorily completed before 1st January, 1979.</P>
      <P>The applications referred to by Deputy Bermingham in Question No. 6 and the second person named by Deputy O'Keeffe in his Question No. 7 are therefore now being reconsidered. However, there is no record of an application for a housing grant from the first person named by Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister say if there is an income basis involved in houses that were commenced prior to the 1st January last year?  Does this mean that the £1,000 will be allocated irrespective of income?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no income basis in regard to the £1,000 grant cases, but there was an income basis, as the Deputy knows, in regard to the supplementary grants under the old scheme.  It is a question of which scheme applies.  There will be no gap. <Col N="1635" /> A person will qualify under one scheme or the other.  Under the old scheme there was an income basis, but under the new scheme there is no means test requirement.  I cannot say in regard to a specific case which scheme applies, but all cases will be covered by one scheme or the other.  Until the pre-£1,000 grant cases are absorbed the means test will continue to apply to the supplementary grant.</P>

      <P>Section 39 of the Housing Act, 1966, and the regulations made under it set out the minimum statutory conditions applicable to the granting of house purchase loans by local authorities.</P>
      <P>It is open to any local authority to include a condition to provide mortgage protection by way of an insurance policy or otherwise when granting a loan.  Similarly any recipient of a loan can take out mortgage protection if they so wish.  I do not consider, however, that I should make such a condition a compulsory element of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will bring that to the Minister's attention.  I appreciate the point, but I felt that the purpose of the question was to make it mandatory to incorporate mortgage protection in <Col N="1637" /> regard to the issuing of SDA loans. Whatever the merits in regard to making the options known to the applicants, which I will have considered by my colleague, there are also disadvantages in adding it in as a compulsory element to the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points of view on it.  As a Deputy, I take the view of the applicant.  One is adding to the burden of the applicant's responsibility with regard to seeking an SDA loan.  Surely the more simplified the procedure as far as the applicant is concerned, the better.  My colleague, Deputy Murphy, is proposing an additional burden as far as the applicant is concerned, although I appreciate the advantages in having this type of mortgage protection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <P>Would the Minister be confident that the house-building programme of previous years and particularly the number of houses built, would be sustained or increased in view of the fact that there does not seem to be any substantial or significant increase in the amount of money being allocated?  Is he happy that the number of new houses will be maintained?</P>

      <P>On the matter of the total housing programme I have no doubt that the stimulus which we have injected into private house building by the £1,000 grant and the improvement in SDA loan facilities on both the income basis and the total amount basis, will result in an increase overall in housing in the coming year.  All the indications are to that effect.</P>

Would the Minister say if any have been paid or are they all as they are in County Meath where 285 people applied, one has qualified and no one has been paid?  If that is the situation after six months what is going to happen to the £1,000?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask a very serious question?  Do I understand the Minister to say that no additional funds have been made available to the local authorities' housing fund in capital terms; that as a result of the change of Government last July the new administration saw fit not to make one extra penny available for the provision of local authority dwellings, and that all the efforts of the Fianna Fáil administration have gone into the provision of additional private houses? If I may take the sense of the Minister's answer, as a result of the efforts that his Government have taken they expect to reach the 25,000 figure purely on the basis of increased private house building output and there will not be a single extra local authority house to those planned prior to 5th July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not understand the mechanics of Government and that is the problem.  The public capital programme is an annual matter done each year.  The question put down by Deputy Tully related to the capital programme in regard to public housing prepared in 1977.  At <Col N="1642" /> the moment we are preparing the public capital programme for 1978. That will emerge in the various prebudget publications of the Department of Finance next month and is another issue.  We are talking here about the 1977 programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say that a first allocation for housing was given to local authorities this year and when local authorities found that their programme ran over and they were out of money a further allocation was given, apart from whatever money has been withdrawn from places like Dublin county and Dublin city who did not spend their allocation?  Would the Minister say if any further money has been made available, as in previous years, from any source by the Government to enable local authorities to complete their local authority housing programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a sensible question.  The Deputy is aware of the mid-year review of the public capital programme with regard to housing. After this mid-year review, which was initiated by the Deputy when Minister and is being continued by the present Minister, the review of allocation was carried out and in October extra moneys were allocated to many local authorities throughout the country who required such help.  As they required help extra allocations were made to them.  That is normal practice in October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Only from moneys already taken back from other local authorities.  No extra moneys were made available by the State.  None of the £30 million that was talked about was made available for local authority housing this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has rather paternalistically accused me of not knowing how to ask questions.  In my innocence I asked the simple question, <Col N="1643" /> have this Government, through what-ever available experience mechanisms are open to them, thought fit to increase the capital fund available to them to provide for the projected increase in local authority housing?  I have as yet got no straightforward, simple, uncomplicated answer to that rather simple question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.  The upkeep of public roads is the responsibility of the local authorities and I am satisfied that the service being provided by them is generally satisfactory.  I do not propose at present to recommend to the Government that an order to bring into operation the provisions of section 60 of the Civil Liabilities Act, 1961, should be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in 1961 the Government of which he was a member brought in this Act containing a section which abolished the non-feasance responsibility of local authorities, that this section of the Act was to be brought into being not before 1st April, 1967 and that it still has not been brought into being? What does he propose to do about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter again on which there are two points of view. As against bringing it in you have the weight of opinion of the Association of Municipal Authorities, the General Council of County Councils and the City and County Managers' Association.  The local authorities throughout the country are against bringing in this on the basis of the potential burden that it would add to them in regard to liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain what point of view you can give to a woman who finds herself, her <Col N="1645" /> husband or child seriously injured through the neglect of a local authority to repair a road?  Surely the Minister will agree that arising out of this we have a scandalous situation which can be called nothing but criminal negligence on the part of our local authorities in not being responsible for repairing and maintaining the roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

We will continue to have this system.  It would be a very difficult drafting job to get around the court decisions.  We will continue to have a blood alcohol level, and I do not intend as of now to reduce it from 125 to 100 millilitres.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the proper planning and development of their areas rests, however, with the individual planning authorities.  It is for each authority to set out appropriate policies in their development plan and to implement these through the operation of planning control. The majority of planning authorities do, in fact, make some provision in their development plans for the limitation or restriction of ribbon development taking into account the special position of farmers and those engaged in agriculture.</P>

Quite candidly, the Department of the Environment were a bit perturbed by the tendency of the previous Minister and An Bord Pleanála in regard to being too flexible in dealing with ribbon development.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the advice or assistance he has to offer to Counties Kildare and Dublin where development is taking place at a very rapid rate and where the limitation laid down by him on rates increase and the grant from his Department do not provide sufficient revenue to meet this expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have recently notified a limit of 11 per cent to all rating authorities as the maximum amount by which their rates in the £ for 1978 may exceed the rates struck for 1977. My concern is to ensure the continued alignment of the programmes of local authorities with national policies in a manner which affords protection also to the interests of non-domestic rate-payers.</P>
      <P>The 11 per cent limit on increases in the rate in the £ does not imply a corresponding limitation on the rates income of rating authorities for 1978. In fact, because of new and increased valuations, it is estimated that on the basis of the upper limit of 11 per cent, rating authorities would have, on average, an extra 14 per cent in rates income, including income from rates-linked State grants, available to them in 1978.</P>
      <P>In the case of Counties Kildare and Dublin, where development has been taking place at a rapid rate, increases in the valuation base will be above the national average and, accordingly, the additional rates income available to these areas should increase by more than 14 per cent over 1977.  To set the limit of 11 per cent for 1978 in perspective it should be observed that increases of 10.9 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively on the 1976 rates in the £ were provided.  I am satisfied that fair provision can be made in 1978, within the limit on the rates in the £ which I have set down, to meet the cost of existing and expanding rates-financed services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was done on a very sensible basis.  It is embodied in a circular that was sent to local authorities. It emphasised the fact that last year we had a situation where there was an increase of 14 per cent.  This year we have set a limit of 11 per cent.  We have kept it flexible in that, while it applies across the board, in certain counties where there will obviously be pressure in terms of development&mdash; Counties Kildare and Dublin are two obvious examples and they have been informed&mdash;we will have a limit of 14 per cent as of last year.  The idea is to strike a balance between the requirements of the local authorities without making it too open-ended, so that we may have a discipline in regard to local authority financing and at the same time meet their requirements. We have struck this balance between the demands of last year and this year and we have drawn a distinction for the coming year between the counties on which pressure will be coming and the counties that will not have the same pressure.</P>
      <P>We are trying to get a formula.  This is the first time the new scheme is being adopted.  Hopefully the formula will work as a compromise between the necessity for financial discipline and the necessity to keep services going. The figure of 14 per cent is based on a planned inflation rate of 7 per cent &mdash;hopefully it will be less, but as it looks now it will be 7 per cent&mdash;and a real growth of 7 per cent.  We take 3 per cent off that 14 per cent in respect of rates income from additional non-domestic premises and we have a variable so far as the whole country is concerned between 11 per cent and 14 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the Minister's reply and I thank the Chair for its indulgence.  This is a fairly important matter.  Did I understand the Minister correctly that the calculations were based on what had happened in the past, that the assessments of growth were based on extrapolations of the previous two years <Col N="1660" /> rather than on an assessment of potential and real population growth in the obvious growth centres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a combination of the experience acquired last year and in previous years in regard to local authority finance and development and the projection for next year in regard to inflation and GNP.  We are seeking to achieve a balance between giving too much and too little.  The figure of 14 per cent represents a rate of 7 per cent for inflation and a 7 per cent rate for GNP.  That is a reasonable level. We are taking from that 3 per cent for additional non-domestic rated property and this leaves 11 per cent.  There will be a balance between 11 per cent and 14 per cent&mdash;certainly it will be 14 per cent in Dublin and Kildare and perhaps 11 per cent in the rest of the country.  We must see how it works this year.  This is a completely new scheme and a new development in local authority financing.  It is a new concept to take rates off domestic houses in accordance with our commitment, which has been welcomed by the people.  To some extent we must regard the coming year as a trial year.  We have tried to adopt the best criteria. We have taken the criteria of inflation and GNP.</P>

      <P>A decision by a local authority on an application for a rates waiver is entirely a matter for the local authority, whose decision is final and conclusive and is not subject to review by me.  It is understood from the local authority that a waiver has never been granted in the case mentioned by the Deputy but that judgment mortgages totalling £934.56 have been obtained on the person's property in respect of rate arrears.  It is also understood that the local authority refused to grant a waiver in the current year in view of: (a) the amount of arrears which had already accrued and which was charged on the property in favour of Birr Urban District Council; (b) the fact that it is unlikely that the burden of the rates would pass to any members of the ratepayer's immediate family since as far as the Council is aware no other member of his family occupies the premises; (c) the extensive valuation of the property.</P>

Conditions attached to that permission required the submission of further particulars for approval before <Col N="1665" /> the development could commence.  In January, 1977, the planning authority granted a further permission for stage 1 of the development with a condition that the developer comply with all conditions attached to the original permission in June, 1975.  In July, 1977, permission was granted for additional car parking.</P>
    <P>The planning authority have informed me that they have received no complaints about the condition of the Adelphi Cinema site and that the only complaints received about the Salthill Hotel site were in connection with a hoarding which surrounds the site.  I understand that this hoarding is repaired when necessary by the corporation. The Adelphi Cinema site has recently been fenced and tidied.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that there is either a health hazard or a nuisance on either site.  The corporation do not appear to think so but in any event I would have no function in regard to such matters.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister if planning permission is given in respect of this kind of development, is it permissible or possible for the planner to get permission and then sit on the site, as it were, for an unlimited period without doing anything?  Is he then the person who determines what goes on that site or can the environmental people step in and say: it is in a condition which should be changed? If a planner decides to sit on it for, say, five years may he do so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware of the continuing anxiety of residents in the Ovens district, County Cork, as to the potential health hazards created by the Raybestos Manhattan factory; and if he will take action to monitor and counteract this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received representations from residents of the Ovens area concerning the operations of the Raybestos Manhattan plant.  I am advised that planning permission subject to 12 conditions was granted for the development in January, 1976 by Cork County Council.  Conditions attached to the permission were designed to ensure that there would be no danger to the health of workers in the factory or to people living in the area.  No appeals were lodged against the permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the conditions required a monitoring system to be devised to measure asbestos dust emissions both within the factory and in the vicinity. I am informed that this has been done and that the system has been approved by the county council and by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  I also understand that the plant will be monitored by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards on behalf of the planning <Col N="1667" /> authority.  Moreover, the planning permission required that the plant should be designed, constructed, operated and maintained in accordance with the Factories (Asbestos Processes) Regulations, 1972 and in this connection I understand that the plant was inspected on 7th December by the factory inspectorate of the Department of Labour and that they are satisfied that the regulations are being complied with in full.</P>
    <P>From what I have said, the Deputy will appreciate that adequate provision has been made for monitoring asbestos dust emissions from the plant.  The terms of the permission granted allow the use of chrysotile asbestos only and prohibit any use of crocodolite asbestos. Furthermore, very severe standards have been imposed to ensure the efficiency of dust filters and general dust control by vacuum cleaners and to minimise occupational exposure to dust within the factory and any dust emission from it.  The planning authority has acted on expert technical advice and it is now a matter for them to see that the standards are observed. The necessary enforcement powers are available under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 and 1976.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department certainly seems to have done its best to make sure there is as little danger to local inhabitants as is possible.  Is it not a fact that this asbestos has been recognised only recently as an extraordinarily dangerous substance whose real danger we are not fully aware of at present from the point of view of carcinogenesis; that there is legitimate ground for fears by local householders that we are dealing with something we simply do not know about?  Would the Minister not agree that even though the Department has done all that it appears to be possible to do, in the light of our present knowledge, it may not be adequate and, in those circumstances, something should be done to hold up the whole development until they are quite satisfied they are dealing with something about which they know as much as possible?</P>

      <P>I will deal with him later, a Cheann Comhairle.  Before dealing with the domestic aspects of the Taoiseach's speech in introducing this debate, which are controversial and on which I may find myself, to say the least, in disagreement with the Government, I should like to deal with the Taoiseach's remarks about Northern Ireland.  He made the point that the security situation in Northern Ireland seems to be getting better, and this is something we are all glad of and hope it can be sustained.  However, one has to comment that it seems to be getting better to a degree at our expense and that there seems to be an <Col N="1716" /> increasing tendency for those who are engaged in terrorist activities in the North to engage in them here at danger to human life and considerable cost to the community.  It does raise the question of the disposition of our security forces with a view to ensuring that these activities are kept under control.  The Taoiseach made particular reference to the care that needs to be taken in the disposition of security forces of a certain type or tradition in particular areas in Northern Ireland, which he said is a matter that can cause great trouble. I endorse what he says in regard to this matter; indeed, I go further and say that where we are talking of a particular unit of the security forces it is not just that there is a problem about it serving in particular areas in Northern Ireland.  I think it is a question of its service in Northern Ireland at all in view of the record of one particular group, and it should be seriously reconsidered by the UK Government.  We have sufficient interest in the maintenance of peace in Northern Ireland from every point of view, from the point of view of this State, from the point of view of our concern for the people of Ireland as a whole, to have a right to take this matter up with the UK Government.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach says he does not need to underline the sensitivity of this matter.  It would seem that he does need to underline the sensitivity of this matter to the UK Government and it might be no harm if he did that and if it were done rapidly before the provocation that could be given by this particular force operating in Northern Ireland heightening the tension again and creating a recrudescence of terrorist activity which has, as the Taoiseach said, been dying down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to his remarks on the discussions aimed at an interim devolution arrangement, I can only endorse his hope that these discussions will come to something.  For them to do so will require considerable skill and openmindedness on the part of the UK Government and the Secretary of State, an openmindedness in putting forward proposals which are related to the desires of the two sections of the community <Col N="1717" /> to make some progress towards devolution but within certain constraints that arise from their divergence of attitude to the question of power sharing.  No pre-occupations or preconceptions on the part of the UK Government should stand in the way of proposals being made that are likely to secure a measure of support in Northern Ireland.  It would be a pity if a basis for agreement were to be at least possible&mdash;one cannot put it higher than that&mdash;if this were to fail because of a reluctance on the part of the UK Government to put forward proposals along the lines that seem to interest many of the potential participants. This would include a significant measure of legislative devolution.  I shall not pursue that further on this occasion but I feel it right to add that comment to what the Taoiseach has said.</P>
    <P>This debate has been and necessarily is primarily concerned with the affairs, above all the economic and social affairs, of this State in this part of the island of Ireland.  When I originally considered my remarks for this occasion, I had intended to spend a good deal of time in putting on record the state of the country when we left office.  With a single exception, the Taoiseach has done this job excellently for me.  I could hardly have produced better figures for this purpose.  The only exception&mdash;and I do not fault him for it because the information was not available to him at the time he spoke &mdash;relates to inflation, the latest figures for which were published only today. These figures show an increase of no more than 1.7 per cent in the consumer price index for the latest quarter, which gives an annual rate of inflation for the last 12 months of only 10.8 per cent, significantly lower than the best hopes we had in Government ourselves; indeed, significantly lower than what we committed ourselves to in the election campaign as being feasible and achievable on the basis of the policies we had been pursuing.</P>
    <P>These figures show that for the second half of the year, even if one makes full allowance for the effect of road tax abolition, the impact of which on the consumer price index Fianna Fáil are entitled to the credit <Col N="1718" /> for, the inflation rate is down to 3.4 per cent, an annual equivalent of 6½ per cent.  If one compares the annual rate of 10.8 per cent for the last 12 months and the 3.4 per cent for the last six months, leaving the road tax abolition aside, these figures compare extraordinarily well with the 25 per cent inflation rate at the height of the post-oil crisis inflation of two-and-a-half years ago when the extraordinary inflation in Britain communicated itself to us with particular force; indeed it compares remarkably with the 20 per cent inflation rate of as recently as 12 months ago.  I do not think any other country in Europe has achieved a comparable reduction in inflation in recent times by a virtual halving from 20 per cent to 10.8 per cent within 12 months.  That is an achievement which except for a fraction of 1 per cent relating to the road tax, is the achievement of our Government.  It derives from our actions when in Government and, most important of all, our actions in relation to the national wage round which is at present in force and the negotiations of which we sought to facilitate by tax concessions and where we secured a very satisfactory outcome.</P>
    <P>Having made that point about inflation which the Taoiseach was not in a position to make yesterday because the figures were not available I should like to remind the House about what he said about other aspects of the economy.  On the growth of the economy, which he put at around 5 per cent this year&mdash;this may be an underestimate because the ESRI has suggested a figure of 6 per cent&mdash;he described this as being near the top of the league table internationally.  I agree with him; in fact, only Japan and the United States have similar growth rates this year.  Within the EEC and with respect to the other non-EEC industrialised countries growth rate this year are now projected at 2½ per cent in both cases.  The Taoiseach told us that investment was dynamic with the principal impetus coming from the private sector.  He said that investment in equipment and machinery was up 15 per cent.  Indeed it is.  The achievement of a dynamic rate of investment at a time when the rest of the world economy is drooping is indeed one of <Col N="1719" /> the great achievements of our Government. The Taoiseach referred to the significant improvement in private consumption and said that consumer demand was up 4½ per cent.  He also stated that it grew throughout the year and added that the improvement in consumer confidence had played a large part in inducing the revival in consumption.  Given that this revival in consumption has occurred throughout the year it, therefore, began before this year started.  The question of who secured the improved confidence causing this recovery is one that admits of no doubt or argument; it was the Government that was in power in 1976 and the first half of this year.  They created the confidence that has led to this recovery.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also told the House that exports were up by 35 per cent in value.  Indeed they are.  As far as I can calculate from the price indices, it means a 17 per cent increase in the volume of our exports overall.  It is an unprecedented increase and is almost three times the rate of increase of exports for industrialised countries generally, now projected at 6 per cent for the current year.  The Taoiseach told us that industrial output was more than 8 per cent higher in the first half of the year, on top of last year's 10 per cent.  He added that the July-August figures were also encouraging.  All of that is as a result of our efforts when in Government.  He told us that employment in industry continued to rise and that it was up by 6,500 between the second quarter of 1976 and 1977. When he referred to industry I believe he should have said manufacturing industry.  If one includes mining, quarrying and turf, not taking into account the building industry, the increase is 8,000 in that period.  The Taoiseach said that for the year as a whole there had been an average rise of 7,000 in industrial employment and I assume he was referring to manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach told us that the trend in cement sales was encouraging but he might have added that the trend was encouraging since May when the weather improved and not since the <Col N="1720" /> Government changed, as he may have sought to imply.  He might have added that the number of houses completed in the 12 months up to September was fully 25,000 in spite of all the propaganda that we were in some way failing in the housing drive.  We maintained that figure of 25,000 houses per year to the end of our period of office. Throughout most of our period in office we exceeded that figure and it ran at 26,000.  The question which the country will ask is: can Fianna Fáil continue this rate of house building which they never achieved in their periods in office?  The highest figure they ever attained, at the end of their period in office after a long slow movement upwards from a desperately low figure in the first six years they were in power, was 21,000.</P>
    <P>This year has been a good year for farmers.  The Taoiseach told us&mdash;I was interested in the figure&mdash;that the volume of gross output would be up 9 per cent.  I find the figure interesting because it is very much higher than the figure recently suggested by the Central Bank of a 5 per cent increase. This means that the Central Bank's estimates of agricultural incomes, involving a 35 per cent increase, must be understand if the volume of output is going to be 4 per cent more than the Central Bank thought.  Then the true increase in farm incomes must be of the order of 40 per cent.  This will give farmers a family farm income this year of £750 million, almost three times the £275 million they had under Fianna Fáil in 1972.  Incidentally, the Taoiseach's attempt later in his speech to suggest that farm incomes have risen less proportionately than other incomes is based on a selected choice of years, omitting the 1977 figures from that calculation although he had spoken of them earlier in his speech. The true comparison to make is between 1972, when Fianna Fáil were last in office, and the current year, and in that period I find that both family farm incomes and total wages and salaries have risen by 270 per cent. Incidentally, taking full account of the consumer price index increase over that period, that means an increase in real incomes in agriculture and the rest of the economy of almost 30 <Col N="1721" /> per cent in those five years, despite the world economic crisis.  I wonder whether any other European country has achieved a comparable increase in real incomes during that crisis.</P>
    <P>To all the Taoiseach has said I would add only one further fact, something to which insufficient attention has been drawn.  It is the fact that in this year we have had an enormous inflow of capital in here, at least in the first eight months&mdash;the figures for the later period are not to hand yet. In that period, which fell almost exclusively into the period of office of the Coalition Government the autonomous private capital inflow which is the best test of international confidence in any economy was £425 million, four times the average of the preceding years.  This is a figure which is exclusive of Government borrowing and which represents the ordinary free flow of funds as people choose where to put their money to get the best return and to keep it safe.  They chose this country on a massive scale during this period.  That is the most remarkable tribute to the performance of the Coalition Government which the Taoiseach summed up so well in his speech.  What words did the Taoiseach use to summate all his remarks on the current year?  He said&mdash;and I thank him for it:</P>
    <P>This is the sort of foundation on which we can build if we manage our affairs properly.</P>
    <P>The words, &ldquo;if we manage our affairs properly&rdquo;, were added very wisely.  I accept that that is where the doubt lies.</P>
    <P>I could have sought no better testimonial from our successors than the Taoiseach provided us with, but the question is: will they manage our affairs properly?  It is the nagging doubt with regard to that which must concern us all.  As a political Opposition it might suit us if the Government failed but as patriotic Irishmen we must hope that, in spite of everything, they succeed.  However, we must have doubts and others have doubts also.  The EEC seem to have some doubts.  In its report on the economic situation of the Community, No. 3 for 1977, published a fortnight ago, the Commission, after saying that the new <Col N="1722" /> Government's policies would mean that the balance of payments would move further into deficit added:</P>
    <P>Under these conditions, economic policy will have to be based primarily on a careful regulation of domestic demand so as to avoid the dangers inherent in over-stimulation of consumption demand. Although it would bring about a temporary improvement in the employment situation, such a development would ultimately necessitate undesirable measures to curb activity.</P>
    <P>That is precisely our fear, a fear so diplomatically expressed by the EEC Commission, and they always express their criticisms in diplomatic language as we know from our period in office. They fear that all the work we did to get the economy moving ahead, and what the Taoiseach has accurately described as a place near the top of the league internationally, may be undone by the consequences of an unscrupulous attempt to deceive and bribe voters to put back into office: Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>I should like to state that achieving this extraordinary economic success described so fully by the Taoiseach was not easy.  Firstly, it had to be done in the face of a reduction of more than two-thirds in the growth rate of the industrialised countries between the pre-crisis years, 1969-1973, and the crisis years, 1974-1976, a reduction in the growth rate from 4.7 to 1.5 per cent.  It had to be achieved also in the face of the collapse of sterling which declined in value by more than one-third in the spring of 1975 and the autumn of 1976, thus pushing up our import prices by one-third in 18 months.  As a country which imports half our needs, that alone involved automatically, discounting any impact it might have on domestic inflation, an inflation rate of 17 per cent over that period of a year-and-a-half.</P>
    <P>How, in the face of these difficulties, in the face of a reduction of one-third of the world's growth rate, in the face of the collapse of sterling in the 18-month period from the spring of 1975 to the autumn of 1976, did the <Col N="1723" /> National Coalition Government achieve the remarkable results described by the Taoiseach in his speech?  First of all, and it is a precondition of success in this area, we created confidence in our ability to control public expenditure which was out of control when we took over.  In our period in office for the first time non-paying expenditure in real terms was held steady for several successive years. That is important because there is a large amount of Government expenditure&mdash;it is not particularly productive except in so far as it employs civil servants to spend it, but it is necessary&mdash; and that cannot be got rid of without disrupting the economy.  Its expansion will not, of course, necessarily achieve either any particular economic improvement or any social improvement, such as an increase in social welfare expenditure.  The fact that we held down this part of Government expenditure and kept it steady for several years, which no previous Government had done, promoted that confidence in our ability to control the economy, a confidence which had previously been lacking.</P>
    <P>Secondly, and most important, our Government secured the confidence of the social partners and, even more important&mdash;and I do not apologise for saying it because it is the fact of the situation&mdash;the confidence of the trade unions.  We did this by pursuing a policy of social justice.  I need not dwell on the record of the gaps left in the system by Fianna Fáil after 16 years.  Neither need I dwell on our efforts to plug those gaps and what we had to do to raise the purchasing power of pensions for widows, the aged and other underprivileged groups from below the subsistence level at which Fianna Fáil had left them. These moves were not only right for their own sake but were an essential part of our commitment to social justice, a commitment which the party opposite so notably lacked.</P>
    <P>But they were also important for our economic future because they made possible the social contract. They made possible agreement on this year's wage round because the confidence <Col N="1724" /> the trade unions had in us as a Government dedicated to social progress was a critical contributory factor when it came to negotiating this wage round and creating the conditions in which a moderate wage round could be negotiated.  Indeed, that wage round, the negotiation of which was achieved because of our commitment to social progress, underlined our commitment by its impact in the trade unions and this has had its effect on competitiveness and provided the key to the extraordinary growth we have seen throughout the current year.</P>
    <P>I must in conscience here warn Fianna Fáil, who seem grossly insensitive on this issue and who can be seen to be so from their manifesto, which is totally devoid of social content, that the failure to do justice and to be seen to do justice to the underprivileged could undo the atmosphere we created which made a moderate wage round possible and made possible the economic growth we have observed.  The tone of the Taoiseach's speech offered no encouragement to the idea that Fianna Fáil in Government again will be any more socially concerned than they were in Government before or in Opposition when they were preparing their manifesto of goodies for the &ldquo;Haves&rdquo;, for those who have cars on which road tax could be remitted, those who have houses on which rates could be abolished, those who have savings to buy a house, savings that can be supplemented&mdash;it is very hard to believe, as it turned out, that the supplement is purely marginal&mdash;and those who have enough income to benefit from remissions.</P>
    <P>Let us note carefully what the Taoiseach said yesterday morning on social welfare, if you can find it.  It is very brief.  It takes up half a page of a 23-page speech.  There are three sentences reciting how many beneficiaries there are and the percentage increase in numbers.  The tone of these sentences leaves one undecided as to whether the Taoiseach in reciting these facts is doing so with neutrality, approval or with an element of disapproval.  These three sentences are followed then by one sentence which says that we must ensure that <Col N="1725" /> expenditure is directed &ldquo;to where it is most needed and can do most good.&rdquo; Is this merely a platitude such as one finds in ministerial speeches, in the best of them, or is it a hidden threat of cutbacks to come?</P>
    <P>Finally, the last sentence in this short paragraph of five sentences devoted to social welfare says it is the intention of the Government to ensure that the value of welfare payments is maintained &ldquo;and where possible to increase those payments especially where there is greatest need&rdquo;.  Note the double qualification&mdash;two wheres.  I have to warn that this type of attitude if it persists will in the experience I had of Government certainly threaten the possibility of agreement with the social partners because our ability to achieve that agreement was based on confidence and trust in us that the benefits of growth would be fairly spread, as we did fairly spread them despite the fact that this led to criticism from the people over whom those resources had to be spread, and they are 75 per cent of the community, the poorer sections of the community. Fianna Fáil may think that by playing to the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and ignoring the underprivileged they can govern successfully.  They certainly cannot govern justly in that way.  Neither can they govern successfully because I do not think the trade unions would be willing to do business on that basis.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with two of the measures we took to get the country moving at the rate at which it has been moving, the creation of confidence in our ability to control public expenditure and our concern for the underprivileged, thereby securing the co-operation of the trade unions.  The third step we took was to introduce major incentives for enterprise, incentives having no parallel in our previous history.  Fianna Fáil in Government over 16 years had raised the maximum tax rate to 80 per cent, hitting people with incomes which, while well above average, are not abnormal for executives, technologists and others with key skills.  We cut the rate marginally first to 77 per cent.  The rate then was, I think, lower than in any other country in Europe and lower than in the <Col N="1726" /> United States of America.  This year then we cut the rate dramatically to 60 per cent leaving these groups with twice as big a share of their incomes over a figure of about £7,000 or £8,000.  That was an important major incentive for people who seemed to feel the need for an incentive, people who, if they are allowed to retain a reasonable proportion of what they earn, will be willing to work harder in the interests of expanding output and increasing employment.</P>
    <P>The second measure we took was designed to help domestic firms which hitherto had not benefited from tax reliefs.  Tax reliefs went to exporters and, most notably, to new foreign firms investing here.  We halved the rate of company tax for those who increased their output and employment, even marginally, over the three years beginning this year.  By these three means we created a climate of confidence with trade unions which gave us a moderate wage round, a wage round of about 7½ to 8 per cent increase in wage rates, negotiated at a time when the inflation rate was still 20 per cent.  This required at the time an act of faith that inflation would come down to well below 10 per cent within a year or, indeed, one could say 7 per cent in the second half of this year.  We inspired that act of faith and a willingness to accept an increase in wage rates far below the rate of inflation in the belief that our Government would succeed in getting inflation down and with the tax remissions the workers would be better off, and we were right.  The Taoiseach has given the figure in his speech.  He says the real incomes of workers this year are up 3½ per cent.  They are up because we succeeded in halving the inflation rate and that, together with tax incentives and the increase in wage rates and earnings, has left workers better off this year.</P>
    <P>At the same time this moderate increase in basic wage rates has given us the dynamic investment described by the Taoiseach, and has given us the unprecedented growth that we have achieved in the face of the slowing down of the entire world economy. Through the effect of this moderate <Col N="1727" /> wage round on the competitiveness of our goods, we secured a massive growth of manufacturing exports in this year &mdash;50 per in the value of manufactured exports for the first nine months which implies a 30 per cent increase in their value.  We also secured a fair share for Irish firms on the home market against competing imports, because Irish firms were competitive and able to compete without losing further ground against imports.  In many cases they gained something.  The result of the massive expansion of exports and the expansion and strengthening of the home market has been booming output, and the spare capacity in industry has been largely used up by the steady growth of industrial output since the end of 1975.  It has meant this year for many workers the end of short-time working, the reintroduction of overtime, and in many cases the reapplication of productivity agreements that had been in abeyance during the crisis.  As a result the increase in workers' earnings has been well beyond the increase in wage rates.  This has ensured for workers the 3½ per cent increase in their living standards to which the Taoiseach referred.  It is the increase in workers' and farmers' purchasing power this year which has boosted home demand by the 4½ per cent figure mentioned by the Taoiseach. This boost to the home demand for goods has helped to increase manufacturing output.  We are launched on a beneficial cycle of growth if only it can be maintained, if only this cycle is not destroyed by unwise action on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>What has the Fianna Fáil manifesto to offer industry to keep up this extra-ordinary growth?  The first thing I find in it is the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign, which is to yield the extra 10,000 jobs. Where is this campaign?  The Taoiseach, as head of the Government, told us, and the House must have been excited to hear, that it is at an advanced stage of consideration after almost six months of Government by a Cabinet which claimed to have a comprehensive and effective programme ready when it came into office.  By &ldquo;at an advanced stage of consideration&rdquo; the Taoiseach may mean that we <Col N="1728" /> may see some modest little effort dropped into the pool, not causing any great splash, sometime next year or may be the following year, or we may never hear of it again.  Of all the ideas in the manifesto this was not the most brilliant, as the Taoiseach can probably see.</P>
    <P>The manifesto also offered a Seán Lemass type of industrial development consortium.  Why drag Seán Lemass into it?  He certainly never undertook anything as half-baked as this.  Seán Lemass tried and failed to turn Government Departments individually into development agencies.  By saying he failed, I am not imputing blame.  It is a difficult task, as I can appreciate, after four-and-a-half years in Government. Seán Lemass never deluded himself or tried to delude anybody else that by bringing nine Departments and agencies together in a committee he would solve Ireland's problems.  No one knew better than Seán Lemass the iron law of public administration, which I trust after I have enunciated it will be called &ldquo;FitzGerald's first, second and third law&rdquo;: it is that the time taken to get anything done increases as the square of the number of Departments and agencies involved in the decision making process.  What one Department might do in a month&mdash;supposing any Department could move that fast&mdash;would be done in four months with two Departments, nine months with three Departments, and 81 months with nine Departments, which is the lifetime of one-and-a-half Governments.  If that means that we will inherit this consortium the next time we get in, we will take very rapid action to replace it with something a little more effective.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1729" /> The manifesto also said that a new export credit finance corporation would be considered.  It does not say they will do anything about it.  We know what &ldquo;considered&rdquo; means, especially when we see how long it has taken Fianna Fáil to implement the things they decided in Opposition, never mind the things they considered in Opposition. Apart from this the manifesto offers so much waffle to industry. There is nothing else of any content in it.  What must concern industry more than the absence of anything concrete or useful is the danger hinted at politely by the EEC Commission: that the Government's programme will overheat the economy by expanding consumer demands instead of stimulating exports and enterprise and will lead to the need to deflate the economy in a year or two.</P>
    <P>We initiated the expansion of jobs first in the industrial sector and then through job creation programmes in the public sector.  In the industrial sector our efforts were so successful that in our last quarter in office the number of industrial jobs increased by 2,500, an annual rate of 10,000 jobs.  The acceleration of industrial employment in this period owes much to our employment incentive scheme.  We also put into effect through the capital programme and through selective increases in current expenditure, to meet situations where new posts were badly needed&mdash;for example, in education and in the health services&mdash;a job creation programme in the public sector providing for 7,000 new jobs in addition to the new jobs to be created through the employment incentive programme, premium employment programme, the youth employment schemes and so on.</P>
    <P>What has happened to these jobs since the 5th July?  I undertook some careful research into this.  I studied the issues of capital to State bodies up to 2nd December.  That is the best indication as to how much of the capital programme we provided for State bodies is being expended.  Secondly, I studied all the Supplementary Estimates and they show that on that part of our special job creation programme, which took the form of capital investment, of £37 million no less than £14 million <Col N="1730" /> of this is not being spent.  That was an extra £37 million on top of the normal budget which itself involved some expansion. In addition £7 million of our normal basic capital programme is not being spent.  Fianna Fáil, allegedly concerned about jobs, have failed to produce any significant visible number of new jobs.  Their best claim for new jobs filled that I can find in the official record of the Dáil is for 1,900 jobs.</P>

      <P>I am entitled to continue without interruption even from the Chair if the time is as short as that.  The best claim of Fianna Fáil is for 1,900 new jobs including 900 allegedly arising from new grants and loans to the building industry.  What about the jobs we provided for?  The Supplementaries for youth training and employment schemes, for which we set aside £1 million, amounted only to £250,000.  Fianna Fáil have not even bothered to ask the Dáil for three-quarters of the sum for youth employment that we provided.  They have also sought less than we provided for the employment incentive scheme and the premium employment scheme. Only £300,000 of £1.5 million extra for Bord na Mona has been issued&mdash; 200 jobs not created.  Less than half of the £2 million extra we provided for public works has been sought&mdash;100 jobs not created.  Only £3.15 million of the extra £6 million for educational <Col N="1731" /> building has been sought under the Supplementary Estimates&mdash;225 jobs down.  Only £130,000 of the £1.1 million which we provided for fishery harbours has been sought&mdash;another 150 jobs down.  In the Taoiseach's own area of the £1.3 million which we provided for the Cork Harbour development scheme only £0.6 million has even been sought from the Dáil&mdash; 150 less jobs.</P>
      <P>The failure to use £21 million of what we set aside for employment creation led to this job shortfall of, as far as I can estimate, 2,500.  But they have not totally sabotaged our job creation programme.  Dáil Questions have revealed that 4,500 jobs in the public sector have been created since 5th July out of moneys provided in the January budget, and 2,000 have been created in the same period under employment schemes financed by that budget.  With 6,500 new jobs created from moneys provided by the National Coalition and with the high rate of employment growth in industry&mdash; 2,500 in the second quarter alone&mdash; why has unemployment not fallen sharply in recent months?  It dropped by 1,000 between July and November. The Taoiseach and Tánaiste may say that this is a period of seasonal increase. Allow for seasonality and what do you get?  A reduction of about 4,000 in unemployment in this period, but that is more than accounted for by the new jobs which, in parliamentary replies, the Government have stated have been created out of the moneys in our budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where then are the Government's jobs?  Why is it that unemployment has not fallen further than that?  What has happened to the Government's crash programme?  Has it crashed before take-off?  The Taoiseach is not very convincing about it.  He talks about creating 600 additional posts for teachers in secondary and vocational schools.  Have the teachers been appointed?  We are told they have authorised 500 more gardaí.  When will they be recruited and trained?  We are told that funds have been authorised for the creation of close to 4,700 jobs in building and construction and more <Col N="1732" /> than 3,500 new posts in the public service.  What does &ldquo;Funds have been authorised&rdquo; mean?  Authorised by whom?  Not by the Dáil in the Supplementaries Estimates.  Does it mean that the Government have been passing pieces of paper backwards and forwards between one another?  Where are the 5,000 new jobs promised to be created by the Government before the end of the year?  If even a fraction of them had ben created, then with the 6,500 jobs which the Government have said in their replies to Parliamentary Questions have been created since 5th July out of moneys provided by our budget, unemployment would not be 107,000 today; it would be down almost to 100,000.  The Government have failed abysmally in the first test they set themselves which was to act quickly to get unemployment down. In the meantime we have had endless speeches, above all from the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, starting to explain away the Government failure.  Sometimes it is the unions who are being warned that they are going to be blamed.  Sometimes it is the world economic situation and sometimes it is the Irish people as a whole.  On 15th September the Minister said that success can come only if the Government's efforts are supported and reinforced by all sections of the community.  We are all going to be blamed when Fianna Fáil promises are not fulfilled.</P>
    <P>I say to Fianna Fáil, &ldquo;Drop the excuses and get on with the job.  Stop sabotaging our job creation programme as you have done by cancelling £21 million of expenditure and leaving 2,500 people out of work who would have been employed had we been in office.  Get on with implementing your own programme in a way which will not sabotage the Irish economy which we have handed over to you in first-class shape&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="The Tánaiste George Colley">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to come back from the never-never land in which we have been entertained in the past three-quarters of an hour during which we were told about this marvellous Government who had got the confidence of investors, of the trade unions and of everybody in <Col N="1733" /> sight.  I do not know how they lost the election.</P>
      <P>In looking at our present and prospective economic policies it is worth-while to consider our economy in the wider international context first.  We are pre-eminently a trading nation. Our exports and our imports together add up to more than our total national output.  We are much more open to international influences than are the major world economies or most of our Community partners.  We all know that Japan lives on trade, but how many of us know that, relatively speaking, we are four times as dependent on trade as the Japanese are?  Therefore it is important that we watch what is happening in the world economy because it has a major bearing on the course of our economy.</P>
      <P>From the various international meetings which I have attended, representing this country, I have been struck by how similar are the economic problems currently facing Governments everywhere.  Unemployment and inflation, which are our major areas of difficulty, are causing concern the world over.  Unemployment, which stands at about 6 million in the EEC and over 16 million in the OECD area, constitutes an enormous challenge and it is clear that there is no easy solution to it.  All sorts of factors have affected what has been happening in recent years, among them recurring bouts of instability in the international monetary system and the greatly increased cost of energy, but one of the major factors has been the uncertain state of economic thinking.  At some of the conferences I have attended, not least at the EEC Ministers for Finance Council where we studied a document issued by the Commission, I discovered the manner in which most economists are now recommending an approach to the problems which are common to all of us, an approach which is remarkably similar to that put forward in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto; indeed, one that was put forward basically in September, 1976, in the Fianna Fáil economic proposals at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The efforts which have been made heretofore in a number of the major <Col N="1734" /> economies of the world have not been sufficient.  Those efforts are being stepped up, but the most we can hope for is that they will merely enable the world economy to hold its position.  We cannot hope in the short term for any real advance in the world economy, and we have been enabled, within the EEC at least, to express our view as to what needs to be done.  Whether we are able to exercise some influence is another matter.  We have expressed our views and will continue to do so where necessary.  I detect change in the climate in this respect and I hope it is for the better.</P>
    <P>It is important to understand that there has been, contrary to the expectations at the beginning of the year and the end of last year, a considerable failure to achieve the targets then set and there has been a set-back in the second half of this year in that regard so far as the world economy is concerned. We are vitally dependent on what happens in that regard.</P>
    <P>One of the major differences between Fianna Fáil and the Coalition is the basic approach to the whole problem of the development of our economy. We regard the tremendous amount of dependence that our economy has on world trade as a compelling reason for doing everything within our power and under our control to improve our position. The greater our dependence on world trade the greater the obligation on an Irish Government to do what they can within their area of control to improve our economy.  I recall only too well my predecessor in the Coalition Government telling us <i>ad nauseam</i> that our economy was like a cork on the ocean with as little control over its destiny as a cork has on the ocean. We do not accept that proposition and we never did.  I want to make it clear that our manifesto was based on the proposition that an Irish Government, with the support of the people, can do a great deal to improve the economy of this country whatever happens to the world economy.  I want to repeat that is one of the fundamental differences of approach between this Government and our predecessors.</P>
    <P>Despite the disimprovement in the situation in the world generally, we <Col N="1735" /> face something of a paradox.  As I said before, the international situation is far from satisfactory.  Yet, even though we are dependent on the world economy, we have managed to do quite well this year.  It looks as if we will achieve the fastest growth rate in the EEC this year by a fairly substantial margin.  This of itself generates confidence and helps further progress.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what Deputy FitzGerald said, this improvement is not due solely, as he said, to the efforts of the Coalition Government in late 1976 and the first half of 1977.  They can claim some credit, I freely admit. The credit they can claim is that, for the first time in their history, the Coalition Government in the budget introduced in 1977 began to pay some attention to what we had been telling them all along.  They gave some impetus, some incentive.  That was the first budget in which they ever did this. All their other budgets&mdash;and they had five, or was it six?&mdash;worked in the opposite direction.  We appealed to them to try to adopt the kind of policy that would create incentive, that would create growth.  They told us we were either economically ignorant or socially unconcerned.</P>
    <P>Whatever reason they ascribe to it, they suddenly had a partial change of heart in January, 1977.  I suppose it is not unreasonable to assume the imminence of the general election might have had something to do with that.  Whatever the reason, it had a good effect.  Part of that good effect is reflected in what we have been saying about the economy this year.  The tragedy is that it was not done so much earlier when it could have been done, and we could have been so much further along the road out of the depression in which we had to exist.</P>

      <P>Part of the reason why our growth performance this year will be as good as it will be, is that this Government acted energetically to implement our manifesto from the day we came into office.  I have in mind such things as the abolition of road tax, the improved scheme for house loans and grants, and the many measures we have already taken to create employment.  Weekly there is growing evidence of the beneficial impact of these measures and of the general economic upswing which is taking place, and the effect that is having on the level of unemployment.</P>
      <P>The steps we have already taken are proof that the manifesto will be implemented in full.  Any sensible economic policy is a set of related measures.  If you change one you must affect the other.  Our manifesto is such a package.  Contrary to what has been alleged in this debate, we said so when we issued our manifesto.  We said it all through the election.  I know Coalition speakers would dearly love to claim an alibi for their resounding defeat in the election.  The alibi is that the manifesto consisted of bribes and goodies for the electorate.  That is the alibi.  What is the truth?</P>
      <P>The truth is that the manifesto is a package which has attractive features but which also clearly spelled out items of restraint in regard to incomes and public expenditure.  We were attacked during the course of the election campaign on these very issues.  We were asked how we would enforce them. Would we bring in legislation to control wages?  What would we do about the borrowing requirements?  We were attacked right, left and centre on all of this.  It is no good pretending now the people did not know these were features of our manifesto.  We said consistently that it was a package and that it had to be an integrated programme if it was to work.  Whatever alibi the Coalition want for losing the election, let them not propagate that myth which suggests the Irish people were so gullible that they fell for what they wanted to hear and ignored the rest.  That is not the truth.</P>

      <P>The progress made this year on growth and employment is most welcome.  Inflation is an area in which considerable results have also been achieved, results which, from the viewpoint of the economy in the longer term, may be even more significant. Curbing inflation and thereby improving Ireland's competitive position internationally is a central aim of the Government's economic strategy.  It is designed to secure sustained high growth in output and employment. There is already firm evidence that, in the short period since we took office, real progress has been made towards getting our rate of inflation down to an acceptable level.</P>
      <P>Figures published today show that, in the six months up to mid-November, consumer prices rose by less than 3 per cent compared with about 8 per cent in the previous six months.  This improvement reflects the direct action taken by the Government.  While one must be cautious, of course, in interpreting short term trends, I am confident these figures provide a definite indication that the underlying trend in inflation is a favourable one.  Clearly the economy is evolving along the lines we envisaged in our manifesto.</P>
      <P>There is, therefore, as the Taoiseach indicated, a solid foundation on which to build a prosperous future for our people.  A good beginning such as we are now seeing is crucial, but a lasting improvement in our economic fortunes depends on our future actions as a community.  Foremost among these is our approach to incomes.  A sensible and socially conscious attitude in this area is imperative if the advances made in recent months are to be consolidated and improved upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By now the community at large have appreciated the futile and destructive nature of excessive income increases which drive up prices and leave us vulnerable to our competitors at home and abroad.  They see the benefits which are beginning to result from a degree of moderation.  Putting it in more colloquial terms, people realise payment in confetti money is no good to them.  What is of crucial importance to them is the real value of their take-home pay.  Many people have <Col N="1738" /> begun to see that the size of a wage increase does not necessarily bear any relation to the real value of one's take-home pay.</P>
    <P>It will be clear, not only from our pre-election manifesto but from all we have said and done since then, that this Government regard continued income restraint as absolutely essential to success in the fight against employment and inflation.  This is why we have been prepared to offer such a large package of tax concessions and job creation expenditure in exchange. As has been said, it is a package which, taken in its entirety, gives significant real increases to workers. Such a package is possible only in the context of moderate pay increases.  The community cannot let itself be deprived of the opportunities now before it.  Still less can it let itself be pushed back into the recession from which we are just struggling free.  The Government are determined to take all steps necessary to ensure that such a tragedy does not occur.  It is a matter of such overriding national importance that the Government feel entitled to call on the full co-operation of all concerned.</P>
    <P>I am perhaps not surprised but somewhat disappointed that the Leader of the Labour Party should have seen fit to try to make political capital during this debate out of the tragedy of Ferenka.  The circumstances surrounding the closure of that under-taking have already been fully debated in this House on the 6th and 7th of this month.  During that debate the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and the Minister for Labour gave full and detailed accounts of their actions in this matter.  It must be clear to all Members that every action which could possibly be taken was taken by both Ministers to solve that dispute and to prevent the closure of the factory.  Deputies are aware that the final decision to close the plant was taken outside this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey is very much mistaken if he thinks he can convince the people that the responsibility for that tragedy lies at the door of this Government. Whatever other arguments there may be as to where the responsibility <Col N="1739" /> lies, few people will accept the proposition that it lies on this Government.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of Opposition speakers, including Deputy FitzGerald, who tried to put forward the proposition that this Government inherited a booming economy.  In particular they claimed that the encouraging economic performance of 1977 was due to the policies pursued by the previous Government.  It has been suggested that the prospective outturn at this stage is no better than that forcast by members of that Government during their term of office.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald gave us the comparative figures for increases in farm incomes from 1972 to 1977 in a context which seemed to suggest that this was due to the Coalition Government. Of all people he should be the last to suggest that the EEC had no influence in this regard.  I will not pursue that any further.  The general theme he put forward was also put forward by Deputy Barry and Deputy Cluskey.  Deputy Barry said that they could with confidence during the election predict that our economic growth for 1977 would be in the region of 5 or 6 per cent.  Deputy Cluskey said it was predicted by totally impartial international economic observers that our growth would be approximately 5 per cent because of the decisions made in the January budget.  He went on to say that this was still the predicted growth &mdash;5 to 6 per cent.  He said the predicted rate of inflation would be approximately 13 per cent and Deputy Barry said 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, Deputy FitzGerald waxed eloquent about the tremendous job that had been done by the previous Government.  He said they had, by the policies they had pursued, particularly in the late 1976 and the first half of 1977, obtained the confidence of investors, and therefore there had been an increase in investment, and that they had obtained the confidence of the social partners and particularly of the trade unions.  I would like to put a simple question.  If the Coalition had obtained the confidence of the trade unions, why did <Col N="1740" /> approximately five out of six trade unionists vote for Fianna Fáil in the last election?  There is something wrong with that logic somewhere.</P>

      <P>No, he would not like that.  I do not want to embarrass him by bringing out the real underlying figures in the election and in the recent public opinion polls.  He knows the majority of trade unionists voted for Fianna Fáil.  If they did, how can he tell us in this House that the Coalition Government had the confidence of the trade unions?  He knows there is no truth in that statement.  The whole thing is merely a window dressing exercise to try to pretend that any good thing that has happened since Fianna Fáil came into office is due to the Coalition.</P>
      <P>Let us have a more realistic approach.  I have suggested that the Coalition are entitled to claim some credit because of what was done in the 1977 budget.  We said that at the time but we said they did not go far enough.  One thing is clear so far as the people are concerned.  They had made up their minds.  They had seen the various budgets of the Coalition. Whatever was done in 1977 they did not believe the Coalition were represented in their general stance by that budget because they knew what had been done consistently before that.</P>
      <P>Talking of the achievements of the Coalition, whatever happened to that prophecy by Deputy FitzGerald during the election that by mid-1977 unemployment would be below 100,000?</P>

      <P>I can understand Deputy Harte's and Deputy FitzGerald's concern.  We restrained ourselves listening to Deputy FitzGerald making some silly statements.  Perhaps the Deputies could try a little of the same kind of restraint.</P>
      <P>On the topic of underspending on the Coalition's job creation programme in the 1977 budget, does Deputy FitzGerald remember the end of June this year?  There was a job creation programme by the Coalition at that time, between the election and the change of Government.  There is a Parliamentary Question down today giving some details of it.  I wonder does he know that at the end of June, while he was in office and while he and his colleagues were engaged in the special job creation programme for their friends, that the Department of Finance carried out a review of the job creation package announced in the 1977 budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What did they find, as indeed I found, when I came into office approximately a week later?  There was gross underspending on various headings of that programme.  I was appalled when I discovered this.  I tried to find out why this was happening.  All sorts of reasons were given but eventually the truth is emerging.  The package announced in the January, 1977, budget was to a considerable extent simply a question of picking out a scheme <Col N="1742" /> here and a scheme there to give an impression of a job creation packet. Many of the schemes had not been thought out.  There was no possibility of implementing them.  No machinery had been provided.</P>
    <P>I am talking of a review which took place while Deputy FitzGerald was in office.  I could talk about reviews which took place while we were in office but he would say we cooked the books.  Perhaps he would care to explain to the public the underspending which had taken place almost six months later while he and his colleagues were in Government.  When he has explained that, he can then start asking us questions about his alleged job creation programme.  I would prefer to concentrate on our job creation programme which is working.  As far as we are concerned the programme is going as planned.  Of course the major impact cannot take place in five months.  To listen to some of the Coalition Deputies one would think we had promised to implement our manifesto in full by the end of 1977. Of course there is no truth whatever in that allegation and the public know it and they do not think any more highly of the Opposition when they make such silly forecasts.</P>

      <P>There is much more hope for the unemployed under this Government than in the illusory programme <Col N="1743" /> produced in the budget last January.  Perhaps Deputy FitzGerald would explain some time why his Government were underspending?</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry said he supposed we should be thankful that someone of financial realism behind the scenes was intervening to ensure that the promises in the manifesto were not being implemented and Deputy Cluskey said there is no way that the promises could be delivered.  I want to make it quite clear that the manifesto proposals are, and will be, implemented fully.  As I have indicated, a far-reaching programme of this kind will not be implemented fully in five months but there is ample evidence that this Government are pursuing with all possible speed the implementation of their manifesto and within the timetable laid down in it.  Suggestions to the contrary bear no relation to the facts. No real attempt has been made to justify these suggestions; rather we have been subjected to sweeping and unfounded generalisations by the Opposition.</P>
      <P>In talking about the abolition of rates Deputy Barry told us there was a blanket increase of 11 per cent to local authorities.  I do not think he has understood the situation clearly.  To make it quite clear, I want to put on record that the average increase in money that local authorities will receive in lieu of rates on private houses is 14 per cent.  Some authorities will receive less but none will receive less than 11 per cent and areas encountering rapid growth will receive more because of the increased valuation base. It is important to put that correctly on record.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry said: &ldquo;For instance, the £1,000 flat grant for new houses becomes £1,000 for first-time buyers&rdquo;. He tried to indicate that we were going back on our promises in the manifesto. What does the manifesto say?  I shall quote from page 27&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We did not promise what Deputy Barry said we promised: we promised what is in the manifesto and we did it. In a reference to the £1,000 grant Deputy Cluskey used the words &ldquo;illusory as it is in some cases&rdquo;.  Does the Deputy realise that the former grants were subject to a means test of £2,350 per annum?  The £1,000 grant is not subject to a means test and, therefore, many thousands of potential house buyers who were excluded under the Coalition scheme are now able to avail of the new grants given as promised in our manifesto.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Opposition speakers have claimed that the outturn for this year is exactly as they said would happen.  When they were in office the previous Government consistently forecast a growth rate of 4 per cent on the basis of their actual policy. It is true that during the election campaign they produced higher figures but presumably those higher figures were based on what they then said they would do; in other words, new policies and expenditure to add to their existing policies.  Up to that time their forecast was 4 per cent.  Even though the international economic climate&mdash;a factor that will influence Irish growth forecasts quite substantially&mdash;has deteriorated since the middle of the year, growth in now expected to be about 5 per cent, a figure that is significantly in excess of the Coalition's expectations when in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to inflation, I notice Deputy FitzGerald was trying to claim all the credit for what has happened. The significant position is that in the six months to mid-May of this year <Col N="1745" /> the Consumer Price Index rose by nearly 8 per cent but in the following six months it rose by less than 3 per cent.  I would not claim, and I do not want to be taken as claiming, that all of that improvement is due to the fact that Fianna Fáil are in office.  That is the kind of claim that would be made by the Coalition.  However, I am saying that a significant factor has been the specific action by the Government and the climate of confidence that has been engendered since the election. These factors go a long way towards improving the rate of investment and helping to keep down price applications because there is confidence that it is no longer necessary to keep hiking up prices in order to keep up.  There is confidence that there will be a degree of stability under this Government, a confidence that was totally non-existent when the previous Government were in office.</P>
    <P>Many of the Opposition speakers have been telling us that they are responsible for all that has been happening in the second half of this year. It might be interesting to contrast that with the performance of the Coalition when they were six months in office. In 1973 the Coalition introduced a budget that began to bite in the second half of the year.  The figures for 1973 taken as a whole are very good but the underlying economic indicators show that almost entirely they had a sharp downturn in the second half of 1973 with the result that the growth achieved in the first half of 1973 was the highest on record.  Let us compare that situation when there was a downturn in the economy in the first six months when the Coalition were in office with the upturn in the economy in the first five or six months of Fianna Fáil's term of office and we get some idea of the way the trends are going.  I am speaking of factors under the control of the two Governments&mdash; not international factors which, to a very limited extent, have affected either situation.  So far as they have affected it, they have affected the second half of this year negatively rather than positively.</P>
    <P>The overall message that has emerged from this debate is that things <Col N="1746" /> are shaping up well.  They will get a lot better provided Fianna Fáil continue on the course outlined in the manifesto, the course they put before the people and for which they got a mandate.  We have no reason to deviate from that course and I do not think the Coalition expect us to deviate from it.  That is the basis for their concern, for their scramble to try to claim credit for anything good that has happened and to predict doom and gloom for the future.  I am glad to say our people are not of that view.  It is important that our people continue to have confidence in the Government and be willing to co-operate in the policies put before them.</P>
    <P>I believe that this Adjournment debate has highlighted the shortcomings of the Opposition in this Dáil.  They are clearly out of touch with the new mood of this country, they are living in the past, and, in their contributions to this debate, have been at pains to defend their performance while in Government.  Indeed the speech made here yesterday by Deputy Cluskey, the Leader of the Labour Party, was a good case in point.  It was, in many ways, a very sad speech.  The thinking and philosophy behind Deputy Cluskey's contribution demonstrated the extent to which the Labour Party have submerged their aspirations and identity.  There were, of course, some ritual genuflections to the traditional Labour view.  But there was an underlying acceptance of the timid, conservative view of life which characterises Fine Gael.  No amount of attempted image-building by Deputy FitzGerald will change it because, when he comes in here and gets down to brass tacks, we find he wants to restrict us, that he does not want the kind of growth we are going for.  He is basically a Fine Gael man; I suppose he should regard that as a compliment since he is the Leader of that party, but it is not a compliment to Deputy Cluskey to find that he is going along with that view.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey accused us of cynicism, of recklessness, all of this because we dare to aim high.  Granted, there is a saving clause here and there in what Deputy Cluskey said, in contending <Col N="1747" /> that our aim was unattainable because, he says, we are not adopting a quasi-socialist approach; he put that in a few times.  However, what comes through clearly from Deputy Cluskey's speech is a sense of hopelessness, a feeling that it is an impertinent presumption for anyone to assume that we in this country can achieve prosperity and full employment.  Let Deputy Cluskey read his speech again when he will find this note running through it, and he will regret that he made it.</P>
    <P>What is the message from Deputy Cluskey to the youth of this country? I could understand it had Deputy Cluskey come in here and told us our targets were too low, that we should be aiming at more ambitious goals. But the burden of his speech was that the objectives set out in our manifesto are unrealistic and unattainable.  He talked about planning and the need for a planned approach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred earlier to the new mood in this country.  The Fianna Fáil manifesto expresses that mood.  I believe that June, 1977, in future years. will be seen as a watershed in our political and economic affairs.  The Fianna Fáil manifesto is the charter for progress.  Its overwhelming endorsement at the general election represented a conscious decision by our people to embark on a new and ambitious course.  Our people, and young people in particular, <Col N="1748" /> are no longer content to see us limping along in the second division.  They have rejected the old fatalistic view that this small country must always have high unemployment, that emigration is an inevitable fact of life, or that we are doing well if we achieve slight improvements from year to year.  Other small nations are able to employ their people at home.  They can maintain healthy economies and decent living standards.  Fianna Fáil believe that our people have the capacity to achieve these things and to build a worthy society here.  That is the difference between us and the Opposition parties.  The objectives in our manifesto certainly concern economics but, above all, they concern a matter of will.  To achieve these objectives we, as a people, must stretch our efforts and I believe our people will rise to this challenge.</P>
    <P>Opposition speakers have said they will keep reminding us of our manifesto commitments.  We will welcome that.  In the months ahead the Opposition will find that this will be a frustrating and unrewarding task from a political point of view.  But they need not fret themselves; we will be our own hardest task masters in monitoring our progress.</P>
    <P>I want to state categorically that we in this party and Government will not settle for limited objectives.  The plan for national reconstruction, in our election manifesto, is the first stage of a comprehensive programme which aims at building an economy here that will absorb and fully employ our growing population.  We regard this growth in population as a source of strength and a positive asset in furthering our economic and social well-being.</P>

      <P>We want to build a society which will provide good living standards, a healthy and sane environment and conditions which will be more attractive to our young people than anything they would find abroad. Our programme aims at cutting unemployment dramatically in a relatively short period of time.  But the real goal is full employment and an end once and for all to involuntary emigration. <Col N="1749" /> We do not have to be told that these objectives will not be easily attained but we are saying they can be attained and Fianna Fáil is in business to attain them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our first budget, which will be introduced on 1st February next, will aim at bringing about a transformation in the economic climate.  It will aim at generating a level of growth and development greater than anything achieved to date.  The theme of the budget&mdash;generous tax reliefs linked with moderate income increases&mdash;will set the pattern for a sustained assault on the twin evils of unemployment and inflation.  We fought and won this year's election in the firm belief that, with the right leadership, our people &mdash;through a concerted and combined effort&mdash;can overcome the chronic ills which have plagued our country for so long.  I cannot over-stress the importance of a united and concerted effort in this context.  I do not think the people who sent us here will be particularly impressed by points scored in a debate.  They want us to address ourselves <Col N="1750" /> to eliminating, once and for all the chronic shortcomings in our society.</P>
    <P>There is a tide in the affairs of nations as there is in the affairs of men.</P>
    <P>We now have an opportunity of achieving greater progress economically and socially than was ever achieved in this country in the past.  An enlightened and self-disciplined approach to incomes is vital.  Let us be quite clear about this: claims for income increases which would impair our competitiveness abroad could sabotage the rightful hopes of our young people to employment at home.  In pushing through this programme&mdash;which will change the face of this country and brighten the prospects for our youth&mdash; I am appealing not so much for sacrifice from the various sectional interests but for enlightened self-control while achieving a real improvement in living standards next year.</P>

      <P>At its meeting on 24th November, 1977, the Standing Committee on Employment discussed a Commission communication on youth employment.  This communication outlined suggestions for new subsidies for job creation in industry and for certain employment programmes in the public sector, strengthening of Community aid for post-school training for young people, and assisting the development of national institutions responsible for labour market management with encouragement and support from the Community.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware the function of the Standing Committee on Employment is to ensure continuing dialogue and consultation between the representatives of the Governments of member states, the Commission and bodies representative of workers and employers in order to facilitate co-ordination by the member states of their employment policies in harmony with the objectives of the Community. The committee have no executive function.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the Commission will submit formal proposals early in 1978 to the Council of Ministers for Community action in relation to youth employment and that the discussions at the standing committee meeting of 24th November will be taken into account in the formulation of these proposals.</P>

      <P>Under our collective bargaining procedures any changes in overtime arrangements would be a matter for negotiation between trade unions and employers.  Reports which I have seen on the situation in particular enterprises indicate that the relationship between a reduction in hours worked and increased job opportunities cannot be examined in isolation from other factors, such as the economic working of the enterprise and its capacity to meet demand and thus safeguard the jobs of those employed in it.  I am however continuing to study the matter and I plan to include it in discussion with trade unions and employers in due course.</P>
      <P>In the present difficult employment situation, I would however hope that when a choice arises between overtime and increased employment, the decision taken would if possible be to increase employment.  A number of the measures introduced to aid youth employment would encourage such a decision.  As an example, I might mention the employment incentive scheme which offers an immediate advantage to an employer who recruits additional youths&mdash;possibly as a consequence of curtailing overtime. The premium for young people was, incidentally, increased recently from £10 to £14 a week.</P>

      <P>Ireland is benefiting from the European Social Fund to a considerable extent for schemes relating to <Col N="1674" /> the training of young persons.  To date, grants amounting to £2.2 million have been approved in respect of 1977 operations under a specific category of fund aid for young people which gives priority to those seeking employment for the first time.  It is expected that further grants amounting to £2.0 million in this category will be approved for 1977 operations.  In addition, a number of other training programmes financed under other areas of fund intervention, which include large numbers of young persons, have been approved for assistance from the fund.</P>
      <P>Up to now no EEC funding has been available for measures to promote youth employment other than vocational training measures and certain limited pilot projects on preemployment preparation of young people.  However, at its meeting on 28th October last, the Council of Ministers asked the Commission to submit proposals for a new form of aid for the promotion of employment and centering on young people.  I will be pressing strongly for the urgent adoption by the Council of Ministers of such an aid and for the provision of the additional resources necessary to finance the new aid.</P>

      <P>Under the Industrial Relations Act, 1969, a rights commissioner's function is to investigate a trade dispute provided that (i) a party to it does not object in writing to such an investigation; (ii) it is not a dispute connected with rates of pay, hours or times of work, or annual holidays, of a body of workers; (iii) it is not a dispute involving persons who have not access to the Labour Court for the purpose of a trade dispute; (iv) the Labour Court has not already made a recommendation about the same dispute.</P>

    <P>In the event of an employer objecting to a rights commissioner's investigation of a dispute the commissioner is precluded from taking any further action in the matter.  It is however open to the worker or his trade union to request the Labour Court to investigate the case.  This avenue of redress requires the worker or his trade union to undertake in advance to be bound by the recommendation of the court. <Col N="1676" /> The voluntary nature of the service is regarded as one of the factors which has contributed to its success.</P>
    <P>Under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, a rights commissioner may, with the consent of the parties concerned, investigate a dispute involving a dismissal. In the event of the employer objecting to an investigation by a commissioner, the worker may automatically refer his case to the employment appeals tribunal.  If the tribunal finds in favour of the worker and the employer fails to carry out the terms of the determination of the tribunal, I am empowered under the Act to carry on proceedings in the Circuit Court on behalf of the employee.</P>

      <P>I do not consider that I should do more than quote the terms of this rule which has been included in the code of Rules for National Schools for many years.  They are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>9 (3) No political meeting may be held nor may any political business be transacted in schools, whether vested or non-vested, except as provided in sections (1) and (2) of this rule, and no meeting in connection with a local election may be held therein.</P>
      <P>Sections (1) and (2) read as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) At a contested Dáil Election or Presidential Election or Local Election or at a Referendum, any room in a school may be requisitioned by the appropriate Returning Officer for such election, free of charge, for the purpose of taking the poll.</P>
      <P>(2)  A school-room may also be used for public meetings at reasonable times outside school hours by candidates at an election of member of Dáil Éireann between the issue of the writ and the day of the poll under the provisions of Section 30 of the Electoral Act 1923 (see Schedule III).</P>

      <P>The decision to close the Convent of Mercy Girls' secondary school in Borrisoleigh was taken entirely by the Sisters of Mercy themselves and I do not consider that it would be proper for me to interfere with their freedom of action in the matter.  My Department is at present considering the question of the most appropriate arrangements to be made for the provision of girls' second-level education in the area.  Each situation arising from the withdrawal of a Religious Order from second-level education in an area has to be considered individually and the primary consideration in all cases must be the educational interests of the pupils concerned.</P>

      <P>The report known as the <i>Humphrey's Report</i> was furnished in April, 1971, by the consultant appointed by the Minister for Education to advise him in relation to the National Library.  It was not envisaged at any time that the report would be published and it is not intended to publish it at this stage. Action has been taken in many respects since the receipt of the report and in the specific matter of storage space the position is as follows.  Material has been transferred to the additional accommodation acquired at the rear of the former Kildare Street Club premises, at I and 1a Leinster Lane and to the recently built-book repository at Santry in which an eighth share of the accommodation was provided for the use of the National Library.</P>

      <P>Although I have no function in this matter, my Department has been keeping in close touch with the situation.</P>
      <P>This case originated with a claim for a salary increase which was made in 1974 by senior instructor dental technicians at the Dublin Dental Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case was processed through the Labour Court and there were two hearings in May and September, 1975.  The Court issued its findings on 31st December, 1975 and these findings <Col N="1682" /> have been implemented.  During the discussions before the Labour Court it was stated that the senior instructor dental technicians do not teach in excess of 50 per cent of their working time.</P>
    <P>In autumn, 1977, there was an increased intake of students at the Dublin Dental Hospital and some of the senior instructor dental technicians were rostered to teach in excess of 50 per cent of their time.  The terms of appointment of the senior instructor dental technicians indicate that their duties, under the head of department, &ldquo;shall include the teaching of students&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The senior instructor dental technicians, through their union, objected to being time-tabled to teach in excess of 50 per cent of working time, on the grounds that this constituted a change in working conditions for which there must be recompense, and the union instructed its members not to teach in excess of 50 per cent of their working time.</P>
    <P>The board of the Dublin Dental Hospital and both the Departments of Education and the Public Service consider that the matter should be referred back to the Labour Court.  The union has refused to resume teaching as rostered, pending Labour Court proceedings, unless the basis of referral is a joint statement agreed by the board of the hospital and by the union.</P>
    <P>A draft statement was prepared by the board of the hospital and referred to the union on 1st December, 1977. No response has been received from the union.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of the comments attributed to the managing director of Seafield Gentex Limited that the Minister has given information to the Dáil which was &ldquo;significantly incorrect&rdquo;; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to comments in an article in <i>Business and Finance</i> of 10th November, 1977. I do not accept that in answer to a question tabled by Deputy Donegan on 12th October last I gave the Dáil information which was &ldquo;significantly incorrect&rdquo; or indeed in any way incorrect in regard to the affairs of Castleguard Textiles Limited or Seafield Gentex Limited.  The Deputy will recollect that in answer to a more comprehensive question by him on 24th November on the same subject, I provided fuller details in regard to the loans provided to this group by Fóir Teoranta.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance why a loan of £450,000 intended for Castleguard Textiles Limited, was paid by Fóir Teoranta to Seafield Gentex Limited; why this amount was not subsequently paid over to Castleguard; and the steps he intends to take to recover the money from Seafield Gentex.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that while the loan from <Col N="1687" /> Fóir Teoranta referred to by the Deputy was intended to meet urgent financial requirements directly arising out of the serious losses being incurred by Castleguard Textiles Limited it was sought by the parent company, Seafield Gentex Limited, and issued to that company.  As regards the second part of the question I am unable to say whether or to what extent the loan moneys were subsequently paid directly to Castleguard by its parent company.  I am informed, however, that these funds were used to reduce the level of indebtedness of the Seafield Gentex group of companies which had significantly and critically increased as a direct consequence of the drain on the group's liquid resources arising from the losses being incurred at Castleguard.</P>
      <P>In relation to the recovery of the money the position is that the loan agreement has been entered into by Seafield Gentex and that company remains liable to repay the loan to Fóir Teoranta.</P>

Fóir Teoranta were, however, unable to accede to the representations as they are precluded by law from disposing of their funds for such a purpose.  I regret, furthermore, that there are no funds at my disposal from which such payments could be made.</P>

      <P>The information sought is set out in a tabular statement which, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate for inclusion in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>(A)  <i>Building and Construction</i>&mdash; 906 <i>jobs.</i></P>
      <P>Eight hundred and sixty-six jobs are in respect of road works, public water supply and sewerage schemes, local improvement schemes and certain other environmental protection works undertaken under the aegis of the Department of the Environment.  The remaining 40 jobs arise from minor improvement works undertaken at vocational schools under the aegis of the Department of Education at widely dispersed locations throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 866 jobs filled to end-September, 1977, in respect of schemes approved by the Department of the <Col N="1689" /> Environment represent 570 direct on-site jobs and an estimated spin-off employment of 296 jobs created in ancillary industries.  With regard to the geographical spread of these jobs, figures are available by reference to the function areas of local authorities <Col N="1690" /> but there are no figures available for the location of the estimated spin-off employment.</P>
    <P>Following is the breakdown by local authority area of on-site jobs filled:</P>

      <P>A claim to disability benefit was not made by the person concerned in July, 1977.  Medical certificates showing incapacity for work from July, 1977, in respect of him were received in my Department on 7th November, 1977.  The Social Welfare (Claims and Payments) Regulations, 1952, provide that where notice of incapacity is not given within seven days after commencement, the claimant shall be disqualified for receiving benefit in respect of any period more than seven days before the date on which the notice is given unless there was good cause for the delay in giving notice of incapacity, in which case benefit may be paid for a period not exceeding six months prior to the date of notification.</P>
      <P>The claimant in this case did not at the time explain the reason for the late submission of the medical certificates. Payment of benefit was, accordingly, withheld and he was asked to say why they had not been forwarded in time. The explanation since received has been accepted and all disability benefit due to him has now been paid.</P>

The Deputy will also be aware that in October last I indicated in a press release that the commission were examining retailers' margins on beef, mutton and lamb and I requested meat retailers not to increase their prices for these commodities pending the completion of the commission's investigation. I am informed that this investigation has now been completed and I am awaiting the commission's recommendation in the matter.  An examination by the commission of the margins on dried fruit is also in its final stages.</P>
