      <P>I want to make a personal explanation about a question I replied to last week.  Deputy Cluskey raised the question of the British Government allowing the British £ to float and asked whether we were consulted in advance.  I quote from column 180 of the Official Report of 3rd November where Deputy Cluskey is reported as asking:</P>
      <P>Perhaps it would be appropriate at this point to ask the Taoiseach whether the British Government consulted the Irish Government before announcing the decision to float the £.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach: No.</P>
      <P>Mr. Cluskey: Our Government, then, were not informed of that decision?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach: We are never informed in matters of that nature.</P>
      <P>As I indicated, the question was raised without notice and I checked afterwards to see if what I had answered was, in fact, the case.  We are, I believe, informed of matters of that nature but a matter of hours before the announcement is made by the British authorities.  We are never consulted. I want to make that point clear.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 33:</P>
    <P>In page 17, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(6) A patient's medical record shall be made available to the committee only with the consent of the patient, or of his parents, or of his next of kin, or of his legal guardian&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Minister said I was putting up a very good case against my amendment but unless the Minister is prepared to include in the Bill a section stating that all meetings of the Fitness to Practise Committee are privileged it will be necessary to have such an amendment because a doctor would leave himself wide open to being involved in litigation with a patient.  When I mentioned a specific case by way of illustration, I mentioned it as part of a clinical record and not necessarily the entire clinical record.  There was an instance in Britain where a doctor, without the consent of the patient, a young girl, confided to her parents the condition from which she was suffering.  He found himself brought before the General Medical Council on the matter.  The Minister himself and the Department might consider providing that all meetings of the Fitness to Practise Committee would be privileged and that any information disclosed to such a committee would be privileged.  That would be a better answer and would relieve the doctor of the risk of serious litigation. If the Minister would consider that it would be a great help.  I think the Minister knows exactly what I mean.  I am not trying to make it difficult for the Minister or the Department but they may produce an answer along the lines I suggest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can go some way to meet the Deputy. First, all these proceedings would be absolutely privileged.  Section 46 states:</P>
      <P>Proceedings under section 39 of this Act, reports made by the Fitness to Practise Committee to the Council under this part of this Act and any other communications between the Committee and the Council made in the exercise or performance of the powers, duties or functions of the Committee or the Council, as the case may be, shall in any action for defamation, be absolutely privileged.</P>
      <P>I would be prepared to go further and suggest that if the Deputy would withdraw his amendment I would introduce an amendment on Report Stage but it will have to be very carefully drafted.  The idea would be that a patient's medical record would not be made available to any inquiry by the Fitness to Practise Committee without his consent unless the production of the record is demanded by the committee under section 39 (5) (b).  The Deputy will see what I am getting at. This would ensure that a doctor could not voluntarily produce the records. He could only produce them if they were demanded by the Fitness to Practise Committee: of course, he can produce them at any time with the consent of the patient but if that is not forthcoming he could only produce them if compelled to do so by the committee under section 39 (5) (b) and in that case they would be absolutely privileged.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 17, after line 52, to add a new subsection as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(8) The Medical Council shall publish a set of guidelines outlining in detail the offences for which a medical practitioner can be brought before the Fitness to Practise Committee and the procedures through <Col N="484" /> which the public can bring a complaint to this committee&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I believe there is need for the Medical Council to publish a set of guidelines and in doing so to be more explicit about the various offences for which a medical practitioner can be arraigned before the Fitness to Practise Committee. One might say that a doctor is an educated person, fully experienced in life, and should know what constitutes good professional behaviour but some of the guidelines that were published previously by the Medical Registration Council were not very explicit as to what constituted professional behaviour.  It would be a good idea if guidelines were published not only for the edification of the doctors but also for the public.  Guidelines are all the more necessary because from now on a doctor may not only have his name erased; he can be disciplined, warned and advised about his professional behaviour, so he will need a set of guidelines so as to know what constitutes unprofessional behaviour in relation to neglect of patients and so on.  Previously, doctors received a set of guidelines perhaps when they qualified and they were unlikely to read them more than once.  This set of guidelines should be sent to doctors at regular intervals and it should also be made available to the public. Members of the public do not realise the various offences for which a doctor can be brought before the Committee. In this case there will be need for such a set of guidelines to be published in the public interest and in the interests of practising doctors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal of substance in the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Connell and it is a matter of some importance.  It raises some fundamental questions.  In relation to the last aspect of this question mentioned by Deputy O'Connell, in section 62 (2) it is stated that:</P>
      <P>It shall be a function of the Council to give guidelines to the medical profession generally on all matters relating to ethical conduct and behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That aspect is taken care of.  It will <Col N="485" /> be a function of the council to lay down guidelines as to professional conduct and behaviour.  I agree with Deputy O'Connell that this is very important and is perhaps becoming increasingly important because there are so many developments now in modern medicine that it is vital that practising doctors have the best possible advice available to them on the various issues that arise, moral as well as medical issues.</P>
    <P>We will have to be judicious in the matter of the lodging of complaints with the council or with the Fitness to Practise Committee.  We have to decide whether we will trust this council to do its work fairly and impartially and to serve the public interest as well as protecting the legitimate interests of the profession.  That is the dilemma that will present itself to the council&mdash;to protect the public and at the same time protect the profession and professional standards.  No matter what guidelines are laid down in the end it will all come back to whether or not this council will be the sort of council we want it to be and whether it will perform its functions impartially, objectively and judiciously. For the council to try to outline the sort of offences that a doctor might commit and for which he might be brought before the Fitness to Practise Committee would not be a wise procedure. The very publication of such a document would give rise to all sorts of disputes as to whether or not a matter complained of came within the terms of the guidelines.  What Deputy Dr. O'Connell would be doing, if we accepted his amendment, would be restricting the freedom of the general public, although his intention is to try to help the general public.  The very fact of a set of guidelines being published would almost certainly inevitably mean that on some occasions something would be left out or some matter would arise which would not come within the terms of the guidelines. It is much better to leave it open and to leave the general public free to raise with the council and with the committee anything that it feels should be brought to their notice without any restriction and then leave it to the judicial function of the council or the <Col N="486" /> committee to decide whether or not a genuine legitimate cause of complaint exists.  That would be my approach in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to say the same thing about the suggestion about the manner in which complaints brought to the notice of the council or the committee should be defined.  This would restrict the rights of the general public and the individual who had a complaint. The less formality in this area the better.  The simpler it will be for an individual to bring a complaint before the council and the committee the better.  One would visualise that a simple letter written to the registrar would normally be enough to activate the process.</P>
    <P>I am not entirely adamant in regard to the second portion of the Deputy's amendment: the procedure whereby complaints can be brought.  There might be something to be said for the council indicating how this could be done.  I will consider that, but at this stage of debate it is best to leave it open, not to stipulate any formal procedure but to leave it as free and as flexible as possible so that any member of the public who feels that he has a complaint can just simply draw that cause of complaint to the attention of the council by whatever means is most convenient and appropriate in the circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I decided to put down this amendment not because this Bill was coming before the House but because the set of guidelines which the Medical Registration Council published are not available on a regular basis to doctors.  I received a set when I qualified, and it was only then I began to look into the whole problem of the function of the Medical Registration Council that I sought another.  I was astonished, as no doubt most doctors would be, at the guidelines that are laid down.  They are very good. Doctors will need these guidelines more now because on committing an offence their names will not simply be erased from the register, but they can be admonished and warned in relation to certain practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This set of guidelines should be incorporated in the Bill.  I doubt if any <Col N="487" /> ordinary member of the public knows anything about the Medical Registration Council.  The Minister and his Department might just contact the two medical organisations and they will inform them that most people just write to the two medical organisations who are unions or representative bodies protecting the interests of the medical profession.  They never heard of the Medical Registration Council and I doubt if anybody here even knows the address of the council.  The Medical Registration Council should make its whereabout known to the public.  Members of the public write to the health boards and to their TDs in relation to unsatisfactory service from their doctors because they do not know of the existence of the Medical Registration Council.  A set of guidelines will be necessary whether or not we leave it to the discretion of the council.  Perhaps the Minister would consider some kind of amendment to ensure that it be made available to doctors on a regular basis to keep them alert.  It is not restricting doctors' rights; it is improving the image of the profession and ensuring that doctors maintain a very high standard.  Most doctors want that.  Therefore it would be helping the doctor to improve his profession and the standard of practice of members. It is all in the interests of the medical profession and, just as in any other profession, we should aim to ensure that their high standards are good. A booklet sent at frequent intervals&mdash; perhaps once a year, every two years or even every five years&mdash;might be good.  I got one when I was qualifying but, in those balmy days, one never bothered to look at it.  I requested a booklet recently and that is the only reason that I got it.  I went through it and was a little alarmed to find that I had been practising without knowing the number of restrictions.  Perhaps it was my fault for not having checked but I never knew about it.  To tell the truth, I do not remember receiving it when I qualified.  I would assume that I did but it is very important.</P>
    <P>With such a set of guidelines the Medical Registration Council should engage in quoting cases of doctors&mdash; not necessarily stating specific cases <Col N="488" />&mdash;who have got themselves into trouble due, let us say, to accidental neglect. In that way we would be ensuring that litigation against doctors would be on the decrease.  It would be in the interest of the profession that it be done on a regular basis.  The Minister might give some thought to inserting an amendment on Report Stage providing that it be sent to doctors on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>The other important aspect is that the new Medical Council would make themselves or their presence known to the public.  Nobody is trying to badger the medical profession.  There is no intention whatsoever of doing that.  But the public should know and the Medical Council should say: &ldquo;We want to ensure that the public get what is right for them, that they get a fair deal. We want to ensure also that doctors are not maligned unnecessarily, so we will process claims, we will know of any complaints.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The present position is far from satisfactory with regard to that Medical Registration Council.  I wrote to them about a doctor from Clonmel, a German doctor living here, who feels called upon by his friends&mdash;he is a registered medical practitioner in Germany&mdash;to prescribe for them.  Occasionally friends come down to him and he likes to keep his hand in practice, as does many a doctor.  I wrote to the council about him some months ago and, other than receiving a single line acknowledgment, nothing else has happened.  I find this council most unsatisfactory and unco-operative.  I can only tell the Minister of my experience in eliciting information from them, when I have found them most unsatisfactory.  I even went down to them to see if I could bring about a satisfactory situation by explaining it to them.  Therefore, I am afraid of leaving too much to them at their discreation. I should like to see the new Medical Council being an active one, upholding the good name of doctors, ensuring that high standards are maintained, keeping the public informed and ensuring also that their members are not maligned unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could come up with some amendment providing <Col N="489" /> that the public and doctors are protected and that both are kept fully informed.  It is vital that doctors be constantly informed in the areas of ethical conduct where members might go wrong.  Keeping any profession on the alert in that way is in the interests of the profession and the public alike.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it is important that the new council should be as helpful as possible to the medical profession in guiding them in their professional behaviour.  There are so many new issues arising now this assumes increasing importance.  That will be done under section 62.  It will be a function of the council to give guidance to the medical profession generally on all matters relating to ethical conduct and behaviour.  I will look at section 62 (2) again to see if it can be expanded.  We are talking there purely in terms of guidance to the profession by the council.  I have already accepted from the House the suggestion that something more should be done by this council to inform the public of their existence, to let the general public know more about how they can have access to it.  I have accepted that in principle and I shall see what we can do between now and Report Stage along those lines.</P>
      <P>I accept also that we should do something more in the Bill about informing the public about the way in which they can contact, have access to, the council.  The appropriate place to do that is in section 62.  Therefore, if the Deputy would leave the matter for the moment I will come along on Report Stage and see what amendments I can put down to that section to try to meet the wishes of the House in these areas. There is, first of all, the expansion or development of the function of the council in guiding the profession. Secondly, there is the question of letting the public know as much as possible about the guidelines the council have issued to the public and, finally, how the council should or could inform the general public more about their affairs without creating unnecessary nuisances for themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the provisions of section 40 (1) (b) are not rather harsh.  I realise it would be very unusual if the council were to write to a doctor and not receive a reply from him, or have a retention fee submitted by him, within two months of writing.  It appears that the provisions of that paragraph are a little harsh and I invite the Minister to consider the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The other matter is in relation to very important notices. This question runs through several subsections of this section and earlier sections and I referred to it last week.  If it is self-evident that we should specify that the notice should be sent by pre-paid post, should we not specify that it be sent by registered post so that proof of delivery might be obtained?  We are talking about the situation here where a doctor's name can be erased from the register which would prevent him from practising.  Every safeguard should be taken to ensure that the notice has been properly delivered to the person who will be affected by the far-reaching provisions of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a suggestion in this section that the medical practitioner may have to pay a fee on a regular basis to have his name maintained on the register.  This is a very serious matter.  A person qualifies as a doctor after many years of study and he has his name included on the register of medical practitioners.  It appears to me that it is the intention of the Medical Council to charge an annual fee.  If a doctor does not pay this annual fee, he will find he is no longer a doctor.  This matter can be challenged in the courts.  It will have to be changed in some way on Report <Col N="492" /> Stage.  By refusing to pay an annual fee of £20 a doctor may find his name erased from the register and thus he is deprived of his right to practise. This is a very serious matter because the person concerned has undergone intensive training for six years and a compulsory internship.  He may also have carried out post-graduate work but because he will not pay the annual fee his name is erased from the register thus depriving him of the right to work.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say there is no such intention but, unfortunately, there is a precedent for this in the General Medical Council in Britain where there were massive stirkes by doctors.  They decided they would all withdraw and a very serious situation arose in Britain.  I can see the same thing happening here.  We must insert some provision to the effect that it will happen only with the consent of the overwhelming majority of the profession. It would not be right to leave it just to a council alone.  There is a serious constitutional issue at stake here, the right of a doctor to practise. I do not think anyone has the right to deprive him of his failure to pay an annual fee to keep his name on a register.  There is a principle involved here.  To my mind it is unjust and possibly unconstitutional that one has to pay an annual fee to keep one's name on a register.  By removing a doctor's name from the register, automatically he is deprived of the right to practise.  I would be glad to hear the Minister's views on this matter because he can be more objective about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to deal with the points raised by Deputy Boland.  This is a matter of normal administration.  The Deputy will note that under section 40 the professional person concerned must get two months notice and if he does not pay the fee as requested the council may decide that his name be erased from the register.  He is given further notice of that decision under subsection (2).  The person concerned gets two notices about the matter before he is finally struck off or removed from the register. I do not know if this is a matter on <Col N="493" /> which we should go into too much detail in the legislation.  Perhaps it is a matter that would best be left to the common sense of the council.  I could not imagine them capriciously or irresponsibly removing a name from the register because of the mere inadvertence of the practitioner to pay his fee.  However, I will look at the matter.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of the registered letter.  I do not think we can accept that.  Of course, there is expense involved but apart from that a person does not have to accept a registered letter.  I understand that refusing to accept a registered letter is a device resorted to from time to time by certain people when they do not want to receive the communication in question for reasons best known to themselves. It has been found from normal routine of administrative practice that the way it is laid out in the section is the best way of dealing with the matter.  However, I will consider whether it might not be desirable to put into section 40 some intermediate step between the first notification and the decision to remove the name.</P>
      <P>I am at a loss to understand Deputy O'Connell's anxiety about the retention fee.  We have already accepted the idea of the retention fee in section 25 of the Bill.  That section stipulates that retention fees can be charged by the council.  I might mention here that the level of the fee will be subject to my consent.  The Deputy and I had a passage of arms about the provision regarding the consent of the Minister in other sections but, perhaps, he will agree that in that section it is desirable that I should have this authority to consent to the level of the retention fee and make sure it is not excessive. Subject to that, I cannot see any objection in principle to a retenion fee.  No matter what organisation one belongs to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is the professional body of the medical profession.  The doctor is asked to pay an annual subscription to ensure his retention on the register.  The Deputy said he would be denied the right to practise but of course he will not be denied that right. All that will happen is that his name will be removed from the register and we already have had that distinction earlier in the debate, namely, the difference between the right to practise medicine and the right to be a registered medical practitioner and hold oneself to be a registered medical practitioner. If the doctor in question refuses or omits to pay his retention fee, he is prevented, with all the inhibitions that places on him, from holding himself to be a registered medical practitioner, but he is not prevented from practising medicine.  I cannot share Deputy O'Connell's anxiety in this matter.</P>
      <P>It is reasonable that a practitioner should pay some annual fee towards the upkeep of the council and that is best done by providing that he should pay a retention fee.  I would have thought that this would be in line with the Deputy's thinking in regard to the council and their functions.  As I understand it, Deputy O'Connell is anxious that there should be increasing contact between the practitioner and the council.  In other words, that the situation he describes in regard to himself would not arise, that is, that a medical practitioner has contact with the council when he qualifies and never hears of them again.  We would all like to think that there would be increasing communication between the council and the practitioner and to that extent the idea of a retention fee would be in keeping with that concept. Provided the retention fee is cast at a reasonable level I cannot see any objection to asking doctors to pay an annual contribution towards the upkeep of a body that is regulating their profession.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned the altercation we had and I apologise for that.  I accept that the council should undertake more work for the profession and the public.  For that reason, public money should be <Col N="495" /> given to the council.  If a doctor's name is removed from the register because he refuses to pay a registration fee, has he the right to prescribe? There is no indication that the fee will be a nominal sum because the setting of it is left to the discretion of this body.  If a doctor decided not to continue on the register, he would be an unregistered medical practitioner. Deputy Boland said that unregistered practitioners should not have the right to practise.  Deputy Boland would want fines or imprisonment against them, but would they have the right to prescribe if they did not pay their annual fee?  After completing six years in medical school and a one-year internship with, perhaps, another four years' post-graduate work, a practitioner may be irked by having to pay an annual fee of, say, £5.  If he does not pay he will not be a registered practitioner or specialist. If he is a consultant, has he the right to work in a hospital?  If he is a general practitioner, has he the right to engage in general practice?  Will a pharmacist refuse to accept his prescriptions?  All these questions need to be answered.</P>
      <P>In Britain it caused a serious upheaval among the profession.  They finally arrived at a compromise which was acceptable to the profession.  The Minister's advisers should consider this problem.  However, the Minister will dictate the policy of the Department and I only want his advisers to do the drudgery for him.  I have not said that about any Minister for Health with the exception of the late Donogh O'Malley, who was a great decision-maker.</P>
      <P>Would a doctor immediately regain the right to practise on payment of the fee?  Many people have gone to prison over matters of principle.  I heard of a lady in Britain who had paid her car tax but, due to a clerical error, she was told that she had not paid it and she went to prison.  This is the kind of situation that could arise in regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the simple answer in regard to the question of prescribing is no.  The matter <Col N="496" /> is dealt with in section 53, which provides that any certificate which is required by any Act of Parliament should be signed by a registered practitioner and that it will not be valid or acceptable unless it is signed by a registered person.  There might be prescriptions which it would be possible for a doctor to issue which would not come within the terms of section 53.  Therefore, the effective answer is that unless a doctor is a registered medical practitioner he will not be entitled to prescribe. What we are getting at here is the validity of the registration itself. The Deputy mentioned the situation in the UK.  My advice is that the situation in the UK arose because the doctors were not prepared to pay for inadequate representation on the council. Hopefully that situation will not apply here because we are giving reasonable representation to general medical practitioners.</P>
      <P>There are precedents for the idea of a retention fee.  It is provided for in the Dentists Act and in the Opticians Act.  Deputies O'Connell and Boland agreed with the idea which evolved in the course of our discussion that doctors should have certificates which they should display in their consulting rooms, and we all regard that as desirable.  Surely, a retention fee would keep a connecting link between the doctors and the council throughout their medical careers.  On the one hand we will issue certificates and provide useful information from time to time on new issues, moral or medical, that may arise and in return, a medical practitioner makes a contribution to the finances of the council by way of a retention fee.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell has asked me to consider the matter again and I have agreed to do that.  At this stage I am not persuaded that it is a draconian provision to ask a medical practitioner to pay an annual fee to have his name retained on the register.  It is more or less an administrative matter that he makes this annual contribution to the cost and upkeep of his own governing body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it is not a draconian provision to ask a medical practitioner to pay a reasonable fee. <Col N="497" /> There is nothing in this Bill to suggest that the fee be reasonable.  In section 25 I noticed that provision was made for a retention fee.  That was fair enough but I did not see anything about the fee being on an annual basis. The first I heard about annual fees was when Deputy O'Connell mentioned it this morning.  What upset me was that in his reply the Minister twice referred to the fact that it was intended that this would be an annual fee.  It was not referred to in section 25 which was the section enabling a fee to be charged nor was it referred to in this section.  If it was intended that there should be an annual fee, it should be written into the Bill.  As the Minister now tells us that the fee should be on an annual basis, we shall have to look again at section 25 and at the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
      <P>I am not sure that I would be opposed to this fee being on an annual basis if I was satisfied it was of a reasonable nature but there is no provision to specify that beyond the fact which says that the fee which the council set must be with the consent of the Minister.  Last week the House spent hours bemoaning the dreadful acts the Minister's successors were likely to carry out.  We all know we do not allow the Minister's successors the sort of latitude we might allow the holder of the office at present.  If a practitioner decided a fee was exorbitant&mdash;we must be realistic, I do not think many practitioners would decide that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A newly qualified doctor might find the fees more punitive than a doctor some years in practice and he might be a little remiss in submitting his retention fee if it were to be on an annual basis.  That was why I said this is a completely new ball game and I suggested that we have another look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested that the provisions of paragraph (b) were rather harsh because if the council write to a doctor asking for a retention fee and do not hear from him for two months they may then remove his name from the register.  They will write to him <Col N="498" /> again to tell him they have done that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage we are talking about a doctor possibly becoming involved in a very expensive court action to have his name restored to the register because through inadvertence or lack of funds or any other reason his name was removed from the register.</P>
      <P>When talking about the issuing of notices that may to a large extent affect the livelihood of a practitioner, it is important that there should be proof of delivery of the notice to the practitioner.  The Minister said that there are ways around avoiding acceptance of registered letters.  My recollection is that in previous legislation provisions are enshrined for the delivery of a notice which can have far-reaching effects on a person.  The sections usually specify that there would be proof of delivery by registered letter or, in the event of nondelivery, the notice would be served upon the person or at the address at which he was last known to reside. There are provisions which cover this kind of situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only in section 40 but right through Part V of this Bill, we are talking about the livelihood of a doctor, his possible removal from the register and possibly discrediting him in the eyes of the public.  Notice should clearly be seen to have been served on the doctor to give him every opportunity of complying with the necessary conditions.  It is not enough to say that if he is upset by having a second notice served on him telling him he will be removed from the register he may then apply to the courts.  After the second notice is served, it is not clear whether from that time until the 21 further days have elapsed he is removed from the register after the provisions of subsection (2) apply or <Col N="499" /> if he is not removed from the register until his appeal period of 21 days have elapsed.</P>
    <P>The point Deputy O'Connell raised brings us back to the long discussion we had last week as to whether a person who is not a registered practitioner should have the right to practise medicine. The Deputy went a little further than I intended when he said I suggested that a person who was not a registered medical practitioner should not practise medicine.  What I was saying in a layman's way was that I did not think he should have the right to prescribe drugs.  I am not sure that I accept the Minister's point that if he is not a registered practitioner, under the provisions of section 53 he cannot prescribe drugs.  I think he cannot prescribe drugs specified in their recent Dangerous Drugs Act.  I imagine that is the legislation the Minister is referring to.  I am sure not every drug is covered by legislation.  If the Minister checks this, he will find that it is only those drugs specified at that time as being dangerous that he could not prescribe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy O'Connell knows, there are new drugs coming on the market every day.  Many drugs that may be dangerous may not be specified under the recent Dangerous Drugs Act.</P>
      <P>In my opinion that doctor is not prevented in any way from prescribing those or any drugs.  I cannot see how he is prevented from practising as a surgeon simply because he is not a registered medical practitioner.  This is a very important area which the Minister's advisers will have to look at before Report Stage.  They will have to make it clear what people who hold themselves to be medical practitioners should be allowed to do if they are not registered with the Medical Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends which side you look at it.  The Minister must be <Col N="500" /> aware of the anxiety of Members on this matter which arises under this section and, perhaps, even on subsequent sections.  This will have to be cleared up.  It is not enough to say that as long as a doctor is registered everything is all right, and if he is not registered we are into shades of grey. The Minister has made it clear that if he is not registered we are in shades of grey as far as his right to prescribe drugs is concerned.  He will not be allowed to prescribe the dangerous drugs specified by statutes.  He is not prevented in any way from prescribing any dangerous drugs which have come on the market since that Act was passed. As I said, I am not sure he is prevented from practising as a surgeon or as a physician of any sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this section will be declared unconstitutional by the courts.  We would be very foolish, where there is the slightest doubt about it, to proceed with a section if the question of its constitutionality arises.  We are talking about a small council who are elected for five years and if a doctor feels dissatisfied with the annual retention fee being demanded by the council&mdash;I am sure Deputy Browne will come in with me on this issue because of its importance &mdash;and he does not like the representatives on the council he can do nothing about those matters for five years.  The council can charge an exorbitant fee because there is no limit.  If a doctor does not pay the annual retention fee &mdash;I assume it will be annual because the Minister gave every indication that it would be&mdash;his name is removed from the register and he is deprived of the right to practise.  What happens if he is a surgeon?  Has he the right to work in a hospital?  Will he be deprived of his livelihood?  The question of whether or not he has a right to practise is a serious constitutional issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard the question of prescribing drugs also arises.  Can he prescribe life-saving drugs for a patient? Such a person is competent to deal with these drugs, knows about them and has been trained in the use, the benefit and the adverse effects of drugs. Such a person may have had ten years <Col N="501" /> post-graduate experience as a surgeon or physician but he is deprived of the right to practise here by virtue of this section because he considers, as a matter of principle, that the Medical Registration Council were charging too much to keep his name on the register. Because this raises a serious constitutional issue the Minister should have another look at this section.</P>
    <P>The point raised by Deputy Boland about notifying the doctor is a good one.  I suggest to the Minister that a copy of the letter notifying the doctor be sent to the relevant medical organisations also.  In this way they would make contact with the doctor and it is another way of ensuring that the doctor is notified.  I suggest that an amendment be inserted for Report Stage on the lines that the retention fee must be approved by the overwhelming body of the medical profession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may say that the fee is justified by virtue of all the expense we have called for in the work of the council but if 70 per cent of the doctors decide not to pay this fee we would then have that number of unregistered medical practitioners. That would be serious.  If that happened there would be dismissals <i>en masse</i> from the health boards because the doctors would be dismissed automatically if they were not registered.  The health service would then be in a state of chaos and the Minister would have to introduce a new Bill to regularise the matter.  This is not a hypothetical case because I can see doctors objecting strongly to <Col N="502" /> anything that would infringe on their rights to practise.  They might find that they are not getting value for money. It should be remembered that this Bill is to protect the public as well as the doctors.  If 70 per cent of the doctors decided not to pay the fee an emergency situation would arise and none of us wants that to happen.  I do not wish to pose problems for the Minister all the time but there is a danger that this would be declared unconstitutional. The section should be amended to relieve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can allay the fears of the House on a number of issues. First, the House need not worry about the constitutionality of the section.  The section has been carefully drafted from the constitutional point of view in full consultation with the Attorney General and the legal advisers.  The bringing of the High Court into section 40 ensures the constitutionality. The fact that subsection (3) provides that a person has immediate access to the High Court, I am advised, ensures the constitutionality of section 40.  I ask the House to accept that as the position. However, these are matters which can only be resolved in practice as the legislation comes into effect over the years.  On the other issue of the retention fee.  I believe Deputies Boland and O'Connell are straining at gnats.  Deputy Boland kept reminding me that I mentioned an annual fee on many occasions.  I visualised that it would be an annual fee particularly in the context of the issuing of a certificate and so on.  Of course, there is nothing in the Bill to stipulate that it need be an annual fee and, perhaps, it will not be an annual fee.  First, to a large extent this is a democratically elected council. The doctors will elect their own body from now on and it is going too far to suggest that such a body with a strong representation of elected general practitioners would, in the first instance, attempt to promulgate an onerous, draconian or excessive fee on the profession. It is going too far to think that that would happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if the council proposed doing that they would still have to get the Minister's consent to the level of the fee they proposed.  If any further safeguard <Col N="503" /> can be built into section 25 I will put it in but at this stage I am not convinced that anything further is necessary.  The idea of a retention fee is pretty well inherent in this whole new concept of this council.  Deputy O'Connell pointed out that the existing situation is absurd, that a doctor comes into contact with his council the day he qualifies and from then on he never hears of them again, he does not even know where their head offices are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just painting the general picture.  We are going to have more comprehensive and meaningful elections every five years.  Doctors will be issued with certificates which they will display in their consulting rooms and guidelines will be issued for their information.  Hopefully, there will be a great deal more communication both ways between the council and the profession. In those circumstances a retention fee makes sense.  Deputy Boland made a point about the level of the retention fee and felt that it might be onerous for a young doctor starting off in practice.  The whole idea of a retention fee is to deal with that situation.  If we did not have an annual, bi-annual or tri-annual fee then the initial registration fee would have to be all the higher.  Hopefully, the initial registration fee can be brought down if there will be a subsequent retention fee at periodic intervals.  From that point of view, the idea of a retention fee is a good one.  Deputy O'Connell is worried that doctors as a whole might not accept this.  I would contrast the situation in regard to doctors with what happens in the case of solicitors. They not only have to pay an annual subscription to their governing body but every solicitor in practice has to contribute very heavily to a compensation fund.</P>

      <P>That is an entirely different matter.  By statute there is established a compensation fund which must be adequate fully to compensate any person who is defrauded by a solicitor in practise.  Solicitors not alone have to pay their annual registration fee but have to contribute a varying sum every year to make sure that the compensation fund is adequate.  We are not providing in this legislation any compensation fund for the general public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There is no compulsory fund involved in this legislation.  I simply wanted to contrast the situation of doctors and solicitors.  Deputy O'Connell suggested that this is unnecessarily onerous on the medical profession and that they might reject it.  I have no fear that they will reject it, provided that it is a reasonable fee.  The fact that the council are to a large extent democratically elected and, secondly, that ministerial consent must be forthcoming with regard to the level of the fee will ensure that the amount of the retention fee will not be excessive, onerous or draconian.</P>
      <P>I will have another look at section 35 to see if there is any further safeguard which should be built into it. Deputy Boland reiterated his argument about the removal of a doctor's name when he had been given notice only once of his failure to pay the retention fee.  If it were left to myself, I would leave that matter to the commonsense and sense of fair play of the council.  We must assume that they will be a reasonably responsible council, having the interests of the profession at heart just as much as any other obligations.  I think they will not act irresponsibly but perhaps there should be some intermediate stage between the two months' notification and the High Court.  I will see if something else can be inserted there which would be a protection for the doctor who might be remiss in paying his retention fee, but something which would not be administratively onerous on the council.  This has been my fear.  I do not want to load this council with too many statutory restrictions on their day-to-day operations but if it is possible to build in some intermediate stage between the initial notice and the removal of the doctors name, then I will do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister makes the analogy with the solicitors which I consider is not a good one.  Before a doctor is allowed to work in a hospital he must take out indemnity insurance with the Medical Defence Union or the Medical Protection Society.  They are the two bodies to which he pays a hefty annual fee because of litigation dangers at the moment.  He pays into a compensation fund.  It is the first thing he does.  Last year as much as £33,000 was paid by way of compensation in respect of negligence in Ireland.  Every doctor contributes towards this, whether it is called a compensation fund or litigation insurance.</P>
      <P>Solicitors pay a registration fee to the Incorporated Law Society, who also represents their interest.  Doctors have two bodies representing them as well as the council.  They are negotiating bodies, the Medical Union and the Irish Medical Association.  It is not correct to say that doctors do not have to pay into a compensation fund.  The body to which the solicitors contribute also represents them.  I cannot vouch for that fact but I assume that this is the situation because I do not know of any solicitors' protection body or association which represents them in negotiations with the Department.  I am open to correction on that.</P>
      <P>I hope that something can be built into this on Report Stage which will meet Deputy Boland's point that a doctor may not have been informed, even though the letter may have been sent.  Perhaps a copy should be sent to the medical organisations representing the profession.  This might be a way of meeting this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the retention fee, we must decide whether it is to be annual, bi-annual or tri-annual.  This should be stated in the Bill.  Secondly, the consent of the Minister is not necessarily the best guarantee that this will be a normal fee.  Perhaps we could provide that the Medical Council in consultation with the medical organisations representing the profession would ensure that the fee would be acceptable to the entire profession. This may not be the answer and the <Col N="507" /> Minister may come up with something much better.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Minister's statement that he knows this is constitutional, none of us can know.  How can we know?  How often have Bills gone through this House the constitutionality of which we all felt sure could never be contested?  We cannot state categorically that we know a Bill is constitutional.  The Attorney General has been wrong on many occasions.</P>

      <P>When this problem arose in Britain there was a great danger of a complete breakdown in the <Col N="508" /> hospital service when doctors refused to pay the retention fee.  If 78 per cent of the doctors here took a similar attitude our hospitals would not be manned and there would be chaos.  We should legislate for all eventualities. We should anticipate situations like that in Britain arising here.  The Minister may say that the council would be reasonable, but I do not think this is the right way to legislate for a situation like that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It might seem irrational to some people if one took up a position against what the section provides. It states that the Medical Council may decide, and that presumably means giving discretion to this predominantly medical body.  The Minister could say reasonably that the profession need not have any fears because they will be judged by their peers.  I do not understand why such power is given to the Medical Council.  The section, in subsection (1) (a), deals with the Fitness to Practise Committee, and inability or omission to pay by doctors is being put on a par with criminal activities by doctors.  We could deprive a person of his ability to practise as a doctor, simply because he had not paid his bills.</P>
      <P>It seems to me to be terribly unreasonable and the penalty is grossly disproportionate to the offence.  A person might not have the money to pay or he might not like to admit that he had not or he might forget to pay his bills and we should not equate such inability with criminal activities, with malpractice, with the various crimes of which doctors can be guilty. This could lead to very serious consequences for doctors and it seems to be completely irrational.  It is like telling a Deputy if he cannot pay his restaurant or bar bills he cannot be a Deputy any longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see the purpose of this.  Is the idea behind this provision to give power to the Medical Council, set up by law, to force the medical profession to pay?  Let them pay if they want to. The Minister referred to the tolerance, understanding, wisdom and all round knowledge of the Medical Council and the work they would have to do, and <Col N="509" /> he asks if they cannot be trusted to decide on this question of payment. Then, why must this power be incorporated in the law?  The Medical Council can be reminded that they are not discharging one of the provisions of the law under which they were established, but the Minister may have a successor who would not have good relations with the medical profession. He could penalise them, reminding them of this clause.</P>
    <P>Leaving all that aside, it does not seem to me to make sense to provide that you can take away a man's practice because he cannot pay his bills.  This power is to be given to a body which will monitor the course a doctor has taken, involving six or seven years to get his MB and another four or five years to get a consultancy. The Medical Council must decide such a person is competent and skilled before being allowed to practise and then, because of some quirk on the part of some person who says he will not pay, or because somebody cannot pay and does not want to admit it, his right to practise is to be taken away.</P>

I will pay 60 per cent and you collect the remainder.&rdquo;  That would leave the council with no alternative.</P>
      <P>We accept totally that a doctor who is found guilty of a serious charge should have his right to practise taken away.  This is provided for in paragraph (a) but is it proper to include in the same section under paragraph (b) the provision to have removed from the register a man who has not paid his registration fee?  Is this not disproportionate? As Deputy O'Connell pointed out in the case of auctioneers and solicitors, for instance, there are considerable sums of money involved. Consequently, a considerable pool of money must be established in order to ensure that in the case of a defrauding solicitor, for example, clients will be compensated.  What is the purpose of the change here?  I do not recall paying a fee since I paid my registration fee initially, which was then about £5.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could intervene here to remind Deputy Browne that a fee of the nature we are talking of here is paid by such people as dentists and opticians.  The provision is in line with modern developments.  It is our wish that there be an active council.  I have been trying to explain all morning that we wish to bring about a situation where there will be communication between the profession and the council.  This democratically-elected council will have many functions to perform in relation to the profession in regard to guidelines, controlling behaviour, controlling professional conduct and so on.  Surely in such circumstances it is legitimate that some sort of ongoing fee be paid by the members of the <Col N="511" /> profession in order to keep in being what is their council.  A register must be kept.  Therefore, a registrar must be paid.</P>

      <P>There will be annual outgoings.  Therefore, is it not a simple self-explanatory concept that a profession pay some ongoing fee?  I have been talking about an annual fee but that has been objected to.  Should they not pay some continuing periodic contribution to meet the expenses of the council who govern their affairs and who exist largely for the benefit of the profession?  It is a principle of general application throughout the whole professional world and throughout the trade union world that if one is a member of a body of this sort, one's own professional or vocational governing body, one pays a continuing fee to meet the expenses of that body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry but I intervened merely to explain the position about putting the two provisions in juxtaposition.  Of course they have no relationship to each other in terms of degree of importance.  One relates to a situation in which a doctor is found guilty of professional misconduct and as a result is struck off the register, perhaps for life, while the other relates to a simple inadvertance to pay a retention fee in which case the doctor is restored to the register by paying the fee.  Both provisions are in this section purely from the point of view of convenience of drafting. Because of the constitutional issues to which Deputy O'Connell adverted both provisions have related to them the right of access to the courts for restoration. Without this provision the Bill would be unconstitutional.  In other words, in relation to an erasure from the register, if there were not the right of access to the court for the purpose of restoration, the section would not <Col N="512" /> stand up.  Deputy Browne knows enough about drafting and legislation to know that this is common practice. The fact that different provisions are included in subsections that are adjacent to each other is of no consequence in relation to the severity or to the importance of the provisions.</P>

      <P>This is an ideological principle.  There is no <i>rationale</i> other than the sort of idea that everybody must pay for everything he gets, that otherwise, he will not appreciate fully what he is getting.  There is nothing to prevent the Minister from setting up a disciplinary council of this kind to decide on levels of practice and training. There is nothing to prevent him from funding such a council.  I do not expect that the fees that will be payable under this legislation will be sufficient to pay for what I would imagine would be enormous expenses in respect of the personnel and the administrative services of an organisations such as this.  Therefore, there is no <i>rationale</i> other than a political or an ideological one in the provision.  In a sort of actuarial sense has the Minister any idea of the percentage he will be expecting the medical council to raise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and does he think that there will be permission for this to be varied?  The Council could, for instance, ask for a nominal fee of £5 in the event of a statutory fee not being imposed.  If I were on the board, perhaps I would get round the matter by asking for a fee of about 50p, thereby making the whole thing so ridiculous as to be irrelevant.  In such circumstances, what could the Minister do?  I would be paying something like 0.001 per cent of the actual cost of running this institution and the Minister would not have the power to do anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Doctors are being put in the position that in the event of their not accepting whatever the Minister decides on, they will be denied, effectively, the right to <Col N="513" /> practise.  That is most unjust.  Many doctors would gladly pay a fee voluntarily. We do this already in respect of the Medical Defence Union, the Medical Association and the Medical Union of which all of us are members.</P>
    <P>We accept that we must pay fees; if a body like this is set up by the Minister and decides that there will be a fee of some kind the majority would pay that fee.  For the minority why cannot we just leave it that they take action in the courts to recover money if they want to?  There should not be this draconian decision to deprive a person of his right to practise.  There are other ways than depriving a person of his professional status because he does not pay his bills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have a look at the record.  My recollection is that the Minister stated that the Bill was constitutional, that the Attorney General had said that it was constitutional and that the Attorney General was right. <Col N="514" /> The reason for the delay of the appearance of this Bill for a long time was the doubt about the constitutionality of the entire section 25 of the Bill.  Last week the Minister spoke about this being his Bill and his decision.  It is now, but it was kicking around for a long time while the constitutionality of these sections was being considered and the sort of questions being asked in the House for the last hour or so, were being asked in private.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Bill was delayed for months to check this out the House should be entitled to talk about it. Section 25 provides that the council may charge fees with the consent of the Minister.  The House might feel happier about it if that section provided that whenever the Minister gave his consent he did so by way of making regulations which would be laid before the House, under section 25. That might be a way of meeting the objections that have been brought up. Members are concerned that the fee might be so repetitive and exorbitant as to persuade doctors not to pay it.</P>
      <P>The other and more vital question on this section still has not been answered.  If a person is removed from the register and is no longer a registered medical practitioner is he entitled to practise as a surgeon?  Is he entitled to prescribe any drugs that are not mentioned in statute as being dangerous drugs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is yes. The provisions are in sections 52 and 53.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we have been shying away from.  The Bill purports to decide whether a doctor can practise or not, but when it becomes law it does not really decide.  Under the provisions of section 39 the Medical Council is going to set up a Fitness to Practise Committee which will not be a Fitness to Practise Committee at all but a Fitness to be Registered with the Medical Council Committee.  If the person is removed from the register he is still entitled to practise.  We <Col N="515" /> are purporting to represent to the public by the terminology used in earlier sections that the person who is removed from the register under the provisions of section 25 or who is temporarily suspended from the register will no longer be able to practise as a doctor in any shape or form and that in that way we are protecting the general public against the doctor who, for one reason or another, should not be allowed to practise.  We are not really protecting them at all.  I spoke about this at length last week.  At the time the Minister said that this was not a Bill to do it.  I would like to know what is the appropriate legislation whereby the public should be protected if it is not legislation that talks about a Fitness to Practise Committee.</P>

      <P>We are talking about the erasure of doctors from the register, and I am suggesting that doctors being erased from the register are not being prevented from practising. If the Medical Council sees fit to remove a doctor from the register for any reason his removal should prevent him from practising and certainly from prescribing dangerous drugs and carrying out dangerous operations.</P>

      <P>Those are drugs known to be dangerous at the time of the passing of the Act.  He is not prevented from prescribing any that will come on the market subsequently.  He is not prevented from practising as a surgeon.  I suggest that he should be. I appreciate the constitutional difficulties, but if in section 25 we are representing ourselves as protecting the interests of the public as well as the interests of the medical profession. some attempt should be made to ensure the public's right to feel that if a person is, as they know it, a doctor, he is really a registered medical practitioner and that, if they are placing their life in his hands, there <Col N="516" /> is some form of legislative control over how he goes about his business.  This section, with the power of removal, purports to do that and it does not do it.  I do not know exactly how it could do it, but I am suggesting to the Minister that before the Bill comes back on Report that area must be looked at again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>This section of the Bill will hold us all up to ridicule and it can have very serious implications. The constitutionality of it is in question.  I am not infallible, but it seems that if I do not pay the registration fee or the retention fee of say, £5, I am a fully qualified, competent and practising doctor, and if some Member of this House has an acute heart attack and I rush with my supply and give him a shot of morphia, I can find myself in prison.  I can find myself in prison if I carry out some life-saving measure as a competent, qualified, practising doctor, because I am prescribing a dangerous drug.  Morphia is a dangerous drug, so I am precluded from prescribing a life-saving drug which will prevent shock in a seriously ill patient.  If a surgeon does not pay the £5 or whatever the retention fee is and he arrives at the scene of some serious accident and he gives an injection of a life-saving drug he can find himself in prison.  We are trying to equate this with professional misconduct, and this is the danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is inclined to confuse the Medical Council with a medical protection body such as the Irish Medical Association or the Medical Union.  There is no comparison.  They represent the interests of doctors.  This represents the interest of the public. This measure is to ensure that standards are high.  This body want to ensure that doctors are properly qualified, not that they are not registered.  They want to ensure that doctors are educated and trained properly and have the proper experience and skill and that they behave properly in a professional manner.  That is what this council is all about, but then they decide to put a man in prison because he does not pay the fee.  They have decided <Col N="517" /> the standards for that doctor.  If he does not pay £5 a year or whatever the fee is, he can go to jail for carrying out functions the standard for which they have laid down.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely ludicrous to incorporate this in a Bill.  There is no parallel for it.  The Minister may find himself in a very serious situation if the doctors refuse to pay this money.  I believe the constitutionality of it is in question.  I know of a taxidriver who was deprived of his right to drive a taxi because there was a question about his morals.  He appealed the case to the court and won his right to carry out his work.  He got his taxi licence back. I remember making representations on his behalf and failing.  The only suggestion I could make then was that he would take his case to court, which he won.</P>
    <P>I believe a doctor could take his case to court and prove that he was being deprived of his right to practise. What would happen in a case like that?  Would we look foolish?  We must make sure that anything we do in the House does not conflict with the Constitution. I believe this is one area where it can.  If I do not pay my yearly fee of £5 I could go to jail.  If the Minister was ill and I went to his aid and prescribed a drug which I am competent to do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would do it over and over again with anybody because that is my duty as a doctor.  I could then find myself in jail under the provisions of this Bill.  The body is set up to decide standards and professional behaviour.  It suddenly jumps in with deciding an annual fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to create problems for the Minister but I see a problem arising here.  I would rather see the council taking more care of the public, acting more on their behalf and making sure that standards are high and in return let public money go into it.  I want the public to be involved in this. I want the public to be represented on this body.  When the council act on behalf of the public, public money should go into it.  The Minister could <Col N="518" /> then decide what would be adequate remuneration for officers of that body. I ask him to have a look into this matter and in some way protect the doctor who is fully qualified.  I am sure that Deputy Boland agrees that there is no comparison between a fully qualified doctor who is not registered and one who is not qualified.  He is a surgeon or a cardiologist but he cannot go to the aid of the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make my final intervention.  This is my last word on this matter.  First of all, does Deputy Browne realise what he is suggesting? He suggests that the cost of running this council from year to year should be inflicted on the taxpayer.  If there is no retention fee or some other way of getting money to run the council, received from the profession, the taxpayer will have to pay the cost.  I do not believe anybody would accept that.</P>
      <P>We are giving the profession the right to govern themselves, as I have already said, to control their own affairs, control their own behaviour, control their professional standards and control their own education.  The least they might do is pay for that.  That is the whole principle in the Bill.  We propose to do it by means probably of an initial registration fee and a subsequent retention fee.  I cannot see any great difference in principle between a registration fee and a retention fee.  If you pay to go on a register there is no great difference in principle in paying to stay on the register, particularly if the two can be used together to ensure that the burden does not lie all that heavily on the young man or woman coming into the profession for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could, as happened in the old days, pay £1,000 on one's initial registration and never pay anything after that but I do not believe the House would like that.  I believe the idea of a registration fee and a retention fee to pay the outgoings of the council is a common-sense approach to this matter.  I have already pointed out to Deputy Browne that this principle applies to dentists, opticians, and, I am sure, to many other professions. It certainly applies in the case of <Col N="519" /> solicitors.  Who else is to pick up the bills for the annual outgoings of this council if not the taxpayer?</P>
    <P>Those are the two options.  It is very fitting that we entrust the profession with the regulation of their own affairs and therefore they should pay for it. If I came along to the council, as Minister for Health and said that I wanted them to do this that or the other in the public interest I should pay them for that.  If there is something not in the Bill which I want them to do over and above their normal duty of regulating the profession then I should provide money out of the taxpayer's pocket for that purpose.  The sensible, practical way of running this council in the normal course of events is for the profession to provide the money to pay the outgoings and expenses.  If Deputies accept that a registration fee should be payable on registration, then in principle there is not one iota of difference between that and paying over a period of years by way of retention fee.</P>
    <P>I want to come to the constitutionality of the matter, and I hope clear up the issues here.  I believe the Bill goes as far as it possibly can in seeking to ensure its own constitutionality.  The provisions of section 40 are very clear and explicit.  First of all, if the council wish to remove the name of a practitioner from the register for either of the two reasons&mdash;because of a finding of the Fitness to Practise Committee or because the practitioner has failed to pay his retention fee&mdash;it must go to the court.  There is no question of removing people facilely from the register.  The procedure must be as follows.  First of all, the person concerned must be notified.  That person then has 21 days in which to go to the High Court and ask that the removal is not proceeded with.  If the person does not do that the council must go to the courts, <i>ex parte</i>, and ask that the removal be proceeded with.  The court must come into it.  If that falls down constitutionally I should be very greatly surprised.</P>

      <P>Certainly.  The procedure is as follows.  If the council, for one of the reasons which we know of, decides to remove the name of a person, the council must notify that person. That person then has 21 days to go to the court and ask for an order that his removal is not proceeded with. If the person does not do that the council still has to go to the court <i>ex parte</i> and ask that the council be allowed to go ahead with the removal. One way or another the court is involved in the procedure.  The person's name cannot be removed from the register without the authority of the court to do so.  Constitutionally that is as far as we can possibly go in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In this context &ldquo;may&rdquo; is equivalent to &ldquo;will&rdquo;.  To come to the point of my stating I believed this is constitutional, I have been over this whole ground before in regard to the legislation governing solicitors.  I know all the discussions and all the to-ing and fro-ing which took place on that occasion.  When I was presented with the draft of this legislation, I said I wanted to be abso <Col N="521" /> lutely sure we would not have any constitutional difficulty on this legislation. I went back again to the present Attorney General and ensured that, in so far as he could devise the procedures, they would be sacrosanct from the constitutional point of view. That is the history of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only his opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is only his opinion.  From my own inexpert knowledge of the situation, I do not think these provisions can be assailed from the constitutional point of view. I am reasonably certain of that, and the Attorney General is equally convinced that they are as watertight constitutionally as we can make them.  Perhaps we could leave it at that and accept that, in so far as the House can ensure it these provisions with regard to the retention fee will stand up.</P>
      <P>Then we are left with the profession. I should be very considerably surprised if this new council, constituted as it will be with a considerable elected element acts in any foolish or improvident manner, or if it even attempted to fix a retention fee at a level which would be unacceptable to the profession. I would be even more surprised if the council fails to measure up to the standard we expect from it in that regard and if the Minister is equally improvident and unwise and agrees to a fee which is unacceptable to the profession, a draconian or unnecessarily onerous fee.  If all these things happen, we are dealing with a period of five years only, and the council can be thrown out after the five-year period by the electors and the Minister can be dismissed, as Ministers have been dismissed, by the people.</P>
      <P>I really think we are pushing this thing a bit too far.  If Deputy Dr. Browne is prepared to accept in principle a registration fee for going on the register, he cannot in principle object to a detention fee, particularly as a man cannot be removed from the register, in effect, without the authority of the court.  In effect, you cannot go off this register without the authority of the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The subsection reads:</P>
      <P>Where a person to whom a decision of the Council under this section relates does not, within the period of 21 days beginning on the date of the decision, apply to the High Court for cancellation of the decision ...</P>
      <P>&ldquo;cancellation of the decision&rdquo;.  He has not been removed.  It is only a decision to remove him.  What happens is that the council decides to remove him, conveys that decision to him, and he then has the right, if he wishes, to go to the court and say: &ldquo;Please do not permit the council to remove me&rdquo; or, if he does not do anything, the council then goes to the court and says &ldquo;May we now proceed?  Please let us confirm our decision to remove this man.&rdquo;  I do not think we can go much further than that.</P>
      <P>I would have thought from Deputy Dr. Browne's point of view that the fact that paragraph (b) is put in in close conjunction with paragraph (a) is a protection.  Even though it is as simple a matter as a failure to pay a retention fee, by virtue of its inclusion in this section it still gets the full protection of the constitutional court provisions.  Removal for non-payment of a retention fee gets the same protection, the same safeguards as serious misconduct found to be so by the Fitness to Practise Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should the council not have this right to remove a person who does not pay a retention fee?  Let us accept for a moment that the retention fee is fixed at a reasonable, sensible, rational level.  Is it right in a profession that 70 per cent or 80 per cent of the decent people should pay their retention fee and the council has no way of compelling the shysters to pay theirs? Surely that is not acceptable.  Let <Col N="523" /> everybody pay the retention fee.  If the retention fee is necessary to run the council, and if it is fixed at a reasonable level, let everybody pay it and let the council have the power to ensure that everybody pays it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The only other alternative as outlined by Deputy O'Connell is to go to the courts and sue.  That is cumbersome and undignified. Do we not all know the very fact that the council intimates to a professional person that if he does not pay his retention fee he will be removed from the register means that the retention fee will come by return of post?  We know that.  It is a simple practical safeguard, a device to ensure that the council can make every person pay a retention fee.  Every profession has its own little shyster section who are not prepared to accept their obligations or play their part.  The council should have some power and authority to make them play their part.</P>
      <P>I listened to all the arguments but I am quite satisfied the provisions set out here are reasonable and will work satisfactorily.  The only alternative to having a retention fee from which the council can get the funds it wants is to make the taxpayer pay and I do not think we want that.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before calling Deputy O'Connell I want to point out that there appears to me to be a fair amount of repetition of the arguments on this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is Committee Stage.  Arguments and counter-arguments arise and we could spend all day on one section.  Under Standing Orders we are not precluded from going over points once they are valid. That is the first thing I want to tell the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  We had better get things straight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to mention a few points to the Minister because his argument falls flat.  His argument falls on its face, if I may say so.  He said we are leaving it to the profession to decide but, of <Col N="524" /> course, we are not, because we are asking for public representation.  The Minister has accepted that there should be public representation on this body.  Therefore that argument is wrong.  I would like more public representation on it.  The Minister must accept that his argument is wrong. We are not leaving it to the profession to decide their own affairs.  I would not like to leave that to the profession, nor would the profession like it.  We want public representation and we are getting it.</P>
    <P>The Minister says the man who does not pay has a right to go to the High Court.  That is testing the constitutionality of it.  For what other reason would he go to the High Court if his name was erased from the register by virtue of the fact that he did not pay the retention fee?  To me the Minister's argument does not seem valid.  Everybody has the right to go to the High Court if they think something is wrong.</P>
    <P>We are saying this person can test the constitutionality of this.  He is not testing the unfairness of it.  It would be different if we were talking about an issue such as professional misconduct. I do not think that by any stretch of the imagination we could call refusal to pay a retention fee professional misconduct. It is very important for us to know that.  Professional misconduct is entirely different.  This is the payment of a retention fee.  The only reason why he would be challenging that case&mdash;and he certainly would be challenging it in the High Court&mdash; would be to test its constitutionality.</P>
    <P>This is for the protection of the public.  Because of that I would like to see more public representation on it and therefore, I would like to see public funds devoted to it.  Then it would be answerable to the public.  That is the whole purpose of it, protection of the public, ensuring qualifications, standards of behaviour and so on, not for the doctors benefit but for the public benefit.  I would ask the Minister to look at this again and incorporate some such phrase as &ldquo;after consultation with the medical organisations that represent ...&rdquo; I am not concerned about what the fee is.  I am concerned about doctors saying they are not paying, resulting <Col N="525" /> in a serious situation.  That is the main point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a much more serious matter than Deputy O'Connell has made it out to be, and he has made it out to be very serious. My belief stems from a remark made by the Minister in his recent contribution. He said that if the cost of this new institution was not placed on the doctors, it must be paid by the taxpayer, and he dismissed that.  This is, I believe, the ideological difference between us.  I believe taxpayers are perfectly happy to pay for institutions set up to protect their interests, to provide for their welfare, health, education, old age, housing and so on.  That is a long-accepted principle.  The Minister tells me that I must pay more as a doctor than the other taxpayer who is not a doctor.  I am a doctor and I must pay this additional fee as well in order to run this institution which is directed to look after both our interests, not just mine, not just his.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is a valid point.  If an institution is being established in order to protect the taxpayer's interest, I do not see why he should not be prepared to pay for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A most interesting phrase in the Minister's contribution was &ldquo;the least they might do is pay for that&rdquo; and then the most important one of all, &ldquo;they should provide for the running <Col N="526" /> of this institution&rdquo;.  The Minister suggested that I was inconsistent in saying I did not agree with this but agreed with the registration.  It was an nominal £5 fee paid those years ago for the running of an office down at the corner of Merrion Street, as far as I remember, with a lady secretary and possibly an administrator or whatever it might be.</P>
    <P>That seemed to me to be fair, but, as I said on the Second Stage, there is an enormous expansion implicit in the provisions of the Bill: the establishment and vetting of the courses, the monitoring of the standards in each of the different medical schools, the provision made for this new development of reciprocity with Europe, the expansion in administrative staff, medical and technical personnel, clerical staff, buildings.  This will be an enormous institution if it is a <i>bona fide</i> intent by the Minister seriously to protect the public interest as I have outlined.</P>
    <P>What are we proposing to do to the medical profession and the Medical Council?  We are proposing to them that they will now foot the bill for an enormous expansion involving a very costly institution?  Then this Minister, who is very favourably disposed to the medical profession&mdash;and there is nothing wrong with that&mdash;blandly states now, before they are given any understanding of the size of the Bill, the ultimate price they will have to pay, that they will have to provide for the running of this institution.  He considers that a perfectly reasonable thing to do.  This is a reasonable Minister, well disposed to the profession.</P>
    <P>Then the question arises, what would be an appropriate retention fee during the lifetime of this institution, necessarily a growing fee because it is an expanding institution?  It cannot be a fixed fee as is the one we pay.  £5.  Will this fee be a percentage of a doctor's income?  There are various levels of income in the medical profession. There are some of them who could pay an enormous sum per year and it would not mean anything to them.  However, there are many young and middle-aged practitioners, particularly those working in the local authority service, with large families <Col N="527" /> and other commitments, to whom other than a nominal fee would be a very serious imposition on them in addition to their contribution to the Medical Union, the Medical Association and the Medical Defence Union. These are all additional taxes that the medical profession pay, all directed towards the protection of the public interest in various ways.  There are also Voluntary Health Insurance contributions, as none of us is eligible for the health scheme.</P>
    <P>All of these additional taxes are being imposed on the medical profession simply because the Minister is sticking to a doctrinaire ideological position that every institution set up should fund itself and not be paid for by the taxpayer.  All our institutions, hospitals, schools, school bus, and so on, are funded by taxes and by rates to cover the various needs of society. If the service is there and if it is the collective wish of the people that these services should be there, then the taxpayer is quite happy to pay for them and, I think, can be asked to pay for them.</P>
    <P>As regards the fee, on the one occasion that I was asked to insist on a fee for a health scheme, I said &ldquo;All right, ten shillings&rdquo;, and that was accepted for a very costly medical scheme.  It saved the face of one sector and it was unimportant as far as I was concerned because it was such a tiny fee.  Therefore, we have a position where a council says &ldquo;We object to this&rdquo;.  They take this argument up that I have just put, but very much more vehemently than I do because, remember, I am considered to be rather forward looking in my views on medical practice generally.  Those in the profession will resent the fact that they are discriminated against in this way and the Minister might easily find himself in trouble if a powerful enough lobby is built up within the profession.</P>
    <P>I do not work within the profession at all but those who do will regard it as a very serious imposition on the profession and if a powerful lobby is built up against this imposition one of the planks in the platform <Col N="528" /> will be that the members of the profession will object to the payment of this fee and say that, as far as they are concerned, it will be a nominal fee of 50p for registration.  Presumably this institution is being set up by the Minister at the instigation of the Government under EEC regulations. If the Minister wants this institution, let him pay for it.  If the Government want this institution, let the Government pay for it.  If the taxpayers who put the Government in want this institution, let the taxpayers pay for it.  Why should a small section be singled out to pay, not a nominal fee but a continually increasing financial commitment to which there is no perceptible limit, leaving out inflation altogether?  At what point will the Minister decide the institution is big enough, costly enough and cannot be allowed to grow any further?  In the context of the fee he is suggesting&mdash; this is most important&mdash;the medical profession will be expected to provide for the running of this institution through this retention fee.</P>

Suppose the Minister is told that the profession will not fund the institution and will allow its members to pay a nominal fee of 50p, what will the Minister do about it?  He has a figure in his mind as to what it will cost the profession to run the institution.  Is it 5 per cent, 10 per cent, 20 per cent, 30 per cent, 40 per cent, 50 per cent, 80 per cent, 90 per cent or 100 per cent?  Where does it stop?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important principle.  We now find from the Minister's contribution that this costly institution, ever-growing, will be funded by the profession by means of fees.  Even if the Minister gives an undertaking that it will be a nominal fee, unless that is written into legislation, it will not be binding on his successors. We must get some kind of undertaking as to the percentage.  The Minister says the profession will pay the total cost.  The words are &ldquo;provide for the running of the institution&rdquo;. The Minister must give us some projected cost.  I asked for that on Second Reading.  I asked for the immediate, mid-term and long-term cost of this very elaborate institution spread over the registered members who will be expected to provide for the running of the institution through the medium of a retention fee.  That could not possibly be a nominal fee. The Minister would regard a fee of 50p as frivolous.  He said he would laugh at it.  If that was suggested he would tell the profession to come back and put forward a realistic suggestion. What percentage has he in mind for the maintenance of this institution which he, as a politician, is setting up?  He talks about going to the High Court.  It is the old cliché&mdash;the High Court, like the Ritz, is open to everybody.  I do not think there are many doctors who would be anxious to take a body like this to the High Court.  That is not something they should be lightly asked to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main difference with the Minister is on the issue of the enormity of the penalty imposed, namely, depriving a medical doctor of his right to practise simply because he has not <Col N="531" /> paid his bill.  That is the first point. The second point is the handing over of this body to the medical profession to run.  I disagree with that for my own ideological reasons.  Obviously, the Minister is giving it over not just for his own personal political reasons but as a kind of <i>quid pro quo.</i>  He now says&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Not at all.  Right wingers always say the left wing is doctrinaire.  In the beginning I thought this was simply the old idea with which I was faced at one time&mdash;you will have to pay because you must pay for what you get, a kind of ideological thing&mdash;when I had this row with the Church on that occasion.  I said I would go half way and charge ten shillings for the service and so on.  We had a kind of dog licence arrangement whereby people could go to the post office, pay ten shillings and their faces were saved and I was happy to see them getting good service.  I thought the Minister was trying to cling to that principle in a very right wing sort of way.  But it is a very much more serious one from the point of view of the medical profession: he is trying to get the medical profession to pay for this very costly, expensive institution. That is what he said.  I have asked him if the fee would be a percentage of a doctor's income.</P>

      <P>As a self-disciplining, responsible profession I am just applying to them the simple rule which we apply to professions generally.  We have already applied it to the dentists, the solicitors, the opticians.  We say &ldquo;You are a responsible profession; we are entrusting you with the governing of you own affairs, running your own profession, disciplining yourselves, <Col N="533" /> setting standards of education and training and professional behaviour and as such we ask you to finance the council which does this&rdquo;. I do not think this will be an enormously expensive council.  I hope it will give a good service, have plenty of communication with the profession, but I do not see the expense of it amounting to a great deal.  It will be well within the competence of the profession to meet its annual outgoings by a modest, reasonable, retention fee which will not be outrageous or excessive and which will be exactly the same in principle as what the Deputy doctors here have already accepted willingly and enthusiastically, a registration fee.  There is no difference in principle.</P>

      <P>As a result of our deliberations, the Minister will agree, we have now decided that the Medical Council shall undertake more functions than were originally envisaged in the Bill.  It will now undertake work of a public information type.  It will be keeping doctors informed, keeping the public informed and compiling a set of guidelines that will ensure that doctors maintain a high standard of professional behaviour in the public interest.  This is different from its predecessor, the Medical Registration Council.  The council now has members of the public on it, protecting the interests of the public and I disagree with the Minister in saying that this is a body by the profession to regulate the affairs of the profession.  It is not a body for that purpose because of the fact that, with our persuasion, the Minister has agreed to include a number of lay people on it.  That is very desirable but because of it I should like to see public moneys being applied to it to expand the work of the council in the public interest.  The Minister says that he will if ... Could we not provide in the Report Stage that this will be done?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Great.  I do not want to see the Minister as Minister for Health finding himself without a health service if the doctors resign <i>en masse.</i>  That would be very serious, We suggest altering the section which says that a doctor's name will be erased unless he pays the annual retention fee.  The Minister will agree that there is no comparison between a doctor's right to practise and being disbarred from a golf club.  The Minister says you must pay membership fees to your golf club; this is not the same; this is your right to practise, to earn a livelihood.  Could the Minister consider altering that section so as to <Col N="535" /> ensure that the consensus of the profession is obtained and not merely the views of the council?  It is not because I want to protect doctors.  I am thinking of the public being deprived of a medical service if all the doctors decide they will not pay and are all disbarred.  Could we have something to provide that you get agreement of the doctors?  If the Minister can include such a provision in an amendment&mdash; it is not easy, I know&mdash;he would ensure that situations like that would not arise.</P>
      <P>If there could be consultation with the medical representative organisations it would ensure that such a situation would not arise.  If the retention fee could be decided on after consultation the Minister would be relieved of a big burden.  Because of the nature of the work the Minister should provide the necessary funds to help to defray the costs of this body. This would ensure that the Oireachtas would have greater control over it. Public expenditure means public accountability and that is good in the interests of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's patience in relation to this matter but if he is helped by the discussion now it will save him trouble later on, as Deputy O'Connell says with a profession notorious for making trouble for their Ministers.  The Bill is to provide a new body to register and control those engaged in the practice of medicine and to regulate medical education and training at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. There are enormous implications here. The Minister may be bringing this in because he is impelled to due to outside pressure.  Of course, it is likely that the Minister's successors will decide to make the Medical Council into a body which will do its job, will be particularly conscientious about the level of vocational guidance in relation to intake, about the quality and scope of services, the expansion and removal of different kinds of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are all contentious issues which will require people of the <Col N="536" /> highest calibre to deal with them.  It will require all sorts of administrative facilities and physical building facilities to do that.  To update and extend disciplinary provisions is easy enough, but to make consequential provisions arising from the accession of the State as a member of the European Community and to repeal existing legislation&mdash;Heaven knows what the provisions arising out of accession to the European Community may lead to, but they must lead to a considerable expansion in the existing services of the Medical Council which hitherto were simply the keeping of a register. With the best will in the world, even knowing his own mind, the Minister cannot possibly say what his successors in office may decide working within the context of this Bill.  They will all have to work within the context of this Bill and any undertakings given which are not written into this Bill are worthless.  They will be guided by the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Under section 24 all expenses incurred shall be defrayed by the council out of funds at the disposal of the council and then the administrative costs will be paid for out of moneys voted by the Oireachtas to the Minister. Unless the Minister amends section 24 as well as amending section 40, the council will have to pay for any expansion of our services.  I cannot see why the members of our profession should have to pay for the maintenance and expansion of this body.  I can understand them paying a subscription to a registration institution. Matters in relation to the functions of the institution, such as deciding who shall be admitted from the European countries and who shall not be admitted, which standards are acceptable in relation to the amendment of laws and so on, are matters of State and not the business of the medical profession.  All of this work, which is inevitable to maintain high standards, has nothing to do with the medical profession.</P>
    <P>A medical practitioner goes through a very complicated expensive, long and tedious training to become a general practitioner.  That takes a tremendous lump out of any man's <Col N="537" /> life, making enormous demands on himself and his family.  That he should be accepted and recognised at a certain level by a reputable body everybody accepts; that there should be a nominal fee to pay for the expenses of keeping this register is also acceptable; but that he should then be told that he will have to maintain a costly expanding institution whose function is directed towards the maintenance of a particular vigilance in the public interest at the request of a Government Minister is outrageous.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any rationality in that at all.  This is an unlimited commitment because under section 25 the council will find the money themselves &mdash;in the retention fee presumably&mdash; and under section 40 the retention fee must be approved by the Minister.  If the medical profession do not agree in principle and make all the arguments that we have made here more eloquently and more persuasively, what will the Minister do about it?  There is a discrepancy between what one considers reasonable and what another considers reasonable.  There is no reasonable figure; it depends on individual circumstances.  It is vague in its implications from the point of view of expansion and expenditure, but it is not vague in its implications for the members of the profession, for their inevitable commitment under the provisions of this Bill.  They will have to fund this service even though it is no longer simply a registration or disciplinary body.  It has become very much more than that now because it has got to deal with the whole question of establishment of courses, the maintenance of the quality of the courses and then inspecting universities all over Europe.  It must be a very greatly expanding body, if not in the Minister's time, as time goes on.  If you like, it is an infinite commitment. There is no limit to the commitment for the retention fee if the provisions of this Bill are to be honoured&mdash;all expenses incurred by the council shall be defrayed by the council out of the funds at its disposal.  The Minister is giving them nothing except the cost of administration of the Bill, and that he will get from the Oireachtas, from the taxpayer.  Why not ask the doctors to <Col N="538" /> pay for that?  Why bother to come back to the Oireachtas for that money? Why not let the doctors pay the whole lot?</P>

I am not complaining at all about the simple question of registration; I accept that.  But I do resent the fact that a very elaborate service must in time grow out of this Bill, a costly service, for which the Minister is asking the medical profession to give him <i>carte blanche.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no quarrel with the Minister on the simple question of registration, the calibre of persons coming into the profession, staying in the profession and practising the profession and the whole question of discipline.  The difficulty is that the Minister is trying to get, on the cheap, a very elaborate institution which is an extension of the existing registration <Col N="541" /> mechanism.  Like architects, dentists, opticians and so on, nobody opposes that at all.</P>
      <P>The side note to section 35 reads:</P>
      <P>Functions of the Council in relation to Directives adopted by the Council of the European Communities as to education and training.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I am trying to make the point that the Minister, first of all, is telling the council that they must find all their own funds and, secondly, that he is giving them additional duties which will require an expanding institution, that the medical profession must pay for this in addition to paying for the right to be on a register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The road referred to by the Deputy is a county road and, accordingly, any work undertaken on this road falls to be financed from the county council's own funds supplemented <Col N="542" /> by the block grant which in the case of Kerry County Council amount to £315,000 in 1977.  The timing and execution of these works is a matter for decision by the council. There are no other funds at my disposal from which additional grants could be made available this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this road is collapsing and is causing great hardship to farmers in Cloghane and Castlegregory as they cannot travel to Dingle?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to a grant of £9,000 notified to Kerry County Council on 1st February, 1977 for repairs to Caragh Bridge, I allocated a special Road Fund grant amounting to £72,500 on 21st July, 1977, towards the cost of strengthening sections of this road.  I have no further funds at my disposal from which an additional grant can be made this year.  However, in determining the road grants for 1978, I will bear in mind the case for further works on this road.</P>

There is bogland on both sides. As this is one of the most important secondary roads in Kerry, would the Minister consider increasing the allocation for this road?

      <P>The Government's approach to co-operatives, including industrial workers' co-operatives, is that they would welcome the establishment of such enterprises not only as a means of creating jobs but also as a way of promoting valuable experiments in the area of industrial democracy involving worker participation in the fullest sense of that term.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy was still standing, I was not sure if he had finished.  The position is that the establishment of the Employment Action Team was announced on 4th August.  On the following day all parties represented on the team were invited to nominate members.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the month of August for many of those <Col N="552" /> nominating groups was a holiday period and there was a time lag.  The full composition of the team was announced on the 26th September and the first meeting took place on the 28th.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate that August is for most people a holiday month, would the Minister not agree that in view of the extreme urgency of this matter, an urgency which his party have repeatedly emphasised, to allow eight weeks to elapse between the announcement of the team and the holding of its first meeting&mdash;which, as far as I could see from pictures in the papers was only a meeting at which pencils were sharpened and blotting paper was doodled on&mdash;shows no real sense of the urgency of this matter?</P>

      <P>It is not fair to the Employment Action Team to say that that was what happened at their first meeting.  As I mentioned in my reply, at the first meeting of the action team four working groups were set up.  This I regarded as being a very positive step in the right direction.  The first working group undertook to examine the training and preparation of young people for work, the second group to examine employment incentives, the third group to examine job creation and the fourth group to examine the distribution of work.  I repeat that the time lag referred to was mainly because of the delay and difficulties being experienced by some of the nominating bodies.  If this had not happened, the team could have met earlier.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The EEC social regulations for transport include provisions regarding the installation of tachographs in commercial vehicles covered by these regulations.  The purpose of the tachograph is to facilitate the enforcement of the regulations governing such matters as hours of driving, breaks from work and rest periods.</P>
      <P>Installation of tachographs in vehicles engaged in international transport has been required under the EEC regulations since the 1st January, 1976. Draft regulations to be made under the European Communities Act, 1972, for enforcement of this requirement in Ireland have been submitted to the EEC Commission for clearance, and correspondence with the Commission in the matter has not been completed.</P>
      <P>Various changes in the social regulations applying primarily to national transport, including changes relating to the installation of tachographs have been under discussion by the Council of Transport Ministers for some time past.  Decisions on these changes were reached at the Council meeting of the 27th October last which, <i>inter alia</i>, included the approval of a clause which empowers the Commission to give Ireland a further period of up to three years after the 1st January, 1978, to phase in the driving periods and so on laid down in the regulations.  The situation as to the installation of tachographs in vehicles covered by the regulations which are engaged in national transport is now as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the present time tachographs should be installed in newly registered vehicles and those engaged in carriage of dangerous substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As from the 1st January, 1978, tachographs should be installed in vehicles covered by the regulations except for those engaged in transport <Col N="555" /> within 50 kilometres of base and those between 3.5 and 6 metric tons fully laden; these exceptions will cease as from the 1st July, 1979.</P>
    <P>As from the 1st January, 1980, all vehicles coming within the regulations should have installed an EEC-type approved tachograph.</P>
    <P>The regulations, as amended under the decisions taken on the 27th October last, exclude certain limited categories of vehicles from the tachograph requirement and other limited categories can be excluded after consultation with the Commission or after authorisation by the Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in regular contact with the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy about the future of these firms and their workers since the threat of closure first became known.  The Minister concerned, the IDA and the official liquidator are doing all they can to have the two companies sold as going concerns in order to preserve as much as possible of the existing employment. The position in this connection is affected to some extent by an industrial relations problem on which the liquidator has been having discussions with trade union representatives up to as recently as 1st November.  If, however all efforts to sell the enterprises as going concerns are not successful, extra endeavours will be made to provide compensating new industry in the area.</P>
      <P>I have arranged that the facilities of AnCO and of the National Manpower Service will be fully available to any workers made redundant to help them to find new jobs in other new and expanding projects in Cork.</P>

Government agencies will assist to this end and the IDA have been extremely active in the matter.  As the Deputy is well aware, problems were created as far back as June 10th and the difficulty was aggravated by the fact that the top management of the companies were not based in this country.  Consequently, it was difficult to make contact with anybody who was in a decision-making position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from AnCO that the mobile training centre in Kildare town was established <Col N="558" /> specifically to meet the needs of a large newly established industry which was coming to the town.  It was the expressed intention to move the centre elsewhere when those needs had been met.  AnCO state that those needs have now been met and they therefore propose moving the centre to Newbridge as soon as suitable premises are available in that town.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that sometime ago his Department gave an undertaking that for so long as there were applications for training in Kildare town, the AnCO centre would be left there?  Consequently, is this decision to close the centre not a change of policy?  Would he not agree, also, that the terms of reference of AnCO in Kildare in respect of the firm mentioned were changed to allow for the taking in of trainees from other areas?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is referring to a temporary decision taken in mid-1976 to the effect that when the training had ended for the work force to which he refers, the centre would continue to operate in Kildare town for a further period in order to train additional unemployed workers.  I am sure the Deputy is aware also that in reply to a question tabled by Deputy Power my predecessor said that a study was being carried out and that a decision would be taken in the near future.  Because that study has shown that the need for the training centre is greater in Newbridge than is the case in Kildare town it has been decided to transfer to Newbridge on the same basis as applied to its establishment in Kildare town.  The situation there will be kept under review in the future.</P>

However, during that time the review to which I have referred was undertaken as to the training needs of Kildare generally.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>There are six occupational guidance officer posts in the National Manpower Service at present and all of these posts are filled.  In addition two officers recently commenced a course of training abroad in occupational guidance and will be available for guidance work when they have completed the course in the summer of 1978.  The question of further additions to the service will be considered in the meantime.</P>
      <P>There are 60 placement officers currently employed and arrangements are in progress for the recruitment of a further 22 to bring the number in this grade to 82 as soon as possible.  The ultimate staffing needs of the placement function will be kept under regular review in the light of experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that the Minister is not very long in his post and that he certainly will get down to the job.  Is he aware that, according to the Institute of Personnel Management and the Institute of Training Managers. these six guidance officers must cater for 150,000 young people under the age of 19?  Would he not think that the figure is completely unrealistic and that we are sowing the seeds of dissatisfaction in places of employment because of this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the necessity for increasing the numbers. It is considered that there should be a guidance officer for every six placement officers, and that means that we should have about 14 at the moment.  Two extras are in training and I hope that, with the approval of the Minister for the Public Service, I will be able to create three additional posts in 1978.  I might also add that the embargo on the public sector did not help me in the past number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if, in view of the recent state of unofficial strikes, he will state (i) his attitude to these strikes (ii) the action his Department take to settle these strikes and (iii) the proposals he has to diminish the likelihood of these strikes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the Deputy's question my attitude to unofficial strikes is that, where management and trade unions have agreed on procedures for the conduct of industrial relations these procedures should be observed by both sides.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second part of the question I must refer to the role conferred by statute on the Labour Court. However, the monitoring section of my Department keep me informed of developments in all dispute situations as they occur and, on occasions, avail themselves of any opportunities to advise parties as to possibilities for settling a dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the final part of the question, about any proposals for reducing he likelihood of unofficial strikes, it is my firm view that the best prospects of success lie in initiatives that come from the trade union movement.  The proposed review body on industrial relations will, I hope, prove a suitable <Col N="572" /> forum for examining the difficulties in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree this is the area of most acute concern and most damage to our economic prospects, the area of unofficial disputes, and that it is also the area least amenable of a quick solution?  If he does, would he not consider at least talking to the unions about how best to cope with the situation in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about unofficial strikes.  This situation is serious for all sides of industry, for the Government and for the people.  As I said, I believe the initiatives must come from the trade union movement.  Of course, at any time I will discuss and support any initiatives they may suggest.</P>

      <P>In the event of an unofficial dispute taking place in a company, what services are available from the Minister's Department, or through the Labour Court, to bring the parties together where they refuse to come together in the first instance because it is unofficial?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is giving a false lead here because the encouragement of unofficial disputes, as one could gather from the question, would be very serious for everybody concerned.  As the Deputy is well aware, the services of the Department are available in normal circumstances in official disputes.  As well as that, the monitoring section to which I referred avail themselves of every opportunity to advise parties as to possibilities for settling a dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I categorically reject the Minister's inference as to the content of my supplementary question. Is the Minister aware that, in the event of an unofficial strike taking place, this is a great source of serious further unrest unless the sides are brought together?  The proper agencies to bring the sides together are the Labour Court or the Minister's Department.  I am asking if there are any services under the Minister's aegis which could allow the parties to be brought together in these unfortunate circumstances.  I do not promote these circumstances.  I wish to reject the <Col N="573" /> Minister's statement in that regard and I ask him to withdraw his remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that and I am happy to hear the Deputy say it.  The Deputy will realise that the proper procedure should be through the official channels which can then be handled by the agencies of the Department.  On the other hand, those agencies will always keep in touch with a situation and can be made available for talks, but there is the danger, and the Deputy will appreciate it I am sure, of an unnecessary or undesirable encouragement for an unofficial strike which would seriously harm our entire structure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In his attitude to unofficial strikes, does the Minister differentiate between strikes which take place in the public sector and those which take place in State or semi-State organisations which, relatively speaking, may enjoy a monopoly in the service type industries and in which perhaps his influence and initiative might have an impact for good?  In other words, does he differentiate between commercial companies and State and semi-State organisations in his attitude to strikes? Does he feel he has a particular responsibility for State and semi-State organisations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to consider a much more active and positive role for his Department and for the Labour Court in intervening at an early stage in disputes of an unofficial nature in particular? Will the Minister accept that usually intervention comes after strikes have done untold damage and have lasted far so many weeks?  Would the Minister consider using his powers and the powers of the Labour Court under the Industrial Relations Act to take the initiative in disputes of an unofficial nature in order to reduce the man-hours lost and to achieve the harmonious industrial relations we all want to achieve?</P>

I dearly wish to see harmonious relations but, as I said, I would prefer to see both sides coming together and reviewing the problem and reporting on ways and means by which we can have better and more harmonious industrial relations.  Unofficial disputes are serious and they are also undermining where the official trade union line has been ignored by people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring then to the subsection dealing with the removal of a practitioner's name because of failure to pay the retention fee.  I cannot accept that, and I have sought to establish that what is proposed throughout the Bill is reasonable, that the medical profession are being given statutory capacity to govern their own profession, look after their affairs, their training, their education, their discipline and their professional integrity.  We suggest it is reasonable in those circumstances, that as they have done up to now, the professional should be responsible for carrying the cost of administering the council's normal affairs.  I have gone so far as to say that if I or a successor in title asks the council to perform some function which is not contemplated within the ambit of the Bill, then it would be appropriate that funds should be made available to them from the Exchequer to cover the costs of any such function.</P>
      <P>Further than that, I suggest that if the Deputy still wishes to pursue the matter he should put down an amendment for Report Stage or, alternatively, in order to facilitate the Deputy, if he gives me, between now and Report Stage, an indication of the amendment he wishes to put down, I will consider it.</P>

      <P>It seems to be a rather unjust procedure for an indictable offence that would have no relation to the practice of his profession. I know is says: &ldquo;may&rdquo;, but, again, we give the council arbitrary power to decide.  It could conceivably happen that a man could be found guilty of manslaughter in driving a car.  If a civil servant or an employee in industry is found guilty of manslaughter, he does not lose his job on that account, but the medical practitioner loses the right to practise his livelihood.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too convinced about this point on the High Court.  The fact is that the council will proceed to erase his name.  Then he has recourse to the High Court, as we can all challenge everything in the High Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If he does not challenge it, then they, in effect, must go to the High Court to have his name erased.  The section says &ldquo;may&rdquo; but, as I have already indicated, in these circumstances that is equivalent to &ldquo;will&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

      <P>I accept that there are many different aspects to it.  Again, I think we can only rely on the common sense and responsibility and judicial capacity of the council.  One would not visualise the council moving to strike off a medical practitioner because he was found guilty in the courts of an indictable offence which none of us would regard as particularly serious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is exactly what it says, that where the council want to do so, where it is in the public interest, they may apply to the High Court for an order in relation to any person registered in any register maintained under this Bill that, during the period specified in the order, registration of that person's name in that register shall not have effect.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is giving the council powers too because the council can apply for this.  I am wondering what protection an individual would have in a case where there might be abuse of such powers by the council.  They might apply to the court in circumstances which might seem important to them but might not in reality be so very important at all.  If it is clearly spelled out that will be all right.  I am just considering the implications of it.  There is the danger that we might be using a sledge hammer to kill a fly.  That is what I am worried about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept there is that danger but we must give the council some sort of emergency powers to act in circumstances, for instance, in which a practitioner is suddenly discovered in the process of committing a serious crime or something comes to light which makes it urgently necessary that he should be removed from the register.  There is a danger that an injustice could be done, but I think everyone will accept that situations could arise where the council must act quickly and urgently.  In such circumstances it is almost certain the court would grant only an interim or interlocutory injunction pending full investigation.</P>

      <P>The council will be made up of men who are very busy. Indeed, I remember a member who was abroad most of the time and a great deal of the work was done not by the chairman or the council.  These will all be academics, very busy people, consultants involved in research, all trying to eke out a meagre living.  God knows, it is meagre enough.  Now I am wondering could we incorporate here something like &ldquo;the council by a majority decision&rdquo; to ensure that one person on behalf of the council does not do this.  Remember, it could be a vindictive act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it means the elected council but I am a little taken aback to discover the kind of circumstances in which this sort of section might be necessary because, as was pointed out, it could take the council some little time to come together to seek a High Court order.  I am not clear as to whether a more permanent order could be made.  I am wondering about the length of time it would take to convene the council.  Would it not be virtually as quick for the Fitness to Practise Committee to look into the matter?  I appreciate the section would only be used in emergency situations but it would have a prejudicial effect on any subsequent investigation by the Fitness to Practice Committee if that <Col N="592" /> committee were investigating the conduct of a member or a complaint about a member against whom their council had got an interim order in the High Court.  I do not think that would improve the doctor's case and, from that point of view, I am wondering just how necessary it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not difficult to visualise a situation where some very serious malpractice or crime would be revealed and it would be essential for the council to act immediately.  It dispenses therefore with all the normal procedures.  The Fitness to Practise Committee has to hold inquiries and so on and the matter might be so serious that the council would not wish to wait to go through all the formality of holding an inquiry and so they would go to the court and ask to have the name removed immediately from the register and then it would be a matter for the court to decide.  It might make an interim injunction or refer the matter back to the council or insist that the Fitness to Practise Committee inquiry be held.  This is designed to give the emergency power to the council to apply to the court.  I think it is necessary.</P>

      <P>This is the section that sets out what is or is not an offence in relation to a person making a false declaration or falsely holding himself out to be registered as a medical practitioner. It brings us back to a point I have made several times as to whether we should not try to introduce other areas of control in an effort to protect the general public.  Again, I invite the Minister to consider that before Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to subsection (2), it is amazing how well the 1927 Act has stood the test of time.  It is an Act of 50 years ago and so was drafted a little earlier than that.  For instance, sections 53 and 54 are virtually rewrites of sections 33 and 34 of the 1927 Act.  Quite a number of sections right through this Bill are virtually copied line by line from the original Act of 1927.  We all agree that one of the failures of that Act that has come about through the passage of time is in regard to the penalties, which do not bear any relation to present-day circumstances.  The fine was £25.  It is suggested here that <Col N="597" /> the fine should be up to £500.  I disagree with this sort of figure being written into legislation.  We have had problems very often in regard to grants and in other areas, where income limits or grants limits are written into legislation.  We know it takes a long time for legislation to be amended. Grants and income limits or monetary fines that are relevant in today's terms may be hopelessly out of date in five years' time.  In all those instances, if a figure is contained in a Bill, the Bill should also have a subsection allowing the Minister afterwards by order to vary the figure.</P>

      <P>With due respect to the Deputy, that would be most objectionable. Where the criminal law is concerned entirely different considerations apply.  I can understand the Deputy's point of view about the grants or anything of that nature but there would be very real objection to not stipulating by statute what the appropriate fine is where criminal matters are concerned.</P>

      <P>Perhaps in very rare circumstances.  We are dealing here with the criminal law where you can deprive a person of their liberty or property under the criminal code.  It is well established as good and proper parliamentary procedure that in that case you must spell out the fine in the statute. That is a very desirable principle to adhere to.  If necessary the statute can be amended, but where it is a fine or a term of imprisonment it must be stipulated in the statute.</P>

I assumed that while the Minister did not accept my <Col N="600" /> amendments he accepted the spirit of them and would bring them in on Report Stage.  In line with the Minister's thinking on this I would ask him to include this amendment to say that it shall be a function of the council to give guidance to the medical profession and to the public generally. As the Minister said this morning, this council will not be hidden away in some obscure place but will make its presence felt and the intention will be to keep the public informed.  It would be in the public interest for the Minister to accept this small amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In the best interests of democracy the Minister should consider a three-year term of office which would ensure a much broader representation of the profession.  Each term of office should be not longer than three years and a person should not be allowed to serve more than two consecutive terms of office.  We are religiously following the 1927 Act on this, but a three-year term of office can be very effective and it would not add enormously to the expense of the council to have an election once every three years.  This would also be in the best interests of the council.</P>
      <P>The quorum for the meeting is listed as seven.  This is not good.  Seven out of 20 is not sufficient and I would like to see more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the great danger.  That is what I was talking about earlier, the danger of a dictatorial approach.  An officer or council representative might on behalf of the council make application to the High Court for an injunction or an order against a medical practitioner and in this respect it is very dangerous.  That is why I ask for a decision by the majority of the council.  I note that three members could call a meeting of the council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the quorum must be seven.  Would the Minister consider a quorum of ten instead?  If people seek election to this council they should be prepared to attend the meetings.  After all they only have to <Col N="602" /> attend at least four meetings in the year.  The information I have to date is that they have never exceeded their statutory requirement and there have been four meetings a year only.  I would advocate a quorum of ten.  I mention merely in passing about there being four meetings a year; that is the statutory requirement.  I would also advocate a term of office of three years. That is all I am asking for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be inclined to agree with Deputy O'Connell at all in relation to the suggestion that the term of office of the members should be limited to three years.  I would have thought five years was a fairly standard length of time for appointment to quite a number of bodies such as this one.  That would be fairly reasonable.  There is the requirement that no person should be allowed hold office for more than two consecutive periods of five years, ensuring that there is no danger of a person being on the council for a great length of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Ten years is the maximum at any one time.  Many of us are members of bodies having a membership of approximately 25.  The usual quorum is seven or eight; that is a reasonable number.  It is very rarely that a body fails to meet through lack of a quorum.  I do agree that there be a stipulation of a minimum four meeting annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill we have given to the new council very many more duties than had the previous council as the Minister was at pains to point out earlier today.  Usually the requirement to meet four times a year is one that is placed on a body that has not got very many functions.  In view of the numerous additional functions that will be assigned to the new council on foot of this Bill we ought to require them to meet at least once every two months &mdash;which would be six times a year. But, instead of saying six times a year, we should say once every two months ensuring that they meet on a regular basis throughout the year.  There is also the tendency in some of these <Col N="603" /> organisations required by statute to meet only three or four times a year to realise towards the end of the year that they have had two meetings only so that in the last month or six weeks they meet, perhaps, twice to fulfil their statutory requirement.  Therefore, it might be better to require them to meet every alternate month.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Second Schedule, the conditions in relation to the appointment of a president, the resignation of members and so on are fairly standard ones usually found in relation to bodies such as this.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 15 of the Second Schedule reads:</P>
    <P>Minutes of the proceedings of all meetings of the Council shall be drawn up and entered in a book kept for that purpose and such minutes shall be signed by the chairman of the next ensuing meeting.</P>
    <P>Some of the functions of this council will be very important.  They may well affect the livelihood of doctors and may involve far-reaching proposals in relation to the training and education of doctors in the graduate and post-graduate areas.  There ought to be contained in that paragraph a specification as to who is to draw up the minutes and, more importantly, that the minutes should be circulated to the members and agreed at the next meeting. It is not sufficient to say minutes should be entered in a book and signed by the chairman at the next ensuing meeting if the chairman and majority of members at the next meeting do not agree that they are an accurate record of what took place.</P>
    <P>I know the council have been given power to drawn up their own standing orders.  It always intrigues me when we set out, in statute, to draw up what is really two-thirds of the standing orders of a body and finish off by saying: &ldquo;We now give this body the power to draw up its own standing orders&rdquo; because it has not got very much power to draw up standing orders after taking into account the restrictions the Oireachtas has placed on it.  But it is important that the minutes of a council such as this, which will be taking very <Col N="604" /> important decisions, should be agreed by its members as being an accurate record and only then signed by the chairman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with Deputies' points in the order in which they were raised.  First of all, a quorum is normally a quarter of the membership. That is usual, standard practice. A quarter of 25 is six and a quarter, so we make it seven.  I am not prepared to squabble about the difference between seven, eight or nine.  I will consult again with the various bodies concerned to ascertain what they might think would be appropriate.  To settle on a quorum of seven is reasonable. We have got to try to maintain a balance. Deputies of this House know how difficult it is to get quorums.  It is very difficult in this House to get sufficient members together to provide a quorum. It is not wise to pitch the number too high.  On the other hand, the number should be sufficient to ensure a reasonably representative meeting.  More or less standard practice in these areas is to settle for a quarter of the membership as a quorum.  However, I shall take another look at that.</P>
      <P>I think four meetings a year are sufficient. The existing stipulation is for two meetings a year.  We are increasing that to four.</P>
      <P>I should like Deputies to bear in mind that a great deal of the work of the council can be done by committees. An active member of the council will almost certainly be attending much more than four meetings a year.  Therefore, for a full, normal meeting of the council itself a stipulation of four meetings a year is sufficient.  They will probably hold more but to make a mandatory minimum of four is sufficient for our purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should not like to go below five years for the life of the council.  As Deputy O'Connell pointed out, the members of this council will be busy men and women carrying on their own practices, working in hospitals, doing their job, going on courses, undergoing post-graduate education and so on. Doctors are very busy people right across the board of the profession. Therefore, the minimum amount of <Col N="605" /> upset there is the better.  I think five years is just about right.  It is sufficiently long to ensure stability and continuity without being too long.  In fact, it coincides with a lifetime of the Dáil and, perhaps, that is not a bad standard to go by.</P>
    <P>I can understand there being different opinions about what is the optimum in these areas, or what may be the most desirable standard to adopt. Without wishing to defend every comma in the Bill&mdash;the House will understand I have no wish to do that&mdash; on this aspect the Bill is fairly sound&mdash; four meetings a year minimum, a quorum of a quarter of the membership and a lifetime of five years.  Particularly when one takes into account the election aspect, it will be seen that these will cost some money; they will cost some deflection of time and energy.  Therefore, we should not have them too often.  On the other hand, we should make sure that the council do not become moribund and out of touch.</P>

All I am interested in is the question of rights.  I do not think that four people should make the decision.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would consider the matter between now and Report Stage.  There is also the question of the five-year period. We are talking about a profession of 3,000 persons.  By reducing the term of office to three years we could ensure that many members of the profession could serve a time on the council. It might be in the best interests of the council that all members get an opportunity to serve on it and to formulate proper guidelines for themselves.  The reason I suggested the three years was to give a broader representation over a specified period.</P>

      <P>This is the point I have been making to the Minister throughout our discussion.  The Title purports to represent the Bill as being:</P>
      <P>An Act to provide for the setting up of a council ... which shall provide for the registration and control of persons engaged in the practice of medicine ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="608" /> In our discussions on Committee Stage the Minister agreed that this Bill does not control persons engaged in the practice of medicine.  Only persons who are registered with the council are controlled. The Title also states:</P>
    <P>... and to provide for other matters relating to the practice of medicine and the persons engaged in such practice....</P>
    <P>I agree with the Title and I think it should describe what is in the Bill. The Title purports to make this an Act of Parliament eventually that will control persons engaged in the practice of medicine, but on Committee Stage the Minister admitted that it will not have this control.  I want to draw his attention once again to this area and to suggest that the Bill should contain provisions to match the laudable purpose and intention set out in the Title.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), line 14, to insert &ldquo;agus Soisialaí,&rdquo; after &ldquo;Eacnamaíochta&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure adequate and full recognition of social policy in relation to this new Department.  When I spoke on Second Stage I expressed some major reservations about the commitment to social planning and development so far as that Department was concerned.  I indicated then that I would consider putting down an amendment of this kind.</P>
      <P>Since then I have had the benefit of listening to the new Minister for Economic Planning and Development and some of the Government backbenchers and I am more convinced now than I was then that this amendment should be made.  I was disappointed with the new Minister's speech because he made no reference to the social aspect of his new position.  In his defence it might be said that it was a short contribution and his maiden speech but there is an old saying that first impressions are the most lasting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened very carefully to hear what answer he would give to the reservations <Col N="611" /> I expressed about the social aspect of his new position, but I did not hear anything that would reduce my reservations.  Government backbenchers spoke more or less in the same vein.  A number of them gave the definite impression that this Bill was a repeat of the programmes for economic expansion, in other words, this was the fourth programme.  They praised everything those programmes accomplished and were looking forward to a similar performance and results from this measure.</P>
    <P>I am pressing this amendment for those reasons and hope it will be accepted.  I note that throughout the Bill there is reference to economic and social planning and development. Nevertheless, the Department will be known as the Department of Economic Planning and Development, and the new Minister will be called the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  There has been a great deal of reference to the Minister and his Department in the media &mdash;radio, television and the Press&mdash; as the Minister for and Department of Economic Planning and Development. This is very bad particularly when so much is expected of this Department in the social field.</P>
    <P>Social policy quite simply and clearly cannot be divorced from economic planning and policy.  Social progress cannot be allowed to wait until some unspecified future stage of economic development.  That seemed to be the answer the Minister for Finance gave in his reply, that is, that we cannot really think or do anything about social planning or development until we have first economic planning and development. Failure to recognise that social and economic planning and development must go hand in hand is a great disservice to the interests of the many disadvantaged groups in our society.</P>
    <P>There was created also the false impression&mdash;this came through in many of the speeches from the Fianna Fáil backbenchers&mdash;that before one can do anything in the field of social planning and development, it is necessary first to have a lot of finance on hand.  This is not necessarily so. <Col N="612" /> There are many aspects of social planning and development that can be put through on foot of very little expenditure but I appreciate that the major part of social development necessitates increased resources.  Unless all aspects of our national policy are designed to guarantee social as well as economic achievement at all stages the problems of the unemployed, of the poor, of the badly housed, and of the victims of discrimination, will not be solved.  Rather, they will be added to as time goes on.  This is the unfortunate lesson of history in all free enterprise economies.</P>
    <P>Experience has shown that there is no guarantee that social progress follows automatically on economic progress.  This is why we are pressing to have this very important word put into the title of the Department and into the Minister's title.  I can point to many instances in this country in which, in the name of economic planning and development, certain lines of action were taken that resulted in disastrous social consequences.  For example, I can cite the many job closures that occurred supposedly for purposes of economic planning and development, of rationalisation or modernisation and all of which had serious social consequences.  In my own constituency the coal mines were closed for economic reasons.  The closures had disastrous social consequences.  Time has shown that these decisions should not have been taken, not only from a social but also from other points of view.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I wish to emphasise that the idea that social development goes hand in hand with economic development is not accurate.  Social planning must take into account the problems of inequality, not merely by catering for their immediate effects but by creating conditions for their eventual elimination.  It is a useless exercise to continue to treat symptoms of social disadvantage without coming to grips with the underlying causes of these problems.  The new Department and the new Minister should have a clear, definite and positive identification with social policy.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading, I made some of my case for this and I do not <Col N="613" /> wish to repeat what I said.  After I had spoken on that occasion many of the speakers supporting the Government referred to what they regarded as the success of the various programmes for economic expansion.  It was a source of concern for me to realise the level of their social thinking in their approach to the new Department.</P>
    <P>There were three Fianna Fáil programmes for economic expansion covering the period from 1959 to 1972. The first of these related to the period 1959 to 1963 and was completely and utterly devoid of any social content. The line taken in that document was based on the theory of baking a larger national cake and that when it would be baked we could decide how much of it should be devoted to improvements in social developments.  Unfortunately that programme did not provide much in the way of social policy or development.</P>
    <P>The second programme was intended to cover the period 1964 to 1970 but it collapsed and was abandoned in 1967.  It went but a little further in relation to social matters <i>vis-à-vis</i> the first programme.  It included some measure of discussion of the State's social services but the whole emphasis again was on economic rather than social policy.  The main commentary that can be made in respect of those programmes relates to their emphasis on economic growth to the point of ignoring the views of those who were concerned deeply with the hardships and injustices in our society.</P>
    <P>The third programme was merely an academic exercise.  It sank shortly after its publication but at least it was entitled &ldquo;A Programme for Economic and Social Development&rdquo;.  At the time much play was made of the great advances that it heralded in social planning.  Two whole chapters of the programme were devoted to social development.  These chapters dealt with a range of important social issues. Special attention was given to education, to health, to housing and to social welfare but because the programme as a whole collapsed no real social planning resulted from it. Indeed, the history of this country in the area of planning for social <Col N="614" /> development is pathetic in the extreme. Nobody would deny that many worth-while and far-reaching advances have been made down through the years but there has been absolutely no progress in relation to the co-ordination of development activities.  We have failed to develop either the methods or the structures for the systematic planning of our social policy and there is nothing in the Bill to suggest that we can hope for any real improvement in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Unless the new Department have real responsibility for social planning, the necessary complement of skilled personnel and the backing of a genuine socially-minded political will at the level of Government, I cannot see any successful break-through on the planning front.  For those reasons I propose the insertion of these amendments into the Bill.  I hope that they will be accepted in the spirit in which they have been put forward because unless we can involve everyone in the planning and development and in the discussions leading up to plans and developments and unless we concern our plans with people, people will not be concerned with our plans.  To get people involved the social identification of this Department must be paramount.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Public Service in his reply on Second Stage debate said that inserting the words &ldquo;and Social&rdquo;, would create an unnecessarily long title.  With respect, I do not think that this is a good argument.  The amount of goodwill and attraction for people to involve themselves in this planning and development that would follow from the social impact of this measure would far outweigh the small disadvantages of having a long title. We have seen the Minister for Industry and Commerce becoming the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  This amendment which I propose, and which will undoubtedly lengthen the title of the Department and of the Minister, is of far greater importance and significance than the adding to the title of the Minister for Industry and Commerce the word &ldquo;Energy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have had other examples of <Col N="615" /> decisions arising from economic plans which again had serious social consequences. I refer to previous Fianna Fáil Governments in relation to housing where they decided for economic reasons to go for low-cost housing&mdash; I will not identify any area&mdash;in order to solve the social problem of housing people.  That type of economic policy in relation to housing brought about disastrous social consequences for the people who have now to live in those low-cost houses with the developments that arose from strictly economic considerations. Any economic consideration must be guided by social principles. If the policy of previous Fianna Fáil Governments in relation to the provision of housing, and if those decisions had been guided and influenced by social considerations, we would not have the very obvious disastrous social consequences which that type of economics produced.</P>
    <P>There are many other examples but I hope I have said enough to convince the Minister that he should accept this amendment.  The Minister for the Public Service, and everyone else in this House, is anxious to see the new Minister successful in the job for which the Department was established.  The Minister will not succeed to the extent that we would like him to succeed unless he has this clear identification with social policy, and he can have that only by having the word &ldquo;Social&rdquo; included in the Minister's title and in the Department's title.  I hope earnestly that this amendment will be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I could, but I will not, follow Deputy Pattison down the road of what was said on this side of the House on Second Stage debate, but I will place on record the fact that I disagree with and refute Deputy Pattison's interpretation of what was said on this side of the House.  We are discussing here an amendment, with which are associated nine other amendments, the purpose of which is to add the words &ldquo;and Social&rdquo; to &ldquo;Economic&rdquo; in the title of the Department and of the Minister wherever they appear in the Bill.  It is significant that in the rather lengthy contribution we had from Deputy <Col N="616" /> Pattison in only one sentence did he make any reference&mdash;a passing reference&mdash;to the fact that the substance of the Bill dealing with the functions of the Department does what he is talking about.  It is a little unreal to ignore the functions of the Department as set out in section 2 (2) where it says:</P>
      <P>It shall be the function of the Department of Economic Planning and Development&mdash;</P>
      <P>and then there are five sub-paragraphs in which different functions are set out.  The first refers to economic and social planning, the second and third to economic and social development, and the fourth and fifth to economic and social plans.  That is where the functions of the Department and of the Minister are set out.  What Deputy Pattison is talking about is not the function of the Department or of the Minister, but simply the title.  I say that in order to get this matter into perspective, because nobody can argue that the functions of the Department as set out in the Bill ignore the social aspect by concentrating on the economic aspect.  This is demonstrable from what I have just quoted, so what Deputy Pattison is saying is that we must add the word &ldquo;Social&rdquo; to the title of the Department and the title of the Minister. It is not unreasonable to assume that he is saying that we must do this if we are (a) to show that we are sincere about social development and (b) to ensure that there is social planning and development.  I do not think, with all due deference to Deputy Pattison, that that argument stands up.  It is not logical and it does not make very much sense.  If one is concerned about what this Department will do, one has to be concerned about its functions.  If one is concerned about the title one wants to ensure that it is reasonably indicative of what that Department is concerned with.  That is all.  The title is not by any means indicative of what any Department is involved with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Pattison referred to the recent change in the title of the former Department of Industry and Commerce which is now the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.  The <Col N="617" /> reason for that change is that the functions in relation to energy were transferred from another Department.  The Department is being given new functions. There is not any question here of new functions.  The functions are set out in section 2 (2) of the Bill as I have quoted so it is not necessary to demonstrate that there is any change of function for this Department.  If we talk about the title, we are not talking about the substance of social planning or development.  We are simply talking about the title of the Minister and the title of the Department, as I indicated on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>We will not achieve anything additional in regard to social planning and development if we add the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; to the title of the Department. We will, by the addition of this word, create the longest and most cumbersome title of all the Departments of State.  We certainly will not get any improvement in performance as regards social or economic planning.</P>
    <P>I sympathise to some extent with the point of view Deputy Pattison is expressing but I suggest to him that in so far as there need be any concern in this regard it is met in the definition of the functions of the Department and that nothing is gained by putting the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; into the title.  We are making life more difficult by adding to the title and gaining nothing.  In the circumstances I can see no possible advantage in accepting this amendment, incorporating a further word or in some cases two words into the title of the Minister and the Department with no gain because the substance is contained in the functions of the Department as set out in section 2 (2).</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a case for the amendment because I said, and he has repeated, that the Bill contains many references to economic and social planning and economic and social development.  I recognised that fact when I moved the amendment.  I cannot see why it should be ignored in the title.  It is the title which creates the image because it is the title that is used on radio, television and newspapers.  It is the Minister for Economic Planning and <Col N="618" /> Development; it is the Department for Economic Planning and Development which we find in references to the Minister and the Department in the media.  The media will not publish the Bill every time the Minister's name is mentioned.  They will not publish section 2 (2) to give the Minister his full title and functions.  They would adequately cover it if the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; were inserted.  All the paragraphs in section 2 (2) have a social context.  As the Minister said everywhere in the Bill the functions of the Department are referred to as social as well as economic planning.  Why have we not got this in the Title because that is the part of the Bill everybody will know the Department and the Minister by?  It is inconsistent to have the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; mentioned so many times in the Bill and yet not have it in the Title.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the Department of Industry and Commerce which I previously referred to.  Energy was part and parcel of that Department up to some years ago.  Many people still thought it was part and parcel of that Department.  It was not until the Government made the change that some people realised that energy was with the Department of Transport and Power for some years.</P>

      <P>The Minister made the point about a new function which it was not.  If we wanted to economise on words people would just as easily understand that industry and commerce contained energy even without its identification with the Department. The Minister said that it was mentioned in the Bill a number of times. It is as much part and parcel of the Department as the economic side.  I fail to see why we cannot have it in the title of the Minister and the Department.</P>

      <P>I do not think it matters a lot what the Department is called.  The important thing is what the Department does.  Perhaps it would be a good thing if Departments were not named and that when Deputy O'Donoghue becomes Minister he is <Col N="619" /> known as Minister No. 17 in charge of Department No. 17.  Possibly the ideological implication of the numerically designated Ministers might not suit some of us.  I think the Minister might reasonably accept the amendment because it is not a very important matter.  I see certain merit in what Deputy Pattison is saying that when the Minister or his Department are referred to in the newspapers or in the media in any way it will be brought home continuously to people what the Minister's functions are.  The people will realise that the functions of the Department are not just economic planning and development but are also social planning and development. I agree with Deputy Pattison that it would be a continual reminder to people that Deputy O'Donoghue will have other functions besides economic planning and development. He will also, as the Bill sets out, be responsible for social planning and social development.  That is the way it is worded in the subsection.</P>
      <P>As regards Transport and Power the word &ldquo;power&rdquo; created great difficulty in Europe when I was Minister in charge of that Department.  I do not know how the Department came to be the Department of Transport and Power or the Department of Transport and Energy in the early sixties when it was founded but in Europe the use of the word &ldquo;power&rdquo; without the word &ldquo;energy&rdquo; created a lot of difficulty. After a few years there I set the wheels in motion to change the name to the Department of Transport and Energy.  The Department of Industry and Commerce then had certain relations to energy.  I was anxious that either those functions would be tranferred to the Department of Transport and Energy as I wanted the Department called or as the Government have now done transferred the energy section to the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>There was quite a definite split.  It came at the shoreline.  Outside the shoreline the Department of Industry and Commerce were responsible, and inside the Department of Transport and Power were responsible.  That was just by the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" /> I do not think what any Department are called is important.  As against that, I accept what Deputy Pattison said.  If we are to name Departments we might as well name them for all their functions.  Obviously there are far more functions in the Department of Industry and Commerce than just energy and we could not name them all.  In this case, with a new Department, the emphasis should be put on the fact that social planning is involved as well as economic planning.  The name might help people to remember that in the years and months ahead.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barry put his finger on the situation when he said it really does not matter a damn what a Department are called.  What is important is what they do.  That is my attitude too.  If I thought the addition of the words &ldquo;and Social&rdquo; to the title of the Department or the Minister would make one iota of difference to anybody, I would have no hesitation in accepting this and the associated amendments.  Quite honestly, I do not think it would make the slightest difference.</P>
      <P>We are not concerned with the image of the Department.  That is not what is at stake.  Whatever image the Department will have in due course will depend on the manner in which the Department and the Minister deal with the functions set out in substance in subsection (2).  If we are talking about images that is what the image will come from and not from the title.  I do not think it would make the slightest difference.  If I did, I would have no hesitation in accepting the amendement.  It would have certain admittedly minor disadvantages by including it but, since there is no counterbalancing advantage, I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>On the point of what the Department may do or accomplish, from experience far too many people associate economic planning with the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.  Unfortunately, that is an historic fact.  For the proper functioning of the Department and in order to get better results it is important to create a definite and clear image from the <Col N="621" /> outset that the Department definitely and without doubt are involved in and concerned with social problems and social policy and not involved in the narrow meaning of the word &ldquo;economic&rdquo;. The narrow interpretation of that word is the creation of a climate wherein a small minority can get richer, where the speculator can get back to the atmosphere of the sixties, and where a few people can make a lot of money.  That interpretation of &ldquo;economics&rdquo; should be discouraged and every effort should be made to ensure that this Department are not associated with that type of image.</P>
      <P>I have subsequent amendments down about the involvement of the social partners in plans, and deliberations on those plans, because I envisage discussion and dialogue with what have become known as the social partners.  For that reason, the slight encumbrance the addition of these words to the title would be to the Bill would be far outweighed by the impact the Minister and the Department would make if they were known as the Minister for and Department of Economic and Social Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to reconsider his position on this amendment.  I put it down in the belief that more people would be involved in tackling the enormous problem of employment in particular.  It would identify the Department more clearly with the unemployment problem which is an economic problem to some, and a social problem to others, while to me it is an economic and a social problem. To create employment for the unemployed and for those who will be coming on the employment market in the years ahead, and to get the full involvement of all the social partners and all their constituent members, the more wide-embracing the title is the better.  The Department would work better and get better results, and that is what this is all about.  Both sides of the House want to ensure that the Department will get the best results possible.  Adding these words to the title would help to get those results and would help in the formulation of policy and plans and, more important, in the implementation of whatever plans are put forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to say what my attitude will be to legislation coming here either from the Minister for the Public Service, Deputy Colley, or the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Deputy O'Donoghue.  On Second Stage we will establish the principle of the Bill that has been moved by the Government and, as will happen inevitably, it will be accepted by the House because of the Government's majority here.  I would hope that on Committee and subsequent Stages we could concentrate as elected representatives of the people on improving those Bills, accepting that the House in general has agreed to them as proposed legislation.</P>
      <P>I am not singling out any particular party in this connection because probably we have been as guilty as anybody else in Government, but we lose sight of the fact that we were elected here as 148 Deputies to produce legislation to improve the running of this country.  The wisdom in doing this is not confined to any one section of the House or to those coming down those gangways on the left and on the right. I know it is against the tradition of this Government&mdash;and, indeed, they were somewhat shocked when some of the backbenchers of the previous Government did not follow their tradition&mdash; to speak here against aspects of legislation being proposed by the Government, although still vote for the Government when it came to a division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see anything wrong with that.  From the country's point of view it would be quite untenable that any group of backbenchers in a political party could so blackmail the leaders of the party or parties in Government <Col N="624" /> to bring them consistently down, maybe once a month or once every six months.  I think the Whip system is necessary.  What might be a better way out of it, but it is a matter for another debate on Dáil reform, would be that the Dáil could not fall during the period for which it was elected.  I genuinely want to try to improve any legislation introduced.  This will apply more particularly perhaps to the Finance Bill when it comes in in the New Year.  On Committee Stage I will seek &mdash;I am only human and maybe I will fall&mdash;not to put forward political points but to make a genuine efforts to contribute to the legislation passed in this House.  The Minister may not agree with the points I make; I will accept that, but I will try not to make political points on Committee and other Stages.  There may be Bills where this will not be possible.  The Bill itself may be political and the sections of the Bill therefore will also be political. I may be on the road to hell but for as long as I am spokesman for my party on Finance, Economic Planning and Development and the Public Service, that is the attitude I will try to adopt on legislation.</P>
    <P>I say that in introducing the amendment in my name because we have gradually over the years lost the sense of the importance of this House.  We have done this nearly unconsciously and unknowingly.  Ignoring section 2 (2) (a) but taking (b), (c), (d) and (e) as drafted I quote:</P>
    <P>(b)  to identify the policies it considers necessary for general economic and social development and to report thereon to the Government,</P>
    <P>(c) to review and appraise the plans and activities of Departments of State giving effect to the policies for general economic and social development adopted by the Government,</P>
    <P>(d)  to make proposals to the Government ....</P>
    <P>(e)  to review the implementation of such national economic and social plans as may be approved of by the Government from time to time and to report thereon to the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="625" /> There is no word about coming back to the Dáil, the Members of which will pass this legislation, who are setting up this new Department, to whom the Minister is ultimately responsible.  He is a member of the Government, but his responsibility is to the people and to their elected representatives in this House.  There is no provision in this Bill which says he must come back here and account for his stewardship.  The amendment in my name seeks to do that among other things, seeks to make him lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas the plans he has and show the effectiveness of those plans after a period of time.  Perhaps the most important part of his job&mdash;and he probably recognises this in articles he has written&mdash;will be looking at public expenditure, which now accounts for a very large proportion of our GNP. It has grown over the years under different Governments and perhaps more proportionately under our last four years than in the previous periods of the Fianna Fáil Government.  It is something that must worry everybody and it must be the first point of attention as far as the new Minister is concerned, as the amendment says, &ldquo;to prepare and publish general estimates of public expenditure, both capital and current, and to relate such estimates to the growth of national resources and to the estimated growth of Government revenue....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is necessary that any such plan or preparation of policies in this regard should be debated in this House.  As I said, in anything the new Minister has written over the last five or ten years he has been constantly aware of the amount of the national resources that were being absorbed by public expenditure. These are matters to which he must devote his attention in this House.  Under the Bill which is now before us the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, need never come to this House except at Question Time.  Under all the paragraphs of subsection (2) with the exception of paragraph (a)&mdash; which I have also incorporated in my amendment because it appears to be a paragraph of subsection (2) that might be effective, and I have made that (c) in mine&mdash;he need never come into this <Col N="626" /> House to tell us what he is doing, what plans he has or how successful he has been.  It is in an effort, as much as maybe hoping to get at him, to preserve this House as the important body it is in this country that I have drafted the amendment.  I hope quite genuinely that the Minister will accept that from the point of view of the democracy and the importance of Dáil Éireann the provisions I propose in subsection (2), would be more effective in that regard and would give more public accountability than subsection (2) of the Bill as drafted which only makes the Minister responsible to the Government; he need only report to and discuss these matters with the Government, never in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 5 in my name is to ensure that an outline plan for a period of at least four years ahead is published annually, and to see to it that the new Department are not confined merely to reporting, monitoring and reviewing plans on behalf of the Government. This amendment would make it mandatory&mdash;and I believe rightly so&mdash;for the new Department to present an outline plan, or a Green Paper it could be called, for at least four years ahead.  It could be five or six years but four is the figure I have chosen as a suitable period in which the targets of the medium-term policies in the new plan might have the fullest impact.</P>
      <P>In proposing the presentation of an outline plan I am, of course, looking upon planning as a continuous process with policies, targets, strategies and so on being under continuous review and subject to amendment in relation to the external environment, such as improvements in sterling, growth rates, volume of trade and so on, and the performance in a given year of the economy itself.  This will be a plan subject to review every year, with additions to and amendments in policies and the ways of implementing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now to achieve that, there is need for the full involvement of all sections in the community and that is why it is so very necessary to have an outline plan or a Green Paper published <Col N="627" /> annually since, if such information were not published annually, it would be very difficult to get the full involvement required from all sections of the community in order to achieve the objectives laid down in the plan. People can only feel involved and make their full contribution if they are brought into the process before final decisions are taken.  They must be given the opportunity of voicing their opinions on the policies proposed and they cannot do that unless the policies are published in an outline plan.  I do not want to hark back but we must learn from experience.  Unfortunately the lesson from the past has been that the three programmes for economic expansion under the previous Fianna Fáil Governments were published as White Papers.  The Government had already taken vital decisions.  The general public and even the Members of the Oireachtas were not involved in the formulation of these programmes and that approach led to an inflexible programme and a resultant failure.</P>
    <P>The main goal in any plan for the immediate future must be full employment. There is no hope of any success in this enormous national task if people are not wholeheartedly behind the Government and such support can only be built on a full understanding of all that is involved in the plan.  In order to get a full understanding of all that is involved publication is absolutely essential.  Secondly, the Department should produce the outline plan setting the broad aims and goals of the plan, the main policy options and the projected budgetary expenditures as well as the projected tax revenue. The Minister might argue this would be a diminution of the Government's role.  It would not, in fact, be any diminution of the Government's role.  On the contrary, it would maximise public involvement and education in these matters.  Another criticism might relate to the time factor.  Consultation takes time but a strict timetable for such consultation could be laid down and adhered to.  Following the publication of the outline plan comes the involvement of the Oireachtas. After that it would be the Government <Col N="628" /> and the new Department which would eventually assume responsibility for the plan and the ultimate decisions in regard to policy and revenue allocation.</P>
    <P>What the amendment seeks is a fairly detailed presentation in the outline plan of public expenditure estimates and revenue receipts for four years ahead. These figures could be adjusted from time to time should the need arise. This is something that has never been done here.  The United Kingdom is more advanced in this method of management than we are but there is no reason why we should not adopt a similar system particularly in the light of the new Department stimulating planning in other Departments.  Expenditure estimates would have to throw light on policies and policy choices.  They would also assist the Dáil, the social partners and the general public.  They would focus attention on key policy decisions and help to create a climate of discipline and understanding in regard to economic and social problems generally and the policies to be adopted in relation to them.</P>
    <P>The publication of this outline plan should take place in the December-January period just before the annual budget.  That would be the most appropriate time.  The National Economic and Social Council commented on the National Coalition's Green Paper at page 25 of report No. 33 as follows:</P>
    <P>The description of a policy objective, without a spelling out of the beneficial consequences that will follow if it is achieved, is not enough. Objectives which are otherwise feasible can be achieved only to the extent that the Government and the community are committed to them&mdash; that there is a willingness to accord priority to the national interest over sectional interests.  Specific policies and measures will not be sufficient by themselves&mdash;they will be effective only if they evoke the responses needed to achieve the desired results.</P>
    <P>That exhortation should be noted because we have to focus and encourage public attention on a continuing basis on the work of the new <Col N="629" /> Department.  That can only be done by accepting this amendment No. 5.</P>
    <P>I shall deal now with amendment No. 6 designed to ensure that the Dáil and Seanad are involved in debating outline plans.  This is most important because the elected representatives of the people have a particular right to contribute to the evolution of both policies and plans.  This amendment is for the purpose of facilitating debate in the Oireachtas.  It should be noted that the Oireachtas had not been previously consulted in relation to economic programmes.  There is another reference in the National Economic Social Council Report 21 about the lack of Oireachtas consultation.  That is why there should be embodied in this Bill a section making it mandatory for such involvement to take place.  The NESC Report 21 on public expenditure at page 48, paragraph 6.2, says:</P>
    <P>First, a strategy for economic and social development is required.  No such statergy has existed since the mid-1960s.  There were, of course, the Second Programme for Economic Expansion and the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development.  But the extent to which the Government was committed to them was at best always ambiguous.  Neither of these Programmes was debated in Dáil Éireann.  Neither of them seemed to be widely accepted in the public service as a framework for thought and action.  Indeed, very little was heard of the Third Programme after it was published.</P>
    <P>Again, it is essential to have both Dáil and Seanad fully involved in the evolution of policy and plans.  In other planning systems in other countries there is provision for the formal involvement of Parliament.  When I said some time ago that the Oireachtas were not involved in plans and policies, that might be answered by the Minister saying: &ldquo;We have the annual Estimates debated here and supplementary Estimates and that gives an opportunity to put forward plans and policies.&rdquo;  I submit that the Estimates debates are not suitable as an occasion for the full scale debate required. <Col N="630" /> Proper parliamentary involvement demands the presentation of a formal public document if the Government consider that suitable priority is to be attached to this very important work concerning regions and the nation as a whole and its various sections.  If the new Department is to have the importance we all want it to have, it is essential to have the presentation and discussion here of a formal public document.  It is no answer to say that we have the annual Estimates debates. The Department should get the status we think it should have.  Planning is not just an exercise in administration; it is not appropriate to the secretive processes of the civil service. Nor can it succeed through Government decisions, the Government dictating to the people.  It must be seen to be part of the democratic process of national development and that cannot be so without the involvement of the Oireachtas being clearly stated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The fact that planning was never really part of the democratic process might well have been the major contributing factor to its failure but with this Bill it should be made clear that from now on it will be a full part of the democratic process.  The outline plan or Green Paper to which I have referred could be put before the Oireachtas and debated on a motion noting its contents as has been done in other cases.  This would enable Members to comment and make constructive proposals on the plan before it is finally adopted by the Government. If the Minister has any fears about the timetable involved in such an exercise I, for one, would fully support him on a strict time schedule for such discussion even in this House.</P>
    <P>Going a little further, consideration should be given to the establishment of an Oireachtas committee charged with responsibility in regard to the long term review of plans.  This might help to shorten the debate on the motion coming before the House. Involvement of the Oireachtas, as this amendment proposes, would assist significantly in the acceptance of the plan proposed and to the creation of the national aim and purpose contained in that policy or plan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="631" /> I want to say a few words about amendment No. 7, the purpose of which is to ensure the involvement of the social partners whether under the aegis of the NESC or otherwise.  That would add to the general acceptability in the community at large of the Government's planning decisions.  It would also bring the professional expertise of the organised major interest groups in society directly into the planning process.  The mandatory involvement of the social partners in some way is essential.  The Minister might say that we can assume that that is contained somewhere in the Bill in the process of co-ordinating the work.  I hope that that intention is in the Bill but hoping that the intention is there is one thing and making sure it is there is another.</P>
    <P>This amendment would improve the Bill in that it would make consultation mandatory on the social partners particularly those involved in the NESC. The NESC is a widely representative body comprised of five representatives from the Confederation of Irish Industry, three members from the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, ten members from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, three members from the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, five members from the Irish Employers Confederation, four members from the Irish Farmers Association, plus 14 other members nominated by the Government and an independent chairman.  As can be seen, this is a very responsible and representative body and a very suitable forum for consultation.  The purpose of this amendment is to make consultation with the main economic and social groups mandatory rather than voluntary.  I have no doubt that the Minister in accordance with section 2 (2) of the Bill will be searching far and wide for ideas, suggestions and for a feed-back on whatever plans and proposals he might have in mind, and he will be approaching many groups and societies apart from the interests represented in the NESC.  It would be of assistance to the new Department and to the Government to have the obligation of formal consultation with the major interested groups, contained <Col N="632" /> in the Bill because it would provide a basis of understanding although not necessarily agreement for the Government's formal policy decisions.  It would also be of assistance to these groups who will be encouraged to contribute to public policy formulation if they are given this kind of facility within the legal framework of the Bill. It would mean that these people would contribute to policy formulation on an organised basis in an objective manner. They would have a formal opportunity of putting their decisions as interested groups to the Minister and to the Government.</P>
    <P>The consultation mechanism of the NESC is already there and that can be expanded upon or changed to facilitate other interested groups that are not currently represented in the NESC.  How the consultation would take place is a matter of detail.  If we can get this included in the Bill I am sure co-operation will be willingly forthcoming to arrange the necessary mechanism by which that can be achieved.  Consultation is a very convenient way of dealing with this aspect of the planning process.  The previous Government consulted with the NESC on many occasions and in the Green Paper of October, 1976, they were asked to deal with various aspects of that.  The National Economic and Social Council Comments on Economic Development No. 33 makes reference to this fact on page 36, paragraph 63. It states that:</P>
    <P>In the preparation of any plan for economic and social development, there should be the fullest possible consultations with those expected to contribute towards achieving its objectives.  These consultations should include all productive sectors &mdash;agriculturalists, as well as trade unions and industrial managers and employers.</P>
    <P>Basically my amendment is intended to achieve that kind of involvement. Coming now to amendment No. 8&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

      <P>Sorry, Deputy that is a different amendment. Amendment No. 4 is before the House. Amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 7 being related are being discussed with it.  We <Col N="633" /> can have separate decisions on two of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust that I have impressed the Minister with the necessity of giving this mandatory and statutory facility within the framework of the Bill to accomplish these very important matters&mdash;the publishing of the plan so that we can get full public involvement, the involvement of the Oireachtas so that the democratic process cannot just operate but can be seen to be operating in its fullest manner and the involvement of outside interested groups who have already shown in various ways their concern, co-operation and willingness to provide the kind of assistance which the Minister will require if he is to get a successful plan underway.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister is accepting these amendments.  I do not know but I hope his answer will not be that he is refusing, that there is already&mdash;in a vague kind of way&mdash;facility for this kind of process I am seeking in the Bill.  If there is, let us bring it in, identify it and make it mandatory within the framework of the Bill in a very definite, clear and positive way.  I do not believe for one moment that it is the intention of the Government to exclude the people I have made a case for.  I do not think it is; I think they want to involve everybody.  The way to do it properly is to accept these amendments, to have them part and parcel of the Bill setting up this Department.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether I shall be following Deputy P. Barry on the road to hell but I want to assure him, that, so far as I am concerned, it is my intention also&mdash;in regard to Committee Stages of Bills where amendments or suggestions are put forward from the Opposition that seem to me to make sense or to improve the Bill&mdash;to accept them.  I can say without any doubt whatever I am totally convinced that, in the last few years, there were some extremely good amendments and suggestions put forward from the Opposition benches. Unfortunately, most of them were not accepted.  I can say also that, when I <Col N="634" /> was in government before, the record will show that, on many occasions, I accepted suggestions or amendments from the Opposition.  I have always disapproved of an attitude on the part of a Minister&mdash;and such attitude has been demonstrated from both sides; I freely confess that&mdash;of a determination to stick simply to the Bill as brought in and not to accept proposals for amendment which make sense.  Of course, that is where the difference of opinion can arise, as to whether or not it does make sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am in the fortunate position that I can show from the record that, before I went into Opposition, I acted in this way.  There was very much more reason for my predecessor to have acted in this way where Deputy P. Barry is but I assure the House that I intend to continue the practice I followed before.</P>
      <P>However, it is not quite as easy as it seems in so far as I said it is necessary to be convinced of the merits of the suggestion even where a particular amendment may not, of itself, be technically correct.  If the idea is correct the Minister concerned should accept it.  I am prefacing my remarks in that way because of the manner in which Deputy Barry prefaced his.  I am trying to indicate a willingness on my part to meet the approach he has outlined, hopefully for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to this and associated amendments the first point I want to clarify is&mdash;and this was referred to by Deputy Barry and Deputy Pattison but particularly by Deputy Barry&mdash; concerns the provision in the Bill whereby proposals for a plan would be brought to the Government by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, as Deputy Barry said, as distinct from the Oireachtas.  If Deputies will cast their minds back a short time to the Second Stage discussion on this Bill they will remember that there were, roughly speaking, two schools of thought in the speeches from the Opposition benches, not <Col N="635" /> divided on a party basis as between the Opposition parties but rather two basic schools of thought.  One was that the Department of Economic Planning and Development would be able to do nothing at all because it would be controlled totally, overshadowed or whatever by the Department of Finance.  The other school of thought was that it would be a super Department which would work out a plan, then implement it and make sure that every other Department did what the Department of Economic Planning and Development said it should do.  The only doubts expressed there were: were there quite enough teeth in the Bill to ensure that it could do this?</P>
    <P>Of course, neither of these views is correct at all.  As my colleague, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and, indeed, I pointed out on Second Stage, that is not the way government works.  It is certainly not the way this Government work.  What is envisaged in this Bill is based on the way I believe democratic governments should work, that is, that the Minister who is charged with the responsibility of producing the proposals for a national plan, who is equipped with the necessary powers to so do&mdash;having got the input from various other Departments, including the Department of Finance&mdash;brings those proposals to the Government.  But, until the Government make a decision to accept such a plan, or perhaps to accept it with amendments, there is no plan.  The status of such proposals is merely such&mdash;proposals.  But, when the Government make the decision to accept and adopt such a plan, then one has a different situation.  It is then binding on all Ministers, all Departments, and the whole of the public service.  It is necessary to spell that out once again because of the apparent concern of Deputy P. Barry that the Bill provides that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development would report to the Government.  That is the reason he reports to the Government; he cannot be in a position to dictate what is going to happen; neither can <Col N="636" /> the Minister for Finance.  It is a Government decision, a collective decision, a team decision; that is the only way it can work.</P>
    <P>Taking it from there, as to what should happen&mdash;and the amendments make certain proposals in this regard which display a concern to ensure that when that decision is taken the matter will come to the Oireachtas&mdash; it is not quite clear to me whether one of the amendments is not, indeed, proposing that it should come to the Oireachtas before the decision is taken. In any event, in so far as the involvement of the Oireachtas is concerned, I fully appreciate the desirability, if only from the point of view of making a plan effective, of publicising it, of trying to involve as many sectors of the community as possible in it.  Of course, in that regard, the role of the Oireachtas is vitally important.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of devices whereby a national plan would come before the Oireachtas. Indeed, a national plan for economic and social development would, in most cases, be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas automatically by the Government of the day in order to ensure, if nothing else, that, by debating its contents, its implications were fully understood or were as widely understood as possible.</P>
    <P>Even if we suppose for a moment that the Government of the day do not wish to do this, there are a number of devices whereby the Opposition can ensure that there is a debate on the matter.  The most likely one would be where the Opposition would look for government time to debate such a plan.  We are talking now not about something the Government of the day are trying to keep secret but rather about something that they want to be as widely known and understood as possible.  If the Opposition were to request Government time for a discussion of such a plan, the circumstances in which the Government would refuse time for such a debate would be very unusual.  Even if that were to happen, and I suggest it could only happen where there was some frightful flaw in the plan which the Government were trying to conceal <Col N="637" /> and forget about the plan, it is open under the rules of the House to the Opposition to put down a motion for Private Members' time and to give it precedence.  They choose the order and they could have that amount of discussion.</P>
    <P>I confess quite freely that that amount of discussion would not be at all adequate for a debate of a national plan.  All I am saying is that in the very unlikely event that the Opposition of the day were reduced to that point they are not completely powerless to ensure that the matter comes before this House and is publicly debated here.  In my view that would be a very remote possibility and a most unlikely situation where an Opposition had to resort to that kind of device to ensure discussion of a national plan produced by a Government.  I would expect in the normal way that any Government producing such a plan, as part of their programme for implementation, would make full arrangements to ensure that the details of the plan were widely known, debated and understood, thereby hopefully bringing along the various sectors of the community in order to ensure that the plan would operate effectively.</P>
    <P>When we are considering these amendments it is necessary to consider what is the purpose of the Bill, and particularly what is the purpose of setting out the functions which the amendments are designed to change. In the Long Title of the Bill the purpose is stated to be:</P>
    <P>... to provide for the establishment of a Department of Economic Planning and Development and for that purpose to amend the Ministers and Secretaries Acts, 1924 to 1973.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Ministers and Secretaries Acts, as given in the Long Title to the 1924 Act, is:</P>
    <P>... for constituting and defining the Ministers and Departments of State.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to set up a Department of Economic Planning and Development and to ensure that their powers and functions are generally adequate and appropriate.  If we look at the Ministers and Secretaries Acts as a whole, and in particular at <Col N="638" /> section 2 of the 1924 Act which first established the Departments of State and set out their powers, duties and functions, it is quite clear that such powers and functions are set out in the widest possible terms.  There are two purposes in mind.  First, to define the area of responsibility of each Department and, secondly, to ensure that the Department and the Minister concerned have adequate powers to act in the area so set out.  I suggest that the functions for the new Department, as provided for in this Bill amply meet these criteria.</P>
    <P>I shall deal first with amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 7.  They accept the functions laid down in the section but they would add to them by requiring the Department to publish annually an outline economic and social plan for not less than four years, to lay this plan before each House of the Oireachtas and to consult with certain interest groups to whom Deputy Pattison has referred.  This would be a perfectly respectable method of planning but I do not think we can say with any degree of confidence that it is the only way and that it should be made mandatory on the Department of Economic Planning and Development to the exclusion of all other possible approaches to the plan.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be too provocative to Deputies opposite when I quote from a speech made by my predecessor. I am quoting from it for a purpose and in the process they will see that I am indirectly drawing attention to what did not happen during the term of office of the previous Government.  In his budget statement in 1974 my predecessor, as Minister for Finance, said the following in this House:</P>
    <P>It would not be possible to publish a meaningful programme pending a re-assessment of medium-term planning in the light of the current unsettled world economic situation.</P>
    <P>While I do not subscribe to the view that planning is impossible at certain times, I think that the kind of plan and the methods of planning that would be required may vary from time to time to meet the needs of a particular situation.  For instance, it is <Col N="639" /> quite possible that there may be times of extreme uncertainty when, perhaps, a four-year perspective might be too long.  It is almost certain that when the new Department are fully operational and when they have developed the techniques of economic and social planning the shape of the plan envisaged in these amendments might be unduly restrictive compared with what the Department would want to produce. The methods suggested in the amendments might be at variance with more refined techniques that the Department may well evolve.  Until the new Department have developed the future shape of the planning process it would be extremely unwise for us to require them to lay an annual plan before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Basically I have two objections to what is suggested in the amendments. First, the purpose of the Bill is simply to set out the functions of the Department, not to lay down the techniques to be used by the Department.  The other is that even if one were to accept that what is suggested in these amendments, the form of planning and the techniques, is the ideal&mdash;even if one were to accept that proposition which is doubtful&mdash;one could not say that it would continue to be the ideal proposition. Therefore you must lay down a statutory mandatory form in the founding Bill for this Department.  Unlike other Departments, you must not alone set out their functions but you must state precisely how they will work so that they cannot change that without going through the whole process of bringing in a new Bill.  As the House knows a Bill changing the functions of a Department should not be lightly introduced.  The real purpose of this Bill should be to set out the functions of the Department and ensure that the Minister is given adequate power to carry out those functions, not so to restrict the operation of the Department and the Minister that many useful things that could be done would be prohibited by law.</P>
    <P>There is another implication in this and that is, if you are too specific in the way this should be done, by implication you are suggesting, and <Col N="640" /> sometimes there is a legal presumption to this effect, that any other approach would be <i>ultra vires</i> and unlawful for the Minister and the Department to contemplate.  In other words, you would be putting the Department into a straitjacket.  The Bill as it stands gives the Department and the Minister a greater opportunity to do the kind of job we want them to do than pushing them into a straitjacket which compels them to operate on a particular basis and precludes any other possible line of approach.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposal in amendment No. 7, that the new Department should consult &ldquo;with the interest groups represented on the National Economic and Social Council at the time of the passing of this Act&rdquo;, as Deputy Pattison anticipated and as I said in my opening statement on Second Stage, the new Department will consult with the social partners and other interest groups.  If one is to hope to get anywhere with the planning process one must engage in this kind of consultation.</P>
    <P>There is a big problem about the kind of proposals made in amendment No. 7.  If you make it mandatory to consult with particular bodies which are so specified that they are &ldquo;represented on the National Economic and Social Council at the time of the passing of the Act&rdquo;, then you are again introducing a rigidity which should not be there.  Then you are saying that those people must be consulted.  It is not inconceivable that there could be changes in those bodies.  Over relatively recent years there have been changes on the trade union side&mdash;I am trying to remember the predecessor of ICTU&mdash;and in some of the employer groups representation.  There was a proposal for a major change some years ago which did not come to anything.</P>
    <P>If any such changes were to take place in the future, and if you had this amendment incorporated in the Bill, you could run into very great difficulty trying to decide who was the lawful successor of the body known as whatever it was.  By accepting this amendment, we would be taking on unnecessary restrictions and difficulties. <Col N="641" /> In practice, there must be consultation with all the interest groups.  If there is not, you can be sure that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, whoever he may be at any time in the future, is going to be very unsuccessful at his job if he does not engage in that kind of consultation.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 4, paragraph (c) is identical with subsection (2) (a) in the Bill as drafted. Paragraphs (a) and (b) would substitute for the general list of functions set out in the Bill, again a very rigid framework for planning which could determine in advance the method of planning to be employed by the new Department before they had the opportunity to review the whole situation and develop their own techniques and strategies.  What I said before in regard to the other amendments applies equally to this.</P>
    <P>Suppose the new Department have evolved their own methodology, techniques and strategies.  Who is to say that having done so, they are to be the end of the road and that that is not to be changed in future?  I would be very disturbed to think that having reached a particular methodology which was satisfactory we would say: &ldquo;That is the way it will be in future and we will never change it&rdquo;.  It would be quite wrong to do that.  I suggest it is even more wrong, before the Department have had the opportunity to develop their techniques in that way, to lay down a rigid framework as is proposed in amendment No. 4 and to impose that on the Department.</P>
    <P>What is the purpose of this Bill? What should it be doing?  I suggest it should be spelling out the functions of the Department and ensuring that the necessary powers are being given to carry out those functions, and that it is a misconceived approach to try to put the Department into a straitjacket as regards the method they will employ both because those methods may not be appropriate, because there should be provision for them to evolve, and also because of the risk that when you specify too clearly a particular method, by implication you are excluding other methods which might be available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="642" /> When Deputies think about this I hope they will agree that this would be the wrong approach and we would not be helping the Department or the Minister. We would be hindering them and putting them in a straitjacket.  For these reasons I could not accept the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not discern from anything the Minister said why he could not accept amendment No. 4. He spoke of putting the Department into a straitjacket and not allowing them to grow.  He described the functions of the Department without inflicting on them any further too tight or too rigid form of action to be taken later.  In this regard my amendment does not vary greatly in language from section 2 in the Bill as drafted.  The Bill says &ldquo;to identify the policies&rdquo; and my amendment says &ldquo;to prepare and publish&rdquo;.  The Bill says &ldquo;to review policies&rdquo; and my amendment says &ldquo;to describe the policies by which the Government's economic and social objectives can be achieved, and to indicate the expected impact on the growth of national output&rdquo;.  I think that is a reasonable extension of what they should be doing.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (b) of my amendment says:</P>
      <P>to identify in consultation with other Departments of State the policies it considers necessary for the attainment of the Government's economic and social policies, to integrate these policies with a national and social plan to be submitted to the Government; and to review the implementation of any economic and social plan adopted by the Government and to lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas the results of this review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see that that is a straitjacket to be putting the new Department in. The Minister should remember, both he and the new Minister referred to this on some occasions during the Second Stage debate, that there were no grounds for the fears expressed by some people to the effect that there might be a conflict between the two Departments.  He has told us that his relationship with the Minister, Deputy <Col N="643" /> O'Donoghue, has been very good always, that for a long number of years they had no problem in relation to interpreting each others mind and that each of them was always able to maintain his own stand.  But that is not the point.  We are not legislating here for Martin O'Donoghue and for George Colley.</P>

      <P>I regret that I must leave the House shortly but I shall put a point to the Deputy first by way of question.  During his Second Stage speech Deputy Barry expressed concern that I would have no part to play and he used that delightful phrase, a toothless chatterbox, to describe me. I should like him to clarify that concern and to tell me how his amendment would either strengthen my powers or give me a greater insurance against the danger he fears?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that the Minister would be in danger of becoming a toothless chatterbox.  I accept the point made by the Minister for the Public Service about not putting the other Minister in a straitjacket but I am trying to ensure that the new Minister would be entitled to go to the various Departments and consult with them, that he would be entitled to go to the Government also and that he would be responsible for drawing up plans and for publishing figures annually or at whatever period was considered suitable: also, that he would be responsible either for the curtailment or for the growth of public expenditure as the case might be and for coming back to this House to talk about these matters.</P>

      <P>In regard to my going to the other Departments, I thought that aspect was catered for adequately in the Bill as drafted because subsection (3) provides for a <Col N="644" /> review and appraisal of the plans or activities of Departments.  Although the other Departments are not named specifically in paragraphs (b) and (d), there is reference to identifying policy and to making proposals to the Government of the plans and activities referred to in paragraph (c).  These are plans and activities of Departments.  I do not see how, after a Government had given to a Minister the authority to do those things any Department would try to imply that the Minister did not have the power to consult with the Department concerned.</P>

      <P>The point I am getting at is that at present the Bill provides for review and appraisal of plans after they have been drafted.

While the Minister would be identifying policies considered necessary for general economic and social development some Departments could be going ahead and drawing up plans that would be found to be different from the policies identified by the Minister.</P>

      <P>In this Bill we are amending an Act of 1924.  Hopefully this legislation will be on the Statute Book 50 years from now.  We must cater for the probabilities of that time hence.  We must frame legislation that protects this House and the people from all sorts of a wide range of improbabilities or, possibly, probabilities in regard to the democratic process. The Minister for the Public Service referred to a Government giving time to discuss what would be the future of the economy.  By and large I expect that the Government of the day would do that.</P>

      <P>In this context we can rule out Private Members' Time because I would not consider that a suitable vehicle for such discussions.

      <P>The Opposition could use Private Members' time to draw attention to an unwillingness on the part of the Government to allow time for such a discussion.  They could seek Government time or could resort to either of the other two methods mentioned by the Minister.  However, from time to time every Department find it necessary to put forward either new or amending legislation.  This provides the opportunity for discussing relevant aspects of the Department concerned. Unfortunately estimates are not discussed in the House as frequently as used be the case.  I should like more time to be given to their discussion because they provide the only broad platform for discussion of the activities of Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot think of any legislation that this new Department would be bringing forward that would give us an opportunity of discussing their activities. Unless the Minister is given more powers from the House I cannot visualise our getting any opportunity to discuss his Department.  The only circumstances in which I could visualise the Minister coming before us on an occasion that would provide us with such opportunity would be by the Government deciding, for instance, that <Col N="647" /> he should have power to instruct Departments to limit their budget for the year in question to whatever figure was decided to be appropriate.</P>
    <P>It is unlikely that there would be an Estimate discussion in respect of his Department.  I expect that the Estimate would comprise merely two or three subheads covering salaries, wages, travelling expenses and, perhaps, the cost involved in the extra messenger service that would be required to bring all these plans to the Government.  Consequently, the only time the Minister would be here in relation to his Department would be at Question Time.  At least, I cannot foresee him being back here again unless there is written into the Bill some provision compelling him to lay before the House for discussion copies of his reports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's approach to these amendments.  In essence what he has said was that the setting up of this Department will be no different from the kind of framework that sets up any Department.  The setting up of this Department I would regard as the most significant and important measure taken for a long time because of the work for which it has to be set up.  It is very necessary that that work should meet with success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not inflexible about the terminology of the amendments that I propose.  Basically what I want in amendment No. 5 is to publish an outline plan annually.  The Minister for the Public Service said that that would place a kind of straitjacket on the Department.  Deputy Barry said that it is unlikely that any legislation will be put forward by this Department, so therefore their main if not their sole concern will be the production and publication of this plan.  I would like to think that such a plan would be forthcoming soon.  I am not talking about a plan that has to be produced by the end of the year for EEC purposes. This is a Department that must get the goodwill of all sections of the community and in that way it must be different from other Departments.  The legislation which sets it up must have <Col N="648" /> a new approach and there must be a certain amount of experimentation in this setting up.  Whereas the Minister for the Public Service has accused my amendments of putting the Department into a straitjacket, I think that in setting up the Department, in the same way as any other Department the Minister is himself placing this Department in a disadvantaged situation, having regard to the type of work the Department have to do.</P>
    <P>At the risk of being called to order by the Chair for repeating myself, let me emphasise again that this is a Department which must involve all sections of the community in the formulation of the plans.  The Minister referred to the bringing before the Oireachtas of a plan that the Government would already have decided on. I do not see much purpose of debate in this House on a plan upon which the Government would have made decisions.  The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that the democratic process would be brought into full play before the plan would be announced; in other words, what would be published would be an outline plan or a Green Paper and then we would have a full-scale Oireachtas debate on that outline plan when the views put forward and the considerations expressed by Members on both sides of the House would be considered and ultimately the Government would decide.  They would have the responsibility, but they would exercise it after the discussions and consultations had taken place and after the Oireachtas had been fully involved in the lead up to it.  That is what I wish to achieve by my amendment No. 6.  This was not done in the previous programmes for economic expansion.  If I interpret the Minister correctly, he said that it is the intention to deal with this plan in the same way as the first, second and third programmes for economic expansion were dealt with, that is they were not given the opportunity of being debated in this House.  That would be wrong.</P>
    <P>On amendment No. 7 again the Minister spoke about a Government decision on the plan and his words were: &ldquo;to bring along the various sectors with the plan&rdquo;.  In my amendment <Col N="649" /> I wanted to bring in those sectors before the plan was decided upon.  I understood the Minister to mean that the Government would decide on the plan and then would go about getting everybody else to fall in with it and accept it.  There is not much interest in or attraction towards involving oneself in discussion or debate on a plan that might be very difficult to change, a plan one knows that the public and the various interested organisations were not involved in. Public involvement and public consultation prior to decision-making are essential for the success of this Department. Decisions that one is involved in making are far more easily accepted and implemented than ones that are handed down.  Therefore, the Minister should reconsider his attitude on this point.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... the National Economic and Social Council at the time of the passing of this Act&rdquo; is the phraseology used in my amendment.  That amendment was not intended to exclude any other interested groups and I have put on the record of the House the various groupings represented and the strength of their representation.  It will be obvious that outside of this House the NESC is the most representative body that the Minister could consult.</P>
    <P>I hope that between now and the next Stage the Minister will have some further consideration of the intentions behind these amendments and he might think of other ways of implementing these intentions besides the ways I have put down in the amendments. It would be of some help if he could indicate that because the overall general purpose of my amendments is to facilitate the development of a comprehensive and democratic system for economic and social planning and to encourage, involve and focus attention on a continuing basis, not just initially, on the work of the new Department.  I believe that can be much better accomplished if those amendments relating to the publication of the plan, the involvement of the Oireachtas and the involvement of the NESC and similar bodies are accepted.  I cannot stress sufficiently the necessity to have the goodwill of all sections of the community for the <Col N="650" /> success of this Department.  The work of the Department is very urgent.  The goodwill and co-operation of all those groups is needed.  I put forward those amendments to get everybody involved. The task of this Department is different.  We should approach it in a different way and see what is the best way of enabling it to do the work which it has to do in a very short time.</P>

      <P>I want to deal with a number of the points raised by Deputy Barry and Deputy Pattison.  Deputy Barry said that apart from Question Time he could not see how a Minister for Economic Planning and Development would ever come before the House.  He was trying to think of some legislation the Minister might be concerned with and could not think of any.  I agree with him as I cannot think of any offhand in that sense.  It has been announced that apart from other matters the Minister for Economic Planning and Development will be dealing with bodies like the ESRI, the NESC and the new body being set up on science and technology.  It is conceivable, particularly in regard to the latter body, that he might well be involved in bringing legislation of the kind envisaged by Deputy Barry before the House.</P>
      <P>Let us suppose the Minister were to come before the House with legislation in connection with more funds for science and technology.  As the Deputy well knows, even with the most liberal occupant of the Chair, that would not enable him to discuss to any great extent the kind of thing we are talking about here in regard to a national plan for economic planning and social development.  Similarly, in the case of the Minister for Finance, if he brings forward legislation in connection with the Industrial Credit Company the debate in regard to that is relatively restricted.  It certainly does not cover his general activities or inactivities in regard to the management of the economy.  There is nothing new in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister but the point I <Col N="651" /> was making was that if the Minister for Finance brings forward a Bill on the Industrial Credit Corporation we can discuss that aspect of his responsibility.  Over a period we discuss virtually all aspects of the Minister's Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true of quite a number of Departments as far as the major part of their work is concerned. The fact that the legislation under which other Departments are set up does not automatically bring before the House every year or every few years the major functions of those Departments, does not mean that the House does not in fact have an opportunity of discussing them.  The problem here is that Deputies on the other side are putting the cart before the horse.  Deputy Pattison seems to think I am suggesting that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development would produce a plan and I was then saying at that stage the Government of the day would be trying to bring along the various sectors of the community behind them.  That was not what I said.  I said that it would be essential for any Government engaged in the preparation of a national plan for economic and social development to consult with the various interested groups before the plan was produced. I then said that when the plan was produced&mdash;the Deputy acknowledged this&mdash;ultimately the Government of the day are the people who have to make the decision.  There will be conflicting views when that decision is made.  The Government of the day will be trying to bring various sectors with them in <Col N="652" /> support of the plan and will be engaging in various activities to publicise the plan.  One of the most obvious is to bring a motion before the House that the House takes note of it.</P>

      <P>Last night I made the point that the case made by the Labour Party, and helped by the front bench of the Fine Gael Party to a limited extent, was a waste of time.  I said I came into the House hoping we would have constructive debate about positive things which I felt should be discussed. Last night the Labour Party decided to veer away from a very important motion concerning the mentally handicapped and came into the House to talk about preference of seat allocation <Col N="653" /> in the European Parliament.  When they had the reins in their hands we all remember the proposals from the then Minister, Deputy Tully.  One proposal was that the Donegal constituency would be so large as to take in an area from Loop Head in County Clare to Oram and Mullyash 263 miles away in County Monaghan and from Malin Head in County Donegal down to Aspick in County Laois.</P>
      <P>Those are the people who are trying to monopolise a situation for themselves tonight which does not exist and was proved conclusively so by the Parliamentary Secretary yesterday evening. They tried to monopolise and rig constituencies to get extra seats for Fine Gael and, in particular, for themselves. They are here again begging with handkerchiefs in their hand and saying they are being done and being treated undemocratically.  The people will never forget the Tully-type democracy in that proposal prior to the general election.</P>

They roamed from figures to fictitious figures to a conclusion on a percentage basis to give a false impression to the media and the people about the facts concerning the allocation of seats.</P>
      <P>The real problem is that they are sitting over there.  One week we saw an article by Deputy O'Leary saying he is the best man.  The next week we saw an article from Deputy O'Connell saying he is the best man for Europe.  Deputy Kavanagh is the man in possession.</P>

      <P>With the situation concerning Dr. Thornley&mdash;no one knows whether he is there or here&mdash; Deputy Cluskey is in a terrible dilemma.  An article was written <Col N="654" /> recently by the previous arch-principal of socialism in this House, Senator Cruise-O'Brien, and printed in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> in which he stated the major argument the Government had was on the appointment of the Commissioner.  He said the Labour Party were very disappointed the then Deputy Keating did not get the job in Europe.  Fine Gael would not give it to them then, and will not give them anything now.</P>

      <P>They expect Fianna Fáil to give them something.  We owe nothing to the Labour Party and a lot less to the Fine Gael Party. Wherever the front bench members of the Fine Gael Party are hiding, they should go upstairs to the big round room where they decided who the Commissioner would be and have another chat about it, and see if they can divide out the four seats which are their democratic right so that Deputy Cluskey can solve the terrible problem he has behind his back.</P>
      <P>That is why I say the time of this House is being wasted by this ridiculous motion.  If by any mistake the people had put them back into power, I know where we would be turning to to try to get what we are entitled to in Europe.  I know what Fianna Fáil got and what the people got from the National Coalition Government.  It will never be forgotten.  It will be 16 or 20 more years before the people will forget what they got from them in the past four years.  Yet they have the audacity and the simplicity to cry into their handkerchiefs and say: &ldquo;We are in terrible trouble.  All the lads have gone so mad.  Look at them writing articles every week in the national papers saying they are the best.&rdquo;  They are asking Fianna Fáil to give them a hand.  It is obvious from the absence from the House of the Fine Gael Party that something has happened.  They must have been trying to fix up the four seats and Fine Gael are keeping three and giving one to the Labour Party.  I am sorry I have to come in here and make such a contribution.

No <Col N="656" /> matter what way they try to twist figures it is correct, based on the fact that we have just had a general election and on the fact that prior to the Seanad election the then Government appointed four or five Senators to the other House in order to give them an electoral advantage and to give them the greatest possible degree of democracy.</P>

Then Senator Cruise-O'Brien is crying in the newspapers because they had a row when Senator Justin Keating did not get the job from Mr. Burke, now Commissioner.</P>
      <P>It is up to the Fine Gael and Labour Parties to divide the four seats, and if Fine Gael have any kindness left in their hearts they will give the Labour Party two.

      <P>After the last contribution I feel like someone who is trying to bring a sense of order to a pub at the close of the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo;.  We are not wasting the time of the House; we are in Private Members' Time.  We are talking about the representation not of the Labour Party in the European Parliament but about the representation of this country and of this Parliament in the European Parliament, a parliament that Fianna Fáil were anxious to drag us into in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="657" /> Before I go on to discuss and support the case made yesterday by the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Cluskey, I would like to refer to a story that is carried in today's <i>The Irish Times</i> in which the journalist refers to a £30,000 a year seat being debated in this House last night. It is with some regret that I have to point out that that journalist has not got his facts right, because all of the ten Members of this House who represent this country in the European Parliament at Strasbourg do not get any salary at all, and I think the record should be put right in that regard.</P>
    <P>The job of representing this country in the European Parliament is a difficult job at the best of times.  It is an extremely difficult job if you have to represent Dáil constituents at home as well.  There are very few people who would willingly take on the role and the task that involves something like 14 plenary weeks and up to 60 committee meetings if you wish to participate fully, and the system of the European Parliament is such that the committee work is absolutely critical to the decisions that are taken by the Parliament in plenary session.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey made a fundamental and detailed point in regard to the precedent of representation going back to the original group that was decided by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1973 on the basis of 50/50.  The electorate have never had a direct say in European elections; they will have one officially within six months, but realistically probably some date later on.  Until such time&mdash;and we are only talking of a period of a year or at the maximum 18 months&mdash;I would like the Fianna Fáil Party and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is welcome here tonight, to state what specifically has changed since Fianna Fáil were last in office in 1973, since Fianna Fáil were in Opposition, since Fianna Fáil have come back now, that would warrant a change in this representation during this interim period of about 18 months until the European elections.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on that point, because I was very interested to hear <Col N="658" /> what the Minister had to say in the debate on the Bill for the direct elections to the European Assembly. Because on that occasion we were all happily in agreement on the necessity for direct elections, there was a certain aura of harmony over this House.  Among the contributions the Minister made to the House on that occasion he said, and I quote from column 1263, Volume 300, of the Official Report of 26th October, 1977:</P>
    <P>Our standing in the EEC is based on our wholehearted participation in the Community's institutions and our constant support for the principles of the Treaty.  Equally we have always promoted the need for strengthening the democratic process in Europe, and to the extent that a directly elected Assembly provides a direct link between the people and one of the institutions, it can only be welcomed by all who want a truly democratic European Community.</P>
    <P>Further on in the same column he said:</P>
    <P>It is necessary that there be a wholehearted commitment by all parties to direct elections.</P>
    <P>We agreed with him.  We did not oppose that Bill.  We did not put on any amendments to it.  As a spokesman of the party, I said that if they wanted to bring in the Committee Stage we would agree to that and to get it through, because we want to see European elections taking place and we want to see the European Parliament democratised, and to win back for the sovereign people of Ireland some of the democratic powers that were ceded by them when they went into the European Assembly.  But until such time as there are direct elections, we say that the precedent that was established in this House in 1973, not by us, not by Fine Gael but by Fianna Fáil, should be maintained and that there should be 50 per cent representation for both sides of the House.</P>
    <P>I would go further to say that my colleague, Deputy Kavanagh, is a member of that Parliament and can explain, if he so chooses, the way in which the committee structure of the Parliament is far more important than <Col N="659" /> it is in this House.  However, the referendum that was quoted in the same speech made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 26th October referred to the 83 per cent of the people who voted to join the EEC, and obviously of those who voted, 17 per cent voted against.  Therefore 17 per cent of the electorate of this country voted against the Common Market and an increasing number have shown, in terms of opinion poll surveys, if one can accept those as being an indication, their reluctance to accept the Community and its institutions and the effect of the Common Market on this country.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are now saying to the House and to the country that the 17 per cent who voted against the referendum are henceforth not entitled to 20 per cent representation in the European Parliament.  Henceforth, they are not entitled to two people to be there so that one person can be off sick and, unfortunately, Deputy Killilea, some people do get sick and some do not enjoy the same good health that others enjoy.  Henceforth these people will only have 10 per cent representation. That is democracy.  OK, you have the divisions, you have the tax, you have the panzers and why stop at that? You can roll in any amendment you like.  Why stop at six?  Why not seven? Round it off.  Go metric.  Why not ten? You won the election.  Winner takes all.  Why six?  You have broken a precedent.</P>

      <P>The matter is very simple.  There will be direct elections within a maximum period of 18 months.  We believe, as we have always believed, that the final say should rest with the people.  We have never disputed that and we have always accepted the verdict of the people but, until such time as they have a direct say in who represents the country at the European Parliament, we feel it is right and proper, given the limitation of ten people who represent the country, that that representation should be divided on the basis originally decided, not by Liam Cosgrave, not by Brendan Corish but by Deputy Jack Lynch.

I would like him to explain in personal terms to the Labour Party Deputy and Senator, to the constituents of the Labour Party Deputy and Senator and to the wife and family of the Labour Party Deputy and Senator how will they carry <Col N="661" /> out their responsibilities under the democratic process with 10 per cent representation from this Parliament.

      <P>I think it would be well at the outset to establish whether or not there are precedents here and what are the agreements, if any, that may exist and the binding obligations, if any, that may exist.  In regard to the Treaty of Rome and the regulations of the European Parliament, I think it is acknowledged there are no binding obligations and no regulations which determine for us in this Parliament or for those in any other Parliament what the representation from this Parliament should be in the European Assembly pending direct elections.</P>
      <P>Secondly, it is suggested that because there was an arrangement in 1972 or 1973 whereby there were five members from this party, whether in Government or Opposition, and five from the other parties, that that was then meant to be an agreement until such time as there were direct elections.  There is, of course, no such evidence.  It happened that at that time the representation here warranted that kind of arrangement and the parties in both Fianna Fáil in Government and in Opposition and the successors of Fianna Fáil in the Coalition Government agreed to that representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quinn asked what has changed since.  The change has been the election that took place recently and a very significant change it was. It is not a question of winner take all because that would not be or could not be the position of this Government. Neither would it be the position of any other party but, nonetheless, it is a reality that must be recognised. What is the reality?  In the run in to direct elections&mdash;here I accept entirely what I said and what Deputy Quinn has quoted in the debate on the European Assembly Bill&mdash;we should to the fullest possible extent give effective expression to the democratic wish of the people.  The people have not as yet had the opportunity <Col N="662" /> of voting in a European Assembly. It is hoped they will have that opportunity in May or June of next year though, as Deputy Quinn has pointed out, there are possibilities that the election may not take place then. I reiterate what I said on that occasion: it is in the interests of the community that all Members should be ready for direct elections by then and, if there is any Member who will not be ready, he should recognise that he is putting a break on the interests of the other member states in implementing this democratic will.  Other than that there will be pressure on each and every member of the Community to reach that deadline but, pending that, it is not unreasonable surely to take account of the recently expressed will of the Irish people in the only democratic process available to them in the national election.  There is no suggestion and there cannot be that it was ever said&mdash;it was not&mdash; that the representation from the House pending that would remain as it was.  It never was said and it never was contemplated.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the Labour Party's position in this in the sense that it does appear, as Deputy Killilea said, that the Fine Gael Party apparently who have so persuasively suggested the labour case is reasonable do not seem to be prepared to make an accommodation which would allow the Labour Party the representation they are asking for.  I accept the Labour Party must be a bit sorry because of the way things have turned out, not just in regard to the European Assembly but generally.  The reality is they relied on two issues. They talk about precedent.  There is no precedent unless a precedent is established on the basis of a binding agreement. There was no binding agreement. Because what was done represented the position at the time that does not create any binding obligation on this House.  We may have to wait some time for direct elections to maintain the existing five-five position here. In so far as there may be precedents they go the other way in favour of the position the Government party are now proposing.  They are the precedents of all the other member states of the <Col N="663" /> Community.  They send to the European Assembly at the moment what we were doing and what we propose to continue doing.  They send in proportion to their representation in their various parliaments.  That is the position in the European Assembly at the moment.  That is a fairly clear precedent. It is one we have acted upon here at all times because it represents roughly the proportionate increase.  If Deputy Quinn has some concern about some people being left unrepresented the fact is that every represented group here is being represented.  He assumes all the 17 per cent are to be unrepresented.  I cannot see that they would be unrepresented even if one assumes that all of that 17 per cent voted for the Labour Party.  Although one cannot make any such assumption, I think there would be other groups who are not represented in this House, and it is only this House that sends delegates to the European Parliament pending direct elections, who could hardly claim to have a representative in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>In Denmark, following the recent election in February of this year, the Social Democrats won 65 seats and they had four representatives in the European Assembly.  The Radical Party won six and they have no representative; Conservatives won 15 and they have one; the Socialist People's Party won seven and they have one; the Communists won seven and they have none; the Christian People's Party won six and they have none.  The Left Socialists won five and they have none; the Single Tax Party won six and they have none.  The representatives of Greenland won four seats and they have none.  There may be a case of no representation of people in Parliament but the reality is that if you go through all the other member states of the Community, the representation is decided in proportion to the numerical strength in the House although, for instance, in Denmark they seem to have some problem because of the number of minor parties.</P>
    <P>The reality here is the same.  The Parliamentary Secretary made it quite clear last night from the percentages <Col N="664" /> that, working out those as best one can, what is proposed that this party who have over 5½ per cent of the representation in the Houses of the Oireachtas will have six seats; the Labour Party have 1.1 per cent and for that they want two seats; they want to double up on that one per cent.  That may be because they had two previously but things changed both in the national Parliament and in the European Assembly.  We can hardly have a position in which we will bind ourselves in <i>saecula saeculorum</i> or until such time as there will be a directly elected Assembly&mdash;I do not suggest that will be <i>saecula saeculorum</i>&mdash;to the fact that we have had proportional representation from this House in the past number of years and that we should now ignore that proportional representation and say that we would adhere to what was fixed then even though the scene in this House has completely changed.  That would be to ignore the reality of the representation in the Oireachtas.  If we did that, we would be the only country of the nine to do so.</P>
    <P>If that is the argument of the Labour Party they should say so.  They make the case that it is not important. I think that Deputy Quinn said that he was not talking about the representation of the Labour Party but about the representation of Ireland in the European Parliament.  He seems to think that because there are two representatives from the Labour Party who have been in the socialist grouping, the largest grouping, that we should somehow qualify our representation simply to maintain a presence in certain groupings.  If we were to take that approach we would say that, because there are two major groups in the European Parliament who of necessity will be the most influential groups, we should send all our people into the Socialist group or the Christian Democrat group.  Or should it mean that if we wanted to be represented in every significant grouping we should make sure to find somebody here prepared to sit in the Liberal group, a very mixed group in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>I do not think that argument can <Col N="665" /> being to be persuasive in the sense that we would now say that representation in the national Parliament is not the primary consideration but having an adequate voice in each group in the European Parliament.  We would be ceding, in fact, the right of this House pending direct elections to the European Parliament, to express our view as representatives of our people duly elected in whatever group we chose to be represented.  That argument does not hold.  I acknowledge that in the checks and balances of politics changes occur, as obviously they have occurred.  Perhaps the Leader of the Labour Party can say that there seems to be an anomaly because they now have fewer than they had when they had a smaller percentage.  But the reality is that both parties have lost considerably but they are maintaining the same percentage representation. That is a matter between the two parties. From our point of view, taking account of the most recently expressed wish of the people, it is that we should have this representation.</P>

The Minister also mentioned that our representation in the European Parliament should be a reflection of our percentage representation in the House.  Fianna Fáil had 54 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No.  The reality is that the party opposite who are not so well represented in the course of this debate lost ground.  If they were as concerned as was indicated by their Leader yesterday when they wanted this debate they would have a stronger representation here this evening.  They have lost ground also.  It is not for us to decide between you how those seats will be allocated.  We could say, and it would be true, that the Labour Party were very much over-represented in the European Assembly up to this, far more than their representation here warranted.  If that was acceptable at a time when the general balance between this party and the other two parties was more or less on a par, we cannot be expected to tie ourselves to that when we have such a clear majority over both parties.  If we did, we would be ignoring the wish and view of the people and also ignoring the practice in every other Parliament in Europe.</P>

Even within one major party there are varieties of views.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>They have made an effective contribution on every element as the Deputy will see if he checks the record of the relevant contributions of the various parties represented in the European Parliament. From reading the record, as far as I can see the contribution from our members, even on a proportionate basis, has been very much more consistent and overwhelmingly more effective than the combined contributions of the two Opposition parties. I do not make any comment on either Deputy Kavanagh or Deputy Creed who have played a constructive role in the European Parliament.  We are asked to ignore all of that.  If Deputy Kavanagh chooses to look at either the reports, the resolutions, the amendments, questions both oral and written, or speeches he will find that Fianna Fáil have acted as if they had four times the representation almost of both the other parties in the European Assembly up to this.  Therefore, let us not say that we are leaving any group unrepresented.  As we move into direct elections we will to the fullest extent represent the interest of the Irish people as effectively as we can taking account of the latest expression of the Irish people, namely, the general election.  We will do as others have been doing and as we have been doing.  We will take account of the proportionate representation of the House.  That is the position in every single country at the moment.  In some cases there are many significant parties in Europe with more seats than the Labour Party have here with no representation in the European Parliament. I am not saying that that is the way it should be.  Perhaps as a smaller country we have better representation numerically.  The reality is that any individual representative has the obligation both as a representative of his party and of his country to play an effective role.  There has not been any <Col N="670" /> agreement other than that we will have a representative delegation from this Parliament.  What has changed is that the Irish people have expressed their views very clearly now and we are simply acknowledging what they have expressed particularly coming into the direct elections which will enable them once again to express their views. Is it suggested that we should ignore what they said up to the moment and simply make sure that there will be a nice cosy share-out between the Opposition parties that would suit them according to existing standards? That is not the kind of democracy we are going for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The date of the direct elections is officially the end of May or the beginning of June next year.  That gives about eight months. That date has to be accepted.  It is the date that is being spoken of as the date of the elections.  Many of us have reservations about that date but, nonetheless, if the majority of countries are in a position to hold the elections then one country which may not be ready need not hold up the elections.  I am sure the Minister will agree.  Nevertheless, the indications are that they may ask for a postponement and that may be given but as of now the date is next May and that being so we must discuss it as that date.  In taking six seats Fianna Fáil are suggesting that for the next eight months they change the whole basis of representation as it has been since we have gone into Europe.  Irrespective of what the Minister said in quoting figures, he has not answered the question put by the Leader of the Labour Party when he suggests that a party who are returned with more seats in the two Houses of the Oireachtas have their representation reduced by 50 per cent in the European Parliament.  The basis for the smash and grab that has been foisted on the Labour Party by Fianna Fáil&mdash;and they can try to blame Fine Gael or anybody else&mdash;is simply election expediency for direct elections. Fianna Fáil want to break in a new man before the direct elections.  So <Col N="671" /> that they will have six people with European knowledge, with European experience, they reduce the Opposition parties by one.  This is obviously what is happening.  The Fianna Fáil members of the Government will hardly give up their positions to contest the election so there is an urgent need to show new faces to the Irish public in Europe.  This is the reason why Fianna Fáil have taken up this stance.</P>
      <P>The strong rumour in the corridors of this House is that the Taoiseach and at least one if not two or more of his Ministers were not in favour of this move but there seems to have been a small palace revolution.  Maybe the first small revolution will grow as time goes on because of the pressure of hungry men in the backbenchers of Fianna Fáil who are anxious to get out to Europe.  If that is the case, the Irish interests in Europe have received a very bad blow indeed.  The Minister changed his spots a little in his argument when he mentioned that it is not important that influential groupings in Europe should have Irish representation. It is very important that the largest group in the European Parliament has its representation maintained&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because the Socialist group in Europe is represented in six Governments across the Community and very likely in another year's time they will be represented in a seventh.  They have three Prime Ministers.  It would be in the Irish interest to have direct lines to those important countries by having adequate representation in the European Parliament and in the socialist group.  When, as has been said, the referendum was fought and the Labour Party took up a very constructive role in opposing the terms of entry, the turn-out against entry was 17 per cent. When the then Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Corish, pledged his full and constructive participation in Europe, the present Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, was prepared to give that 17 per cent an adequate voice.  He chose them from the only party in this <Col N="672" /> House that he could, the voice which has represented a contrary view in that referendum.  That contrary view was the Labour Party voice here and it was given two seats for 10 per cent. Subsequently the representation increased. Now Fianna Fáil propose to reduce that representation by 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Minister does not do himself any justice by playing down the importance of the various political groups in the European Parliament and the Irish Members of this House in those groups because when he mentioned the five Members who have played an active part in the EPD group he failed to explain to the House the workings of the European Parliament, particularly in plenary session.  He knows as well as I do that the speaking arrangements are rather similar to those in this House, that the largest group leads off in any debate, then the next largest and so on.  I think the EPD group is the fifth down the line; they are entitled to a speaker in turn with the remainder of the groups.  In that way the Fianna Fáil members, who comprise a little over one-third of that group, are afforded an opportunity to come in at regular intervals on every debate; they are usually either the first or second speaker.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>In the socialist group there are 65 Members approximately of which two are Irish.  If one looks at the figures there are something like five out of 17 in the EPD group.  Therefore, an Irish Member's turn in the socialist group comes up once every thirty-fourth time while that of a Fianna Fáil member comes up once every third time in his group.</P>
      <P>It is not fair to make the argument the Minister has just made&mdash;to say that other members, because of laziness, lethargy or because they do not have an interest do not make contributions. Those of us who are there have made valuable contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me review it this way: the Minister could have explained a little more about the operations of the European Parliament which works on a committee basis. There are 12 committees.  The Irish members on those committees are there and make the best contribution in our interest, irrespective of what place they occupy, or where they sit.</P>
      <P>In those committees&mdash;they generally number about 30 per committee&mdash;the socialist group have approximately nine or ten.  The EPD group have two; it is usually broken down into one Irish and one French representative in most of the committees.  But because of the numbers in the various committees it is not possible to spread the Irish membership over all of them. Therefore, the Irishmen in Europe, I think have taken the decision to deploy themselves in the more important committees, for example, the regional policy committee, the social committee on employment, the agricultural committee.  Over the years in that way&mdash;to my knowledge; and I am as good an attender as any&mdash;they have put Irish interests first.  They have worked together in those committees whether it be on amendments, proposals, opinions or anything else and have always endeavoured to press for the Irish interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because there are nine or ten socialist members on most committees it has meant that I can fill vacancies in other committees to which I am not assigned when there is some Irish interest involved.  I have done this.  For example in the agricultural committee, of which I am not a member, as recently as Thursday last there was a debate on ether alcohol.  It was a very important debate and was of great relevance to the Irish distilling industry. An attempt was made to align roughly the southern members of the European Community to introduce regulations which would cause a great deal of difficulty for the distilling industry. Those of us representing northern countries, but particularly Britain and Ireland, came together to defeat the effort in that committee.  That work <Col N="674" /> will never, never receive any publicity. That is what we go to do and are happy to do.  If I have to make a special journey to do that, I am quite prepared to do so.  If other members from other groups join us to help out well and good.</P>
    <P>It is not correct for the Minister to say that this work could be done with fewer members in the socialist group because if we are reduced it is obvious I cannot go to all of the committees I should like to attend.  There is not a second Labour man in the socialist group who could also be usefully deployed whenever a matter of our national interest crops up to help his colleagues of the Fine Gael Party in those committees.  That has been most important in the past because his members do not have that opportunity. For example, in the agricultural committee last week one of the EDP members introduced that regulation.  Certainly he was not going to give up his place for a second Irish member from the Fianna Fáil Party.  Neither will that happen in any of the other committees.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been reminded of speeches he made in the House recently, particularly on the subject of the European Assembly elections when again he did not do himself justice. I accept that in the famous words of Shakespeare he was &ldquo;an honourable man&rdquo; when he said that Members on this side of the House voted against the best interests of Ireland in the recent budget debate.  When speaking on the 27th October, 1977, at columns 1461 and 1462 of the Official Report he said:</P>
    <P>In my opening speech I said a proposal had been passed by the budget committee to increase the allocation for cross-Border studies. I assumed that it would then come before the Council of Ministers.  Unfortunately that will not be the position because yesterday there was a vote on that very issue and I regret to say one of our representatives voted against the proposal.  One of the Opposition representatives voted in favour and one voted against. Now I know no Deputy would do that deliberately just to stymie something <Col N="675" /> original but obviously there is a lack of co-ordination.  Perhaps there was pressure within another group but in a matter of such vital importance surely we could expect a consistent approach.  I shall make no criticism except to say that this highlights the need for consultation. Perhaps the fault in not making arrangements for such consultation lies with this side.</P>
    <P>A similar situation arose in regard to another proposal.  The representatives of both Opposition parties voted against a budgetary allocation for an office of the European Commission in Belfast.</P>
    <P>If the Minister's contributions are to be on that basis, if he is not prepared to get the proper information, then he does me a disservice since I assume I am one of the people he claims to have voted against this useful proposition. Certainly, he should have consulted the Opposition parties before he made that statement because, in the budget committee, three amendments of the proposition to allocate funds to regional studies on the Border were put forward.  I voted on an amendment put forward by the budget committee that 160 million units of account be assigned to that study.  If the Minister wants to check it, the record is there&mdash; 118 voted in favour, two against and neither of those two was Irish.  That programme will commence when plans are submitted, I assume, by this Government in consultation with another. Those proposals will be studied in the European Parliament and funds allocated accordingly.  That is the practical situation.  It was unfair of the Minister to say what he did; he should be very careful in regard to what he says.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have been trying to explain, the membership of the committees of the European Parliament is of the utmost importance. Those of us in the Socialist group have a great opportunity to be there at practically any debate that is relevant to the Irish interest.  That facility is not possible for members of the European Progressive Democrats to be there in such strong numbers because of the composition of the committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can stand over my voting record in the European Parliament.  Unfortunately my colleague in the Socialist group was defeated at the last general election, a defeat which I believe was due to the fact that he was working in the European Parliament.  He was away from his constituency and he suffered for that.  Nevertheless our contributions in that committee were considerable in many areas, particularly in agriculture, where on many occasions we fought the Irish cause <Col N="678" /> and changed the opinion in the group quite considerably.  I can recall on at least two occasions when there were debates on the green £ and an amendment from the Socialist group that the Irish should have the full representative rate of the green £ was proposed by a German socialist.</P>
    <P>With regard to the fisheries policy, the Socialist group contains the element of the 50-mile limit.  I do not think that is enshrined in any policy of the EPD group.  Indeed, when that matter came up for debate we could have had a victory in the Parliament on the 50-mile limit if the Minister's colleagues voted on that occasion.</P>
    <P>I am quite happy about the level of participation of members of the Irish Labour Party in the European Parliament. It was worth while and was certainly of benefit to this country.  To hive off one of those seats and to increase a group that has little influence across the board in Europe&mdash;its representatives come from three countries; one from Denmark and the rest from France and Ireland&mdash;cannot compare with the influence of a strong Irish representation in the Socialist and in the Christian Democrat groupings in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>The Irish interest has been damaged by the action of the Minister's party in proposing to take an extra seat.  The reason could not be explained by the Minister when the matter was put to him by the Leader of the Labour Party.  There is still time for him to change that decision but I think we would be foolish if we expected a change at this stage.  However, can he not accept that Ireland's interest will be best served by leaving matters as they are and let the people decide the representation in direct elections next year?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh was quite right to emphasise that the date which has been set for these elections is the mid-month of next year. So far as we know officially, that is the schedule all other countries are working towards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We regret that this motion has been forced on us by the action of the executive, by their switching of the <Col N="679" /> precedent set in their time and in our time.  The figures have been put forward quite compellingly by speakers on our side from the Leader to the various spokesmen of the party.  We have made the point that we had the precedent in this phase of appointment, we had this division in the House as between both Governments that there was a fair division between the number of seats represented by the Executive and the Opposition.  The point has been put by our speakers that from the date of the 1973 general election in the lifetime of the 20th Dáil when the National Coalition was the administration of the day that despite the changing fortunes as a result of by-elections the Government of the day did not alter the precedent. They accepted the principle that there should be this fair division in the period before direct elections.</P>
    <P>A sufficient reason has not been advanced why, within months of the official date for the people to exercise their franchise, this Executive, flushed with their massive victory in the domestic election, should come before the House and expect it to pass without comment their move to take one of the seats given to the Opposition, in this case to the Labour Party.  We have heard of reasons that go back to the recent election here but there has been no reason advanced on their percentage in this House and their percentage share of the seats in the European Parliament.  No sufficient reason has been advanced to explain the discrepancy between their 60 per cent representation in the number of seats in the European Parliament as against their percentage representation in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We may only wonder why this move was forced on the Government.  I believe it cannot but diminish the stature of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>By bringing forward this motion we have thought it sufficiently important that the House should note this break with tradition and precedent, that it should note that this was done within months of the actual franchise being exercised by the people.  We accept that the verdict is clear and that there <Col N="680" /> are sufficient people behind the Executive to make our opposition very much a token opposition.  We believe that this move by the Executive should be noted and condemned.</P>
    <P>It is true the people will shortly have an opportunity of deciding their verdict at the polls.  They gave their verdict at the general election recently and they gave a very handsome bonus in the number of seats to this Government. Whatever the official schedule as to when these elections for the European Parliament will be held, the people may be exercising their franchise for the European Parliament later than the date set and perhaps in conditions that will not give as great a bonus as the recent election gave the Executive.  The people may be exercising their verdict at a time when unemployment is at an all-time high.  It is high enough now but it may be even higher then.  They may be casting their votes at a time when some of the Bills that financed the recent massive election victory of this Government fall due.  We do not know the verdict of the people.  It may be that they will repeat the note of approval they gave recently to the Executive.  It may be that those Fianna Fáil members standing for an alliance with the Progressive Democrats, the de Gaullists in France, will get a similar verdict to that given recently, or maybe they will not.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Executive and to the Minister for Foreign Affairs whose heart may not be in this work, that this will be a tiny influence at the time of decision on the part of the electorate, a significant straw in the wind, to note what the Executive of the day did at this time and how they departed from precedents that had been set by two Governments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh has demonstrated the importance of the group system in the European Parliament.  He has shown an identity of interest can grow between Irish representatives in that Parliament, whatever their political position may be on the home front. There is an amount of common ground between representatives of this House in Europe on many of these questions.  As was shown in the past, this help from the Socialist group, by <Col N="681" /> Irish influence and with Irish help, has not been found wanting by other Irish representatives with different political approaches in that Parliament. One should foresee an amount of common approach in that Parliament, a platform of agreement on such diverse issues as regional policy, social policy and agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>It is true that the European Parliament does not have a great deal of power.  I am one of those people, and there are many others in the socialist groupings throughout Europe, who believe that qualitatively that institution will change from the day of direct elections.  It may be that the Commission or the Council of Ministers may only note what the Parliament decide or debate, but from the moment of direct elections that Parliament will be filled with men and women from different political parties and countries who will have the authority of their own people.  From that moment, the institutions of the Community will have to pay greater regard to that Parliament.</P>
    <P>It is all the more regrettable that on the eve of such elections the Executive here should act in so small-minded a fashion.  As I said, I do not know if the Minister for Foreign Affairs' heart is in this work or whether he understands the pressures at work in the party which forced such a shabby move on the Taoiseach and the Cabinet.  I can only think of the complete contrast between the Executive's action here and their declared policy on the North.  I am not suggesting that the divisions between political parties in this House are as deep-seated as they are between political groups in the North, but the official policy of the Executive is that they are committed to power-sharing in the North, but when it comes to sharing representation in a European Parliament which is presently without power, they deprive one of the significant groupings in that Parliament of one member.  Where is the consistency? The Minister must be embarrassed considering the contradiction between the executive's action in this House and their declared position on the North.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="682" /> The people at the very least may question the sincerity of the Executive in this instance, as we do.  We do not think this is, or should be, a question of the Executive seeking their authority for this move on the recent verdict of the polls.  We believe the honourable thing would have been to act in accordance with the precedents.  From their own point of view should not the victorious be magnanimous in any situation?  How can the people who won such a massive endorsement for their policies at the polls act so small-mindedly within months of that victory?  Why must it be FF rule even in relation to the appointment of members of the European Parliament? Why, on the eve of direct elections, must they gain their last pound of flesh?</P>

      <P>The point can fairly be made that the Government by their decision have at the very least been careless of the interest of the State in the European Parliament.  One does not have to take refuge in percentages or in opinions in stating that the socialist group is the most influential group in the European Parliament. The Executive have robbed the Irish voice of one representative; they have reduced our ranks by 50 per cent.  The case can be made without partisan passion that there is an identity of interest between the Irish socialist represented <Col N="683" /> in that group and the representative of Fianna Fáil attached to the de Gaullist group on such diverse issues as agriculture, regional policy and any others that may come up between now and the direct elections.  At the very least the charge can be fairly sustained that the Government have been careless of the national interest in their shabby decision to deprive the Labour Party by cutting their representation by half.  We all hope that there will be full participation by the electorate in the direct elections to be held next year.</P>

      <P>It is in the interest of all parties in the House that we approach those elections in the correct spirit and that we try to resist the temptation to be exclusively partisan in areas that are not important strictly to the future of that Parliament or to the interests of the State in that assembly.  That process has not been helped by the action of the Executive in altering the representation of the various parties.  It is not the role of this party to enter into a tangle with the other Opposition party on a diminished number of seats.  According to precedent, we were given two seats. The division in 1973 was acceded to by Fianna Fáil on the last occasion on which they were in office and which was ratified by the Coalition.  Irrespective of the varying fortunes of by-elections in regard to this House there was a fair division of a 50 per cent cut between Opposition and Executive. That position should be maintained in order that we might go into these elections with the message to the people that these were serious matters to be decided at the polls and that the free parliament of this State considers the matter to be of serious import and not one to be confused with the normal partisan political bickering which is associated so regrettably and so often with the transaction of business in this House.  As a result of the Government's decision, the election campaign can be said to have got off to a bad start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> While we may argue about the influence of the socialist group in this country there can be no argument about its influence both in the member states of the Community and in that Parliament.  It is an influence which I cannot foresee waning in the future.  That is bad news for the people who were described on one occasion as being in a mad marriage with de Gaullists.  I do not know what will be the future alliances of Fianna Fáil in the European Parliament or whether they will go into Coalition with Fine Gael in the Christian Democrats.  Fine Gael might do the nation a good turn by sponsoring the rescue of the Fianna Fáil representatives from the sweaty embrace of that mad marriage.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell described that alliance as incestuous but be that as it may, it is certainly a very dangerous alliance.  There can be no question regarding the significance of the socialist presence in the European Parliament and, having regard to the two additional states that are expected to join the Community, Spain and Portugal.  I cannot see that influence lessening in the future.  In both of these countries the socialist movement is very strong.  In Spain, the country which will probably be accepted earliest, the socialist movement is within a short time of gaining complete power.  The vast influence of the socialist parties in all the Community countries and in the Parliament should suggest the lack of wisdom in what the Executive have done in cutting, for domestic partisan reasons, the representation of the Labour Party in that Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This decision diminishes the stature of the Taoiseach as a fair-minded man. I do not know what were the forces <Col N="685" /> that were brought to bear on him so that he might adopt this mean, shabby tactic.  Some have suggested that there is an embarrassment of riches or otherwise in his backbenchers but be that as it may there is a great desire to join the European delegation of Fianna Fáil.  However the electorate will not be likely to forget the significance of this shabby tactic when they go to the polls.  I do not think that members of the Government will wish to fall into the trap of thinking that a new style of election victory has been set in motion as a result of the events of some months ago.  The election for the European Parliament may be taking place in circumstances here which would not favour those candidates standing in the Government interest. The numbers out of work are increasing daily as we go into winter and no policy produced so far suggests that there is any remedy on the horizon.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 to 104, inclusive, together.  As the Deputy is aware, a delegate conference of INTO decided not to accept this scheme.  My Department's circular 21/77 indicated that the special trainee teachers would be employed in the following categories of schools:</P>
      <P>(1) In each national school in which there were a principal without class responsibilities and in which the number of pupils divided by the number of teachers excluding the principal and any authorised re-medical teacher exceeded 40, one additional post would be sanctioned.</P>
      <P Just="Center">and</P>
      <P>(2) In the case of schools meeting the requirements of (1) above which are located in disadvantaged areas, consideration would be given to applications by boards of management for additional appointments within the limits of the overall allocation of extra posts.</P>
      <P>Circular 22/77 stated that applications would also be considered for the appointment of special trainee teachers in schools which were not within these two categories but in which identifiable problems exist and in relation to overcrowded classes.</P>

      <P>It is for a local authority to decide on the provisions to be made in their development plan for off-street parking, and the extent to which that should be achieved by public authorities and private developers respectively. I have no doubt that the local authorities take due account of all relevant factors in framing their development plans.  Furthermore, as to the use of specific sites, including vacant lots, for off-street car parking, it is for the local authority to decide whether to use or allow the use of such sites.</P>
      <P>The use of any net income derived from parking meter fees after allowing for certain statutory charges, is primarily a matter for decision by the local authority concerned.  Penalties on foot of notices served by the Garda under section 103 of the Road Traffic Act of 1961 are payable at Garda stations and do not therefore accrue to local authorities.  The Deputy's request for particulars of such payments is accordingly not appropriate to my Department.</P>
