      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 3, 5 and, in No. 5, Votes 50, 39, 29 to 34 inclusive, 44, 43 and 42.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, there is an hour-and-a-half allocated for Education Estimates. May I take it the Minister will take a quarter of an hour and the spokesmen for Fine Gael and Labour half an hour each and the Minister to reply for another quarter of an hour?  May I take it that is agreed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that will be the procedure adopted on the Supplementary Estimates for the Department of Education?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="The Tánaiste George Colley">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there is no agreement on the procedure I would hope that a kind of gentleman's agreement would emerge.  The Deputy will recall that on previous occasions that did not happen, but I would hope it would happen today and on Tuesday next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggested a breakup of the time allocated and the Minister for Health.  Deputy Haughey, agrees with it.  If the Tánaiste would also agree, that is a gentleman's agreement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="The Tánaiste George Colley">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to be done on each Supplementary Estimate in the light of those participating but, as I said, I would hope there would be co-operation on both sides which would allow a reasonable division of the time available.  There is no agreement on that but, as I said, I am sure the Deputy will recall occasions in the past when that did not work out.  However, I hope it will work out now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of disagreements on numerous occasions, and not only in the time of the last Government, and what I am putting forward is a gentleman's agreement in regard to Education, namely, half an hour for the two spokesmen on this side in Fine Gael and Labour and a quarter of an hour for the Minister to introduce the Estimate and a quarter of an hour for him to reply, making a total of half an hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="The Tánaiste George Colley">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to take it as it comes on each Vote.  An effort will be made, if there is co-operation all round, to try to give adequate time to each side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, before you call Item No. 3, you asked <Col N="1051" /> if the suggestion made was being made an order of the House.  I think it is foolish to assume that everyone who is a Member of the House is automatically a gentleman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the House has been agreed by the Whips and any further agreement which would involve an allocation in the case of each Vote would require careful working out and consideration. It is not possible to do that here.  The most we can do is what I have already indicated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, when Deputy Collins suggested a time allocation, the Tánaiste indicated he hoped that would be the agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste did not indicate any such thing.  He asked how long it would take the Minister for Education to deal with five or six Supplementary Estimates.  We are not going to squabble.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1977.</Title>
    <P>The Dáil, according to order, considered Supplementary Estimates for Public Services for the year ending 31st December, 1977.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Vote 50:" RHead="Health">
    <Title>Vote 50: Health.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey) Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £24,978,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1977, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig na Ard-Chláraitheora), and certain services administered by that Office, including grants to Health Boards, miscellaneous grants, and certain grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The original Vote for Health in 1977 amounted to £298,400,000, including a sum of £10 million by way of a capital grant-in-aid of the Hospitals Trust Fund.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate is for a sum of £24,978,000 comprised of a net sum of £21,448,000 for non-capital services and £3,530,000 for capital purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gross extra sum required for non-capital services is £22,398,000. From this there has been deducted a sum of £950,000 representing an increase in income from appropriations-in-aid. This leaves a net requirement of £21,448,000.  This total extra expenditure arises as follows:&mdash;Staff Costs, £18,308,000; Increases in the rates of cash allowances, £1,500,000; Price increases, <Col N="1054" /> £1,500,000; Increase in Social Welfare Contributions (employer's share), £540,000; Increases in capitation payments to special residential homes for children, £550,000.</P>
    <P>The estimated increased income of £950,000 from appropriations-in-aid is expected to be derived from health contributions (£750,000) and the recovery of cost of health services provided under regulations of the European Economic Community (£200,000).</P>
    <P>The additional grant requirement for staff costs is £18,308,000.  The additional expenditure arises under three main headings:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;National Pay Agreement, 1977;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Miscellaneous pay awards;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Additional staff employed by health agencies in 1977.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the National Pay Agreement, 1977, pay increases were payable in two phases&mdash;generally from April and November.  The general rate of increase for each phase was 2.5 per cent of basic pay plus £1 per week (subject to certain minimum and maximum levels of increase).  The additional sum required to meet costs arising here is £7,435,000.</P>
    <P>The amount required to cover additional expenditure arising from Labour Court recommendations and arbitration award comes to £2,023,000.  This is made up as follows: clinical teachers and nurse tutors, £130,000; revisions of salary scales and service conditions in a number of grades, £86,000; general trained nurses, £406,000; certain grades of psychiatric nurses, £291,000.</P>
    <P>The above items were approved following on Labour Court recommendations and arbitration awards.</P>
    <P>The remaining areas where special increases applied were: decisions on equal pay, £800,000; increases in travelling and subsistence expenses, £310,000.</P>
    <P>The amount needed to meet the additional cost of extra staff recruited by health agencies during the year is £8,850,000.</P>
    <P>The cash allowances on the Health side which were increased following the 1977 Budget were: disabled persons allowances; maintenance allowances <Col N="1055" /> to persons suffering from specified infectious diseases; blind welfare allowances.</P>
    <P>The allowances were adjusted in two phases&mdash;from 1st April, 1977, and 1st October, 1977.  The total grant requirement in 1977 to meet the additional cost arising is £1,500,000.</P>
    <P>The amount of supplementary provision now sought for price increases &mdash;£1,500,000&mdash;is to offset the additional costs incurred by health agencies during the year because of higher prices on items such as purchases of medicines and drugs, the cost of heat, light and power, maintenance work, replacement of worn-out equipment and so on.</P>
    <P>The employer's share of the weekly insurance stamp was increased with effect from 1st April, 1977.  Health agencies in common with other employers had to meet the additional cost involved.  As this expenditure was not covered in the original allocations it is necessary to supplement the allocations of health agencies to cover the cost involved.  The amount of grant required for 1977 is £540,000.</P>
    <P>A number of the special homes which cater for children were experiencing severe financial difficulty earlier in the year.  It became necessary to approve of considerable increases in the rates of capitation payments made by health boards to the authorities of the homes concerned.  The rate which applied at the beginning of 1977 was £18 per week.  This was increased to £30 per week.  The additional grant required to meet the extra expenditure incurred by health boards in 1977 is £550,000.</P>
    <P>The additional amount required for capital services is £3,530,000.  These funds are required to meet the cost of a special programme which could not be accommodated within the original allocation.  The programme enabled a commencement to be made on projects such as a new pathology laboratory at St. James Hospital, Dublin, a new centre for the mentally handicapped at Ballybane, Co. Galway and welfare homes at Navan Road, Dublin, Athlone and Edenderry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> I would ask the House to agree to the voting of the necessary supplementary funds for 1977&mdash;£24,978,000.</P>

      <P>Almost all of the moneys required in this Supplementary Estimate relate to increased staffing costs, price increases and social welfare contribution increases in rela-to health board employees.  From that point of view it limits the area of the general health services which may be discussed.  I propose to confine my remarks mainly to the area of the health boards, their size and operation.</P>
      <P>Some weeks ago in the House I suggested to the Minister that when the health boards were first mooted on foot of the famous McKinsey Report it was suggested by McKinsey that when the health boards had been in operation for five years a review of their structure and effectiveness should be carried out and necessary changes implemented.  Such a review has not been carried out although the health boards are now in operation for some seven years.</P>
      <P>Members of the House will recall that at the time of the setting up of the health boards many people suggested that the eight health boards would become monsters which would begin to absorb more and more of the budget for any one year and on an administrative basis would absorb more and more of the money devoted to the health services.  That idea was scotched and denied at the time by the Minister in question, but when one looks at a graph of the costs, especially the administrative costs, one sees that there was a great deal of merit and validity in the case made at that time.  Since the health boards have been in operation for seven years a review is overdue. It is time to have a look at how they are operating, the cost of operation and how relevant they are.  That is not happening.  We are now discussing a Supplementary Estimate in the sum of £24,978,000, about £20 million of which is to rescue or bail out the health boards on foot of additional costs which they have incurred in the course of the present financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said some weeks ago <Col N="1057" /> that he felt that an overall review of the health services and the health boards could best be carried out by the all-party committee of the Dáil which was to be set up on health matters generally. I am sorry to say that although we are now coming to the end of this session that all-party committee have not yet met.  Apart from beginning to carry out a review of the health boards, their cost and operation, we have not discussed any other area of health.</P>
    <P>Many people would suggest that as the health boards have grown since 1970 they have become over large, autonomous and bureaucratic and divorced from local representation and in many respects they have become out of touch with the needs of the ordinary person.  I would be the first to give credit to the health boards in that they conceived and brought into operation many worth-while changes and improvements in the health services and in many areas their operation has been enlightened.  Nevertheless, the fears expressed in 1970 have validity in the circumstances of today.  It was feared that they would become little empires of their own, employing a great number of people in a kind of Parkinson's Law situation in which the amount of benefit derived in comparison with the costs of staff, especially administrative staff, would not be in line with the amount of money allocated. In the figures given by the Minister there is no real breakdown in staff costs as between administrative staff, medical staff and para-medical staff.</P>
    <P>I believe that there is a duty on the House or on the all-party committee at whatever stage they meet&mdash;let us hope it is sooner rather than later&mdash;to have a look at the cost of operating the health boards and see whether they are as effective as it was suggested in 1970. We should examine whether they are getting across to the people the services they have and whether the operation of those services is as effcient as it might be if it were operated by smaller authorities more in touch with what is happening at local level.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that, because most health boards span a number of counties and because their administrative centres are often many miles <Col N="1058" /> away from the area in which services are being provided, the manner in which services are operated is not as effcient as it might be.  If that is true, it is part of the reason why we are voting some of the moneys in this Supplementary Estimate.  When the Minister is replying I should be glad if he would outline to the House his ideas regarding a real and worth-while review of the operations of the health boards.  I appreciate that the idea of asking the all-party committee to have a look at the health services is a good one, but it is also important that some outside body should be asked to examine the structure of the health boards, the administative costs as against the level of services and the percentage taken by administrative costs compared to the percentage that they represented in 1970.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  One of the few areas in the Supplementary Estimate not involved in the cost of staffing the health boards is the increase in the rate of allowances.  This amounts to £1,500,000 and arises on foot of the 1977 Budget in respect of allowances which were not contained in the original Book of Estimates as published.  As the Minister has outlined, they are the increases in the disabled persons' allowances, blind welfare allowances and the rate of allowances paid to people suffering from infectious diseases.  These in-increases allocated to special homes for children, where the capitation rate has been increased from £18 per week to £30 per week.  I am sure everybody agrees that £18 a week is completely unrealistic in 1977 and must have posed great problems for the voluntary agencies who operate those homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are increased costs in the Supplementary Estimates for staff. How many new jobs in relation to both capital and current services have been created and filled during this year? Does the Minister anticipate that there will be any sizeable increase in the <Col N="1059" /> number of new positions filled before the end of this month?  I appreciate that 130 additional public health nurses were employed in the past few months.  I also appreciate that the Minister told the House some time ago that up to the end of September approximately 2,000 were created on the current side.  Has the Minister more up-to-date figures now about the number of posts that have been filled up to the end of November and the number that may be filled before the end of this year?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Supplementary Estimate, which will not be opposed from this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to take up the time of the House.  I am operating on the assumption that the Minister would like to get in around 12 o'clock to reply.  I am speaking in the unavoidable absence of our spokesman on health.  I would like to make a few comments on the Supplementary Estimate and on some of the points raised by Deputy Boland.</P>
      <P>I want to underline what the Deputy said about the all-party committee on the structure of the health services.  The concern expressed by him has also been felt by many members of my party.  It is a concern which is ultimately for the better functioning of the health services.  The Deputy's plea for an early convening of this committee and a speedy completion of their work is echoed by a number of people on these benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first part of the Minister's speech I want to refer to is the section relating to price increases, where an extra £1½ million is needed to offset the additional costs incurred by the health agencies with higher prices in items such as purchase of medicines and drugs, heat, light and so forth.  I want to concentrate on the price increases in the medicine and drugs area.  The Minister must be aware of the finding of the recent report into the health services that a substantial amount of the cost of providing health services was attributable to the prescribing practices of doctors.  The question was raised as to whether or not doctors <Col N="1060" /> always had the cost element at an appropriate place in their minds when they are prescribing.</P>
    <P>This is certainly true of a doctor friend of mine who got a report from the health board on his prescribing practice at his own request and was horrified to realise that he was prescribing in a year drugs which cost more than his salary from that health board.  I doubt if that is unusual.  I urge the Minister to consider this role of the doctor and his prescribing practice.  I also urge him to look at it from the point of view of the manufacture and provision of drugs and medical supplies.  We are all aware of the enormous cost variation between different brands of what are essentially the same drugs.  We are also aware that of the many industries which have been established in the country over the past decade or so some of the most successful and profitable have been those connected with the pharmaceutical industry.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister very strongly to investigate this matter not just in terms of cost but also in terms of providing further employment and the possibility of direct State involvement in the manufacture of drugs and medical equipment generally, especially on the pharmaceutical side.  I believe that in this area one can look to State involvement as something which will add to growth and reduce costs.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Boland I agree that the £18 a week capitation payment to special residential homes for children was not by any means a realistic figure.  I think it is extraordinarily cheap at £30 a week.  I can promise the Minister, whenever he comes back here looking for more money for those special residential homes, he will get a warm welcome from this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Boland has referred to many of the matters I intended to speak about.  I want to congratulate the Minister for having increased the capitation grant from £18 to £30, which is only a realistic figure in relation to present day costs.  This shows the concern the Minister has for those children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1061" /> I agree with Deputy Boland that the time has come for a general review of the work of health boards.  I am not critical of the staff of the health boards when I say that.  The staff of the Western Health Board are very efficient and very nice, but the boards have got very large.  Could the administrative costs of the health boards be reduced if they went back again to county areas?  The health boards are splitting up counties for community care purposes.  A county is a unit for community care.  Part of my county is put in with Roscommon.  The County Medical Officer decides who gets a house.  If a person is in a community care area which is in another county the County Medical Officer in that other county decides whether or not that particular applicant is entitled to a house.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with splitting up counties in relation to community care. The county should be left as a unit for such purposes.  I have opposed this and will continue to do so.  There are many things like that which need to be looked at.  The all-party committee should review the construction of the health boards.  When an organisation get too big one gets away from the ordinary grassroots man who understands everything in the particular county.  I am taking this opportunity of paying tribute to all the staff in my health board area for their courtesy and effciency, but there remains the fear on the part of ordinary people that decisions are being made by way of remote control.  If one were to divide the western health board area into counties and to calculate the amount of money being spent per county on health services, one would realise that, even allowing for inflation, the cost has increased out of all proportion. After seven years of their operation, we should review seriously the health boards set-up.  If such a review should show that the health boards are doing a better job than could be done by reverting to the old system the new system should be continued, but should it be found that a mistake was made, there would be nothing wrong in reverting to the old system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1062" /> There was much of the McKinsey Report with which I did not agree, particularly in regard to the down-grading of hospitals.  However, that is another and a long story with which I shall not take up the time of the House except to say that in other countries there has been a complete rethink regarding the situation of hospitals. The Minister has been kind enough to give me a few minutes of his time so I shall not delay him further except to say that I agree with the speakers who are advocating a review of the present system.  The Minister has shown his concern in this area and the increase in the payment to homes from £18 to £30 indicates further his genuine concern.  I am sure that if a review should indicate a necessity for change in the present set-up, he would be willing to make that change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to take up the time of the House, but I rise to refer briefly to an anomaly that exists in respect of one of the services provided by the health boards. I refer to child dental benefits.</P>
      <P>The position is that many children attending schools, other than the national primary schools, cannot benefit from this scheme.  Indeed, in the case of children attending the national primary schools, dental examinations are carried out only once in four or even five years.  That is not sufficient.</P>
      <P>I should like the scheme to be extended so as to give a more frequent examination.  The worst feature of the scheme is that if a child attends a private school the management of which do not invite the health board to undertake dental examinations, that child cannot benefit from the services that are available to children in other schools.  In addition there are those children who do not attend school, for instance, the children of travelling people.  They, too, are excluded from the dental scheme as operated by the health boards.  Consequently I urge the Minister to encourage the health boards to extend this scheme to all children and, thereby, to eliminate what I would describe as discrimination in respect of those children not attending national primary schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair. First, I would ask the Minister to have a clear look at the whole question of the community care programme.  The Eastern Health Board has become so cumbersome and unwieldy that the necessary attention is not being given to community care.  The change to the health boards system has resulted in the administration becoming so top-heavy with officials that the money that normally would go towards the care of those in need is being spent on the salaries of top officials.  This is a complete negation of the whole concept of what we were aiming to do for our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We talk in terms of massive injections of funds into the health service, but unfortunately the emphasis is not on the distribution of these funds to deserving cases.  People who find it necessary to have recourse to the health boards for the type of assistance that was available under the old health authority assistance scheme find that they may have to wait for months before their applications are considered. Last night I spoke again with a person who had approached me at the beginning of October seeking some form of either supplementary social <Col N="1064" /> welfare allowance or disabled person's maintenance allowance.  After writing to the health board about the case early in October I received a reply on October 8 acknowledging my letter. It is now December and nothing has been done for this man, who is in extreme poverty.  He has no means what-ever. This is not an isolated incident. Hundreds of cases are brought to my attention in which the health board cannot or will not act.  These are cases that require urgent attention.  Such delays are a shocking indictment of the whole community care programme. I am asking the Minister to give the matter his personal attention.  He must be aware of the considerable hardship and suffering that results from such a situation.</P>
    <P>The other point I wish to make relates to medical cards.  There is provision in the Health Act for the taking into consideration of special circumstances in a case where a person's income may be somewhat greater than the statutory limit.  Unfortunately, though, this clause is not being availed of by the health boards.  Perhaps the Minister would urge them to exercise a certain amount of latitude in this regard.  The position is that people whose incomes may be only 70p or 90p greater than the statutory limit for qualification for medical cards are not granted medical cards although their circumstances may warrant this benefit.  Even in cases where the amount is a few pounds greater than the limit specified, there may be special circumstances that warrant the granting of medical cards. The health boards are not prepared to say what constitutes special circumstances. Consequently, I have asked them how people are expected to indicate special circumstances when there is no way of knowing what constitutes special circumstances, but even as a member of the health board I cannot obtain this vital information. If the Minister could get action on these two points, he would be doing a good day's work for the people concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the best thing I can do is to <Col N="1065" /> give some factual information.  Drugs cost £30 million a year at present.  That is a considerable sum of money and it would indicate that every aspect of the supply of drugs should be examined. I hope to go carefully and in depth into the price of drugs supplied, into the consumption of the drugs, the sort of drugs used and whether expensive drugs are being used where less expensive drugs would be equally effective, and into the prescription patterns of doctors in the GMS and elsewhere. This is an area which calls for very careful attention.  Nobody wishes that there should be any skimping in drugs which are necessary and valuable, but on the other hand everybody will support me in my endeavour to eliminate any element of waste which exists.</P>
      <P>On the question of jobs raised by Deputy Boland, on the capital side we created 350 jobs during the year and all of those have been taken up.  On the non-capital side we created 3,800 jobs.  At the end of November 3,200 of these had been filled.  At the end of December 3,600 will hopefully be filled, and the remaining 200 may not be finally filled until January or February.  Deputies will understand that in an operation of this sort there will naturally be difficulties from time to time which, even with the best will in the world, would prevent us from reaching the targets we set ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee of the House will be set up very shortly and I look forward to them performing a very useful and important role in the administration of the health services.  I am trying to ensure that I get a good spread of Deputies from around the country representing the different health boards so that we will have people on the committee who will be able to bring a very important pool of practical knowledge and experience to bear on their discussions.  I will be fairly flexible in the subjects that we will discuss.  I believe there will be very widespread agreement among Deputies who will be members of the committee that we should look at health boards, their effciency, their effectiveness and other aspects of them.  That will probably be one of the first things we will look at, I hope that I will be able <Col N="1066" /> to bring a discussion document on our mental health services before the committee. I assure the House that the committee will be fully operative during the next term.  I am sure that they will make a valuable contribution to the discussions on the different aspects of our health services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £532,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1977, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including, certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The main Estimate for Agriculture amounting to £124 million net and a Supplementary Estimate amounting to over £11.3 million net were passed on 6th July last.  This Supplementary Estimate brings the total net provision for the year to approximately £135.8 million which is some £20 million over the total net provision for 1976.  The sum now sought takes into account savings amounting to about £10.9 million to which I shall refer later.</P>
      <P>Under subhead A. 1 provision is made for a further £600,000 which is required mainly to meet the cost of the 1977 National Wage Agreement. At A. 4 an extra £¼ million is being provided to meet increases in travelling rates, including arrears for 1976, which were decided upon at the end of last year.</P>
      <P>I am seeking an additional sum of £77,000 under subhead B.2 to meet the general cost of the Veterinary College up to the end of May last when the college and the non-administrative staff were taken over by UCD for the unified Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. The excess is due to the unexpected delay in the transfer, which had been scheduled for 1st January, 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supplementary provision of £187,000 at B.5 for An Foras Talúntais <Col N="1067" /> is to meet the cost of the 1977 National Wage Agreement.</P>
    <P>As regards subhead B.18 my predecessor, with the sanction of the previous Minister for Finance, granted an amount of £2,000 to the National Agricultural Authority to cover its initial expenses.  I have already announced that I intend to introduce proposals for the amendment of the legislation relating to the authority.  In particular, the amending legislation will maintain An Foras Talúntais in existence and preserve its autonomy.  The preparation of my legislative proposals is already well advanced and it is my aim to have the new organisational arrangements for the advisory, education and training services in operation at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>A sum of £600,000 is being provided at C6 for the Hardship Fund in connection with the Bovine Tuberculosis and Brucellosis Eradication Schemes.  The sum of £1 million provided by the previous Government for the Hardship Fund has been exhausted and the £600,000 is needed to meet further hardship cases arising from the current rounds of TB and brucellosis testing.  Most of our partner States in the EEC are now virtually free of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis and are determined to remain so.  Accordingly, unless we too eradicate these diseases completely our exports of livestock and livestock based products are liable to encounter increasing restrictions.  It is essential, therefore, that there should be a total commitment on the part of each farmer to protect his livelihood by cooperating with my Department in achieving total eradication of these two scourges in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of disease eradication, I should also like to say that under subheads C2 and C3 a total of £19.5 million was provided for bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication in the current year. Expenditure on the two schemes is now estimated at £12 million and the saving of £7½ million constitutes the bulk of the saving to which I referred earlier.  As regard the reasons for the <Col N="1068" /> saving, the number of reactors disclosed during the year was fewer than had been expected when the rounds of testing commenced.  Also, there was a decline in participation in the Pre-Intensive Brucellosis Scheme.  This is most regrettable because by availing themselves of this scheme herdowners with reactor herds can remove reactors progressively and thus lesson their difficulties when compulsory measures are introduced.</P>
    <P>There are supplementary provisions of £320,000 and £1,140,000 at subheads D2 and D3 for land reclamation work, farm buildings and water supplies under the former schemes. When the farm modernisation scheme was introduced in 1974 farmers who had applications lodged under the old schemes were allowed to opt to continue under these schemes or to transfer to the new scheme.  While a number did transfer to the farm modernisation scheme, an unexpectedly large number opted to have their investments treated under the old schemes.  These schemes were would up on 30th December, 1976, and the clearing of many cases continued into the first quarter of this year.  Only a token Estimate will be necessary in 1978 to cover a small number of cases where legal proceedings or other special circumstances apply.</P>
    <P>I am seeking a further sum of £105,000 at D5 in respect of sheep headage grants.  Because prices were low in the spring the number of hogget ewes held over and presented for grants was far in excess of what had been anticipated.  The provision is also needed to cover the cost in this financial year of the reintroduction of the Mountain Lamb Extension Scheme for the 1977-78 winter season.  In reintroducing this measure my aim was to show the Government's interest in the sheep industry and to provide an interim measure of practical assistance to the industry.  The £2.5 million at E.2 is to meet the cost of an increase of 3.75p per gallon in the liquid milk subsidy which was announced on 14th October and also some extra expenditure on the butter subsidy caused by a slight increase in butter consumption.</P>
    <P>A sum of £185,000 is provided at <Col N="1069" /> E. 6 for payments on exports of certain processed agricultural products.  Because of the devaluations of the Irish Green £ in October and December last year, the prices of cereals, sugar and dairy products in the UK were about 22 per cent lower than in this country.  At the time the monetary compensatory amounts system did not apply to certain processed products based on these raw materials, such as cakes, biscuits, sweets, chocolates and ice cream, and so UK manufacturers had significant cost advantages over Irish manufacturers.  Because of difficulty in getting the MCA system applied to trade in these processed products, the EEC Commission authorised this country to apply levies to imports of them from the UK and to pay subsidies on exports to that country.  This national system operated from 1st April to 3rd July when the Community MCA system was applied. The cost of the national subsidy for the three months was about £185,000.</P>
    <P>As regards the supplementary provision of £3.5 million at subhead M1 for the farm modernisation scheme, the level of investment by farmers has been consistently high throughout the year.  Activity under this scheme is of course widely dispersed throughout the country and is of particular value in maintaining employment in rural areas.  In addition to the employment generated on the farm there is spin-off activity in the fabrication of building components and equipment and the servicing of farm machinery.  A shortfall of £1.15 million is expected in receipts from the EEC under the farm modernisation scheme.  This, however, is purely a matter of timing as a payment on account of over £750,000 was approved recently in Brussels but is unlikely to be received here until after the end of December.</P>
    <P>Under subhead M3 which provides for the disadvantaged areas, an increase of £1.7 million is being sought for the cattle headage, beef cow and sheep schemes.  This is required partly to offset the carryover of grants from 1976 and partly to meet the cost of certain increases in the rates for 1977.  In connection with these schemes also, there is a shortfall of £1 million in the amount recouped from the EEC.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1070" /> The £25,000 being sought under M7 is to meet some old claims under the cattle slaughter premium scheme, which ended early in 1976.</P>
    <P>A small deficiency is expected in appropriations-in-aid, the shortfalls in receipts from the EEC in respect of the farm modernisation scheme and the disadvantaged areas scheme together with some other deficiencies being largely offset by additional receipts of £3 million from the Community in respect of intervention expenses.</P>
    <P>So far as savings are concerned, I have already referred to the savings on TB and brucellosis.  A further important saving amounting to £3 million arises on intervention expenses where the volume of purchases of dairy products was appreciably less than had been expected.  Also, the fall in interest rates reduced the net cost of borrowings to finance intervention purchases.</P>
    <P>I think I have now covered all of the more important items in the Estimate, but if any Deputy wishes to have further information I shall do what I can to supply it.</P>

      <P>Although this is a Supplementary Estimate for £500,000, the cumulative variation in the way in which the money is now being spent as revealed in this Supplementary Estimate as against the way it was to be provided in the original Estimate is £22 million.  An extra £11.5 million is being spent on some heads and £11 million less is being spent on others. This House is being asked to approve of these very large changes in the distribution of spending on agriculture, and I do not believe it is being asked to approve them in an appropriate fashion.  Deputies of this House received in their post this morning a detailed estimate on which this discussion is based to ask them to approve changes amounting to £22 million.  At that sort of notice this sort of debate, in which there is no real opportunity to tease out the various issues involved because of the time limit, is highly unsatisfactory and suggests parliamentary irresponsibility in accountability for Government spending in this House.  This is not a matter in <Col N="1071" /> which the present Government need take full responsibility; all governments are responsible for the procedures that exist and I do not wish to raise this matter in a partisan fashion.  However, the fact is that this debate is not a real one although it is an important one.  There is a case for having a special Estimates Committee for considering this sort of issue in detail and for ensuring that in future years the Supplementary Estimates are circulated to the House at least two weeks before they are to be discussed, not a few hours before.</P>
      <P>The most notable feature of this Supplementary Estimate is the fact that there is a saving of £7.5 million on the brucellosis and bovine TB eradication schemes.  The Minister in the election manifesto of his party promised to introduce realistic compensation for reactors and to ensure that full compensation&mdash;those words were used specifically&mdash;would be paid in cases of hardship.  Since then he has promised on two occasions that this would be done.  It now appears that he has the money to do it.  He has £7.5 million with which he could have raised the level of compensation during this present year, and his Government could have implemented the promises which he made so loudly during the recent election campaign.  Yet they have not done so.  They have not increased compensation rates and they are now saying that it is a matter for next year's budget.  Even though they have £7.5 million to do it this year they will not do it this year, they will do it next year.  Why? The farmers are asking that question and they are entitled to an answer, not only for a financial point of view but from a national point of view.  The eradication scheme will be successful only if reasonable levels of compensation are available.  If the Government have the money with which to pay reasonable levels of compensation a stern question needs to be posed to the Minister in charge as to why he will not use that £7.5 million for that obviously desirable purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £2,000 is provided for the expenses of the National Agricultural <Col N="1072" /> Authority.  We have discussed this already in the House, but the Minister decided not to allow this.  Notwithstanding his views on the matter, why has he not allowed the authority to go ahead with the job in relation to advice and education&mdash;matters which he accepts should be within the competence of that authority?  Why has he not let planning on such important matters go ahead?  We know that the advisory services are bogged down with work on the farm modernistion scheme.  Clearly the advisers need to be relieved of that burden to a certain extent so that they can do the work more effectively in face-to-face contact with the farmers.  The authority are not being allowed to function in relation to such matters where something practical could be done about advice and education.  The Minister is holding up all progress in relation to research and education to await the time when he can deliver his tablets of stone, his holy writ, in the form of his personal legislation.  That is a waste of public resources and of vaulable time.</P>
    <P>There is a provision for sheep headage payments, and I wish to avail of this opportunity to say something on this matter.  This is agitating small farmers in the west and elsewhere where there is no other enterprise open to them because of the nature of their land.  Many of us wonder if the Minister is pursuing a weak approach on this issue.  We heard Mr. Gardner on a recent RTE radio programme &mdash;a correspondent who is not an Irishman and who is not likely to have any political preference&mdash;say that for some reason which he could not explain the pursuit of a common agricultural policy for sheep was not proceeding with the same vigour as was evident some months previously. He did not mention which Government were in office and he was not making a political statement.  It was a testimony from a completely impartial source about the apparent lack of effort by the Government in relation to getting a sheep policy and getting access for our lamb on the French market.  The views of this independent journalist are perhaps underlined by the fact that now we hear talk of a <Col N="1073" /> bilateral deal with the French, a gambit which failed on two previous occasions. Why is it being reopened now? Some rumours were mentioned this morning on the radio that the European Commission may agree to allow the French to retain their right of preventing our lamb entering their markets after 1st January.  I wonder if the EEC would have been able to float that kind of rumour if the previous Government were in office?</P>
    <P>There is also the fact that the court case in respect of which an oral hearing took place last May has not yet concluded.  We know that the European Court tend to give priority to issues where there is pressure from the member government concerned.  The question needs to be asked: what degree of pressure has the Minister been applying on the European Court to get a decision on this case, which is so important for laying the groundwork for the introduction of a common sheep policy and for providing immediate access for our lamb to the French market?</P>
    <P>In relation to grain there is a grave doubt regarding the substantial amounts of grain now in stock and which are not being used.  We have heard that action is being taken in relation to smuggling but it does not seem to be having much effect.  Is the Minister satisfied with the efforts being made by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to grain smuggling which is likely to depress the price for the 1978 crop?  In their election manifesto the Government promised that a grain marketing board would be established. If ever there was a year when such a board was necessary it is this year when there is so much grain that needs to be marked.  The promise was given prior to the election.  The need, relevance and the sense of the promise &mdash;it was a good one&mdash; became all the more evident after the election when the harvest was in.  Why has that promise not yet been delivered?  Why has the Minister not made an announcement in relation to this important industry and in fulfilment of his own and his party's promise to establish such a board?</P>
    <P>An issue that effects the entire <Col N="1074" /> situation of agriculture is the forthcoming EEC price negotiations.  We hear talk from various quarters which suggests there will be a very small price increase.  Many people from whom one would expect to hear different views are almost inclined to accept lying down the suggestion that there does not need to be a substantial increase for farmers this year.  The message should go forth clearly from this House that we do not accept that suggestion. In the last year farmer's costs have risen just as they have for everyone else.  They depend for their income on the prices they receive for their products, just as a worker depends on his pay cheque for his income.  If workers' costs go up their pay must go up; likewise if farmers' costs go up the prices they receive must go up.  In 1977 there has been a 20 per cent increase in building costs as compared with 1976, a 25 per cent increase in feed costs, a 10 per cent increase in fertilizer costs and a 15 per cent in fuel costs.  These are the figures which the EEC Commission, the Council of Ministers and, in particular, our own Minister must take into account.  I hope he will be successful in his negotiations on behalf of Irish farmers. They will expect results from him. They know the facts in relation to their cost increases and they want the Minister to deliver the goods in terms of prices that will compensate them for those increases.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton in his contribution referred to the short notice which Members of this House got of particulars of this Supplementary Estimate.  There is a serious danger that the control of agriculture, our most important industry, is slowly but surely passing out of the hands of the elected Members of Parliament and that in the not too distant future we will find ourselves acting just as a rubber stamp with regard to decisions made in Brussels and elsewhere.  That would be a retrograde step.  We should have an opportunity of discussing fully in this House decisions made in Brussels, Strasbourg and elsewhere.  I hope the Minister will bring before the House any important decisions regarding agriculture that may be taken <Col N="1075" /> by the EEC so that we will have an opportunity of considering them fully.</P>
      <P>The main item in this Supplementary Estimate is the reduction of £7,500,000 in the scheme for disease eradication.  All of us hope that the need for passing substantial sums of money each year for such a scheme will cease in the not too distant future. I am pleased to note that the saving was due to a decline in the number of reactors during the year.  There was an impression given last year by many Deputies now on the Government side that disease was on the decline but that the amount of money then provided, £19½ million, was quite inadequate if we were serious in our attempts to eradicate tuberculosis and brucellosis.</P>
      <P>We have been taunted by the Opposition benches for what they termed a realistic value of reactors. As Deputy Bruton pointed out, this year afforded Fianna Fáil a golden opportunity of putting their words into practice.  The saving of £7,500,000 was there.  Their claim, when in Opposition, was that it was the replacement value that counted irrespective of the type of animal sold, that if a farmer sold a cow he has to get the price of a cow in return.  Indeed during the election campaign at the chapel gates, that was the impression given that our Government did very little in helping farmers to replace diseased animals.  I am particularly pleased that the disease is on the decline, as the Minister has indicated in his introductory remarks on this Supplementary Estimate.  That being so&mdash;and our economic recession being on the decline also; we are all grateful that that is the position&mdash;then the question arises of payments for diseased animals without increasing the amount of money provided in past years.  If this decline continues it is reasonable to assume that, with the amount of money allocated for 1977, we can increase compensation considerably in 1978.  There are alternative ways of expending these savings so far as farmers are concerned, particularly the smaller and medium-sized farmers in the north-west, west and south-west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard quite genuine claims over the past few years for the extension of <Col N="1076" /> severely handicapped areas.  There was difficulty experienced in adhering to the representations made.  There were, firstly, economic problems and, secondly, the fact that such a high proportion of the money would have to come from local funds as contrasted with those of the EEC.  Many farmers in areas contiguous to severely-disadvantaged areas were very annoyed that their areas were not included. I appreciate&mdash;and used to make this point from time to time&mdash; that there has to be established somewhere a demarcation line between a handicapped and a severely handicapped area.  In the course of debates in this House over a considerable period special pleas were made in this respect.  Had we the funds to meet them I considered they were pleas made justifiably, or the plea for a recommendation to be made to the EEC authorities to extend the severely-handicapped areas.  Taking the case of a farmer in a handicapped, as against a severely handicapped, area he is not only deprived of the headage grant but also of the unemployment assistance allowance he would otherwise have got from the Department of Social Welfare, the payment of that allowance being confined largely to areas deemed to be handicapped.</P>
    <P>In West Cork&mdash;a limited part of the country only included for such payments&mdash;it amounts to the fact that a farmer just outside the boundary line loses his headage grant payment and his unemployment assistance.  I would appeal to the Minister to review this position.  I say that fully realising the difficulties involved and that money must be found if such areas are to be extended.  However, he might review the boundary lines in an effort to increase the territory covered by the severely-handicapped system so that farmers who do not benefit at present might be brought within its scope.</P>
    <P>I notice an amount of £2½ million to meet the cost of an increase&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  Perhaps I may refer briefly to the payment of subsidies and the consumption of, say, butter, milk and other farm produce at home.  Apparently it is the viewpoint of both Government and Opposition that some subsidies are essential.  They cost a great deal of money.  There was mentioned in the Minister's introduction a figure of £35,500,000.  I understand the overall figure to be in the region of £60 million.  Speaking for those of us in this Chamber at present I cannot understand why our butter or milk should be subsidised.  My contention is that if there are sections of our people who need subsidisation then give them the benefit of such in some form or other, possibly in one different from that of the present subsidies system.  Were this kind of money at the disposal of the Exchequer it could much more usefully be employed in other fields of activity.  This artificial system of subsidisation of products&mdash; in order to place them on shop counters at a cheaper rate, then going back to our people, putting our hands into their pockets and taking it back in the form of taxation&mdash;must be reviewed. The cost of administration of this subsidies system is a waste of money.  The argument can be made, in answer to that, there is an anxiety to ensure that butter will cost 70p or 75p 1b. or that milk will be 11p or 12p a pint.  People who are able to pay that price should pay it and those who are unable should be sheltered against it.  This subsidisation system must be reviewed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton spoke about the establishment of boards; we have too many boards already here.  It is a question always of setting up boards and taking away and reducing the powers of Ministers and Deputies of this House.  I do not know how many State-sponsored bodies now operate here with little or no surveillance by this House.  Finally, I appeal to the Minister to extend the severely handicapped areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only a few points I wish to raise.  The first is in relation to the price of reactor animals.  I have a document here which shows that an in-calf cow was sold for £130.  The quicker the Minister does something about that the better.  We all know that outbreaks of brucellosis and TB are being hidden because of the ridiculous prices being paid for reactors.</P>
      <P>Prices being paid for sheep are also appalling, and I suggest that this is the reason why our sheep herds have been reduced from five million in 1965 to a little more than three million in 1976, nearly a hundred per cent reduction. If there is not a common sheep policy in the immediate future we will not have any sheep.  I am glad Deputy Murphy referred to grants for severely handicapped areas, and in this context I should like to bring to the Minister's attention the delay between inspections of herds and payment of grants.  I hope the Minister will try to have the grants paid more quickly.  It has become a nuisance to Deputies to have to inquire so often about these things.  I hope the Minister will do all he can to improve the farm reorganisation scheme so that we will not have discrimination against transitional farmers.</P>

      <P>I should have liked to deal with what has become known as the Christmas butter fiasco but I am inhibited by lack of time.  I will refer to two recent orders by the Minister in regard to the grading of <Col N="1079" /> beef and potatoes.  They were important orders and long overdue.  Because of time I will confine myself to the order dealing with potato grading.  An effort should have been made many years ago to grade potatoes so as to give the consumer a better table product but I doubt if the recent order will achieve that.  I speak as both a consumer and a grower.  I believe the order will tend to give a poorer table potato because the potatoes graded highest will not be the best table potato.  I hope the Minister will consider this.  For instance, Arran Banners and Kerr's Pinks are not graded well and there-fore the grading will tend to give a poorer potato to the consumer.  The grading refers only to the size of potatoes and not to what is under the skin.</P>

      <P>In the two-and-a-half minutes at my disposal I will not attempt to deal with all of the points raised.  I should like to emphasise that the provision of time for this important discussion is again inadequate, as it has been for several years&mdash;it has become a chronic situation.  We were in Opposition for two years before we had an opportunity in the House to discuss agricultural problems.</P>
      <P>I will use my one-and-a-half minutes to correct a possible misapprehension of Deputy Murphy in regard to animal diseases.  I said in my opening speech that the number of reactors we have to provide against is not as high as we had expected but it is a great deal higher than it was in earlier years. There has been a regression in the incidence of animal diseases, but the vigorous pursuit of eradication is still vital to agriculture and therefore to the economy generally.  I acknowledge that there is a great need for realistic compensation for owners of diseased herds and I will make every effort to introduce a better system of compensation as soon as I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, no animal disease eradication scheme will be succssful if we have not the full active support of every herd owner.  The situation is <Col N="1080" /> critical in our case and we cannot afford to wait for the process of legal constraints.  There must be full Government and herd owner participation and co-operation.  Without that the scheme will not succeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceedings £617,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1977, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Education (including Institutions of Science and Art), for certain miscellaneous educational and cultural services and for repayment of sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The original net Estimates for my Department totalled £291,279,000.  A first Supplementary Estimate for £270,000 on Vote 29 was taken in July last to provide £250,000 for a temporary grant scheme for youth employment and an additional £20,000 for the Royal Irish Academy.</P>
      <P>Supplementary Estimates amounting to £12,991,000 are now required.</P>
      <P>The greater part of these Supplementary Estimates, that is, £9,211,750 is due to the additional cost of increased salaries and wages arising out of the two phases of the National Wage Agreement for 1977, conciliation agreements and the removal of the reminder of the pay differentials which were not provided for in the 1977 Estimates.</P>
      <P>Provision is also made in these Supplementary Estimates for an additional amount of £1,615,300 over that in the original Estimate and for £482,700 in respect of teaching posts created in implementation of the programme indicated in the Fianna Fáil manifesto announcements for reducing large classes in primary schools and for improving the pupil/teacher ratio in second level schools.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimates also make provision for an additional amount of £2,068,400 for capital expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> The Supplementary Estimates are made up as follows: Office of the Minister for Education, £617,000 Primary Education, £6,873,000; Secondary Education, £1,877,000; Vocational Education, £1,207,000; Residential Homes and Special Schools, £47,000; Higher Education, £2,370,000.</P>
    <P>The following are the main items for which additional provision is being made in the Supplementary Estimates and to which I consider it appropriate to make special reference.  Vote 29: A.1.&mdash;Salaries, Wages and allowances, £178,000; D.3.&mdash;Transport Services, £658,000; F.3.&mdash;Archaeological Excavations, £25,000.</P>
    <P>The increased provision in subhead A.1 is due to the salary and wage increases which took place in 1977.</P>
    <P>The extra amount required for subhead D.3 for school transport is due to an increase in the subsidy paid to CIE towards the fares of school children travelling on scheduled services, loss in revenue by CIE on abolition of increases in rates of fares for concessionary fare-paying pupils on special school buses, increases in the allowances to transport liaison officers and increased costs generally.</P>
    <P>The extra provision in subhead F.3 is to meet the cost of further excavations at the Dublin civic offices site in Wood Quay during the period to the end of the financial year 1977.</P>
    <P>On Vote 30 the increased provision of £338,500 in subhead A.1 covers increased salaries together with an increase of £250,000 in the capital provision for the training colleges.  The extra £4,084,000 for subhead C.1 as well as including money for increased salaries also provides for an additional amount as provided in the Budget Statement 1977 to meet the deficit in the original Estimate.  It also provides for payments under the trainee-teacher scheme for national schools which has been introduced in the present school-year.</P>
    <P>An additional £2 million is being provided in subhead E for the purpose of additional expenditure in connection with the provision of national schools in new housing areas and for the replacement of old and unsuitable school premises.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1082" /> On Vote 31 the extra £2,303,000 for subhead B includes an additional amount to meet a deficit in the original Estimate and also makes provision for the additional posts required to implement the measures announced in the manifesto for the reduction of the pupil/teacher ratio in secondary schools.  A further £26,000 is required for subhead C to meet increased payments to superintendents at the Department's examinations.  The sum of £4,000 for subhead F.2 is to provide for increases resulting from the 1977 National Wage Agreement.</P>
    <P>£322,000 is required under subhead H.1 to meet the cost of increased salaries and wages, new posts and the improvement made by me in the pupil/ teacher ratio.</P>
    <P>On Vote 32 an additional £1,779,500 is being provided in subhead A for an increase in the provision for grants to vocational education committees to enable them to meet the increased cost of salaries and wages, new teaching posts and my improvement there also in the pupil/teacher ratio.</P>
    <P>The additional sum of £3,600 under subhead C is required for residential schools of domestic training.  An additional £390,900 is required for the increased cost of salaries and wages in the regional technical colleges.  This sum includes the sum of £103,000 transferred from subhead A following the raising of the status of the Technical Institute, Clash, Tralee, to that of regional technical college.</P>
    <P>On Vote 33, an additional £50,000 is required for subhead E in connection with the construction of group homes.</P>
    <P>On Vote 34, the additional provision in subhead A.2 includes £1,632,000 for the increased cost of salaries and wages in NUI, UCD, UCC, UCG, Maynooth, TCD, the National College of Art and Design and the National Institute of Higher Education, Limerick.  Provision is also being made for additional capital expenditure of £748,400 under subhead A.3 on works in progress at UCD, UCC, UCG and TCD as well as under subhead A.4 for furniture and equipment for the National Institute of Higher Education, Limerick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for being brief.  I also intend to be brief.  May I congratulate him on his appointment to the ministry and wish him well in his Department?  The more money he can get and spend on education the better we will like him.  He is a great stirrer of the education pot, and the more I look at developments the more we seem to be at a high boiling point.</P>
      <P>I want to get the record straight on a number of issues, because this marvellous manifesto was mentioned at least twice in the Minister's opening speech and it seems to be now the new bible.  Presumably we will all be blessing ourselves shortly whenever it is mentioned here.  The Minister is misleading the House in regard to certain matters to which I shall refer in a few minutes.  First, I want to put the record straight because I will not tolerate facts being contorted in any way where education is concerned, particularly this year in which we have had a change of Government.</P>
      <P>The record reads something like this: in 1972-73 Fianna Fáil devoted £110,171,411 to education.  In 1977 net expenditure was estimated at £291,510,000.  That is a solid sum, a considerable increase.  It shows that over a period considerable progress was made by the National Coalition Government on all fronts in education. Massive expansions were undertaken. There was solid progress on buildings. There was solid progress in regard to money spent on teachers.  I will not have the Minister coming in here throwing, as he does in his introductory speech, cold water on what has been done.</P>
      <P>In relation to expenditure, I note that over £2 million has not been spent under the various votes.  That is a considerable sum of money and a full explanation is very desirable as to why that sum was not spent.  The exact amount is £2,091,400.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last budget £1.8 million was specifically voted in relation to teachers.  I asked the Minister for Education if the 1,100 additional teachers for first and second level schools provided for in the job creation programme in the 1977 Budget <Col N="1084" /> have been engaged and, if so, if he would specify the sectors to which they have been allocated, and I asked him to make a statement on the matter.  I received the Minister's reply this morning and it states:</P>
    <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to question No. 455 of 10th November.  The 1,100 posts created have been filled.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil did not fill those posts because this was provided for by the National Coalition Government.  The Minister should not claim credit for creating 1,100 jobs in education which he did not create.</P>
    <P>The other matter relates to the £6 million which was set aside by the Coalition Government under the job creation programme.  Of that £6 million, only £4,150,000 has actually been spent.  Why?  This almost amounts to a dereliction of duty.  We are being told about the marvellous job creation programme of the new Government in their manifesto, yet the moneys provided have not been spent.</P>
    <P>Regarding the matter of additional jobs created in 1977 on capital works under the Minister, 384 jobs were created.  Those jobs were provided for in the job creation programme of the Coalition Government and I will not listen to the Minister claiming credit for it.</P>
    <P>In relation to primary education, I welcome the agreement in relation to the Dalkey and Marley Grange schools.  The Minister is quoted in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> as saying that the Marley Grange Committee have a good case and that he is meeting them on Monday.  That is good.  I am pleased that agreement is being reached regarding these two schools.  We should always move forward liberally and with an open mind in relation to multi-denominational schools, and the Minister will have our full support for any reasonable moves.</P>
    <P>Generally, the Minister should work in harmony with the teaching profession. No progress can be made without proper consultation with the teaching profession.  They have a kick like a mule and one must work with them.  In relation to the special graduate scheme, that was not done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine, but the fact is that the body of members of the INTO kicked out that scheme.  It was unfortunate because the objective of reducing class sizes has our full support but the Minister will not make any headway by moving against the general body of opinion in the various trade unions representing the teaching professions. The Minister could have done great damage from the point of view of good relations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and from the point of view of future negotiations by the manner in which the scheme was handled, and it could damage the Minister in the years ahead.  It is a pity that some scheme could not have been organised to allow them to go directly into the classroom and to reduce class sizes, especially in urban areas.  If this kind of approach is repeated in future we could have unrest in the teaching profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the governing bodies of the training colleges seems to be in the air, and the Minister should take an open stand on this matter and guarantee that the teaching staff and the students will be represented on the governing bodies of teacher-training colleges.  This is a very important matter.  I am completely in favour of participation by parents, teachers and students on boards of management and governing bodies.  By being involved <Col N="1086" /> they will see the problems clearly. The Minister has a part to play, not only in relation to teacher-training colleges but also in relation to secondary schools.  Representation for teachers is very important in relation to boards of management that will evolve. Students should also be represented on boards of management in the post-primary sector.  The Minister should make a clear statement and point the way forward.</P>
    <P>The provision of audio-visual aids should be encouraged.  The previous Government made a dreadful mistake in reducing the moneys voted for this purpose.  Young children benefit especially from audio-visual aids because they are provided with images which they can see and understand.</P>
    <P>We are all committed to ensuring that voluntary secondary schools will have sufficient funds at their disposal. The method of financing needs to be examined in order to ensure that such schools have adequate financial support. As it is, I believe that they are not getting sufficient moneys.  Greater emphasis has been put on vocational and community schools, and voluntary secondary schools are not getting their fair share of the cake.  They are not being discriminated against but a different method of financing is called for and perhaps the Minister would initiate some study of this very important matter.  They are crying out for money to do good work.  We have a clear obligation to give them our whole-hearted support.</P>
    <P>There is need for full mobility between the primary, secondary and vocational sectors of teaching.  The B.Ed. degree has now turned out to be unsatisfactory.  The National University have not accepted people with this degree for further study in the universities. That is most unsatisfactory.  The effort made to classify primary school teachers as teachers with degrees is correct because it will lead to much better mobility within the primary and the post-primary sectors.  Something will have to be done urgently to correct the situation which has now arisen because of the NUI decision in relation to the Bachelor of Education degree.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1087" /> The training period for national teachers may have to be increased to four years.  It may have to be a three year academic course and a one year practical course.  That would allow them to have a full degree as Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science.  I would like to see that taking place.  There may be other ways.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on this.  There is no point in giving a primary degree from a university to people who have just graduated and then find out that the primary degree is not worth being called that. It is only, in effect, being granted the status of a diploma.  That is about the standard the university recognise it as.</P>
    <P>This calls for immediate clarification by the Minister and it calls for action to correct what has been done. I do not believe we can continue to have B.Ed. degree as it is now constituted. It will not lead to the greater objective of full mobility within the teaching service.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on this.</P>
    <P>With regard to the vocational sector the position regarding apprentice and technician training is not satisfactory. The Minister is well aware of the impasse which has been reached because of the new apprenticeship scheme.  The regional technical colleges are not quite clear of the direction in which they will move in regard to apprenticeship training.  The Minister should become actively involved in resolving the present impasse and clarifying the matter so that those involved, AnCO, the RTC and the colleges of technology are fully aware of the direction in which the Department are going and are fully satisfied of their position within the scheme of things.</P>
    <P>I am not particularly familiar with the residential homes and special schools aspect of education.  Obviously money spent here has the full support of the House.  There is a great need for adequate remedial teachers in primary schools.  It is vitally important that primary school children be monitored every year so that any slow learners and any children who have problems are examined.  If their problems are allowed go on until they are <Col N="1088" /> 15 or 16 years of age it is very hard to rectify them.  It is vitally important to have a continuous monitoring system during primary school education. Money spent there will have the full support of the House.  I do not believe we are tackling this question in a professional way.  There is need to have a foolproof system and professional monitoring of retarded children, slow learners and people with particular drawbacks.  The sooner those children are monitored the better chance they have of overcoming their problems.</P>
    <P>The third level sector of education gets most publicity because of the very articulate and organised students' union and of the way in which protestations can be made.  The question of the higher education grants under the 1968 Act is a very live issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I await the Minister's statement with great interest. I am sorry he did not take the opportunity to include it here.  In regard to the National Council for Education Awards the Government have decided to establish the NCEA as the degree-awarding council for non-university third level education. The Minister, in doing this, has reversed the previous Government's policy in this respect, which was to have a comprehensive and unified approach to this problem.  I am wondering what consultations the Minister has had in this regard with the National University, with Trinity College and with the Higher Education Authority.  Recent reports in the national newspapers would indicate that to date there has been very little consultation. Unfortunately, one gets the impression that the Minister's decision to constitute by statute the NCEA is purely political. That is something that is not to be welcomed in education.  A decision has been made and the relevant Bill will be brought before the House.  At that point I will examine the Bill in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the NCEA should be cleared up once and for all.  When the matter is before the House we will give it our close scrutiny.</P>
      <P>A continuing problem that needs urgent attention is the question of pressure on the National Library. Perhaps the Minister would tell us when replying whether he has had a consultant's report in this regard and, if so, if he intends to publish it.  The library is bursting at the seams and unless steps are taken to relieve the pressure it may grind to a halt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are problems, too, in connection with the National College of Art and Design.  The staff there are unhappy <Col N="1090" /> so far as a number of appointments are concerned and they are anxious, too, in regard to the direction that some courses are taking. There is a case for a broadening of the board of the NCAD to allow for wider representation.  It is a college of great potential and one that should contribute if treated properly, in a positive way to industry.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of complaints throughout the country in respect of the working of the school transport scheme, a scheme which, as I appreciate, is very costly. Apparently a consultants' report on this scheme was to have been made to the Minister.  Can he say whether he has received this report and, if so, whether he intends publishing it.</P>

      <P>I do not like interrupting the Deputy but he has been speaking for 25 minutes and as the debate is very limited&mdash; only one-and-a-half hours&mdash;other Deputies will not have a chance to contribute if any one Deputy goes on for too long.  I have no power, though, to direct the Deputy to conclude.</P>

      <P>We discussed this matter at the commencement of business today so I appreciate the point made by the Chair.  There are a number of other matters I would like to raise but I am precluded from doing so by reason of the agreement we reached.  I was disappointed to hear the Minister speak in such a political way on this Estimate.  I trust that I have put the record straight from the point of view of money and of job creation as embarked on and carried through by the last Government.  It is regrettable that the moneys provided were not spent.  Of the £6 million voted only a little more than £4 million has been spent whereas we could have spent the remaining £2 million on education.  However, I shall await the Bill to discuss all these matters in detail.</P>

      <P>What we have here in these Supplementary Estimates is basically a housekeeping document.  There is not much in them beyond the soupçon or flavour of the manifesto which occurs here and there.  I would go further and say that this Education Estimate is not worthy of the Minister.  I am disappointed that on his first venture before the House with an Estimate he should be bringing in one that is so innocuous and which bears such little relationship to the rhetoric of the past eight months.  I must protest at the cavalier attitude of the Minister in declining to take the opportunity open to him to include in this Estimate figures for the higher education grants that Deputy Collins mentioned.  It is all the more odd that we have been informed by the newspapers that the Minister is about to make a statement in this regard tomorrow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have referred already to the basic theme of this Supplementary Estimate, which is a housekeeping exercise of a comparatively minor nature.  But there is running through the Estimate also, as I have said, the soupçon of the manifesto.  Not only that but it seems that something that is basically the same is turning up in several different places in the Minister's speech so that the misguided or semi-literate reader might be forgiven for assuming that different matters were being talked about whereas there is <Col N="1093" /> merely a series of repetitions.  For example, on the second page of the speech there is a reference to an additional amount of money in respect of teaching posts created on implementation of the programme indicated in the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  On the next page we read about payments under the trainee teachers scheme for national schools which is being introduced in the present school year.  We all know that that relates to precisely the same thing as that which is referred to in the previous page in relation to the programme in the Fianna Fáil manifesto.</P>
      <P>In the fourth page of the Minister's brief there is further reference to measures announced in the manifesto for the reduction of the pupil-teacher ratio in secondary schools.  These are all effectively the same thing but they have been spread, like so much margarine, over the substance of the Supplementary Estimates as a whole to try to give political substance to them and to give the impression that far more has been done than actually has been done.  The office of the Minister for Education is a very important office, not least because we have such a highly centralised educational system. I am in favour of a more decentralised system, but if we are to have a centralised educational system for the foreseeable future it must be efficient.  If it is to be efficient it needs the administrative and financial resources to enable it to do the job properly.  One of the things that has been wrong with the famous faceless bureaucrats of the Department of Education is that there are not enough of them.  The efficiency of the administration of the office of the Minister depends not just on the quality but on the quantity of public servants employed there.  Looking through the State directory for 1977, published at a time when the preceeding Government were in office, I note that, even at that stage, a substantial number of posts in that Department remained unfilled.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No. That would be administration.  The Deputy can refer to staffing.  I will give the Deputy a fair amount of latitude, but we cannot discuss administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to staffing the Minister will have my support and perhaps the support of Deputy Collins in applying the sort of moneys we are voting now to redressing the situation within the Department in general especially in relation to the post primary inspectorate where there are still a substantial number of vacancies. When replying would the Minister indicate whether the proposes to re-establish within the Department the development branch whose operations were terminated during the period of office of the last Government?</P>
      <P>There are a number of points in primary education which are very pertinent to this Supplementary Estimate. We have in the Supplementary a saving of capital in the school transport area and an increase in current expenditure. It is time that we knew the result of the consultancy survey carried out at the behest of the previous Government into the school transport system.  What decisions, if any, does the Minister propose to take on foot of that survey?  The school bus transport system is essential, but it has grown over the years and it was obvious that a consultancy study was needed.  It was obvious that the whole situation needed to be looked at afresh.  We would like evidence that the Minister is doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his speech in relation to primary education referred to the measures that he is taking in line with the manifesto to reduce the numbers in classes in primary schools.  Not long after he assumed office I asked the Minister in a Parliamentary Question what he was proposing to do about the substantial numbers of children who <Col N="1095" /> were still in classes of over 45.  In his reply the Minister said that he regarded this as a very serious situation and that because of the seriousness he proposed to have a special investigation made into this problem.  Will the Minister let us know whether that investigation is yet completed?  If it is completed could the Minister let us know the result and what action, if any, he proposes to take on foot of it?  The Minister is probably aware that large classes in primary schools are more prevalent in the county Dublin area than anywhere else.  Figures that the Minister gave in reply to Parliamentary Question indicated that the average pupil/teacher ratio in county Dublin is something over 35.  These figures mask the reality of the situation to a certain extent because these figures include all teachers in the assessment of the pupil/teacher ratio, and in the suburban areas, which is where most of the county Dublin schools are situated, the schools are very large and there are a large number of non-teaching principals.  If we subtracted them from the total of teachers and took into account that in county Dublin there are a substantial number of small rural schools with very favourable pupil/teacher ratios we will see that the pupil/teacher ratios in this suburban belt running from Dún Laoghaire to Howth in a great arc around the city is the worst in the country.  I suspect that many of the classes of over 45 are to be found in these areas.  The pupil/teacher ratio in county Cavan which forms part of the Minister's constituency is something like 27.5 to 1 on average.  While there are special circumstances there by virtue of the geography and the demographic distribution of the people, I hope we can take it that the Minister would like to see county Dublin ratios reduced to the level in his own constituency.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister ask the teachers in all schools whether they would be prepared to co-operate in the assessment of children to find out before they leave primary schools what children are educationally at risk, and what children cannot read or write?  These are the children that will be the losers <Col N="1096" /> all the way through the rest of the educational system.  I have evidence from the INTO that teachers will co-operate in this.  I believe that a simple assessment to identify such children, carried out by the teachers, could do more to identify the real problems in our educational system and to remedy them before they become too expensive to remedy than anything else.</P>
    <P>I notice that in relation to primary school education there is a very welcome increase in aid towards the cost of school books.  Is the Minister aware of the degree of dissatisfaction with the scheme that currently exists?  I do not receive many queries directly about education apart from queries about class size, but of the queries I receive seven out of ten are about the free book scheme.  Even very impoverished parents are first of all required to buy all the books without any absolute guarantee that any part of the money they are spending will be refunded.  They find the scheme difficult to understand, and they find that in some cases it can be operated in a way that appears discriminatory.</P>
    <P>The teachers themselves, who under this scheme are responsible for deciding who gets the money and how much each person gets, are put in a very invidious position.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this area and see whether or not a better scheme can be evolved. We are now discussing a Supplementary Estimate.  In the not too distant past, indeed under the previous administration, I can recall an occasion on which not all of that allocation was taken up.  Now not only is the whole allocation taken up but there is more pressure on it, and the more pressure on this scheme the more we can see that the scheme is not adequate. It is giving way at the seams.</P>
    <P>Referring to subhead H.1, in regard to second level education we would like to hear from the Minister some statement of his policy in relation to comprehensive community schools. The running costs have gone up.  This has largely to do with salaries, but we are anxious to know if the Minister is simply going to regard the situation of second level as one in which many <Col N="1097" /> schools are competing with one another.  Such a situation is often discriminatory against children and wasteful of resources.  Is the Minister satisfied with this or is he going to press ahead with further relaxation in this matter?  If he does not I suspect that the financial cross he will be required to carry will eventually bow even his stout shoulders.</P>
    <P>Again at second level I note increased payment of £26,000 for examination certificate level.  Is the Minister aware that the whole structure of the examination system at second level is currently under threat of industrial action because of inadequate payments for examinations?  Can he assure us that parents of children who are doing examinations this year and the children themselves will not be put through an experience of tension before decisions are finally taken to make realistic sums available to the people who look after these examinations?</P>
    <P>On the third level side there are a couple of relatively minor points on which I would like some clarification. For example, in Vote 30 a certain amount is provided for payments under the trainee-teacher scheme for national schools.  It is unclear from the Minister's speech what payments precisely are involved.  I imagine that this is the payment of salary to as many of the teachers as are taking up the course in the training colleges.</P>

      <P>The Deputy mentioned third level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as trainee teachers are attending third level institutions; I was not referring to the third level grants specifically.  How many of the 398 people who signed on for the course in the training colleges initially have completed satisfactorily this course, and how many of those 398 have indicated to the Minister that they will proceed now to the full course which is being run from now until next <Col N="1098" /> December?  I also ask the Minister to reconsider the financing of this scheme, because it is not a generous scheme by any means.  These trainee teachers are not only to go on three-quarters of their salary&mdash;frozen salary indeed&mdash;for three years but they also have to find college fees and perhaps some other expenses out of that.  Perhaps the Minister could look again at the generosity that that scheme embodies. I believe it is not generous enough.</P>
      <P>Turning to third level proper&mdash; although in effect we are still at second level and we are talking about regional technical colleges under subhead I.1&mdash;could I ask the Minister whether he is now making provision for the urgently needed extensions to some of the regional technical college? One of them in Letterkenny, a town the Minister must know well, is considerably overdue and as a result of its not being provided to date there is severe overcrowding in that college.  In other colleges where extensions have been provided, basic facilities like canteen, library and ancillary facilities have not been scaled up to match the huge increase in the student population, with the result that the amount of education facilities available per student has gone down sharply because the number of student places has gone up.</P>
      <P>On third level I do not propose to say much on this Supplementary Estimate because I hope we will have the opportunity of a major debate on higher education when the Minister brings in his legislation, but I ask him to make sure that this Higher Education Authority exercise a reasonably close scrutiny over the expenditure of funds granted in this fashion to some of the third level institutions.  One third level institution in the recent past managed to find somewhere in their budget a figure of £25,000 for tree surgery.  We are all in favour of trees, and surgery on trees if necessary, but think of the number of higher education grants that £25,000 could have funded.  We will ask the Higher Education Authority to keep a beady eye on the expenditure patterns of the institutions under their care.  I trust the Minister will make his views plain to them in this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Fine Gael spokesman for his good wishes, and I thank the two spokesmen for their contributions.</P>
      <P>I start off by refuting Deputy Collins's statement that the facts regarding the expenditure on certain teachers' salaries are contorted by me in my paper.  Contortion did take place, but it took place in the Book of Estimates prepared by the previous administration.  As the Deputy correctly says £1.8 million was mentioned in the budget in a job creation context, but the 1,100 teachers which this £1.8 million was to cater for additional pupils and were in respect of people who were retiring during the year.  That is a fact.  There is no contortion. If the Book of Estimates had been honestly compiled this £1.8 million would have been there already.  My predecessor, the unfortunate man, was caught in this.  There was a letter from the Department of Education to the Department of Finance dated 27th January, 1977, and I wish to quote the relevant paragraph for the benefit of the House.  If there is any accusation of contortion it should be from this side of the House.  The letter stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The restoration of these amounts totalling £1.8 million does not allow of an improvement of the pupil/teacher ratios in first- and second-level schools.  It would <Col N="1100" /> merely maintain the existing pupil/ teacher ratios.  In this connection attention may be drawn also to the observation made by the Minister for Finance at page 12 of his budget statement:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Because of the continuing increase in the number of pupils, teacher numbers have had to be expanded to maintain pupil/ teacher ratios and rose by more than 5 per cent in 1975 and by approximately 4 per cent in 1976.</P>
    <P>Similar circumstances apply in 1977 in the case of a continuing increase in pupils affecting teacher numbers as applied in 1975 and 1976 and the full amount of £1.8 million is required to meet such a situation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The second point made by Deputy Collins was in connection with capital expenditure.  Similarly, although not to the same extent, there was a certain contortion here because while the capital programme made allowance for the increase in the consumer price index the £6 million referred to in the budget for the most part had to be spread over projects already in hand.  Again, if the Book of Estimates had been compiled properly the officials in the Department of Finance would have had two to three months more and they could, and I can, spend the full amount if full notice is given.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to the trainee-teacher scheme.  I want to say now that I decry very much the attack by Deputy Collins on the executive of the INTO.  This executive was democratically elected, the general membership is experienced in teaching and they are teaching at the moment.  Its officers are among the most experienced people in education and I consulted with them.  They made a very useful contribution to the debate that we had in the Department of Education regarding my scheme.  Certain modifications were introduced as a result of their suggestions and in the end these people, in a representative capacity, democratically elected, experienced and sophisticated, accepted the scheme.  I deny that there was any <Col N="1101" /> lack of consultation.  The general body, in accordance with the rules of their trade union, were entitled to do what they did.  We went into consultation again and helped to get over that problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">

      <P>The Deputy referred to the situation regarding B.Ed. degrees. I may be a little out of order on this matter but the Chair allowed the Deputy to refer to it.  As far as I can see, I am in agreement with the Deputy. To me it appears to be completely illogical that somebody with an honours B.Ed. degree is not allowed by the universities to do a master's degree in that field.  The Deputy and I are agreeing on one point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry for following bad example.  There are problems with regard to the school transport scheme.  I agree with the Deputies that it is a very expensive scheme.  I <Col N="1102" /> know that at one stage a kite was flown by the previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan, about the abolition of the scheme.  There was a big brouhaha and there were no changes except that certain restrictions were imposed.  Significantly in the early part of the year some of the restrictions were lifted.  Deputy Horgan, and perhaps Deputy Collins also, asked about the report.  It has not yet been received.  I think that the person who was working on the report fell ill and this delayed it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what I will do until I see it.  I am sorry Deputy Horgan came into conflict with the Chair on the question of grants but it was mainly due to his ignorance of how the scheme works.  We do not pay in 1977 for the 1977-78 grants. He should know that central government only come into it a year later and this is why there was no reference to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Deputy that many of my bureaucrats have very beautiful faces.  I appreciate the Deputy saying I should have more in my Department, and I shall quote him in my discussions with the Department for the Public Service.  With regard to the development branch which Deputy Horgan said was abolished&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said discontinued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or discontinued by my predecessor, it does not exist as a development branch as such. Some of the people who had been working in that branch are still working in the same line of country and we have the benefit of their experience.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of large classes, as was pointed out I am very concerned about it no matter where such classes exist.  As I have said in this House before, I am always very suspicious of averages.  There can be one town; two schools in it; there can be 50 in a class in one school, average, 20 in another; one can get an average of 35 and it does not tell one very much.</P>
      <P>It is of particular concern to me. The trainee graduates will bring about an improvement.  Also, next summer, we will have 300 extra teachers trained&mdash;apart from my trainee graduates&mdash;over and above the normal replacement of retiring people and the numbers that have to be made available for increasing pupils in the schools.  This is not going to solve the problem.  But, if one takes 30 pupils and multiplies by 300, one gets 9,000 and if my trainee graduates can cope with 9,000&mdash;and I am putting the ratio low&mdash;that is at least 18,000 extra who will be catered for in the year 1978-79.  I am not complacent about it; I do not intend to become complacent about it until I have dealt with the problem to the best of my ability and in accordance with all of the resources available.</P>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Horgan is doing some research on my constituency. However, if he wants some of his pupils from Dublin South County to change places with the little ladeens and lassies who are climbing Glangevlin mountain on frosty mornings, we will arrange a suitable pupil exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have mountains in South County Dublin also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there are but they are ambitious in calling themselves mountains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> I am glad to tell the Deputy that the money provided&mdash;and it is a small amount right enough&mdash;for school books is an indication that the party's policy has been that where people cannot afford it books should be supplied and that, where they can, we think they should purchase their own.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Horgan's reference to community and comprehensive schools, my main concern, unlike that of Deputy Horgan, is not to become an arbiter in places where there are disputes but in fact to supply school places.  From what Deputy Horgan has said he would be indicating to me that there might be areas where there would be too many school places, but particularly in the Dublin region, we are not going to reach that stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we will reach that stage in the near future.  I do not believe we will ever reach that stage.  I am pleased anyway that he tried to help me carry what he called my financial cross.  I am sure he will be suitably rewarded for this aid.</P>
      <P>The point about the examinations was made also by Deputy Horgan. He mentioned anxiety amongst parents. I want to assure the Deputy that the examinations will be held, superintended and examined under the auspices of my Department, and nobody need break out in a rash over them. He was, I thought, rather unkind to me in his reference to the trainee graduates scheme.  He said it was not a generous scheme.  My contention&mdash;&mdash; and I put it on the record of the House &mdash;is that if a number of graduates, a good number of them who are unable to find jobs, who have not been able to find jobs, who are anxious to teach and feel they have a vocation to teach, are taken, provided with salary, trained and put into the schools, I do not understand the word &ldquo;generosity&rdquo; if one cannot predicate it of that scheme.</P>
      <P>The final point made by Deputy Horgan was about regional technical colleges.  It is a particular delight to me to know that the regional technical colleges are expanding, that there is demand for more facilities in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> My Department are determined that we will not be found wanting in regard to making provision for them.  The spokesman for Fine Gael is the chairman of a board of management&mdash;a very good one from what I hear, and I have examined its record&mdash;of a regional technical college in Waterford. We in Fianna Fáil are particularly proud of having set up a committee which recommended the establishment of these regional technical colleges; we have sustained them and shall continue to do so.</P>

      <P>The main Estimate for my Department for 1977 was for a net sum of £125,374,000.  The Supplementary Estimate which I am now introducing is for an additional net sum of £6.1 million.  It makes additional provision for £7.54 million under five subheads but there will be savings of £1.44 million on subheads F and G.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under subhead A provision is made for pay increases amounting to £2.85 million granted under the national pay agreement operative from 1st April this year because provision was not made for them in the original Estimate. Provision is also made for £250,000 <Col N="1107" /> for higher social welfare employers' contributions and £150,000 to meet the staff costs of a television licence campaign. In addition, a further £500,000 is required to meet extra staff costs arising out of the creation of new jobs for telephone development and a further £600,000 for overtime on telephone construction works and the installation of telephone.  The additional staff expenditure on telephone development is offset by savings of £1.1 million on telephone equipment under subhead F. The total extra amount needed under the pay subhead amounts to £4.35 million.</P>
    <P>Under subhead D an additional sum of £150,000 is required to meet the extra costs of conveyance of mails by air because of increased traffic and devaluation of sterling and of conveyance of mails by sea because of higher transatlantic freight charges.</P>
    <P>Under subhead E an additional sum of £775,000 is required for the purchase of replacement vans for the postal fleet and new vans for the scheme for motorising rural posts; increased supplies and costs of mailbags; increased costs of stamp stationery; increased contract price for the telephone directory and increased costs of miscellaneous stores including telegraph paper.</P>
    <P>Under subhead J, an extra amount of £250,000 is required to meet the higher cost of pensions and lump sums because of the national pay agreement and other pay and pension increases.</P>
    <P>Under subhead L.1, an additional sum of £2.015 million is provided for an increased grant-in-aid to Radio Telefís Éireann in respect of increased net receipts from the higher television licence fees introduced from 1st April last and from higher licence numbers resulting from the recent television licence campaign.  The increased grant-in-aid to Radio Telfís Éireann and the cost of the licence campaign will be offset by a corresponding increase in the amount payable to the Exchequer as Exchequer Extra Receipts in respect of the sales of television licences.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at the outset the net additional sum now required is £6.1 million which brings the total <Col N="1108" /> net Estimte for the year to £131,474,000.</P>

      <P>As I have said, I had anticipated that the debate would begin at 3.30 p.m. There is nothing controversial in the vote and we had a very interesting and extended debate on the Department during the discussion on the Telephone Capital Bill.  There is an element of job creation involved here and I hope the Minister's speech indicates that the Government intend to proceed as rapidly as possible with capital works involving telephone development and new installations.</P>
      <P>This debate offers the Minister an opportunity to indicate that it is proposed to accelerate the telephone development programme much more rapidly than heretofore.  It is ironical, in a sense, that the demand for telephone connections is far outstripping our ability to supply them, and any moves that could be made to speed up the telephone development system, including the building of exchanges, would provide employment.  I appreciate that it is not as simple as pressing a button to do this because one cannot complete the building of a telephone exchange today and have it operating tomorrow, but there is a demand for telephones far in excess of supply and the employment potential here is far greater than in most other State areas.  It is a very important sphere of employment because it involves technicians, engineers and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main point I should like to make is in relation to a problem we had in Limerick recently.  I telephoned the Parliamentary Secretary and I was received with the greatest courtesy by his private secretary.  The point relates to a decision by the Department to transfer from Limerick to Dublin the system of customs examination of incoming parcels.  That system had <Col N="1109" /> operated satisfactorily for many years. I made my representations to the private secretary, telling him there was strong opposition to the change not only from the operators of the system in Limerick but from the entire business community who regarded the service as very important.</P>
    <P>This service was to have been transferred to Dublin on 1st December. Unofficially, I understand that decision has been put aside and I take this opportunity to impress on the Minister the importance of keeping that service in Limerick.  I have received impressive representations from business people and others who expressed great satisfaction with the service they have been getting and who were fearful of the results of the proposed change.</P>
    <P>I do not want to put the Minister in a spot by asking him for an immediate reply&mdash;I appreciate it is more a matter for his Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;but I ask him sincerely to reconsider the decision to take away this service from Limerick.  I appreciate that there is a problem about the building in which this service is being performed and about the acquisition of a suitable alternative building.  In the past year a proposal was put forward to acquire a building adjacent to the existing GPO in Limerick but that building was found to be unsuitable. I urge the Minister to use his good offices in this respect.</P>

      <P>Having regard to my particular responsibilities I take it that the term &ldquo;public moneys invested in private enterprise companies&rdquo; is intended to relate to the <Col N="1110" /> provision of grant assistance by either the Industrial Development Authority or the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited.</P>
      <P>All proposals for grant assistance are subject to rigorous examination as to the long-term commercial viability and benefit to the State of the particular project.  In addition, grants made by the Industrial Development Authority are normally protected by a requirement that the promoting company invest at least as much in the project by way of equity capital, and the grants are repayable in the event of the recipient company effecting a closure of the grant-assisted under-taking within ten years of the date of the grant agreement.  These measures, though they cannot eliminate the possibility of closures, go as far as is possible towards minimising the risk of loss of State funds in such a situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1111" /> To create badly needed new jobs here in this country we depend to a considerable extent on the establishment here of new projects sponsored by overseas companies.  I am satisfied that a requirement along the lines suggested by the Deputy would be a serious deterrent to the attraction of such projects.  I might add that other countries who are competing with us for projects of this kind do not impose conditions of the kind suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report in question.  The Deputy will appreciate that trading patterns, and so on in the electrical appliance market is a very complex matter, but I am satisfied that, having regard to the existence of other outlets and the quality of the service provided by the board, the overall position is not to a customer's disadvantage.  I do not consider that any further investigation is needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say if such a difference in the retail price of electrical appliances is due to more efficient management by the other firms or is it due to the fact that the ESB have higher costs?</P>

    <Col N="1113" />
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would venture the opinion&mdash;it is no more than my opinion&mdash;that the ESB must have higher costs because it is providing a service for potential electrical appliance customers in all parts of the country all the time.  Individual retailers of electrical appliances deal with local markets only, generally in the more built-up areas where the market is likely to be better, and because of that and, perhaps, for other reasons they are able to sell at lower retail prices than the ESB feels able to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that there is no reason for having such a divergence in the price structure?  Wholesale electrical dealers, supermarkets and every other outlet are far and away cheaper, and can the Minister see justification for this difference between the prices?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sought to give the Deputy my own opinion as to one possible major reason for the difference.  From what I know of the retail electrical appliance industry in the private sector, it engages in a good deal of competition and price cutting. I do not think the ESB indulges in that.  That may account also for part of the difference.</P>

      <P>What I said was that I have no funds out of which to make such grants.  So far as considering whether or not they might be made available I would say to the Deputy that at the moment, both from a technological and the financial viewpoint, wind energy is not a satisfactory or an economic source of power.  I have read a fairly long report on it from the ESB. There is research being carried out in other countries and to a limited extent here in relation to it, and if that research were to result in wind energy becoming a more economic proposition for the generation of electricity it would certainly be considered.  It might be suitable for some of the more remote parts of the country.  The difficulty is there is no continuity of supply, and one of the major inhibitions is the capital needed, not just for the windmills themselves but also to provide a standby source so that there would be continuity of supply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going a little distance beyond the question, but is it not a fact that this country is conducting an experiment at the moment and, if that is so, I would be glad if the Minister would tell us how far it has got in regard to the possibility of combining two sources of alternative energy, namely, windmill farming and the growth of short rotation forestry on the same patch of land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The board has started, or is about to start, experiments in what they call bio-mass conversion from short rotational forestry at the existing turf burning station at Cahirciveen in Kerry.  I understand that the position is that the experiments will continue for some years.  It is hoped that that could be used in conjunction with wind energy, and I think the long-term intention is to put in the Cahirciveen area when the technology has been more fully developed one of these large windmills to find out if the two can work satisfactorily together.  It is only fair to say that the public would be misled if it were thought that there was any possibility <Col N="1115" /> of this proposed arrangement being an economic proposition within the next decade.  It is a long-term proposition. It is one of which I thoroughly approve, and I thoroughly approve of the ESB experimenting because, if it works out, it will be beneficial in the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether or not it is economic next year or in ten years' time will depend very much on other sources of energy, particularly the main source of energy which is imported and over the price of which we have no control. If the price were to go up that would completely change the economics of the entire situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Not drastically.  The main factor involved in the economy of any such proposal as this is the capital cost.  While, undoubtedly, in the long term an increase in the prices of alternative fuel would have an effect, the major problem is the capital expenditure involved on the project itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that the Government, in November, 1973, approved, in principle, a proposal that the Electricity Supply Board should proceed with preparations for the construction of a nuclear power station on the basis, <i>inter alia</i>, that the project would be reassessed before final contractual commitments were entered into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal was temporarily deferred in October, 1975 because of a fall in demand for electricity but has recently been reactivated, having regard to the upsurge in demand for electricity <Col N="1116" /> this year and is at present under consideration in my Department.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps add that I have, of course, available to me the advice in this matter of the Nuclear Energy Board which has the statutory function of advising me on nuclear energy and matters connected therewith, including advice on proposals for the construction of nuclear power stations and on all aspects of the installation, operation and supervision of nuclear power stations.</P>

We would expect any further increases in dealer margins to be achieved mainly in these ways rather than by increases in the retail prices that consumers have to pay.</P>
      <P>Since this proposal was made by the commission, the gas companies have submitted with their price applications details of the steps taken to improve their efficiency and to rationalise their dealer networks.  The commission are satisfied at the progress being made in this matter.</P>

In reply to the Deputy's first Supplementary, up to the time of publication in May, 1977 work was proceeding in the Department simultaneously on two Bills, the Consumer Information Bill and the Consumer Protection Bill.  As the Deputy's colleague, my predecessor, is aware the Consumer Protection Bill was brought in rather hurriedly and published rather hurriedly during the term of the previous Government.  It has been found since that there are some problems arising out of the Bill and that certain sections of it must be redrafted.

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not quite correct to say that the company to which the Deputy refers compel their policyholders to utilise garages owned or associated with them, although their requirements may be said to induce them to do so in certain circumstances.  Before granting or renewing cover on vehicles over five years old, the company require checks to be carried out as to their roadworthiness. These checks can be done by a garage owned or associated with the insurance company, by a member of the Institute of Automotive Engineer Assessors or in certain circumstances by an accredited main dealer.  I think a periodic roadworthiness test of older vehicles is desirable, and I believe the practice of this company is much cheaper for the majority of their clients than would be the practice of most insurance companies which require no test but automatically impose an age-of-vehicle loading.  While I would welcome a change to provide that the test might be carried out in any garage, I recognise that this could create serious practical difficulties for the company, and I do not consider their practice unfair or unreasonable.</P>
      <P>The company do not insist that, in the case of a claim for damages, assessment of the damage or repair must take place in their own or associated garages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Question Nos. 34, 35 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>A total of seven Dutch trawlers were boarded in the Celtic Sea since the introduction of the ban on herring fishing.  There was no evidence of herring on board the first six of these trawlers and the question of prosecutions did not, therefore, arise.  In the case of the seventh vessel proceedings were instituted and a conviction was obtained on the grounds of obstruction. In the case of vessels arrested for any reason, their nets have, in the past, been checked as a matter of routine by fishery inspectors when the vessels reach port.  This was done in the case of 11 Dutch, 12 Spanish and two French vessels.  In only two cases (one Spanish and one French) were the nets found to be undersized in accordance with the Fishing Nets (Regulation of Mesh) Order 1976 (S.I. 210 of 1976).  Prosecutions were taken in these two cases and convictions secured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it had not been the practice in the past to board vessels at sea to inspect the mesh size of their nets, six mesh gauges were ordered for this purpose earlier this year and all have now been issued to naval vessels engaged on fishery protection duties. The naval vessels have been instructed to measure mesh sizes, where possible, and in fact the nets of the Dutch vessel arrested on 30th November, <Col N="1136" /> 1977 were checked at sea by the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>Since 1st January, 1977, 23 vessels of other EEC States, nine Spanish vessels and one Russian vessel have been boarded and their catch checked. The Russian vessel was en route to fishing grounds off North Africa. These figures do not include any arrests actually made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Irish fishermen are convinced that the Dutch are fishing for herring under the pretext of fishing for mackerel in the Celtic Sea despite the herring ban? Has the Minister had representation along these lines from the Irish fishing industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I met members of the Irish Fishermen's Organisation who mentioned that they felt that the ban was being broken extensively.  I checked the matter out with the naval authorities and they indicated that they are satisfied that, as far as they can ascertain such was not the case.  We cannot be 100 per cent certain, but I am satisfied that with the resources available to them the naval authorities are doing their best to maintain the ban and that they have been very diligent and indeed successful in performing their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to question No. 35 did the Minister say that only the meshes of ships or trawlers which were arrested were checked?  Surely it is our duty to check every vessel fishing within our 200-mile limit.  It has been proved in recent court cases that a number of boats, particularly French and Spanish boats, are catching large quantities of undersized fish with illegal nets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

The average number of girls under 21 in custody at any time is about ten though, of course, it is possible that the number would be greater if there was a separate unit to which younger female offenders could be committed. The plans for the proposed new women's prison, however, provide for the segregation in separate units of juvenile and adult female prisoners.</P>

The work in question here, namely, the preparation of carrots for preservation by bottling, was in this category but, for reasons outside the control of the prison administration, it has in fact been discontinued.  It is, of course, work of a level which many persons who have never been in conflict with the law are normally engaged in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The main problem in relation to recreational facilities in Limerick Prison is that the grounds of the prison are not extensive enough to enable a desirable range of outdoor activities to be catered for and adequate workshop, work training and educational facilities to be provided. As short term measures, some office accommodation has been redesigned to provide an educational unit and a prefabricated workshop is being built. I hope that plans for more extensive improvements can be implemented over the next few years.  An extensive range of additional indoor recreational facilities has been provided since the committee commented on those facilities.</P>
      <P>The lack of ventilation referred to was dealt with.</P>
      <P>All prisoners committed to Limerick Prison as to any other prison have their cases reviewed regularly by a committee comprising members of the staff of the prison, a welfare officer, teachers and a representative of my Department's headquarters.  Daily conditional release to work or full temporary release are recommended by the committee in appropriate cases. This committee also considers the cases of young prisoners and first offenders and makes recommendations for the transfer of suitable prisoners to other centres providing educational or work/training programmes suitable to their needs.</P>

      <P>Among matters which it is felt still need to be resolved are:</P>
      <P>(1)  Lack of educational facilities in the long vacation (which it is understood is presently being examined by the Co-ordinator of Education).</P>
      <P>(2) Absence of &ldquo;follow-up&rdquo; on boys leaving Shanganagh at the conclusion of their sentence (it is understood that the Constitution of the State prevents this being done, and when a new Constitution is being drawn up it is hoped that the Legislators will bear this in mind).</P>
      <P>(3) The appointment of members of Visiting Committees as at present carried out results in an absence of such Committees for a period of approximately three months each year.</P>
      <P>The first matter raised is still under discussion with the various interests involved in providing education and a complete new structure is being negotiated at present, which <i>inter alia</i>, will, it is hoped, allow for an eleven-month educational programme.</P>

Under subhead L.1 there is provision for an additional sum of £2.015 million to RTE.  This occasion does not allow a comprehensive discussion on the broad and very often controversial field of broadcasting.  In the short time at my disposal I should like to make a few brief comments.</P>
      <P>Last Tuesday I tabled a parliamentary question which was answered by the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to the five-year plan of RTE. The Parliamentary Secretary said he did not regard it as a plan; it was merely a set of projections whose implementation would depend on the capital programme.  I made the point that there is a vast difference between a set of projections and a development programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If RTE are to develop, if the proposed second channel is to develop along the proper lines, if we are to have the much sought-after extension of regional broadcasting and community radio and even the proper development of Radio na Gaeltachta, it is essential that RTE be able to operate under a broad outline development plan.  For that reason it is essential that the Minister would give an indication as soon as possible of his thinking in relation to the areas I have mentioned and state what plans are envisaged and <Col N="1149" /> the financial provisions he proposes to make.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear at a later stage the Minister's reaction to what I regard as an outline plan by RTE.  If broad-casting is to develop logically there must be long-term and realistic planning.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an teanga Ghaeilge&mdash;agus tá a fhios agam go bhfuil suim mhór ag an Aire i ngluaiseacht na teangan&mdash; tá tábhacht faoi leith ag baint le radio agus telefís in a thaobh seo.  Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh do dhá phointe sa díospóireacht seo: ceann amháin, an tábhacht faoi leith a bhaineann le radio agus telefís ó thaobh na teanga de, 'sé sin, go bhfuil géar-ghá le h-aithbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar na cláracha a bheadh oiriúnach don suim atá anois i measc muintir na hÉireann chun an teanga a chur chun cinn.  Tá ard-mholadh tuillte ag Liam Ó Murchú as ucht an chláir bhreá sin &ldquo;Trom agus Eadrom&rdquo;, agus ba mhaith liom a rá maidir leis an chlár sin &ldquo;Féach&rdquo;, nílim sásta go bhfuil sé ag forbairt ar an slí a bheadh oiriúnach chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Tá scóip mhór ann chun leathnú a dhéanamh ar Radio na Gaeltachta agus chun an stáisiún a chur ar fáil sna ceantair nach féidir leis na daoine na cláracha a fháil ó Radio na Gaeltachta.  Iarraim ar an Aire breithniú a dhéanamh ar an chás maidir le iarthar Mhaigh Eó.</P>
    <P>I see, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that the translation facilities are not available, and I noticed particularly on a number of occasions when I have made contributions here in Irish since I came into the Opposition side, there seems to be no one in the simultaneous translation box.</P>

I understand it will be a matter of urgency to bring in amending legislation to enable RTE to increase their borrowing.  This will be only a routine type of situation, but I would hope that the Bill the Minister will bring in will give the House the opportunity of a full-scale debate covering the whole field of broadcasting.  I have no objection to giving the Minister the Supplementary Estimate he seeks.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta O'Donnell as ucht an méid a bhí le rá aige ar an meastachán seo.  Cé gur meastachán forlíontach é, ag an am chéanna tá sé tábhachtach mar tá airgead á chur ar fáil do ghnótha éagsúla atá tábhachtach sa mhéid go gcuirfidh siad obair ar fáil.  Tá sé tábhachtach ar dhóigheanna eile fosta.</P>
      <P>Labhair an Teachta O'Donnell faoin chaipitil don chóras teileafóin agus, mar a dúirt sé, bhí Bille os comhair na Dála ina thaobh sin, agus sílim go bhfuil sé soiléir go leor ón méid a bhí le rá agam ar an mBille sin go bhfuilimid go mór i bhfábhar forbairt an chórais theileafóin.  Tá sé iontach tábhachtach ní amháin ó thaobh obair a chur ar fáil go díreach ach, chomh maith le sin, le hobair a chur ar fáil go hindíreach fosta.</P>
      <P>I know there is no need for me to repeat what I said in Irish.  In relation to the points made by Deputy O'Donnell regarding capital for telephone development, I know he is aware of the fact that we have had a Bill before the House in relation to the provision of capital.  I assure him we are particularly anxious to proceed as rapidly as possible with telephone development.  It is vitally important that we should for two reasons, first of all, that not only do we provide jobs directly through development of the telephone service but we also provide them indirectly, in the sense that a good telephone and telecommunications system is vital to industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1151" /> The number of applications before the Department for telephones is exceptionally high.  We would hope to clear a very considerable number of them within the next year but, as Deputy O'Donnell has already pointed out, as we clear them, more and more applications come to hand.  It is a good sign to see the high level of applications. It would be a good sign in the future also to find the level increasing because it would denote economic recovery. On the other hand, applications alone are not sufficient; we have got to supply the demand, and this is what we are endeavouring to do.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the suggested transfer of the customs examination of parcels from Limerick and pointed out that he had been in touch with the Department in that regard.  I might add also that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy was also in touch with the Department on the matter.  As I am sure the Deputy is aware, the problem related to having premises which were suitable and, more important still, accepted as suitable by the staff who have to work in them.  I understand they are satisfied with the level of refurnishing of the temporary premises.  It is hoped that this will permit the customs work to be moved there in time to meet the imminent Christmas pressure.</P>
    <P>With regard to RTE and the set of projects presented, these were submitted before I assumed office.  The position in relation to them is as stated in the reply to the question the Deputy raised on 6th December.</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh na Gaeilge dhe tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an-dúil ag an Teachta sa teangain faoi mar atá agam féin agus ba mhaith liom pé cuidiú a thig liom a thabhairt ó thaobh forbairt na Gaeilge agus aontaím leis go bhfuil an-tábhacht ag baint leis an gcóras teilifíse chun cuidiú a thabhairt do fhorbairt na teangan.  Ní raibh mé féin sásta leis an athrú a rinneadh ó thaobh am na nuachta agus gídh nach bhfuil de cheart agam iachall a chur ar Theilifís Éireann clár ar leith a chur ar fáil, ag an am chéanna chuir mé in iúl dóibh nach raibh mé sásta leis <Col N="1152" /> an athrú agus beidh mé ag cur ceist orthu anois le fáil amach goidé mar atá an nuacht ó shin ó thaobh TAM rating mar adéarfá go bhfeicimíd goidé an dóigh inar athruigh sé.  Ach shíl mé féin gur ceann de na rudaí is tabhachtaí a bhí i gceist an dóigh ina raibh an nuacht i nGaeilge roimhe seo.  Uimhir a haon, bhí sé lua go leor do dhaoine óga a bheith ag amhare air, agus uimhir a dó, bhí &ldquo;News for the Deaf&rdquo; ag teacht díreach ina dhiaidh.  Ar an ábhar sin na daoine nár thuig i gceart an méid a bhí ar fáil as Gaeilge bhí siad ábalta é a thuigbheáil as Béarla ina dhiaidh, agus sílim gur chuidigh sé sin b'fhéidir le feabhas a chur ar Ghaeilge daoine nach raibh an Ghaeilge chomh maith acu agus ar mhaith leo a bheith.  Aontaím leis fosta go bhfuil an clár &ldquo;Trom and Eadrom&rdquo; íontach maith sa dóigh go bhfuil furmhór mór muintir na hÉireann ábalta é a thuigbheáil.  Tá sé dhátheangach agus tá sé curtha ar fáil sa dóigh go dtuigeann furmhór mór na ndaoine achan rud atá ar siúl ar an chlár.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir, ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh fosta don méid adúirt an Teachta faoi dtaobh de Radio na Gaeltachta.  Sílim go ndearna Radio na Gaeltachta obair fiúntach don Ghaeltacht.  Thug sé seans do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ní hé amháin an nuacht ach ábhair eile a chlos ina dteanga dhúchais.  Mhothaigh mé féin nuair a bhí mé sa Ghaeltacht sna blianta atá imithe thart gur chuidigh sé go mór leo go raibh cláracha ina dteanga féin ar fáil acu.  Sílim do réir mar chonaic mé gur cuireadh an-suim ar fad ins an nuacht áitiúil ar an radio agus fuair mé amach go gcuireann siad suim ar leith i nuacht áitiúil.  Smaoineoidh mé ar an méid adúirt an Teachta faoi dtaobh de Iarthar Mhaigh Eo go bhfeicfidh mé cad is féidir liom a dhéanamh sa chás sin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £4,250,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year <Col N="1153" /> ending on the 31st day of December, 1977, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Tourism and Transport, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate results from excesses of £5,118,000 on five subheads offset to some degree by a total saving of £868,000 on other subheads.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate provides £388,000 for certain improvements in the wages, salaries and allowances payable to the staff of approximately 1,200 employed in my Department. It includes the cost of implementing in the current year the first and second phases of the National Agreement, 1977 which is payable to all staff.  Certain of the Departmental grades in the aviation sector will receive increases due under the first of three phases in the implementation of the salary recommendations of the Aviation Grades commission of inquiry. Provision is also made for the increases in the social welfare employers' contribution and the final steps in the implementation of equal pay.</P>
    <P>This sum would otherwise have been provided from the Vote for remuneration.</P>
    <P>The subvention provided for C.I.E. in the 1977 Estimates was £30 million and it is now estimated that this provision will be inadequate to the extent of £3.8 million to meet CIE's deficit on subventible activities in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>The main reason for the inadequacy of the subvention provision of £30 million is the National Wage Agreement for which provision was not made in the Board's last application for an increase in fares and rates and which will cost C.I.E. an additional £3.5 million in 1977.  The balance of the additional subvention arises mainly because of a reduction in anticipated revenue from rail freight traffic.</P>
    <P>The provision of £3.8 million in the Supplementary Estimate will bring CIE's total subvention for 1977 to £33.8 million, an increase of £1.9 million <Col N="1154" /> on the subvention of £31.9 million provided in 1976.  The sum of £33.8 million includes approximately £27.4 million for railway operations, £5.3 million for Dublin city bus services and £600,000 for provincial bus services; the balance is for the canals and the Galway/Aran ferry services.  No subvention is provided for the board's road freight services which must be operated on a commercial basis.</P>
    <P>The original provision in the Estimates for harbour grants was £719,000 and the additional £626,000 now sought is required for the Cork harbour development plan.  The plan consists of the deepening and widening of the navigation channel at the harbour entrance, the deepening of the channel at the Spit Bar and the provision of a new harbour with deepwater facilities at Ringaskiddy.</P>
    <P>The dredging of the navigation channel will ease present restrictions on the movement of vessels at the harbour entrance and will provide access for large vessels to the proposed new harbour at Ringaskiddy to Nitrigin Éireann Teoranta at Marino Point and for large tankers at Whitegate refinery.</P>
    <P>The harbour works should be completed in 1980 at a cost currently estimated at £16.5 million.  The carrying out of work on the Plan has created 98 additional jobs of limited duration in the current year.</P>
    <P>When the last Estimates were being drawn up in late 1976, the outcome of the talks on the 1977 National Wage Agreement was not known and consequently it was decided not to include provision in the Transport and Power Vote&mdash;as it was then&mdash;in respect of the Agreement.  The cost of meeting the standard increase under the agreement for 1977 for the Bord Fáilte head office staff and staff of the Regional Tourism Organisations will be £54,000 and it is now necessary to make appropriate provision for this.</P>
    <P>I am availing of this opportunity to get Dáil approval for an additional capital allocation of £250,000 for Bord Fáilte in discharge of a commitment given after the original estimate had been finalised.  This money is being used for development projects spread <Col N="1155" /> throughout the country and with a high labour content.  At present the board have work on hands on a number of projects in different centres throughout the country giving employment of limited duration to 180 people.</P>
    <P>The total amount of the increased expenditure is £5,118,000 but there is an offset of £868,000 in savings on other subheads.  Accordingly the net amount required is £4,250,000.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my first opportunity formally to speak on the Department of Tourism and Transport and I therefore use it to wish the Minister health, success and happiness during his term of office.  On behalf of the party for which I am spokesman I can assure him of our co-operation and help at all times.</P>
      <P>The forecast earlier in the year for our takings from overseas tourists in 1977 was £219 million, and it was forecast that £70 million would be realised from home holidaymakers.  I believe that not only will these targets be achieved as forecast by Bord Fáilte but that the sums will be greater.  I hope the Minister will provide the necessary finance to maintain that situation.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister is aware of the situation in this industry on the possibility of new jobs being created.  Tourism here is still in its infancy and there is tremendous scope for development.  Yet we cannot be happy with the position that obtains. Every country in the world is competing actively against us and we there-fore must be generous in our promotion efforts.  There is a number of disquieting features about the figures published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, there has been a serious fall-off in tourist numbers from Britain since 1971-72.  Part of this can be attributed to the situation in the North of Ireland.  In 1973 we had 843,000 tourists from Britain and by 1976 that had dropped to 785,000.  We all know there is a tremendous amount of goodwill among the people of <Col N="1156" /> Britain for the type of holiday we can provide&mdash;there is affinity between us in regard to food, drink and our general way of life.  As well, there are many Irish families living in Britain who are delighted to come back for holidays.  I fear that Bord Fáilte are not giving sufficient attention to Irish people living in Britain and the potential there as far as tourism is concerned.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte are dissatisfied with our all the year round figures for bed occupancy.  In 1975 there was only 37 per cent bed occupancy in a 12-month period.  It is important that this be improved and, indeed, reversed. Bord Fáilte also tell us that there has been a drop-off in the use of hotels, guesthouses, country homes and so on. During 1976, 19 guesthouses went out of business and there was a drop of 137 bed occupancies.  There was a drop of 46 per cent in the figures for accommodation offered by way of town homes and a drop of 270 bedroom occupancies in hotels.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the overall situation means that hotel and guesthouse owners have not been able to reinvest, and I urge the Minister to add such owners to the list of householders who do not pay rates.  I make this request sincerely because of the serious situation in which they are in regard to bed occupancy, and I can assure the Minister of the goodwill of all Deputies on this side in this regard.  Hotels and guesthouses must be given an opportunity to reinvest.</P>
    <P>I hope we will have an opportunity to have a fuller debate on tourism at a later stage.  Today we are running through the Estimates, and that is not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Irish holidays are different.  They are unique because of our way of life, our traditions and our culture. I would ask the Minister to prepare a properly planned approach to tourist development in the future.  Here, I would quote one small item from an article in the <i>Irish Banking Review</i> of September, 1977. It is at page 17.</P>
    <P>...it is claimed that in France tourism has given rise to more new <Col N="1157" /> urban development than industry has done.</P>
    <P>Here, there is tremendous tourism development.  This is an industry that can affect the culture of a particular area as a result of particular groups coming in to visit the area.  We must ensure that the way of life of the inhabitants in that area is not affected. We must not kill the goose that lays the golden egg.  Over a period we must extract the eggs at regular intervals but we must always ensure that these areas do not become Blackpools or anything else.  We want to ensure the maximum benefit from tourism development.  The graph has been rising and will, I hope, continue to rise.</P>
    <P>Recently I tabled a question in regard to canal development.  Subsequently I raised the same question on the adjournment.  Inland waterway cruising is developing rapidly.  There have been tremendous improvements in cruising on the Shannon.  In 1976 13,000 people used the Shannon.  It is estimated the figure will be 18,500 in 1979.  Portion of the Ballyconnell canal between Northern Ireland and the South is no longer navigable.  I would hope this canal would be developed to permit freedom of passage from the North to the South.  This canal was opened way back in 1860.  It has great potential.  I would ask the Taoiseach and the Minister and the Government to do everything possible to develop this canal.  It has an enormous potential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a few points in connection with the Minister's brief.  This Supplementary Estimate covers a vast field&mdash;tourism, transport, harbour development, road and rail transport, and so on.  The Minister referred to an increased subvention to CIE of £3.5 million which will bring the total State subvention to the enormously high figure of £33.5 million.  He said:</P>
      <P>The balance of the additional subvention arises mainly because of a reduction in anticipated revenue from rail freight traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That represents an alarming and most undesirable trend.  It has serious implications <Col N="1158" /> in relation to road transport and to our road network.  I am disappointed to learn there will be a reduction in the anticipated revenue from rail freight traffic.  I am not attempting to apportion blame or anything like that but there are very serious implications here.  This is an area at which CIE will have to look much more vigorously. If rail freight traffic is on the decline it is obvious there must be a corresponding increase in the volume of heavy traffic on the roads.  I had the privilege of being spokesman on transport and I visited all six EEC countries to see how the railways there operated and how the roads were used.  Top priority on the part of the railway companies and governments in Western Europe was maximum diver sion of freight traffic from the roads to the rail.  I cannot understand what is happening here.  I know the advantage of door-to-door transport and the growth in owner-owned vehicles and so on but I would like the Minister to urge on CIE the possibility of concentrating attention on modernising and streamlining their rail section with a view to attracting the maximum amount of freight off the roads to the rail.</P>
    <P>My second point arises in regard to the subvention for the Galway-Aran service.  Bhí poinnte ag an Aire nuair a bhí sé ina Rúnaí Parlaiminte don Ghaeltacht faoin gcóras taistil idir Gaillimh agus Oileáin Árainn.  Bhí poinnte agamsa ar feadh ceithre bliana ar an rud céanna.  Bhí fonn mór ormsa cursaí cumarsáide agus iompair idir na hoileáin agus an mórthír a fheabhsú.  Cé go bhfuil cabhair le fáil ó Roinn na Gaeltachta maidir leis an bád i gcomhair Oileán Cléire&mdash;agus tá seirbhísí ann anois i gcuid dena hoileáin&mdash;mar sin féin ó thaobh prionsiobail de, 'sé mo thuairim, agus tá mé cinnte go n-aontóidh an tAire liom, go bhfuil na háiseanna céanna tuillte ag muintir na noileán is atá ag muintir an mhórthír.  Cuir i gcas, tá £35,000,000 á thabhairt ag an Stát do CIE agus níl ach beagáinín den suim sin á thabhairt chun córas taistil ceart a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na noileán, sé sin, ó Ghaillimh go dtí Oileáin Árainn.  Os rud é go bhfuil suim i leiith ag an Aire ins an rud seo, tá sé in am anois go <Col N="1159" /> bhféachfadh sé isteach inti agus go ndéanfadh sé scrúdú.  Sílim go bhfuil CIE freagarthach cabhrú leis an Aire chun cúrsaí taistil idir an mórthír agus gach oileán, na hoileáin Ghaeltachta agus na hoileáin Ghalltachta, a fheabhsú agus córas a bheidh oiriúnach don lá atá inniú ann a thabhairt dóibh.  An sean-bhád sin atá mar chóras idir Gaillimh agus na hoileáin níl sé féiliúnach mar tá tionscail agus monarcha á dtógáil in Oileáin Árainn chun forbairt turasóireachta agus tá súil agam go mbeidh bád farantóireachta&mdash;a roll-on roll-off service to replace the present rather antiquated service.</P>
    <P>There is a subvention here for harbours.  Harbour development is a vitally important area.  I hope the Minister will tackle at some stage the question of formulating and implementing a national ports policy.  The additional subvention is in respect of development in Cork Harbour.  I do not want to be parochial, but the time has come when we must take a global look at the question of harbour development and the implementation of a ports policy.  Over the years, irrespective of what Government were in power, there were proposals and discussions and hopes were raised that something would be done to exploit the greatest under-developed national asset in the country&mdash;the Shannon estuary.  A Bill was ready to be put before the House earlier this year to set up a Shannon estuary authority.  Some weeks ago I asked the Minister in the Dáil whether he proposes to proceed with this legislation and he said that he had not examined it.  I urge on the Minister the importance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> I note that the Minister is now asking the House to provide extra finance for public transport.  In County Dublin public transport has not kept pace with development and I do not know if the Minister realises this.  In the area stretching south and west from the city there are vast new developments and housing estates and the traffic situation in these areas is absolutely chaotic.  I believe that CIE could do a lot more to relieve this terrible congestion in the mornings and evenings.  Many people are now using their cars who formerly used public transport.  They find that they can reach the city just as easily in their own cars.  This is a pity and causes many parking problems in the city.  People would be more ready to use public transport if CIE were prepared to give the service.  It is not unusual for would-be travellers to be left on the roads and to have to walk half the journey home before getting public transport.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that CIE are doing enough to relieve congestion.  I would ask the Minister to urge the powers that be in CIE to have a look at this whole area.  I know they have their difficulties.  When I was in touch with them quite recently they were experiencing extreme difficulty in crossing two bridges on the south side, at Harold's Cross and Templeogue.  Despite that, they have not changed the routes.  Another bridge has been opened across the Dodder and they have not availed of it.</P>
    <P>The linking of the southern and western roads right across to Dún Laoghaire has caused tremendous annoyance to people living along that route.  Not only has there been an increase in traffic but the roll-on roll-off traffic which formerly came through the North Wall is now crossing through Walkinstown and Churchtown and on through Dún Laoghaire.  I do not know if this traffic can be diverted through the North Wall but perhaps the Minister would consider this.</P>
    <P>Many prospective foreign visitors to this country were afraid to come because of the troubles in the North. This was brought home to us yesterday but I believe that this is no longer a problem for the would-be tourist.  A <Col N="1161" /> new fear relates to the escalation of armed robbery south of the Border.  I would hope that the Minister would be vocal at the Cabinet table in urging his colleagues who have direct responsibility in this field to take more effective action with regard to these armed robberies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can mention them in passing as they affect the tourist trade but I would suggest that he should not continue along that line.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am mentioning this matter in connection with the tourist figures.  I believe that many prospective visitors are looking at what is happening south of the Border and the Government must be seen to take adequate steps to control the situation.  The tremendous escalation in recent times is worrying to people here and to those who would consider visiting the country.  This is a pity. Those interested in tourism are quite happy with the progress made during the past two years.  Tourism is again on the upward trend and it is returning to the position prior to 1969.  It is a pity that it should be affected in the way I have outlined.  I would urge the Minister to be vocal at Cabinet level and I hope that he is not happy with the steps taken so far to alleviate the fears of prospective visitors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Enright for his good wishes. They are appreciated.  In turn, I congratulate him on his appointment as spokesman on tourism for his party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies probably know, especially from the audio-visual presentation by Bord Fáilte to Members of the Oireachtas yesterday, tourism is now showing signs of positive growth after some years in the doldrums.  This will be a satisfying year and our targets will be met and possibly exceeded in many areas.  We can expect that further growth will be achieved through more intensive marketing programmes by Bord Fáilte and greater efforts by all of the constituent elements in the industry with the Government providing the necessary support <Col N="1162" /> and backing.  We recognise the importance of the tourist industry.  It provides very considerable employment. It has been said here, and is recognised by me, that there is scope for very considerable development. Competition has become keener. Vigorous action is required by the various bodies and organisations involved to ensure that we get the benefit from the increased numbers of tourists.</P>
    <P>I feel that in the coming year we should see a further improvement.  I regret, the same as Deputy Enright, that there was a fall off in tourists from Britain starting around 1971 or 1972.  This was due to a number of factors, the economic recession in Britain, the troubles in Northern Ireland and inflation.  I emphasise that Britain remains our most important single market.  I might add that it is given a high priority by Bord Fáilte in their marketing efforts.  Special attention is paid, as the Deputy suggested, to those with Irish connections.  We have got to concentrate also on those who have not got any ties with the country if we are to develop the industry as it might be developed while at the same time continuing to give particular attention to the ethnic group.</P>
    <P>In 1978 I am confident we will see a substantial increase in the number of tourists coming from Britain.  I found it an encouraging sign that for the first time this year people who had not got Irish connections came in much greater numbers than they had been.  They are the best propagandists we have.  When they go home they can point out to their neighbours who were fearful of coming here that they had no need to be fearful.  This giving of knowledge through word of mouth is possibly the best type of publicity we can have.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright said that the bed occupancy over the whole period was 37 per cent.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that because of the nature of tourism it is difficult to get a high bed occupancy over the full year.  Bord Fáilte are making every effort to stimulate traffic outside the peak period through festivals, conferences, sporting events and so forth.  This was <Col N="1163" /> clearly identified yesterday in their presentation.  They are doing everything possible to extend the season. The employment premium scheme has been extended to tourism, which will be a help.  There are grant schemes for renewals and improvements in hotels to help them keep up standards.</P>

      <P>That is not a matter for which I have direct responsibility. Deputy O'Donnell spoke about CIE. I am sure he will accept that most of the losses there resulted from increases in salaries and wages.  He referred to the loss in freight.  As far as I can ascertain the freight traffic was affected in 1977 by the slow recovery in the economy and by the transfer of traffic to competitors.  We will have to look at the competitive aspect of this. The rail freight system has been and will continue to be modernised.  Every effort is being made by CIE to modernise it to the extent that it will become more economic.  I have just returned from a meeting of European Ministers of Transport.  I can tell Deputies that the financial situation of railways in all of the European countries involved is a major concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £6,703,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1977, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies, grants and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is needed in order to provide additional funds for certain of the services operated by my Department and organisations for which I have responsibility and to effect adjustments in the provisions made for certain others of these services.  The additional requirements include expenditure under a subhead which is now within the ambit of the Vote because of the recent transfer of the energy function to my Department from the former Department of Transport and Power.  The need for these additional funds could not have been foreseen when the Estimates were prepared originally.</P>
      <P>The additional £100,000 sought under subhead BI is due principally to an increase in travelling by the Department's inspectors on price control duties and on other inspections arising from the administration of subsidies on bread and flour.  It reflects also the effect of increased subsistence and mileage allowances.</P>
      <P>The additional grant of £84,000 which I am proposing for the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards is required to meet the extra cost of implementing the terms of the 1977 National Pay Agreement for the staff of the Institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1165" /> This year's Estimate provided £4.3 million towards the Grant-in-Aid for Córas Tráchtála, who now require an additional £54,000.</P>
    <P>This amount is needed almost entirely to meet part of the cost, £45,000, of implementing the 1977 National Wage Agreement and which had not been provided for in the original allocation for this body.  The balance is needed to meet the cost of certain short-term borrowing requirements.</P>
    <P>The estimate for the current financial year provided £322,000 towards the Grant-in-Aid for the Kilkenny Design Workshops Limited.  An additional amount of £20,500 is required by the company to meet their needs in the financial year.</P>
    <P>This additional amount is needed to cover the cost of implementing the 1977 National Wage Agreement and some minor adjustments in certain other costs.  These are administration costs in relation to increased rates of social welfare contributions and costs related to the arrangements for the completion of the renovation of the company's property known as Butler House, which was acquired in 1972.</P>
    <P>The original allocation to the Industrial Development Authority for administration and general expenses was £5,700,000.  An additional £30,000 is required to meet part of salary increases as a result of the 1977 National Pay Agreement.</P>
    <P>The original allocation for the capital grant-in-aid was £55,000,000. An extra £4 million was allocated in the January budget to assist job creation.  This money is being spent on additional land acquisition and factory construction by the authority.</P>
    <P>I propose to include a new provision of £220,000 for expenditure under the Vacant Rents subsidy.  This is a technical adjustment necessitated by the decision to transfer to the Industrial Development Authority the responsibility held formerly by the National Building Agency for the provision and financing of industrial housing for new industry.  It covers the amount of vacancy rents payable by the IDA to the NBA in respect of houses built by the NBA at the request <Col N="1166" /> of the IDA but which remained unsold for a period.  As will be seen from the Supplementary Estimate there was a compensatory saving under another subhead of the Authority's expenditure, that was subhead I.3.</P>
    <P>A supplementary grant-in-aid of £50,000 is necessary to finance essential activities of the Irish Productivity Centre until the end of the year 1977. The original allocation of £300,000 is inadequate due to cost increases and a shortfall in expected revenue from fees.</P>
    <P>The amounts allocated already for the bread and household flour subsidies for the current year are £13,850,000 and £2,150,000 respectively, an aggregate of £16,000,000. While the aggregate cost of these subsidies remains unchanged at £16,000,000, there is likely to be an excess of £100,000 on the bread subhead offset by a saving of £100,000 on the flour subhead.  The indications are that there has been a slight variation in the pattern of utilisation of the two commodities with a move away from the home baking&mdash;in which subsidised flour is used&mdash;to subsidised bakers' bread.</P>
    <P>It has been arranged with a number of the consortia concerned that under the terms of their exclusive offshore petroleum exploration licences, they will contribute a total of £1.7 million during a five-year period to provide education, training and other facilities in the areas of petroleum and other natural resources.  My Department, with the assistance of the National Science Council and its successor body, the National Board for Science and Technology, will administer suitable programmes which, in addition to education and training courses at home and abroad, will include studies, consultancy and technical assistance projects.</P>
    <P>The objective is to build up in the private sector a body of native expertise with a view to grasping the many opportunities arising from off-shore developments.  It is intended also to provide the Government Departments and agencies concerned with these developments with the necessary competence and expertise to perform effectively.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1167" /> The State and oil companies have a degree of common interest in this matter.  The offshore operators are required to use Irish bases, goods and services and to employ Irish personnel where suitable and available.  They recognise that, if commercial discoveries are made, this raises very substantially the demand for Irish personnel and services and it is in their interest that suitably qualified and trained people be available here.  It is important also, from their point of view, that the Irish Government agencies concerned with offshore operations should have adequate facilities, including appropriately qualified staff, to administer the many aspects of offshore activities.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to proceed initially by way of a two-year programme, at the end of which I shall review the position in the light of experience gained and of the position in the petroleum industry at that stage.</P>
    <P>In the present financial year only a provision of £50,000 will be needed to cover anticipated expenditure.  the appropriations-in-aid show receipts this year under this arrangement.</P>
    <P>The original provision in the Estimates for 1977 in respect of town gas subsidy&mdash;£1.8 million&mdash;was made in the Vote for Transport and Power.  As I mentioned earlier, energy is now a function assigned to my Department and the extra money needed is, there-fore, included as a subhead in this Department's Vote.</P>
    <P>This subsidy was first introduced with effect from 1st July, 1975 and is at the rate of 12½ per cent of the cost of town gas at that date.  It has been continued on this basis since then despite further increases in the price of town gas.</P>
    <P>The National Prices Commission, in May, 1977, recommended two increases in the price of town gas in Dublin, the combined effect of which would have been to increase the price of gas by about 37 per cent to Dublin consumers. To ease the family budget and to maintain fully the Dublin town gas system pending the possible availability of cheap natural gas the then <Col N="1168" /> Government decided to pay an additional subsidy to the Dublin Gas Company with effect from 25th May, 1977 to offset the increases in prices recommended by the National Prices Commission. It was decided subsequently in August, 1977, to extend the subsidy at the rate payable in Dublin to provincial town gas undertakings with effect also from 25th May, 1977.</P>
    <P>The extra cost of the additional subsidy in 1977 is estimated at £3 million and this supplementary provision is to meet this expenditure.</P>
    <P>The main reason for the steep increase in recent years in the cost of production town gas is the huge increase in the price of naphtha which is used by most of the gas undertakings for gas manufacture.  This raises the question of the feasibility of using an alternative fuel which would reduce the cost of gas production and possibly eliminate the need for subsidy.  The only other fuel which offers prospects of long-term production at a reasonable cost seems to be natural gas.</P>
    <P>So far as the provision of natural gas for Dublin is concerned, the only economically-exploitable deposit of natural gas discovered so far in Irish waters is the Kinsale Head find.  As Deputies are aware the allocation of this find was decided by the then Government in 1974.  The allocations made were&mdash;40 per cent for the production of ammonia and urea for the fertiliser industry in a new plant to be built by Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta and 60 per cent to the ESB for use in a new power station at Aghada, and in an extension to the existing station at Marina, Cork.  Subsequently it was agreed with the ESB that a small quantity of their allocation would be made available to the Cork Gas Company to meet their requirements.</P>
    <P>The question of allocating a supply of Kinsale Head gas for distribution in Dublin has been raised by the Dublin Gas Company.  I referred this matter to an inter-departmental committee to be examined in the context of the decision already mentioned to use a large part of the Kinsale Head gas for electricity generation.  The committee have concluded their examination <Col N="1169" /> of the matter and their report will be available to me very shortly.</P>
    <P>The total amount of the increased expenditure is £7,708,500 but there is an offset of £695,500 in savings mainly made up of £250,000 on subhead D&mdash; Geological Survey&mdash;as a result of the deferment of a proposed aeromagnetic survey of the country; £245,000 on subhead 1.3&mdash;Industrial Development Authority&mdash;Grants for Industrial Housing; £100,000 on subhead S.2&mdash;Flour and Wheatenmeal Subsidy and a surplus of £310,000 in Appropriations-in-Aid chiefly in respect of payments made by holders of exclusive offshore petroleum licences to which I have referred earlier.</P>
    <P>I have explained in the case of each subhead the reason for the increased expenditure but if Deputies consider it necessary or desirable I shall deal with any points that may be raised in relation to them.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not know that a proposed aeromagnetic survey of the country had been deferred.  I am pretty ignorant of the technical aspects of such matters but I presume that this survey would be a mineralogical one intended to assess possible areas of workable deposits.  Can the Minister give a reason why this survey has been deferred and will he say a few words about the relevant importance which his Department attribute to it?  Since it has been deferred will the Minister say when it is proposed to get on with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's estimate includes an increased grant-in-aid for Córas Tráchtála.  Further to things I said about Córas Tráchtála during the Export Promotions Bill debate about two months ago when both the Minister and myself adverted to the very unfavourable trade balances in our trade relations with eastern Europe, about which Córas Tráchtála were complaining, more up to date figures have become available and the picture is now emerging for the whole year.  Córas Tráchtála are fully justified in regarding them as disappointing.  In modification of what I said previously, although the gap in the trade balance with the <Col N="1170" /> Soviet Union is still about the same size as it was last year, namely, £12 million or thereabouts, the increase in Irish exports to the Soviet Union is very marked.</P>
    <P>Having been so severe on the subject six weeks ago I feel I ought to mention this.  It would not be unfair to attribute that increase substantially to the visit of the last Minister for Foreign Affairs to Moscow last year and to the agreement which he signed there.  The Soviet Union falls in for most of the criticism in this regard but the most recent figures show that our adverse trade balance with Poland is of about the same dimension, to within a small number of thousands of pounds.  Our adverse balance with Czechoslovakia although the figures involved are smaller is colossal in terms of ratio.  Of all these eastern European countries Yugoslavia is the only one with which we have a slightly favourable balance.  I mention this in order to modify somewhat what I said six weeks ago.  Although the gap overall remains very worrying and Córas Tráchtála are perfectly right to draw the country's attention to it, it has to be acknowledged that there has been some improvement in regard to Irish exports at least to the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards dates back to the 1940s, the war-time period when we were trying to produce materials and services for things which could not be imported during the war.  It has grown out of all recognition since then.  The Institute is a place of colossal interest even for someone as technologically ignorant as I am.  I paid an official visit there early last year in my capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I was treated with extraordinary courtesy. The visit arose because the Department of Foreign Affairs, in which I was responsible for development aid was confronted with a suggestion that we might make money available for the development of an experimental quantity of leprosy vaccine.  I suggested that this might be done in Ireland by the Institute and with commendable speed they produced a quotation for the amount of money they would need to do it, and then the work was done <Col N="1171" /> there.  It is a most exciting place and the people there gave the impression of being enormously interested in their work.  I am sorry that I should have been in office, even if a relatively junior office, at a time when the financial constraints under which the National Coalition Government had to operate from 1974 on, meant that this institute was financially squeezed in the way that we had to squeeze many other objects on which we wished to spend money.  Had we not ruthlessly squeezed them&mdash;and I am afraid that in the process we squeezed ourselves out&mdash;this country would not be in the healthy condition it is now in.  The figures which resulted from the very miserly budgeting from which the Institute suffered are given by the chairman at the outset of the report for 1976 which was published in June around the time of the election.  They show that the annual increase in the money made available by the Government to the IIRS from 1974 to 1977, although an absolute increase in terms of pound notes, did not keep pace with the annual increase in the consumer price index but fell steadily behind. The people who work there have to live and have to be paid wage increases. They have the same expenses as the rest of us and cannot remain immune, because of their specialised function, to the ordinary operations of inflation.  In 1977 we provided a sum which was a percentage increase in money terms of 11.1 per cent on the previous year&mdash;I am combining the revenue expenditure and equipment with the capital for building&mdash;whereas the CPI rose by 13.9 per cent.  I am glad to see that the Minister is giving them some more money now but that £84,000 which he is giving still leaves them with an overall allocation this year which falls slightly short of keeping pace with the increase in the cost of living.  It is not anything like what is needed by way of an increase in real terms and the chairman complains that the IIRS cannot do its job without more money.  The chairman says that it must still be considered to be a developing organisation which has not yet reached its plateau of minimum effective size or of funding, and that <Col N="1172" /> this cannot be achieved by successive grants which diminish annually in real terms and that even small percentage increases in real terms each year would be quite adequate.</P>
    <P>It is no use to belabour the Minister for not doing what my Government failed to do, but since I cannot open the paper without finding good news being distributed in heaping handfulls by Ministers, and that miraculously the sun jumped over the horizon on the 5th July, although it has been demonstrated that all the economic indicators on which these optimistic speeches were based were showing months before the change of Government, and many more were shown in 1976, I appeal to the Minister that if the good news is all good I wish it could be spread as far as the IIRS in Glasnevin which has made a very substantial case, which has been recognised by the Minister in his Estimate speech, for increased funding.</P>
    <P>The Minister in connection with petroleum licences referred to off-shore operations and said that it was important from their point of view that the Irish government agencies concerned with off-shore operations&mdash;these agencies include the IIRS&mdash;should have adequate facilities including appropriately qualified staff to administer the many aspects of off-shore activities.  That is true and I am sorry therefore that a government which felt able to give away, without anybody asking for it, a sum which could be computed at something like £14 million or £15 million in remitted road tax, could not find something more generous to give to the IIRS after it has had the experience of the last three or four years.  I am perfectly aware of the political weakness of my stance in making that point in this regard but if times really have changed and if everything is looking up as the Taoiseach and other Ministers tell us, the IIRS should come in for assistance. Its significance to our industrial development and future generally and to our prosperity far outweighs the rather small amount of money which is devoted to it.  The amount of money which is now being additionally voted to it is actually less than the amount <Col N="1173" /> of money which we are additionally voting to the Minister's Department for travelling expenses and for subsistence expenses arising from travel.  That will give the House an idea of the very minute improvement which the IIRS is getting.  This institute which has done such good work and which shows such promise for the future should get very generous treatment from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kelly inquired about the aeromagnetic survey, and the position about that is that I put in the Estimate for this year somewhat provisionally dependent on funds becoming available from the EEC.  It was included with a number of other GSO projects in a portfolio of exploration in mining projects from Ireland for presentation at the Community Scientific and Technological Research Committees Working Party which is called CREST dealing with the primary raw material R and D programme of the Community.  The portfolio was intended to inform the Community of the type of projects which might be put forward by Ireland if EEC financial support for such projects was available.</P>
      <P>An early decision is expected on a CREST proposal which was made to the council in the summer of 1977 for a multi-annual R and D programme in the field of primary raw materials for the years 1978 to 1981 to which these projects relate.</P>

      <P>Both in fact.  In these circumstances the aeromagnetic survey was postponed with a resultant saving of £250,000 in Subhead D on the 1977 Estimates.  The amount of aid that might be forthcoming from the EEC will be an important factor in arriving at a decision about proceeding with the survey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point that Deputy Kelly raised was in relation to the IIRS and <Col N="1174" /> he read out figures of what they got in recent years which they and most people agree were scarcely adequate to enable them to expand their operations as they should.  The last Government were unable over a period of three years to give them any effective increase and will be aware of the difficulties in this respect.  I have recently had a discussion on this very point with the chairman and the chief executive of the IIRS and I know what their problems are.  I hope the Minister for Finance will be able to make some reasonable increase next year but I cannot guarantee that, and those figures are not fixed yet.  There is, as the Deputy may be aware, the possibility of the institute earning fairly substantial fees from work which they undertake from private clients, local authorities and others who pay for their services.</P>

The institute have a very elaborate building programme and I have recently had that programme examined by an officer in the Department who will be reporting to me on it, and I hope it will be possible shortly to take some decisions in relation to the programme, which is very costly and very elaborate.  I appreciate the fact that some of the premises in which the institute are housed are extremely unsatisfactory.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter mentioned by the Deputy was under the Córas Tráchtála subheading of trade with Eastern Europe.  We debated this a month or so ago here and I have nothing to add to what I said then.  I agree generally with the observations made by Deputy Kelly.  I believe that debate had the effect of stimulating certain activity <Col N="1175" /> in relation to the purchase of Irish goods.  Certainly this has not yet translated itself into firm orders, but one is hopeful that they will.  Irish exports to Russia have increased this year, as the Deputy said, but our trade balance for this year will probably be as least as bad as it was last year if not worse, and the situation with other COMECON countries is as bad as <Col N="1176" /> ever.  Yugoslavia is in a different situation; they are not in the COMECON organisation and it is possible for our exporters to deal with companies and agencies there.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will agree to the provision at the entrance gates to Leinster House, of sentry boxes or other suitable cover for gardaí, fitted with perspex or other suitable windows, in order to ensure that, while security for the House is maintained, discomfort from inclement weather is kept to a minimum.</P>

      <P>The question of my agreement does not arise.  It is the Leinster House authorities whose consent would be needed.  However, the position is that, for a number of reasons related to security needs, the Garda authorities are not satisfied that garda duties in the vicinity of Leinster House could be adequately discharged from a sentry-box or other similar shelter and accordingly they are not prepared in present circumstances to ask that such shelters be provided.  The matter is kept under review.</P>
      <P>Members engaged on these duties are given protective clothing to minimise discomfort in bad weather.</P>
