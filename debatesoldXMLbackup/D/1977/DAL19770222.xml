      <P>The question of establishing an orthopaedic unit at Our Lady's Hospital, Manorhamilton, is only one of a number of options being considered by the North Western Health Board for the purpose of providing an orthopaedic service within its own health board area.  Until a decision has been reached on where the orthopaedic unit should be located the question of making any changes in the accommodation for medical patients in Manorhamilton Hospital does not arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a new problem. We have always had a big demand from young girls wishing to train as nurses, a much greater demand than the training facilities available in the country can cope with.  The problem is, of course, accentuated in recent times because of the general problem of employment for school leavers.</P>
      <P>There has been no reduction in the number of places available in our nurse training schools.  Normally about 1,000 general nurses qualify each year, which is far greater than the number required for the normal staffing of our health services.  Because of factors such as the development of the health services, reduction in the number of working hours and nurses opting to emigrate after qualification, there has hitherto been no serious problem of oversupply of nurses.  There is some evidence at present of newly qualified nurses finding it difficult to obtain employment and we will probably need to look more closely at this situation with a view to gearing our training facilities more closely to our actual needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMSheridan" hpid="Mr. Sheridan Mr. Sheridan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheridan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the many representations that have been made to every Deputy by the frustrated parents of young people in regard to training facilities?  I would remind the Minister that there is plenty of work for trained nurses abroad.  Would the Minister try to alleviate the situation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what can be done at present.  As I said, about 1,000 general nurses qualify each year, which is far greater than the number needed.  I appreciate the problem described by the Deputy.  It is one with which all of us have to try to cope.  We should not be expected to train more nurses than we need when there are not sufficient places for prospective student nurses who want to become fully qualified.  It is a problem and the working party on nursing are dealing with it at present.  I have not yet received a report from them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>During the current year about 420 additional places for mentally handicapped adults will become available in residential and day centres.  A further 850 places, both residential and day, are in various stages of building or planning.</P>
      <P>A number of community workshops have been opened during the last year and I expect that others will open during the present year.  The total provision of places in these workshops is likely to be about 300.  They will provide facilities for all categories of adult handicapped including the mentally handicapped.</P>
      <P>The recent decision to extend, as from the 1st April next, the schemes for free travel, free electricity allowances and free television licences to recipients of disabled persons maintenance allowance will further benefit the adult handicapped.</P>
      <P>I might add that my Department are examining the longer term needs of the mentally handicapped in general in the light of two recent reports of the Medico-Social Research Board based on censuses of the mentally handicapped in institutions and in the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the biggest single problem in the area of mental handicap relates to the future of the adult mentally handicapped and that it is a problem which is causing intense anguish to parents of mentally handicapped children who are reaching the maximum age for retention in homes for mentally handicapped children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I would fully agree with the Deputy that adults are occupying places that were meant for young children under 16, and I am trying to improve that situation in a manner which is partly described in the reply I gave to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The information I have does not distinguish between severe and mild handicap, but I want to assure the Deputy that as far as the provision of additional places is concerned there will be available this year 160 day places and 264 residential places.  There will also be 300 workshop places during the coming year.  There are very many&mdash;850 places &mdash;being planned and I would hope that the planning would proceed and that we could get on with the building of these institutions as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister send me at a later date a breakdown of the information?  I think he will accept that there is a particular problem in relation to moderately and severely handicapped adults, and I would be anxious to know exactly what is likely to be done for such adults.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will accept there is a very considerable difference between mildly mentally handicapped and the other categories I have mentioned?  Finally, will the Minister see to it, as a matter of urgency, that whatever decisions he makes and whatever provision is made <Col N="7" /> will be relayed to the parents of mentally handicapped children so as to allay the considerable anxiety they feel, particularly when their children are reaching 18 years of age?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will make it a condition of the disbursement of grants to voluntary hospitals and analogous institutions that they operate a pension scheme for nursing staff and maintenance personnel similar to that enjoyed by local authority hospital employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to lay down such a condition at present.  The voluntary hospitals superannuation scheme, which is administered by my Department, applies to a large number of staff employed by the voluntary hospitals.  The benefits payable under that scheme are comparable with those payable to health board staff under the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956.  Some other hospitals and institutions have their own pension schemes and expenditure on these is provided for in their financial allocations.</P>
      <P>The local government superannuation code is at present under review by a working party established by the Minister for Local Government.  The pension provisions for staff throughout the health services will be examined in the context of the report of that working party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the vast expenditure of the health services would the Minister not agree that there is a need to provide a proper pension scheme for nurses in hospitals and other institutions who find themselves, after giving years of service, paid off and having to retire on social welfare allowances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my information. The scheme to which I referred and which is a contributory one applies to officers in voluntary hospitals. These are the permanent, full <Col N="8" /> time, para-medical, technical, nursing, administrative and clerical staffs.  They are described as being officers in the voluntary hospitals.  As far as the non-officers are concerned, after 10 years' service they get an <i>ex gratia</i> pension based on half their service when they retired.  As I told the Deputy in the original reply, the Minister for Local Government has established a working party in order to examine the position of those who are described as non-officers and it is my hope that the working party will recommend that non-officers be brought into the local government scheme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 8 and 9 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government's decision in relation to Nenagh hospital, as announced on the 21st October, 1975, is that Nenagh hospital will be retained as an acute general hospital.  In making that announcement, I indicated that it was my intention to initiate discussions with the Mid-Western Health Board with a view to instituting joint staffing arrangements between that hospital and one or more of the Limerick city hospitals to ensure that adequate <Col N="9" /> staffing is guaranteed for Nenagh hospital.</P>
    <P>During the course of 1976 several efforts were made by officials of the Mid-Western Health Board to work out joint staffing arrangements between Limerick city and Nenagh hospitals.  On June 8th last, the chief executive officer of the board informed me that it had not been possible to work out suitable joint staffing arrangements following consultations with the consultant medical staff in the area.  Following receipt of that letter, the chief executive officer of the board was asked to consider the matter again with the consultants in the Limerick region.  On the 7th October, he reiterated that suitable joint staffing arrangements were not found possible.</P>
    <P>On January 4th last, I received a letter from Comhairle na nOspidéal which stated that they had been informed by the Mid-Western Health Board that joint staffing arrangements between Limerick city and Nenagh were not feasible and that the Government's decision to retain Nenagh hospital should be re-examined.</P>
    <P>On January 28th, I informed Comhairle na nOspidéal that there would be no change in the Government's decision on Nenagh hospital and that all the agencies involved should continue to seek a suitable solution to the staffing problem there.</P>
    <P>The position at the moment, therefore, is that Nenagh hospital will be retained, as announced in the Government's decision of October, 1975, and that the health agencies concerned have been asked to concentrate on finding a suitable staffing solution.  I am anxiously awaiting their recommendations on this matter and there will be no delay on my part in approving any suitable solution which they propose.</P>
    <P>The comhairle, at a meeting on 18th February, decided to arrange talks with the medical organisations on staffing problems in a number of hospitals, including Nenagh.  I do not wish to pre-empt the result of these discussions which, I expect, will take place shortly but, if cover by consultants <Col N="10" /> in Limerick is not practicable, it may be necessary to consider other arrangements, such as the appointment of special additional staff, in order to ensure that the Government's decision to retain Nenagh hospital is made effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that the Mid-Western Health Board, supported by the staff themselves and by all the people in north Tipperary, have asked that the additional staff be appointed, namely an additional surgeon and an anaesthetist. Would the Minister not accept that in view of the fact that the arrangements with Limerick hospital have not worked, it is vitally necessary to appoint an extra surgeon and an anaesthetist to ensure that the surgical and other facilities at the hospital can be maintained?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to point out that the appointment of consultants is a matter for Comhairle na nOspidéal, both in respect of numbers and of locations.  I would point out also, though, that the staffing complement at Nenagh hospital is at the same level as has been the case for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point. The Minister should be aware that Nenagh and the surrounding area is very much a developing area, as the population structure proves.  I take it that the Minister is not saying that the hospital with the same complement of staff as it had some years ago is adequate to cope with present day needs.  Will he not recommend, if that is the limit of his power, to Comhairle na nOspidéal that an extra surgeon and anaesthetist be appointed?  These appointments have been requested both by the staff at the hospital and by the Mid-Western Health Board.  It is obvious that if the request is not complied with we will be ensuring effectively that facilities at the hospital cannot be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>My function is not the same as that of Comhairle na nOspidéal.  If the comhairle make a recommendation to me I shall give it my fullest consideration; but, as I have said, the staff complement has not <Col N="11" /> changed for years.  I do not know what the Deputy was doing in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy accept that the Minister for Health, regardless of who holds that office, cannot appoint consultants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but I accept also that the Minister for Health has, as he has acknowledged already, the final responsibility in regard to designations at general hospitals.  I am asking him to be honest and at least to recognise that since it has not proved possible to work this arrangement of sharing staff and facilities with Limerick the least that should be done is the guaranteeing of proper surgical facilities and that the only way of doing this is by providing extra staff?  Obviously that is a matter that only the Minister can decide.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the services available to the elderly, including those who are disabled, are at an acceptable level.  The community care programme operated by local health boards and by voluntary agencies subsidised by the health boards is an expanding service which operates on the principle that it is better for elderly people, in terms of personal dignity and happiness, to be retained in the community while this is possible rather than be placed in hospitals or other institutions.</P>

      <P>I am obliged by the terms of the Act to judge each application for a licence on its merits.

      <P>I am disappointed with the Parliamentary Secretary's reply.  Surely, apart from using plastic bullets and high velocity bullets on animals, the idea of using them on human beings should be more abhorrent to the Parliamentary Secretary. We know that rubber bullets have been used in the Six Counties.  Now they are going to make them more sophisticated and they are going to use plastic bullets against human beings, but to achieve the sophistication they require they experiment on live animals.

      <P>I would refer the Deputies to my replies to questions by Deputy Andrews on 30th November, 1976, 19th February, 1976 and 18th December, 1975, in which I pointed out that any surplus income which arises on the operation of the pay-related benefit scheme is paid into the social insurance fund.  As a result of the extensions in the duration of pay-related benefit over the last 18 months, expenditure is now coming much closer to receipts.  It is estimated that receipts in the year 1977 will amount to £24.5 million and that expenditure, including administration cost, will be almost £20 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that in reply to a question put down recently by me it was shown that the amount taken in contributions to this scheme was double the expenditure, approximately £52 million income as against £26 million expenditure?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary satisfied that the contributions should remain at the present level when the Department is making 100 per cent profit at a time when unemployment is at an all-time high?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy quoted figures that I gave in reply to a previous question.  That would be over a <Col N="19" /> given period of time.  My concern, and I am sure the Deputy will share that concern, is that the fund will remain solvent.  As the Deputy is aware from my reply, with the extension of the periods of eligibility for pay-related benefit, which does not apply solely to unemployment benefit but also to disability benefit and maternity benefit, there is a much greater demand on the fund and the figures I have quoted in the answer show clearly that the fund would be endangered by any reduction in the contributions paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary would agree that the finances for disability benefit and the other benefits he mentioned are got from the employer and the employee in the social insurance stamp.  Would he agree that the exorbitant amounts being collected under this scheme over and above need are so great as to be as much of a deterrent to production as any other part of tax, and in those circumstances would he not agree that the proper thing to do at a time like this, when unemployment is so high and we are so concerned about improving the employment situation, would be to reduce the contributions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy, eligibility under the pay-related scheme is not confined to unemployment. The scheme also pays in repect of disability benefit and maternity benefit.  It is also fair to say that the people who benefit under the pay-related scheme who suffer either from unemployment or disability for a duration of time would be very concerned about the fund going broke.  I am also quite satisfied that as far as the vast majority of employers are concerned they are happy to see a situation in which some degree of financial security is afforded to their workers during temporary lay-off periods, periods of unemployment or disability. It is essential that the fund be kept in a healthy financial state and the figures I have quoted in my formal reply to the Deputy would show that it would not be possible without endangering the future of the fund to reduce the contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that procedural delays are endemic in the administration of the schemes for which my Department is responsible. Administrative arrangements in relation to these schemes must comply with the requirements of legislation enacted by the Oireachtas and must also meet the obligations of public accountability.  The Department must, therefore, ensure that these criteria are satisfied in the arrangements which they make.  The general system of administration in my Department is continually under review and every effort is made to ensure that it functions as efficiently and effectively as possible.  In processing claims for benefits extensive use is now made of advanced computerised techniques and further far-reaching developments in this respect are in train.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Delays undoubtedly occur in individual cases but many of these are outside the control of my Department. Claimants who fail to complete forms <Col N="21" /> fully by, for example, omitting to furnish their insurance numbers or other necessary information may experience delays in the processing of their claims.  I accept, of course, that delays also occur for which my Department can be held responsible but when account is taken of the fact that about one million new claims of all types are received in a year, or an average of 20,000 per week, it is only natural that occasional mistakes will arise through human error.  I can assure the Deputies that I am most concerned about any delays that occur, no matter from what cause, and I will continue to do everything possible to ensure that such delays are kept to the absolute minimum.</P>

The most extreme case that I am aware of goes back to last August and it has not yet been dealt with.  I am not saying that that is usual but that it should happen at all is surely a reflection on the system.  This is a matter which the Parliamentary Secretary promised some time back to do something about if he could and I imagine he can.  In the case of reinvestigations, <Col N="22" /> they should not be delayed.  In other words, payment should not be stopped while they are going on and if they are not right let the people have the consequences, but do not hurt the people who really are in need merely to protect the Department's coffers from those who are improperly drawing benefits.</P>

      <P>As I pointed out in my original reply, there are cases that are not the fault of the Department in so far as sufficient or accurate information is not supplied to pursue a claim but there are cases where the Department accept responsibility for delays. I pointed out to the Deputy, and I think any reasonable person would accept, that where you are dealing with a million new claims per year or approximately 20,000 new claims per week it is only natural that there will be some human error in the handling of those.  I am also very conscious of the fact that each individual case can cause considerable hardship and I am most anxious and I am making considerable efforts to minimise as far as possible any delay that may be occurring or may have occurred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Parliamentary Secretary says on the matter and he has seen the position as it exists.  Would he not summon a conference of the Dublin local authorities at least, the health board and the corporation to see if the scheme can be improved with Government help? I know from personal experience that he will agree that it is not all it should be at the moment, and some vital steps must be taken to make it a little better.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, I did discuss this with a deputation from Dublin Corporation some time ago and I pointed out then&mdash;and the facts have not changed &mdash;that all the difficulties arising from the operation of the scheme would seem to lie in the area of delivery. Some local authorities have accepted responsibility for delivery.  Dún Laoghaire, for instance, is one.  In those circumstances there seems to be very little, if any, complaint or dissatisfaction with the operation of the scheme.  There is nothing to stop Dublin Corporation from operating the scheme in the way they deem to be most efficient, effective and satisfactory from the point of view of the recipients.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware of the hardship that arises when an old age pensioner dies leaving a widow under 67 years who is not entitled to retain the benefit of free television and travel and electricity allowances which she enjoyed when her husband was living; and the action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the situation which the Deputy describes <Col N="24" /> is in general a source of hardship.</P>
      <P>The free travel, free electricity allowance and free television licence schemes were introduced for the benefit of persons in receipt of a social welfare type old age pension.  Subsequently the free travel scheme was extended to cover all persons, whether in receipt of a pension or not, of pensionable age.  As announced in the recent budget statement, the pensionable age will be reduced from 67 to 66 years from October next.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, it was announced at the same time that the schemes here in question will be extended to cover persons in receipt of an invalidity pension from the Department of Social Welfare as well as recipients of disabled persons maintenance allowance.</P>
      <P>No further extension of the coverage of these schemes is at present contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that the question exposes an anomaly?  Perhaps I could give a quick example of a woman of 64 years who is left a widow.  Her husband was in receipt of a pension, and so on, and during the course of the marriage she enjoyed all the benefits and entitlements of free travel, free electricity, free TV.  Suddenly the husband dies and she is left without the enjoyment of a number of these entitlements.  This seems grossly unfair.  I received very strong representations on this matter and, no doubt, the Parliamentary Secretary received the same representations from the same associations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that in general I do not agree there is hardship.  There could possibly be hardship in the case cited by the Deputy.  On the other hand, I could cite the case of a woman under 40 years of age who could be left the widow of an old age pensioner.  In present circumstances, it would not be reasonable to extend these facilities in that type of case.  I cannot accept that general hardship is imposed because of the present position.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no undue delay in processing the application in this case.  A claim for unemployment benefit made by the person concerned on 27th September, 1976, was disallowed by a deciding officer on the ground that she did not satisfy the statutory condition for entitlement to such benefit which required her to have had not less than 26 contributions paid or credited in respect of her <Col N="27" /> in the 1974-1975 governing contribution year.  She was notified of this decision and of her right to appeal against it if she was dissatisfied but she did not do so.  The question of her entitlement to unemployment benefit was reviewed when the year 1975-1976 became the governing contribution year with effect from 6th December, 1976, but she did not satisfy the relevant contribution condition in respect of that year either.</P>
      <P>Her application for a qualification certificate, which is a necessary requirement for entitlement to unemployment assistance, was disallowed on the ground that she did not satisfy the contribution condition, applicable in the case of a single woman without dependants, that at least 52 employment contributions have been paid in respect of her in the relevant four contribution years preceding her application.</P>
      <P>Later, however, on 11th January, 1977, she submitted to my Department a British insurance card with six contributions affixed in respect of employment in Britain which she had not previously brought to notice and which enabled her to satisfy the contribution requirement referred to for unemployment assistance purposes.  Her case was accordingly referred to the local social welfare officer for a report on her means.  On the basis of the officer's report the deciding officer has now given a revised decision disallowing her application for a qualification certificate on the ground that she had not furnished particulars of her means as required by the Unemployment Assistance Acts and regulations and thus had not shown that her means did not exceed the statutory limit for entitlement thereto applicable in her case.  She is being notified of this decision and of her right to appeal against it if she is dissatisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the items which must be taken into account in the assessment of means for unemployment assistance purposes is the yearly value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by an applicant such as free or partly free board and lodging and for this purpose the applicant was requested to furnish <Col N="28" /> particulars of her father's earnings.  To assist the applicant the social welfare officer also addressed an inquiry in the matter to the latter's employers.  I regret that this action was taken without first obtaining her father's consent. However, the information required has not been forthcoming from the employer, the applicant or her father and the deciding officer accordingly disallowed the application for a qualification certificate on the grounds already indicated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 2, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the chief section. It would authorise the Minister to buy 24 per cent of the shares in Bula Limited for £9.54 million.  It is necessary, when considering the commercial and general public propriety of the Minister's proposed purchase of these shares, to consider a number of relevant matters which pertain to the company in which he has chosen to buy this minority holding.  If in discussing certain aspects of the commercial and legal operations of this company I have to appear critical of them, I apologise in advance.  I have no wish to take on the company any more than I had over the last three or four weeks.  The Minister has chosen to buy these shares and accordingly it is necessary for us, if we are to examine the proposed deal properly, to look into some of the public facts that are available in relation to the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had a copy made for me by reputable professional searchers in Dublin of the entire file relating to Bula Limited in the Companies Office. This information is available to every member of the public.  The number of this company in the Companies Office is 33738.  This search was made about a week or ten days ago.  There was some difficulty making it because the file was not available every day, which <Col N="51" /> is unusual.  I assume on the day my searchers made the search that they were in a position to copy the entire file and that none of it was missing. On that assumption I make the following comments.</P>
    <P>The Articles of Association of this company, which is now called Bula Limited but started out as Wright Limited, contain a most unusual article, unusual in the context of this Bill and of the agreement of the 12th December, 1975, to which the Bill refers. The unusual article, No. 11, is the last of the special drafted articles and is headed &ldquo;Indemnity&rdquo;.  With the Chair's indulgence I will read it because it might not be available to Members of the House who do not want the trouble of going to Dublin Castle to look at it.  It reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Every Director, Managing Director, Agent, Auditor, Secretary or other officer of the Company should be entitled to be indemnified out of the assets of the Company against all losses or liabilities which he may sustain or incur in or about the execution of the duties of his office or otherwise in relation thereto, including any liability incurred by him in defending any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour or in which he is acquitted or in connection with any application under Section 391 of the Act in which relief is granted to him by the court, and no director or other officer shall be liable for any loss, damage or misfortune which may happen to or be incurred by the Company in the execution of the duties of his office or in relation thereto.  But this Article shall only have effect in so far as its provisions are not avoided by Section 200 of the Act.</P>
    <P>During his reply to the Second Stage debate on 2nd February, 1977, the Minister stated that four people whom he named had guaranteed performance of the agreement of the 12th December, 1975.  He named the four people &mdash;who appear to be the four directors of Bula Limited&mdash;Messrs.  Roche Senior <Col N="52" /> and Junior, Mr. Wymes and Mr. Wood.  They are referred to in this Bill as &ldquo;certain other parties named in the agreement&rdquo;; they are not named.  They are the four guarantors. Unfortunately we have not seen this agreement; it is a secret document. But the Minister told us when replying to the Second Stage debate that these four gentlemen have guaranteed performance of the agreement by Bula Limited.</P>
    <P>Performance of the agreement in the context of what we are talking about now would appear to mean that they would take all steps legally open to them to try to get the company into production, the mine operating and producing profitably at as early a date as possible, and to do all or any other acts which are necessary or conducive to the attainment of the commercial objects of the company. Under that unseen agreement the Minister has certain rights as against the company.  When I say &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; I mean, in effect, the taxpayer because it is his £9.54 million that is being used.</P>
    <P>If the Minister felt, for example, that planning permission applications were not being pressed ahead sufficiently or that some other steps were not being taken to get the company into profitable production as soon as was reasonably feasible in all the circumstances and started an action, as he would be entitled to do under this agreement, against the company and the guarantors, and if, specifically, he started against the guarantors to get them to honour their guarantee of performance of the terms of the agreement and, let us assume, he was successful and the court took the view that the Minister was entitled to enforce his guarantee of performance against the four guarantors who were also directors, he would find himself in the position&mdash;and I suggest that this is a rather anomalous position to be in&mdash; that the four guarantors concerned because they are also directors could pass on any claim the Minister might make in this respect to the company. They could seek total indemnification by the company in respect of any claim he might have under the secret <Col N="53" /> agreement of December, 1975, against them.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister would be in the position that, having successfully sought a declaration, that he was entitled to have certain things done, the company, in which he would then be a 49 per cent shareholder, would have to indemnify the guarantors and directors against the Minister's action; he would, in fact, be taking the action 49 per cent against himself.  The guarantors and directors would be only nominal parties for the purpose of passing on judgment in the action which the Minister, in his capacity as Minister for Industry and Commerce, would be taking against Bula Limited, in which he would be a 49 per cent proprietor by virtue of the fact that presumably at that stage he would hold shares to that amount.</P>
    <P>Even the most non-legal minded person would agree that any such situation is ridiculous.  Has the Minister taken into account the virtual uselessness of this guarantee provision, which we have not seen, in the agreement, which we have not seen, of the 12th December, 1975?  If he himself has to indemnify the defendants against whom he takes action as to 49 per cent he is penalising himself and the taxpayer.  What is the point of such an operation?  The Minister cannot say that this article II appeared after he signed the agreement; it did not.  It was there in the original memorandum and articles of this company registered on 19th March, 1971.  More than four-and-a-half years before the Minister signed the agreement he would have been aware of the existence of this indemnity. It is a very broad indemnity but I do not see anything illegal in it because it makes the necessary references to section 200 and section 391. Section 200 prevents certain types of indemnities being given but this does not extend to contractual indemnities of this kind.  Section 391 is a section in relief of directors who may have acted negligently but who did not act in bad faith.  Of course, that would not arise here because one is assuming that there would be no question of bad faith, it would be a question of inability to fulfil a guarantee, possibly <Col N="54" /> through factors which are outside the direct control of the guarantors.  This is a matter which I do not propose to develop any further at this point. But I should like to hear the Minister's views on this because it seems quite futile to have a guarantee when, in fact, the guarantors will be indemnified as to 49 per cent by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I now want to deal with the company and what appears to be the evidence disclosed by its public file in the Companies' Registration Office. Although this company was registered on the 19th of March, 1971, it did not file any annual return until the 12th of November, 1974&mdash;which is more than three-and-a-half years after its formation and registration.  Under the terms of section 125 presumably the company would not have had an obligation to file a return in respect of the calendar year 1971 because that was the year of its incorporation but it would have had a legal obligation to file annual returns for 1972 and 1973 and to file these within a reasonable period.  In fact, we find that the two annual returns for 1972 and 1973 were filed together on the 12th November, 1974.  It is possible that the 1973 return might have been in time or may not have been too late but quite clearly the return for 1972 was late, being filed nearly two years after the end of the year to which it referred.</P>
    <P>Section 125 (2) of the Companies Act, 1963, states:</P>
    <P>If a company fails to comply with this section, the company and every officer of the company who is in default shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £100.</P>
    <P>Section 125 (3) states:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this section and of Part I of the Fifth Schedule, &ldquo;director&rdquo; and &ldquo;officer&rdquo; shall include any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the company are accustomed to act.</P>
    <P>Section 125 (4) states:</P>
    <P>Proceedings in relation to an offence under this section may be <Col N="55" /> brought and prosecuted by the registrar of companies.</P>
    <P>The registrar frequently prosecutes companies under this section.  The numbers are given in the annual report and these companies are fined varying amounts.</P>
    <P>It would appear that there was noncompliance in 1974.  Assuming that the file is complete and that there was nothing missing when the search was conducted on my behalf, it would seem that the last annual return was filed on the 12th of November, 1974, because up to about a week ago no further annual return was filed.  For that reason it appears that there could have been a failure to comply with the provisions of section 125 of the Companies Act, 1963.  The two returns filed on the 12th of November, 1974, in respect of the years 1972 and 1973 both contain under section 4, which contains particulars of indebtedness, the return nil, that is, they state that there was no indebtedness on the part of the company on the 31st of December, 1972, and on the 31st December, 1973.  The Minister tells me that they have filed subsequent annual returns but that they are not available on the file at the moment.  If they had filed returns in respect of the years 1974, 1975 or 1976 presumably that entry could not still be nil.  It would be necessary for the company to specify what its indebtedness was and this, of course, is a factor which is extremely relevant when it comes to the question of deciding whether it was wise for the taxpayer to have to pay £9.54 million for 24 per cent of the shares of the company.  No doubt it was just an oversight that the returns appear not to have been made as required by section 125 of the Companies Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>It is not uncommon for small companies who have not professional secretaries and advisers to overlook these things.  After a year or two they get a reminder from the registrar of companies and they usually comply then. But this company is not a small company without access to professional advice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="56" /> The secretary of the company is a solicitor of standing and would not normally allow a company to be in default in a matter such as this and, in particular, would not allow any company to be in default where the question of complying with the law was concerned.  The annual return does not appear to be the only document where there was failure to make return. One finds on the file also that a special resolution was passed by the company increasing this authorised capital from £100 to £1 million.  That resolution was passed at an extraordinary meeting of the members of the company duly convened and held on the 16th July, 1974.  Although section 143 of the Companies Act, 1963, requires, again under the sanction of a penalty following prosecution in the District Court for failure to comply, such a resolution to be filed within 15 days of its passing, the resolution was filed more than 18 months after it was passed, which, on the face of it, is not in accordance with section 143 of the Companies Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>On this public file in the Companies Office there are a number of references to an agreement of the 17th February, 1975, between the company and somebody called Haras el Chorro, SA.  The agreement between the company, who are described at various points in this file in connection with this as the mortgagors, and Haras el Chorro, SA, appears to relate to the minerals included in Folio 26646, County Meath. That appears to be borne out by a number of further references in the file where the charges are concerned. The mortgage of the 13th September, 1976, is in favour of the Northern Bank Finance Corporation Limited, registered on the 15th October.  That mortgage covers, according to the particulars on the file, the lands comprised in Folio 26646 County Meath but excluding and excepting thereout the mines and minerals on and under the said lands.</P>
    <P>It goes on later to refer separately to those mines and minerals as being all the estate, right, title and interest referred to in paragraph 1 of an agreement dated 17th February, 1975, made between Haras el Chorro, SA and the <Col N="57" /> company and therein described as all the estate, right, title and interest of the vendors in and to any minerals on or under the lands comprised in Folio 26646 aforesaid upon and subject to the terms and conditions contained in the agreement together with the company's rights and benefits acquired under the said contracts.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to ask the Minister a number of questions in connection with this.  Who are Haras el Chorro, SA?  What is in the agreement of the 17th February 1975?  Why are the minerals lying under this particular folio excluded?  Have they been mortgaged in favour of Haras el Chorro, SA?  Were all these facts known to the Minister's advisers and made known to the arbitrators and so on?  If there is a mortgage or some other encumbrance, what is the nature of it, the amount of it and the purpose of it? If one had that information it would prevent speculation as to what might have been the nature of whatever agreement has been made.</P>
    <P>As the annual returns for 1974, 1975 and 1976 do not appear to be on the file in the Companies Registration Office this has avoided the necessity of stating the indebtedness of the company. As there appears to be an obligation under the law of the land to provide this information as to the up to date indebtedness of the company at the 31st December in each of the years, would the Minister now give us that information?  I trust he will not now suggest that it would be commercially damaging to the company to give that information since the Companies Act, 1963, requires it to be given.  My recollection is that section 125 is to a great extent a reprint of the corresponding section in the Companies Act, 1908 which to a great extent was a reprint of the corresponding section in the old Act in the 1860's.</P>
    <P>One hopes there was not a deliberate intention of trying to conceal those figures in view of the fact that the provisions of the law require them to be given.  One must become a little worried, because we have here a company of which the Minister is buying a 24 per cent interest by paying some of the individual shareholders £9½ <Col N="58" /> million for some of their shares.  Up to now the company would appear not to have complied with various provisions of the law relating to companies as contained in the Companies Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>That Act is a publicly promulgated Act of the Oireachtas and what worries me is that if there is a failure to comply with a publicly promulgated law is there not at least a danger that such company might also, perhaps inadvertently, fail to comply with the provisions of the secret agreement of 12th December, 1975, which this Bill seeks to ratify and give force of law to?  It seems that there is a danger that a company which inadvertently failed to comply with a publicly promulgated declared law might equally inadvertently fail to comply with the details contained in the secret agreement of 12th December, 1975, which will become law if this section is passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will respond to what the Deputy has said as adequately as I am able to.  I am not a lawyer and I am not a specialist in these things.  I do not have the specialist knowledge that the Deputy, through his profession, possesses.  If either my understanding of his points is inadequate or my exposition or use of words is wrong it arises from the non-specialist nature of the contribution I will be making. With regard to the point the Deputy made about article 11 in relation to indemnity, on Second Stage I said that the four people who had given a guarantee of the performance of the agreement gave that guarantee in their capacity as beneficiary owners of the shares and that guarantee does not relate to their position as directors of the trading company.  As the Deputy is aware, having held the office of a Minister, in the functioning of a Department there is continuous legal advice of the highest quality available to a Minister.  In circumstances such as this legal advice is continuously and extensively used.  I understand that the new articles were vetted by legal advisers in my Department.  If I understand the situation correctly the points made by Deputy O'Malley in relation to idemnity do not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" /> The Deputy made a second point about the discrepancy in time between the filing of an annual report for 1972 and 1973&mdash;he said they were filed together on 12th December, 1974.  I do not possess expert knowledge in this area, and obviously anything I say would be subject to my lack of that knowledge.  I do not know whether this is something that happens quite frequently or if they are prodded a bit by the Companies Office.  I cannot comment on the significance or the weight of that delay.  I cannot give him the details he asks for in the following section of his question but I can say that obviously the arrangements leading to the completion of the contract provided for detailed consideration of the financial affairs and all the other relevant facts of the company's affairs by people who understand them, not by me because no doubt they would tell me if it were relevant to do so.  I am not a specialist. Those facts were investigated by people on our side who understand them. Arrangements leading to the completion provided for such disclosures as may be necessary to satisfy the Department and me as Minister about the various facts.  I can assure everybody that from our side the matters are being scrutinised very carefully as is proper. I regret I cannot give the Deputy more precise answers than those but it is due to my lack of specialist knowledge.</P>

When I say &ldquo;offshore&rdquo; I mean offshore in the investment sense.  Horrible possibilities spring to mind and it is not reassuring that the Minister cannot tell us anything about this organisation which appears fairly prominently on the Bula Limited file. With the greatest respect, the Minister has a duty to be familiar with the arrangements made by this company. This agreement with Haras el Chorro, SA, was made on 17th February, 1975, and I can only hope to God, for the sake of the taxpayers, that the Minister knew all about that agreement when he signed the agreement on 12th December, 1975.</P>

      <P>I have stated that the information is being properly considered and that it has been at all stages by the experts, but the suggestion that I should carry or try to understand all that information is obviously out of keeping with all our traditional practices and all of the norms of how the Government operate. Although it is true that I bear the responsibility, I must have confidence in the very competent legal and financial experts who have time to study these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am mystified as to why the Minister should misrepresent what Deputy O'Malley has said.  Anybody listening to Deputy O'Malley could not fail to understand him.  He was not saying that the Minister in his personal capacity should have detailed knowledge of all these points.  What Deputy O'Malley went on to say, and this is the kernel of the matter, is that the information sought should be available to the Minister from his advisers so that the Minister could give it to the House.  The Minister spoke about norms sought by various Departments. The procedure described by Deputy O'Malley is the norm.  There are rare occasions&mdash;I am glad to say they are rare&mdash;when information sought in the House is not available to the Minister from his advisers and on such occasions the Minister has to make some special arrangement whereby he will get that information for the House and present it at a time appropriate to enable the House to consider it.  I do not know if the Minister has grasped the points made by Deputy O'Malley.  The <Col N="62" /> Minister has not controverted Deputy O'Malley's points that a number of the annual returns of this company which are required by law to be filed have not been filed.  In the absence of being field, and leaving aside the requirements of the Companies Acts, there is not available to Deputy O'Malley or anybody else who wants it the information which by law should be there.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley comes to the House and asks the Minister, because that information has not been filed as it should have been according to law, to get that information, and the Minister has his advisers available.  It is not reasonable for the Minister to say that he personally cannot know that.  That is not what Deputy O'Malley said.  In this particular matter a very large sum of the taxpayers' money is being invested and there is need for the kind of information that would be available according to law to the public generally in regard to any company&mdash;not just one in respect of which the State is paying a great deal of money to some of the shareholders.  Such information is available in respect of any company but in this case, since it is not available, I suggest very seriously to the Minister to consider Deputy O'Malley's suggestion that if the Minister is unable to produce the information which should be available according to law, he is not being fair to himself if he comes in and in effect says that the information which by law is not there will still be kept secret.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said he has not got available to him the information which should have been filed.  Then, at the very least it ought to be sought immediately so that the House will be enabled to consider the very relevant matters brought up by Deputy O'Malley in regard to the indebtedness of the company.  This is something the company should have disclosed in a file.  There are possibly very good reasons why that was not done.  Inadvertence could be one of them. There is no suggestion of wilful concealment. Because the information is not available, in the circumstances there is a clear onus on the Minister, when he is asking the House to approve the payment of £9½ million <Col N="63" /> of taxpayers' money to those shareholders, to produce in the House the information that should be available.</P>

      <P>There was one other question in regard to what the Minister said in relation to Article 11 of the Articles of Association.  Is the Minister saying&mdash;I want to be quite certain about this&mdash;that the secret agreement of 12th December, 1975, provides specifically that the guarantee of its performance given by the four directors is given in their capacty as beneficial owners of shares and not in their capacity as directors and, therefore, Article 11 does not apply?  Is the Minister specifically saying that is what the agreement provides and, as a consequence, Article 11 does not apply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I believe that to be what I am conveying to the House as articulated by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is in the difficulty that, while that may have been the intention and the four gentlemen concerned may have signed this secret agreement of 12th December, 1975, <i>qua</i> shareholders, nonetheless they are directors and, irrespective of what may have been the intention on 12th December, 1975, because they are directors&mdash;generally speaking, one is a director only if one is also a shareholder, though not necessarily so&mdash;they have in law the benefit of the indemnity that Article 11 gives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="65" /> If in law they have the benefit of that indemnity then the Minister is in effect suing himself as to 49 per cent any time he seeks to exercise the guarantee. For that reason it is to my mind unsatisfactory, to say the least.  A guarantee that is worth precisely only 51 per cent of what it purports to be worth is unsatisfactory and the proper course to have followed in such an instance before the signing of the agreement of 12th December, 1975, would have been to have passed a special resolution rescinding Article 12, repealing it, getting rid of it from Article 11 or, alternatively, adding something to the effect that for the purposes of the agreement of 12th December, 1975, made between Bula Holdings, Patrick Wright and certain other holdings and the Minister, Article 11 shall not apply. That could have been included by a resolution to that effect even though it was not the intention apparently to give them an out and they signed, as the Minister says, in their capacity as shareholders rather than as directors. Nevertheless, the fact they are directors, and while they remain directors, gives them the right to claim this indemnity and they will be claiming that indemnity as to 49 per cent from the Minister himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to appear didactic in a long legal disputation with a lawyer on the other side but I want to remind the House that we are talking about a guarantee.  Now guarantees are notorious in the sense that they are very strictly construed by our courts, whatever about the courts in other countries, and one is tied to the letter of the guarantee and, if one does not strictly comply with the guarantee, then it is not a guarantee. I take the Minister as saying that the four signatories, the guarantors, signed as beneficial owners.  That means they signed in their personal capacities and they would be construed as personally responsible.  That is the way it would be interpreted in a court of law.  I do not go along with the view expressed by Deputy O'Malley that eventually the Minister is coming back on himself or the public back on themselves as being responsible. This is a personal responsibility <Col N="66" /> by the four signatories to the agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>They all deal with the same point.  I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 2, lines 29 and 30, after &ldquo;section,&rdquo; to delete &ldquo;a Minister of State&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 3 (1) says that: &ldquo;Subject to subsection (2) of this section, a Minister of State may exercise, in respect of shares of the Company ...&rdquo;  This is not a fundamental matter in the same sense as earlier amendments were fundamental.  This is less fundamental and less important but there appears to be a certain amount of confusion in the references to &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo;, &ldquo;a Minister&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  In Section 1 &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; is defined as the Minister for Industry and Commerce; in section 2 the Minister for Finance is described as being the Minister in whose name the shares will be registered and in section 3 there is reference to &ldquo;a Minister of State&rdquo;.  That could be the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Fisheries, just to take some Ministers at random.  The question then arises how do these Ministers come into this.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce exercises the powers, the Minister for Finance holds the shares and &ldquo;a Minister&rdquo; has certain other functions. The powers were clearly intended to be exercised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  If the words &ldquo;a Minister of State&rdquo; were deleted and if the words &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo;, meaning the Minister for Industry and Commerce, were substituted we would get over a lot of the confusion and difficulty.  Will the Minister agree to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree to it for a reason which I hope the Deputy will find satisfactory.  The confusion appears to be more seeming than real and, perhaps, I should explain the background which apparently gave rise to the amendments.  While the agreement provides that the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the first instance will acquire the shares, it is the generally accepted practice that any shares purchased out of public funds should be <Col N="68" /> registered in the name of the Minister for Finance.  Therefore, it was necessary for the parliamentary draftsman to insert provisions about holding shares and exercising powers to cover the interim period when they would be transferred to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the subsequent period when they would be held by the Minister for Finance.  It is envisaged that the term of time between the acquisition by the Minister for Finance will be short but presumably it was necessary that the legislation should envisage at least the possibility of there being a delay in transit through the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>In regard to other Ministers, of course it refers only to a Minister holding shares, not to any Minister in general.  Therefore, it refers to the Minister for Industry and Commerce through whom they pass and to the Minister for Finance in whom they come to reside.  Perhaps if the Deputy sees the drafting in that light and understands it, he will not wish to press the four amendments which are related and which come from this single point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will tell the House why this form of procedure has been accepted whereby the Minister for Industry and Commerce acquires the shares for a very short time and then passes them to the Minister for Finance.  If they are going to end up with the Minister for Finance, why not have them acquired by that Minister and have the various powers exercised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce?  Would not that simplify matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreement provides that in the first instance the Minister for Industry and Commerce will acquire the shares.  The normal practice is that ultimately they reside with the Minister for Finance.  There is a transit mechanism.  I suppose it could have been done in another way but it was not.  I do not think there is a major point here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are powers and rights attaching to shares which will be exercised <Col N="69" /> by the Minister for Industry and Commerce even though they are held by the Minister for Finance.  The Deputy knows this is quite a normal practice. Every Minister exercises rights in regard to shares that are not registered in his name but which are registered in the name of the Minister for Finance. There is something of a division here.  In this country we do not operate the practice where if some matter refers to, say, the Department of Transport and Power the shares are registered in the name of the Minister for Transport and Power.  He exercises the rights and powers but the Minister for Finance holds the shares.  There is that dichotomy built into our system and we are not trying to change it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that the Minister is introducing a new element in the normal procedure which he has described, whereby shares are held by the Minister for Finance and the powers in respect of such shares exercised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  When the Minister was explaining the drafting, I thought he was referring to the interim period during which the shares would be vested in the Minister for Industry and Commerce and before they would be vested in the Minister for Finance and when the powers would be exercised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Perhaps I misunderstood the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain responsibilities and powers will be continuously exercised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as the Minister responsible in that area.  Therefore, the exercise of certain powers will be continued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as is the normal practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The interim period is a mechanism to get them from the present owners into the hands of the Minister for Finance and it has no relevance.  It is simply a drafting mechanism.  That was how the parliamentary <Col N="70" /> draftsman thought was the way to encompass the end result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the Minister's explanation but I do not understand how the parliamentary draftsman succeeded in getting us worked into such a cocked hat in this section.  One of the amendments put down by Deputy O'Malley proposes to insert the words &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; meaning the Minister for Industry and Commerce instead of &ldquo;a Minister&rdquo;. We are taking it for granted that the parliamentary draftsman was referring to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the reference to &ldquo;a Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It was intended to encompass either the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance but not any other Minister because he would not hold shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is where the vagueness comes in.  Section 3 (1) refers to a Minister of State and states he may exercise powers in respect of shares held by him.  The word &ldquo;him&rdquo; in this context may refer to two people; it may be the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance. From what the Minister has said it appears that shares in the company will be in the hands of the Minister for Finance.  However, there is a certain confusion because the word &ldquo;him&rdquo; in section 3 (1) could refer at one time to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and at another time to the Minister for Finance.  It is an extraordinary cocked hat situation into which the parliamentary draftsman, with due respect to his ingenuity, has placed us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the four amendments together, which is logical, I find it difficult to visualise the transfer of shares between whichever of the two Ministers might be holding the shares at any time.  In that context, I wonder how the Minister visualises the exercising of that operation on his behalf by an attorney when it is not known which of the two Ministers holds the shares at any time.  We have the same situation in regard to amendments Nos. 9 and 10 in section 4.  Again, there is <Col N="71" /> this element of risk, or are we visualising a type of situation whereby shares will be transferred?  We are proposing the possibility of transferring shares to some other nominee.  I cannot understand the ambiguity in those two sections. I agree with the Minister when he says that &ldquo;a Minister&rdquo; could only be the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance.  On the other hand, one consideration is the possibility of a change in the Department of Industry and Commerce in that there would be a further ministerial appointment and that the Minister was building some form of protection into the section.  I realise there is ambiguity in what I am saying.  The Minister normally makes clear statements but his outline of the reasons for not accepting the amendment was ambiguous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean to sound ambiguous.  While I am not a lawyer, I believe there is no ambiguity in the section.  I assure the House that the only objective in this formulation is to ensure that the shares are transferred to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and then, as quickly as possible, transferred by him to the Minister for Finance.  If there is more ambiguity than that, it resides in the system that we operate, whereby shares are held by the Minister for Finance but different Ministers exercise powers in relation to those shares even though they do not hold them.  It is a reasonable practice and we have no wish to change it.  In view of the indication as to why we find it necessary to proceed in that way, I wonder would Deputy O'Malley not press those four amendments?</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) of this section contains the phrase &ldquo;a right or power referred to in <i>subsection</i> (<i>1</i>) ... or referred to in the Agreement as being vested in the Minister&rdquo;.  It is very hard to pass into law some provision about the exercise of powers and rights that are given to a Minister or to anybody else by being referred to in an agreement if one has not seen the agreement.  The powers may well be perfectly proper and legitimate powers, or they may not.  The particular concern I have in relation to the Minister's powers in this matter is that his powers appear from what we have discovered about the agreement, not to be the ordinary powers that somebody buying shares in a company in the ordinary way would have.  They seem to be less than the ordinary level of powers that the shareholder would have.  The shares do not all have equal voting rights.  They may be unequal in relation to other rights as well.  They may not, for some reason or another, rank <i>pari passu</i> in regard to dividends. However, we do know they are unequal in regard to voting rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is particularly disturbing is that the less than equal shares, the shares with the smaller or diminished rights, are the taxpayer's shares, not the shares of the four gentlemen and Reps.  Wright deceased.  The public's shares are the unequal ones, the ones with less rights than everybody else's. So much less are they that even if the State block of 49 per cent could pick up, as a result of discussion or this agreement or something else, the support  <Col N="74" /> of the 10 per cent Wright block, that 59 per cent block, which is predominantly the public block, would still be outvoted by the 41 per cent block.  I refer to this because this is one of the rights or powers referred to in the agreement as being vested in the Minister.  I just happen to know that non-equality of shares is one of the provisions of the agreement.  How many more are there, for all we know, which are as bad as that?  I hope there is nothing worse than that, but it is quite conceivable that there are provisions as bad as that.  Even if they were only half as onerous from the State's point of view they would be very undesirable.</P>
    <P>Why are we not let know about such things?  Why can we not be given the agreement so that we may see what the Minister's rights are in the agreement? While this section is not one of any consequence so far as the root of the matter is concerned, it does, like virtually every other section of the Bill, contain reference to the rights or powers referred to in the agreement as being vested in the Minister.  Can the public or I or anybody else be blamed for becoming increasingly suspicious?  We do know of one very onerous provision in it.  There may be others.  One suspects that there are. Should the Minister not be seriously concerned that he has got himself into a situation where he is in a permanent minority?  Even if he got a majority of the shareholders to come with him, he would still be outvoted all along the line until perhaps this mine was an empty hole in the ground or up to the stage that it never went into production at all.</P>
    <P>It seems to me extraordinary that, first of all, the State should have accepted a minority situation in a private company when a minority situation in a private company is worth very little.  If that is extraordinary, it is incredible altogether that, having got into a minority situation, further to copperfasten the permanence and powerlessness of this minority situation the State is now agreeing to special powers and provisions in this agreement whereby even if it were by chance or purchase or otherwise to acquire <Col N="75" /> a majority shareholding it would still in fact be a minority so far as the exercise of any powers is concerned. I understand the only means under the agreement whereby the State could get an effective majority would be if the Roche-Wymes-Wood bloc broke up and the effective control of that shifted from those men or from their families or nominees.  It is only in that unlikely eventuality that the State would be entitled to purchase at least 2 per cent of the shares which would give it a 51 per cent holding.  That 51 per cent would then take precedence over the 39 per cent or whatever would be left in the Roche-Wymes-Wood bloc.  The object presumably of that was to ensure that the four vendors, notwithstanding getting, with Reps.  Wright, the £9,500,000, would still retain permanent control, even though the Minister has more shares than they have, and significantly more; he has 49 per cent and they have 41 per cent.</P>
    <P>This House should not pass this section&mdash;even though it is an innocuous section in itself&mdash;while it contains that phrase &ldquo;a right or power ... referred to in the Agreement as being vested in the Minister&rdquo;, until we know what the rights or powers referred to in the agreement as being vested in the Minister are.  We should know everything that is in that agreement.  Every day that passes makes it only clearer to the public at large that there is something fishy about all this if we cannot see the agreement signed in these circumstances, where clearly there is no question of commercial damage being done or of where commercial considerations apply.  As I pointed out in the debate on the last section, Bula Limited appear to be, unhappily, a particularly sensitive sort of company. Before we reached this question of the terms of the agreement at all we saw that, through what was undoubtedly an inadvertence on their part, they had failed during a period of several years to file the annual returns that the general law of the land required them and each of the other 58,000 or so companies to file each year.  The vast majority of companies comply with the law in this respect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> Curiously, however, Bula failed to make the returns.  This only adds to the aura of secretiveness that has grown in relation to the company in recent times.  Perhaps in this regard Bula are being less than fair to themselves. But because we have this situation, in which apparently the law has not been complied with in several respects in so far as the giving of information is concerned, there is the increased danger of their not complying with some of the provisions in this secret agreement.</P>
    <P>In speaking of Bula not complying with the law I am not thinking in terms of some kind of vague civil obligation or right as between one citizen or group of citizens and another.  I am not thinking of, for instance, a breach of contract where one person who might be damaged would have some right to damages. What we are talking of is essentially a matter pertaining to the criminal law. There are hundreds of prosecutions brought every year in the District Court by the registrar of companies. Some of these companies who do not comply with the law are fined fairly hefty sums, the maximum, I think, being £100 in respect of the company and £100 in respect of each officer involved in the default.  But because of this background of secretiveness it is essential on this section, as on most of the others, where there are references to the powers, rights and duties that exist under the agreement, that we should know what these are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of questions arising out of this section which I should like to put to the Minister. These refer to the rights and powers of the holder of shares in this company.  First, can the Minister say whether, on the assumption that the State holds 49 per cent of the shares, the State would get 49 per cent of any dividend?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, what can the Minister do in the event of his not being satisfied that the company are proceeding satisfactorily with the development of the mine?  What powers has he got in such circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="77" />
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We are resuming a trend of the debate which we have been through a number of times and which I shall not pursue now at any great length.  However, in regard to the Deputy's question, the powers I have are the normal powers legally inherent in the situation where the State or a private citizen or any other is an investor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it from that that the agreement referred to in this section does not contain provisions which would give the Minister any special power?  I say this because the Minister has said that in the circumstances I outlined he would have the normal powers of an investor.  I am not trying to trap the Minister but am merely endeavouring to find out exactly what he has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said previously that it is not my intention to go into the agreement in answer to piece-meal questions.  That may be a situation which the Deputy does not like but it is the position I have taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  But the Minister has just said that in circumstances in which he would be dissatisfied with the development of the mine the powers he would have would be the normal powers of an investor of that amount of money and in relation to the number of shares involved. I trust I am not misrepresenting him but that is what I understood from his answer.  If this is so it would seem to follow that he has no special powers in the agreement referred to in the section, powers that would enable him to take action if he were dissatisfied with the development of the mine.  The question arises, then, as to how the Minister can reconcile the normal powers he would have as a holder of 49 per cent of the shares with the statement he made previously to the effect that as a result of this deal he can control the development of the mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We are coming round again to the matter of the agreement but I can refer to what was said during the Second Reading in regard to the <Col N="78" /> question of the destination of the ore, of the rate of exploitation and of the diversion of the Blackwater&mdash;three crucial matters&mdash;in respect of which special arrangements have been made. This is knowledge that the Deputy possesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I do not find that reply very satisfactory but I have no intention of going on about it.  I merely wish to endeavour to establish as much information as possible. If the information being given by the Minister is inadequate or unsatisfactory, he in due course will have to accept responsibility for that.  I have given him the opportunity of giving the information, but if he chooses to withhold it he must take the consequences.</P>
      <P>There is another matter about which I should like to ask him.  It is in relation to subsection (2) of section 3 and refers to &ldquo;any matter which affects a function or responsibility of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  I wonder in this context if the Minister could give us one or two examples of what might be covered by that phrase.  I am thinking in terms of the powers being exercised in relation to the shareholding. What kind of powers in this regard would the Minister envisage would constitute a function or responsibility of the Minister for Finance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this is a general provision which was proposed by the Department of Finance. I cannot be more specific than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

That does not mean that we should abdicate our function entirely and pass sections saying that we do not really know what they mean, that the draftsman put it in or the Department of Finance wanted it.  I am concerned by the Minister's reaction to this question.  It is not very reassuring.</P>

      <P>The Minister when questioned by Deputy Colley on specific points arising out of the agreement smiles and indicates that it is not his intention to fall for a line of questioning that will extract more information from him on this agreement. The information given to date is the minimum.  We have cleared up all aspects related to this section with the exception of the agreement.  The Minister will not reply to any provocative questions relating to it.  Since we dealt with this agreement on section 1 and reached it here in section 3 we have had contributions from Deputy O'Malley and from Deputy Colley in which questions relating to the agreement have been left hanging in the balance.  Because of this protection of the power referred to in the agreement, it is difficult for us to accept section 3.</P>
      <P>Since we finished our debate on the agreement in section 1 the information was conveyed to the House by Deputy O'Malley that Bula, as a company, have not fulfilled their obligations under the Companies Act, 1963, in regard to the submission of reports.  The Minister is not yet in a position to confirm that.  We have a situation here where we are dealing with an agreement between the Minister and a company that may be in breach of a State Act.  We have had a trend in this debate over the last two weeks whereby the Minister is more than honest in conveying that the volume of time he can spend within his own Department dealing with facts and factual replies to queries can be limited and that he is not a walking encyclopaedia, despite the impression given three years ago that he was close to it.  We are coming to the stage where the Minister is conveying to us that, if this whole arrangement blows sky high and if the agreement does not measure up to his expectations, there will be a stack of escape clauses in the Minister's favour, so that all the blame will rest on the officials and expert advisers who contributed to the drawing up of this agreement and to the preparation of the file from which the Minister extracts his answers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Down through the years it has been <Col N="80" /> recognised that the buck always stopped at the Minister's desk.  The attitude taken by the Minister in relation to this Bill is working extremely hard at passing the buck, for fear that his expectations do not meet the hoped for fruition.  When Deputy O'Malley was going out of his way last week to point out that any blame in this regard should be attached to the Minister, the Minister said that we were being extremely hard and unfair to the people concerned in Bula, the individuals who cannot be here to defend themselves.  The Minister said that they had committed no crime, as if the impression was being created by the Opposition that a crime had been committed.</P>

      <P>One of the reasons for skipping over it was that Bula, who are 50 per cent responsible for this agreement, have not complied with the regulations under the Companies Act, and the responsibility for seeing that those regulations are complied with lies with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister mentioned the other day that they had committed no crime, and this is what I am referring to.  The situation is that, if the company as such have not complied with the regulations under the Companies Act, then they are in breach of the regulations.  It is difficult to understand why the Minister who, as Deputy O'Malley has pointed out, has been the Minister who deals with prosecutions taken against companies who have not complied with those regulations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Ceann Comhairle draws my attention to the fact that there is a certain amount of repetition in relation to this matter but it arises from, again, the reference to the agreement. The stage has now been reached when the Minister should be more open than he was when dealing on the First Stage of this Bill with the contents of that agreement.  One of the things that worries me in this regard is that the <Col N="82" /> Minister has been acting so smugly in relation to his 49 per cent.  I would like to ask him if under the agreement there is a situation where he can eventually see his way to being able to move into a majority shareholding position.  I suppose he is not willing to reply to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the section as such but it does seem a pity that there is this reference to these powers, duties, rights and all the rest of it in the agreement and we are still not given any information in relation to them.  Does the Minister realise the harm he is doing to the whole operation he is trying to put through by this constant silence and refusal to give information?  This appears now to extend not just to the secret provisions of this agreement but even to the necessity to comply with the ordinary law.  We posed questions that the Minister does not know the answer to.  It is a situation that has few, if any, parallels in the history of this House.  We had to take the unusual step of adjourning an entire section until the rest of the Committee Stage was over to try to get information. One wonders if the refusal to give information is due to this alleged necessity for confidentiality or to some other reason such as lack of knowledge. One is entitled to ask whether it is due to an anxiety not to disclose certain matters which the Minister knows would cause the House and the public at large to be even more critical of this behind-the-scenes deal than they already are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no wish to oppose the section because the section as such, apart from this one reference in it, is innocuous. There is no matter of principle involved.  At the same time one is not at all happy at the continued refusal of the Minister to give information, not secret, confidential, commercial information as he was trying to allege at the start, but information which the law of this land compels every citizen to provide within 15 days and which now, three years later, has not been provided.  It is only when it was pointed out to him that the law obliges it to be given that he agreed to put back the section to the end so that he could <Col N="83" /> try to get the information in his Department.</P>
    <P>The Chair will recall Deputy Colley, Deputy Lalor, Deputy Barrett and myself seeking information of this kind on section 1 and on a number of the amendments in section 2 and being told it was secret and confidential. One of the things we wanted was the capital structure of the company, how they stood, what they had, and what they owed.  We were told it was very unfair to pick out this little company and not make the same inquiries in relation to thousands of other companies in the country.  There are about 58,000 companies registered in this country and the great majority of them comply with the law.  Some of them do not.  The taxpayer has been unfortunate that the Minister has chosen to do his deal with the directors and shareholders of one of the companies who do not comply with the law and whose failure to comply with the law has resulted in information not being forthcoming which not only this House was entitled to.  It is information which every citizen is entitled to even if there were no Bula Limited (Acquisition of Shares) Bill, 1977.  I or any citizen of the country would be entitled to go to the Companies Office in Dublin Castle and get this information on the payment of 5p or 10p, that is assuming that the information was there.  It is not there.</P>
    <P>The Minister's earlier claims of commercial confidentiality have now been truly and vividly shown up for what they are.  I have always suspected that they were what they are, but now it is proved beyond doubt.  It makes one think how valid was the Minister's refusal to give information in other instances.  What he refused here to give was something which according to the ordinary law of the land must be given, and he refused because it would be commercially confidential.</P>
    <P>It is unsatisfactory, therefore, that we should be in this position now and that this bogus secrecy should continue. What is the reason for it?  We are entitled to ask that.  The whole country is asking and is entitled to an answer <Col N="84" /> and if that answer is not forthcoming I venture to think a lot of the country will give an answer at an early opportunity.</P>

      <P>In page 3, subsection (3), line 13, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;with the approval of Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>After: &ldquo;The Minister for Finance may, after consultation with the Minister&rdquo; we want to insert &ldquo;with the approval of Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.  The subsection goes on to read: &ldquo;and subject to the Agreement, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of the Company held by him under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="85" /> This is the subsection which allows the Minister for Finance, with the agreement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to sell the shares.  In the light of all we now know about this whole transaction, and in the light of the fact that over £9½ million of the taxpayers money is being paid to four individuals for their own private use and benefit, and that not one penny is being invested in the company, and that a permanent minority holding is being acquired which it is virtually impossible to convert into a majority holding, and that there is an enormous aura of secrecy and fear, apparently, on the part of those involved in this agreement about disclosing anything other than those things they have inadvertently or otherwise disclosed already, or that have been discovered by various people from time to time, is it not important that Dáil Éireann, as well as having to pass the money for the buying of the shares and agree to the Minister buying them, in these circumstances, should equally have to agree to the Minister selling them and the terms on which he sells them, and the circumstances in which he sells them?</P>
    <P>For example, on selling the shares he could put himself and the State in the position that there would be no way of ensuring that this company ever attempted to go into production, or attempted to do so within a reasonable time.  Since such a large amount of public money is involved, it is only reasonable that the selling of the shares, just as much as the purchasing of the shares, should have the approval of the Dáil as being the popularly elected assembly and the one primarily concerned with financial matters.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that, if the Minister feels it necessary to come to the Dáil to get power to buy the shares, he should also have to get the approval of the Dáil for the sale of them.  There is not an enormous difference.  There could be a sale by the Minister in a few years time at a huge loss.  If the company are refused planning permission, which is by no means impossible, or if they are granted planning permission subject to extremely onerous conditions, for example, subject to <Col N="86" /> the condition that they cannot engage in open cast mining, the value of the company and, accordingly, of the shares the Minister for Finance would hold at that stage, one would assume would be very seriously reduced.</P>
    <P>Some future Minister who might disapprove of this whole sorry attempt on the part of the present Minister to enter into a field where he is patently unfit, the commercial mining field, might think the whole thing was a total mess and might try to do some better deal on behalf of the State, and God knows it would not be hard to do a better deal.  Alternatively he might decide the State had lost enough and he wanted to cut the taxpayers' loss and he wanted to sell.  I do not think he should be allowed to do that privately.  Even though he has not got much example from the Minister in the sense that no information, or the very minimum of information is being given in relation to the purchase of the shares, that should not be taken as a precedent that no information should be given to Dáil Éireann at the time when the shares were being sold.</P>
    <P>For that reason it is not just important but, indeed, vital that the approval of the House would be forthcoming at such time as the Minister for Finance, in consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, should sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of shares in the company. The most important phrase in the subsection is the phrase &ldquo;and subject to the Agreement ...&rdquo;  He has not got an unfettered right to sell, quite obviously.  He can only sell subject to the agreement.  Presumably the agreement stops him selling at a particular time.  Why should that be so?</P>

      <P>It is all right to be bound by the Companies Act.  I have <Col N="87" /> no objection to that.  I have an objection to being bound by the terms of a secret agreement.  I am not suggesting the Minister or any other citizen should not be bound by the Companies Act. Unfortunately, some citizens see fit not to abide by its terms.  That is beside the point.  What is disturbing is that it is not just the terms of the Companies Act or the public law of the land which bind the Minister and his associates, or fail to bind them as the case may be, but in addition to the law of the land the Minister and the taxpayers will also be bound by the terms of a secret agreement.  That I object to.</P>
      <P>If it is proposed to sell these shares at some future date, either for the same amount or for less, or for more, Dáil Éireann should be informed of the fact and should have to give its approval to any such proposed transaction. I hope the Minister will accept this amendment which is perfectly reasonable.  It should be made.  I can see no valid reason for not accepting it.  I hope we do not get another dose of secrecy to the effect that it would be commercially disadvantageous.  We are on anti-secrecy pills for a long time now trying to stop getting sick about that one.  If we have to have some excuse I hope it will not be the secrecy jazz.  We blew that once and for all when we showed the company have become so secretive that they will not even observe the ordinary law of the land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the answer to that but, after all, this is February, 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to amendment No. 11 we have a practice that has gone on through the life of the State, one administration after another, and it has not been the practice to make the disposal of shares by the Minister for Finance subject to the approval of the Dáil.  It is a long continuing general rule that when property of any kind &mdash;there are many kinds obviously that would come into this category&mdash;has been acquired from the expenditure of funds voted by the Oireachtas, the management and ultimately the disposal of this property becomes a function of the Executive.  There is that division of function between legislator and Executive.  The appropriate Ministers are of course accountable to the Oireachtas for their management of the State's property and there are long established procedures for carrying out that accountability duty and function. I regret that I cannot accept the amendment. It would mean a fundamental <Col N="89" /> departure from what has been the accepted and unquestioned practice whatever administration was in office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would seem to be quoting precedent in defence of the non-acceptance of this amendment from Deputy O'Malley and he talks of the long-established practice whereby the Minister accepts responsibility. Peculiarly that is what I was thinking of when I spoke on the previous section&mdash;the brilliant way that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce succeeds in passing on responsibility to his trained staff when he does not want to accept that he has knowledge, that he has the answers to reply to questions.  There is also a long-term tradition in this State that when public property or any Governmental property is being disposed of, Land Commission or Board of Works property or Garda cars, anything held in ownership under any Department for which the appropriate Minister is responsible it cannot basically be sold privately.  If one thought over this long enough perhaps one could think of exceptions, but this is a tradition that has been built up and it is a good one because it kills the idea of certain buyers getting preferential treatment. Everything has to go either to public auction or public tender.  In this case the Minister objects to an amendment which would mean that shares could not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of without referring back to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can appreciate the Minister's objection to this in relation to what one might call the normal dabbling in shares.  Deputy Esmonde would remind me that we are dealing with a private company and private companies are not over responsible in dabbling in shares.  This is one of the most brilliant dabbles in the business&mdash;£½ million turned into £100 million.  As I see it, the amendment does not visualise the type of arrangement where the Minister for Finance in consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce would be thinking of selling 5 per cent of the 49 per cent share.  I do not think they would think in those terms.  What worries me&mdash;it worries me in the unlikely event of both Ministers <Col N="90" /> holding the same portfolios following the next election&mdash;is the fear that the Minister has succeeded in doing a deal with Tara.  Deputy O'Malley and others on this side have been attacked not by the Minister but by a Labour Party spokesman who contributed earlier to this debate.  He talked or suggested&mdash;I think he went as far as to say openly that the battle on this side was being sponsored by Tara.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was Sir John himself who said it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what is worrying me in regard to Deputy O'Malley's amendment, that there might be another agreement that is not referred to in this Bill under which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has promised in return for his 25 per cent share in Tara that he will do a deal with the transfer of the 24 per cent that we are buying.  In his Second Reading speech, which I agree can sound reasonable, plausible and laudable, he indicated that he had made efforts to bring the two sides together and that the development of the lead and zinc body in Navan could be most advantageously developed by the linking of both firms so that the development could take place as one complete development.  Because of my feeling in this regard, if my suspicions here were to be realised, if there were any foundation for it and that the two opposing factions&mdash;I have no reason to try to choose another form of words in this regard&mdash;could be brought together, it could arise from the Minister for Finance in conjunction with the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the section selling transferring or otherwise disposing of the 49 per cent shares to Tara for a consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that were to occur, depending on what might be in the secret agreement, it might not be the worst thing.  In the interests of the public who have to pay the £9.54 million we are talking about, a decision by the Minister for Finance in consultation with the Minister for Local Government might not be the wisest decision that could be made at that time.  A decision on those <Col N="91" /> lines should be brought back to Dáil Éireann for approval.  If the two gentlemen concerned at present were still here at that stage and holding the same positions, I presume they would have the backing of the required number of feet to put it through.  This would ensure that the matter would have a public airing.  At that stage I would not begrudge him the opportunity of coming back to this House and taking full credit for the 900 per cent profit he would have made on behalf of the people when he is seeking sanction from Dáil Éireann to sell his share in Bula to Tara for £95 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Tara are not stupid enough to buy a minority interest in a private company.  They have their heads screwed on the right way like any normal citizen or company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  For a long <Col N="92" /> time I gave credit to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for the fact that he would not be stupid enough to pay £9.54 million for 24 per cent of a property when he was advised it was valued at £7.5 million, but we will not go into that.  If the Minister were to try to justify opposing this proposal it would be because he would have to come to Dáil Éireann for approval every time he wanted to sell and that would be a terrible situation. I do not think he is involved in that kind of deal.</P>
      <P>Under section 4 (3) he appears to be seeking power to dispose of the shares he is buying here.  If he proposes to dispose of them at some stage <i>in toto</i>, which is visualised here, the least the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the day could do is to come back to the Dáil and get approval for the sale.  I do not think that is asking too much.</P>

      <P>The longer this goes on the more co-operative the Minister becomes.  I do not think we have wasted any time as we have had five amendments accepted today.  I invite the Minister to peruse the terms of subsection (3) of this section, as amended, which now states:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance may, after consultation with the Minister, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of the Company held by him under this Act.</P>
      <P>The only shares he is acquiring under the Bill are those he is paying for because section 2 (1) says:</P>
      <P>The Minister may acquire shares of the Company in accordance with the Agreement.</P>
      <P>That was amended to read: &ldquo;not less than 49 per cent&rdquo;.  The subsection further states:</P>
      <P>And for that purpose may expend sums not exceeding in the aggregate £9,540,000.</P>
      <P>The Minister is acquiring the 24 per cent by the expenditure of £9.54 million.  He is getting the 25 per cent free not under the Bill but maybe under the agreement of December, 1975, or some other agreement.  Section 4 (3) only allows the Minister to dispose of shares held by him under this Act.  He could be in the position that he could sell the 24 per cent but he cannot get rid of the 25 per cent.

      <P>I made my point and I was told it was frivolous, that it was not serious.  I was a little taken aback by being told that because I doubt if my contributions on this Bill could be described as frivolous, whatever way one might describe them. The Minister for Finance may dispose of any shares of the company held by him under this Act.  The Minister under this Act is buying shares.  We know that he is getting a free gift of other shares.  He is getting them presumably under the agreement of 12th December, 1975.  He is not getting them under this Bill.</P>
      <P>The question of free shares in this company or in any other one is not referred to here.  It seems to me that the free shares are not included in the disposal subsection, subsection (3).  We are entitled to ask if there is any provision in the agreement relating to the sale of the shares or is the Minister entitled to sell, wherever he can, in the normal way subject only to the provisions of the Companies Act, 1963, or are there any limitations on his power to sell or his right to sell contained in the agreement?</P>

The 90th day after that would be approximately the 8th or 9th February, 1977, which date has now well passed.  In the light of that was there not a payment made on that date, partial or otherwise?</P>

      <P>Would the rate of interest that would normally be payable where a purchaser fails to complete his purchase on a certain date not be a penal or quasi-penal rate?  Is the Minister aware that it is not infrequent in agreements of this kind to provide for a rate of interest somewhere in the region of not less than 15 per cent and not more than 19 per cent? Is it the position that the State is incurring interest liability of that nature or, perhaps, less or more, depending on whatever the arrangement is?</P>

      <P>When opening the debate on the Second Stage the Minister told us that the money was payable in instalments, 50 per cent in 90 days, 25 per cent within one year and the remaining 25 per cent within two years. I was given to understand that earlier the Minister was very anxious to get this Bill through in the week Second Stage was introduced.  Second Stage was introduced on 1st February and we were given the impression that it had to be through both Houses of the Oireachtas at an early date in order to make the payment provided for in the Estimates within 90 days of the arbitration award.  My fear is that during the general election campaign the Minister for Industry and Commerce will stand up in Thurles and maintain that he got a good deal in buying the 49 per cent share of Bula for £9.54 million and telling the people that he had to pay another £500,000 interest because he was held up by Fianna Fáil.  The Minister has refused to disclose the information <Col N="98" /> which has nothing to do with the commercial activity of Bula.  Surely, in any agreement like this there must be some type of penal clause and the Minister should be more open in relation to it, if it exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the necessity for meeting these payments by the 90th day after the arbitration award, I recall that at 11.45 a.m. on Saturday 29th January, 1977, I received a telephone call in Limerick from the private secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He told me that a Bill relating to Bula had been passed by the Government, that a copy of it would be posted to me that night, that I would have it, hopefully, on Monday morning, 31st January, and that the Minister was very anxious that I agree to take it on Tuesday, 1st February.  He said the Minister was anxious that I let the Bill go through all Stages very quickly as it had to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and signed by the President before Wednesday, 9th February. He said there was a strict obligation to have it in law at that time so that payments due could be made.</P>
      <P>I told the private secretary that it was not my fault if the Minister let it go so late in the day to introduce such a Bill and expect that a Bill like this be taken at 24 hours' notice. I told him I had no intention of doing that.  The Minister's private secretary seemed to be very concerned that the Bill be passed by both Houses before 9th February and I understand a similar plea was conveyed to our Chief Whip, Deputy Lalor, by the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Kelly. Deputy Lalor, in the course of a telephone conversation, told me that the Government wanted the Bill passed in a matter of days and asked if I was agreeable.  I told him I was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seemed, from the agitated state of mind of the Minister's private secretary and of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, that there was a heavy onus or obligation to have this Bill passed by 9th February.  That date has been passed and the state of agitation seems to have diminished considerably, with benefit all round. It no longer appears to be a matter <Col N="99" /> of great concern.  I would be surprised if an agreement of this kind did not contain a provision whereby interest was payable.  I have been involved in a lot of transactions as a solicitor and I am aware that if a closing date is fixed there is always provision in the agreement that if the purchaser does not complete by the closing date he pays interest.  In the old days it was 5 or 6 per cent but in Coalition times the figure is usually 17, 18 and even 19 per cent.  Interest at 17 or 18 per cent per annum on this kind of money would be very substantial. The Minister has not denied there is such a provision and he cannot prevent some of us drawing the conclusion that it exists.  He cannot prevent an objective observer from coming to that conclusion.</P>
    <P>During the Second Stage debate the Minister disclosed parts of the agreement in order to prove that I was marginally wrong in some of my observations.  I told him he was being selective and I said he was not right to pick out bits and pieces to prove that I was marginally wrong.  Because he was selective at that time he cannot afford to be so on Committee Stage.  His set of standards in this respect may be different from those of other people and he may decide that selective disclosures on Second Stage may not apply on Committee Stage because it may be inappropriate. I do not think most people would look at it in that way and, therefore, we are forced to the conclusion that there is a penal interest clause in the agreement&mdash;that the State may be incurring substantial further liabilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give an undertaking to Deputy Lalor that I will not claim that the Opposition forced me or the Government into the position of paying interest.  My legal advice is that there is no interest payable.</P>

      <P>There is a second point arising out of what the Minister said. He told us he was not prepared to disclose limitations other than the memorandum and articles of association because they were contained in the agreement and, in pursuance of the policy he is partially adopting, he is not disclosing these.  If there are limitations in the agreement in regard to the disposal of shares, how was the Minister able to accept Deputy O'Malley's amendment in regard to deleting the words &ldquo;subject to the agreement&rdquo; because, if such limitations exist, that is presumably why the phrase was in, but the Minister has accepted an amendment to delete these words?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I was advised that it was perfectly proper to accept the amendment and there was no difficulty about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will see that a certain problem arises which requires some explanation other than the Minister was so advised.  He has now told us the agreement contains limitations on the right of a shareholder to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of shares in the company. Therefore, on the face of it, the words &ldquo;subject to the agreement&rdquo; are necessary and were put in for that specific purpose.  It is not sufficient, I would suggest, simply to say that the Minister was advised he could drop these words because, if such limitations exist in the agreement, then the words the Minister has agreed to drop are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are limitations at all, they are limitations over and above what might be called the normal ones to which we have referred in the memorandum and articles of association and they are limitations arising out of the agreement.  I have no doubt that that is why the draftsman put in the phrase &ldquo;and subject to the agreement&rdquo;. May I say that, when the Minister agreed to accept that amendment, the clear implication as far as I was concerned was that, whatever else was in the agreement, there was no limitation on the right to dispose of the shares until the Minister told us there was in fact such limitation?  It seems to me on the face of it there is an inconsistency here which requires an explanation.</P>

I think it will be understood that when mention is made here of a member of my staff it is only proper that I should clarify the situation.  I want to make reference, therefore, to what Deputy O'Malley said about telephone calls from my private secretary in connection with the bringing forward of this Bill.  My private secretary spoke to Deputy O'Malley on Saturday, 22nd January, and asked him if he would be prepared to take the Bill on Wednesday, 22nd January.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I should have said Saturday, 22nd January, and Wednesday, 26th January.  Deputy O'Malley said he would be prepared to take it the following week, 1st February.  Now I am informed that, when there was a matter of 24 hours notice to take the Bill on 1st February, Deputy O'Malley had, in fact, been spoken to on Saturday, 29th January, but I am informed also that there was no question&mdash;indeed, I said this to <Col N="104" /> Deputy O'Malley a few minutes ago&mdash; of taking all Stages on 26th January. I understand my private secretary asked merely that the Second Stage would be started.  Deputy Lalor said&mdash; this is to clarify the record; Deputy Lalor is the Chief Whip&mdash;that he was agreeable, as Whip, that the Bill would be taken on 26th if Deputy O'Malley agreed.  I simply say this not to make the matter contentious, but simply for purposes of clarification.  It need not be a contentious matter, but it is only fair to say that we did not in fact, expect all stages.  Deputy Lalor was prepared to agree to the Second Stage conditional on Deputy O'Malley being willing and on Saturday, 22nd January, Deputy O'Malley was asked if he would take the Bill on Wednesday, 26th January.  That I think is more in the nature of a warning and more in line with proper practice than might have been suggested from the record in regard to what Deputy O'Malley said.</P>

They made their case strongly and it seemed a reasonable one.  However, on that occasion the then Minister was very emphatic that the decision with regard to the closure of the line was solely a matter for the board of CIE and he would not intervene in any way to ensure that the line would be kept open.  This was his attitude to the deputations and to this House and the service in question was discontinued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Rosslare/ Limerick Junction railway service, we know that the board of CIE decided in late 1976 to close this line.  The only matter outstanding was the time of closure.  We are not just speculating when we say that.  I was informed of this by a high ranking executive of CIE.  It was only a matter of time until the line would be closed.  The outstanding <Col N="106" /> question then was the necessity to reach some form of agreement with the commuters of west Waterford and south Wexford, an agreement that would be acceptable to them as an alternative to the present service.  If such an agreement could be arrived at, CIE were of the opinion that there was nothing in the way of closing the line to Limerick Junction.</P>
    <P>At that time CIE were not concerned about the haulage of beet from south Wexford to Thurles.  After about six weeks, on 21st January, 1977, the present Minister for Transport and Power at a meeting in the constituency of North Tipperary&mdash;an area that will be badly affected by the closure and, incidentally, one that might be regarded as a marginal constituency &mdash;issued a statement as follows:</P>
    <P>No final decision has been taken to close down the Rosslare/Waterford line and no such decision will be taken until the problems have been fully considered and until a satisfactory method of transport in the area has been provided.  It follows, therefore, that there is no question of closing down this rail line in the immediate future, as has been suggested.  Indeed, it is obvious that it cannot and will not be closed down for some considerable time, if at all, and certainly, as I have said, not until a suitable alternative transport service is provided.</P>
    <P>I trust that what I have said will put an end to the speculation and will allay the genuine fears concerning the proposed closure.</P>
    <P>It cannot be denied that there is a serious conflict of approach between the attitude of the present Minister for Transport and Power and that of his predecessor concerning the role of the Minister with regard to a decision of the board of CIE.  The people of east Galway, Mayo and parts of Clare were affected by the closure of the western line which we debated in this House two years ago.  What will they think of the conflicting attitudes of the two Ministers in a period of less than two years?  They are entitled to believe they were abandoned by the then Minister who would not intervene in a decision taken by CIE on that <Col N="107" /> occasion.  They are entitled to feel hurt and abandoned by the Government and the then Minister because of his approach and his definite attitude with regard to intervening in decisions of the CIE board, especially when they make a comparison with the attitude of the present Minister.</P>
    <P>On this occasion the people of south Wexford, Waterford, Kilkenny and Tipperary are entitled to have some doubts with regard to the statement made by the Minister for Transport and Power, particularly when he says:</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is obvious that it cannot and will not be closed down for some considerable time, if at all, and certainly, as I have said, not until a suitable alternative transport service is provided.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly there are ifs and buts in that statement.  My reading of it, and this is shared by many others, is that it is only a temporary deferring of a decision already taken by the board of CIE at the end of 1976.  None of the interests concerned, with the exception of CIE, believes that a suitable alternative transport service can be provided.  This was debated extensively in a recent RTE programme and it was obvious to everyone that CIE could not provide an acceptable alternative service.  They attempted to explain what they had in mind but they were very much alone in believing that it would be acceptable.</P>
    <P>There has been a gradual run down in this service in the past two years or even longer.  This kind of approach by CIE has become quite common before they announce the closure of a line. When we were debating in this House the closure of the passenger services on the western line we were told they were uneconomic but until we pointed it out, nobody mentioned the fact that CIE had been running down the services for some years.  They succeeded in their action on that occasion by operating express bus services running parallel with the line in question.  They did this for some years before they announced the closure; in other words, the bus service was in direct competition with the rail passenger service <Col N="108" /> which we were attempting to keep in operation and which the people of the area wanted to keep in operation.  The same thing seems to have happened on this occasion.  There has been a run down in the service in the past two years and now they have announced the closure of the line.</P>
    <P>Last year all freight traffic, with the exception of beet and pulp products, ceased on this line.  We should remember that 40 per cent of the total intake of beet at the Thurles sugar factory is grown in the south Wexford area, which has a long tradition of beet growing and compares favourably with other beet growing areas.  The people in the south Wexford area will be affected by this decision as well as the people of Thurles.  The closure would undoubtedly be serious for south Wexford and the Thurles sugar factory, particularly in regard to employment in the Thurles area.  At present we are supposed to be striving to create more employment but we should not forget that we must also strive to maintain employment.</P>
    <P>The Government do not seem to be able to relieve the unemployment problem. The Thurles sugar factory is the main industry in the area and the closure of the line would mean that the factory would be denied 40 per cent of its raw material.  The only alternative for the south Wexford beet growers would be to transfer their produce to the Carlow factory which is not much closer to them than the Thurles factory. However, the Carlow factory has not the capacity to receive the beet from south Wexford.  In order to cater for the extra intake of beet, Carlow factory would need an injection of cash and it would not be appropriate for the Irish Sugar Company to inject capital into it at this time.  Prolonging the usual beet campaign to facilitate the extra tonnage from Wexford is out of the question because the beet crop would not survive a longer campaign.</P>
    <P>Any action along these lines in regard to Carlow would mean that the volume of beet entering the Thurles factory would be reduced to 60 per cent.  This would mean that the existence of the Thurles factory would be in jeopardy.  It would also mean the <Col N="109" /> loss of 50 to 60 days in the annual beet campaign, a loss of work in the area and the loss of £600,000 in direct wages to the people who work in the Thurles factory.  In turn, this would mean a serious loss to Thurles town and the surrounding area because the money would no longer be in circulation. It would undoubtedly mean the downgrading or the closure of the Thurles sugar factory and its associated industries.  The fulltime labour force at the Thurles sugar factory and the Killough lime quarry is approximately 330.  This is a large number of permanent employees in a provincial town such as Thurles.  During the campaign the part-time workers number 220 and they do seven days shift work and earn good money.  This would be a further serious loss for the area.</P>
    <P>The total value of beet paid for by the Thurles sugar factory is £6.7 million.  A loss of 40 per cent would mean a drop in beet payments to approximately £4 million.  CIE's reason for closing the line is their loss of £130,000 in operating it last year.  I fail to see how any Government could justify or condone such a closure. The figure of £130,000 seems a small amount for CIE to carry when compared with the possible job losses and the loss of cash flow into the Thurles area.  CIE's proposed alternative transport could mean further losses for them because it would mean changing from rail to road haulage.  The diesel oil used in road haulage would be in the region of 180,000 gallons.  At present the rail system is using 50,000 gallons of diesel.  This should surely be regarded as a serious loss for CIE. At present the national oil bill is more than £600 million.  Before the oil crisis in 1973 our oil bill was £35 million. Here we have a semi-State body which is proposing to use a great deal more oil, from 50,000 gallons of diesel to 180,000 gallons, and their only reason for this is that they claim they lost £130,000 last year by operating the rail system as against the road haulage system which they propose.</P>
    <P>The alternative arrangements would also mean 90 articulated lorries to haul the same amount of beet as against <Col N="110" /> 150-odd rail wagons under the present arrangements.  One must ask how can the road system in this area or in most other areas bear up under this further heavy haulage traffic of 90 articulated lorries to haul the beet from south Wexford to Thurles.  Those of us who use the roads every week appreciate the hazards which an increasing number of articulated trucks create even on the main road, say from Dublin to Limerick, where there are dual carriageways in a few places only. Now CIE propose to increase that traffic further on a road system which is not fit to carry it.</P>
    <P>Any reasonable person must surely agree that the only answer to this question is to continue to utilise our rail system despite this what I describe as a minimal loss of £130,000, minimal again by comparison with the total subsidy of around £32 million which this House provided out of State funds in the last 12 months for CIE.  We are now asking that this House should be united in telling CIE that this service must not be withdrawn, and I have in mind particularly the Deputies on the other side of the House who have already made public statements in regard to the proposed closure of this line.  They must surely decide where they stand.  Some of them have stated in the press that they are completely opposed to any closure or interference with this line.  Deputy John Ryan of North Tipperary is reported as telling his constituents that the proposed closure of this line was selfish, unpatriotic, inward and detrimental to the well-being of the beet growers of County Wexford and to the continued development of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and particularly to the viability of the factory in Thurles.  Now is the time for him to decide where he stands in regard to this motion and to vote in accordance with the way he has expressed himself to his constituents in North Tipperary.  CIE losses have grown to an unbelievable level, from £5.7 million in 1971 to £32 million last year, and this increase has occurred in the main during the last four years of what can only be described as economic mismanagement.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil do not propose <Col N="111" /> to adopt a negative approach to CIE. We do not propose to see what we can close down with the least political embarrassment.  We will set out to create an economic revolution all over this country which will stretch the capacity of our national transport company to carry the goods and passengers that will come from the renewed industrial expansion that this country needs so badly.  A national transport system should not be seen as a liability. It is and should be seen to be a national asset.  Developing countries all over the world strain their resources in order to develop a national transport system.  Their greatest problem of expansion is to provide facilities for the movement of raw materials and finished goods in those developing countries.</P>
    <P>Why then should we here in Ireland be looking at CIE as an embarrassment or a liability?  It is not.  It is a means of moving goods and passengers and providing a service to all parts of the country.  We in Fianna Fáil will answer CIE's problem with more goods to carry, thereby giving more revenue. That is the side of the balance sheet that Fianna Fáil will deal with when returned to office at the next general election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan</i>): I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;recognises that under Section 19 of the Transport Act, 1958, the Board of CIE is empowered to terminate any train service provided the Board is satisfied that the service is uneconomic and that there is no prospect of its continued operation being economic within a reasonable period; and takes note of the Minister for Transport and Power's recent public statement in relation to the future of services on the Rosslare/Limerick Junction railway line&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his opening remarks Deputy Barrett referred to the closure of the Limerick-Claremorris line and he outlined for us the struggle that he led against the <Col N="112" /> proposed closure.  He told us about the deputation that came here to protest against the closure, about the motion that his party put down and argued in favour of retaining that railway line and the votes that he carried into the lobby against the proposed closure.  The fact of the matter is that the Limerick-Claremorris line was closed on the 5th April, 1976, by CIE in accordance with their statutory powers under section 19 of the Transport Act, 1958, and the railway line was replaced by bus transport.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that there was considerable opposition to the closure of that line and that it was led by the Opposition.  However, since the line was closed and the trains replaced by buses, there have been no complaints. There are more people using the buses than were using the trains.  Everybody appears to be satisfied and I have received no complaints.  Further, the buses to date are showing a profit, whereas the railway line was showing a loss.  So much for the closure of the Limerick-Claremorris line and for the battles led by Deputy Barrett against the closure.</P>
    <P>The next thing I have to deal with briefly is the protest or apparent protest by Deputy Barrett against what he alleges as my intervention in the episode regarding the Rosslare Harbour-Waterford line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): The Deputy seemed to suggest that I intervened and he made that suggestion in a critical manner.  All I can say is that it is hard for the Minister for Transport and Power to win because Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, who has just put his name to this motion, is reported in the <i>Tipperary Star</i> of 8th January last as calling on me as Minister for Transport and Power to see that CIE had their priorities right and that this outrageous proposal did not take place.  Before I say what actually happened I would point to the situation in which we have Deputy O'Kennedy calling on me to exercise my overall control and to ensure that the line did not close while Deputy <Col N="113" /> Barrett, if my interpretation is correct&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): No doubt the record will show that my interpretation is correct, that Deputy Barrett was critical of my intervention.  However, I wish to put the record straight in regard to where lies the responsibility for the closing of lines.  By virtue of section 19 of the Transport Act, 1958, the power to close uneconomic lines or lines which do not look as if they would become economic, rests with CIE.  Under that legislation and between October 1, 1958 and February of this year, 858 miles of lines have been closed by CIE.  It is significant that 700 miles of those lines were closed between October 1, 1958 and 1973 by former Fianna Fáil administrations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But when lines were closed under Fianna Fáil administrations, they made a thorough job of the closure because not only were services withdrawn but the lines were ripped up and the properties sold thereby ensuring that the services could never be restored. I could give a list of the lines concerned but I shall confine myself to naming merely a few.  These were the Harcourt Street-Bray line, the Waterford-Tramore line, the Clonmel-Thurles line and many others, including innumerable lines in my constituency.  On the few occasions that services have been withdrawn since we came to power the permanent way was left intact so that the lines could be re-opened and services restored if that should be considered wise at some future date.  In addition, the 700 miles of lines that were closed by Fianna Fáil were closed at a time when the social need for public transport was definitely greater than it is now and when the losses being incurred by CIE were only a fraction of present-day losses.  For example, in 1967 there was one car for every 10.2 people in the country while in 1976 <Col N="114" /> the ratio was one car for every 5.7 people.  That is why I say that Fianna Fáil closed those lines at a time when the social need for public transport was infinitely greater than it is now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>For the record, we are not talking about passengers but about freight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): We are talking about railway lines and services.  When I said that the sole responsibility for closing lines rests with CIE, the Deputy smiled but two of my predecessors in office, the late Mr. Seán Lemass and the late Mr. Erskine Childers, are on record as being very much in favour of vesting in CIE the power to close down these uneconomic lines.  Indeed, the entire Fianna Fáil Party are on the record of this House as having walked through the &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; lobby in support of that very measure when it was being provided for in the 1958 Act.  Not only that but they are on record also as having voted on several occasions in favour of actual closures.</P>
      <P>As everybody knows and, as Deputy Barrett has said, the present State subsidy to CIE is about £32 million.  That is a vast amount of money which must be provided by the taxpayers, by way of direct or indirect taxation, but it is collected from all the people, right across the board.  Consequently, in these financial circumstances it is essential that CIE should run a reasonable and an efficient national transport service and run it economically.  That is the policy laid on CIE by statute.  As well as the elements of economic and commercial performance, there is also in public transport a social input.  There must be a balance between the two objectives.  If one service can be provided as efficiently but cheaper in one way than in another or by one means of transport as opposed to another, the cheaper method should be used.  An example of this is the Limerick-Claremorris line.  This service was replaced by a bus service which is working well. We can appreciate the emotional reaction that the closure of any line evokes but we must have consideration of the factors I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in the context of what I have <Col N="115" /> said that some months ago the board of CIE had under consideration a proposal to withdraw services from a number of lines and stations.  It is true that the Rosslare Harbour-Waterford line was one of those to which the company gave attention but no definite or final decision was ever taken by the company to close that line.</P>
    <P>By virtue of the Transport Act, 1958 there is an obligation on CIE to publish a statutory notice giving two months' notice of their intentions to withdraw services from lines and stations.  That is very important because we find here that in the case of the other lines we have been talking of, CIE complied with this requirement. No such notice was ever published in relation to the Rosslare Harbour-Waterford line because no final decision was ever taken to close down the line.  The publication of the notice I am talking about is a condition precedent to the closing of the line.  It must be published by virtue of the Transport Act to give people who want to object an opportunity to do so and to enable people to make representations if they so desire.  No such notice was ever published in regard to the Rosslare-Waterford line which is part and parcel of the Limerick Junction-Rosslare Harbour line.  There was no question of closing down one part of this line in isolation. Why was the notice not served or published in regard to this line?  There were special circumstances in existence in regard to this line.  It formed the only link between south Wexford and Waterford, and it conveyed school children and workers from south Wexford to Waterford.</P>
    <P>The only alternative effective means of transport between south Wexford and Waterford would be to convert the Barrow viaduct into a road bridge and that presented enormous difficulties, the first being getting planning permission from at least two county councils.  Everybody knew that that would not be plain sailing.  My information is that Wexford County Council have refused planning permission to convert the viaduct into a road bridge.  Following that there was some talk of a toll bridge.  If the <Col N="116" /> viaduct was to be converted into a toll bridge legislation would be necessary. Deputy O'Kennedy, who was in Government for a short time, will know the tedious methods involved in getting a Bill drafted and circulated and put through the House.  The all-important question of the transport of beet from south-west Wexford to Thurles is also involved here and the importance of that transport was recognised by the board of CIE.  Nobody need lecture any Member of this party about the importance of the beet industry to this country, because we founded the beet industry many years ago and we look back on that and the sugar industry with pride, as something to be fostered and regarded as sacred.  If all these obstacles were overcome there was still the question of a network of roads in that area to be brought up to standard so that they could cater for the added 150 lorries that Deputy Barrett talked about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Ninety lorries.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): That would also have to be considered. It was in that context that I learned of the concern which existed in Thurles and in the other areas proposed to be affected by the alleged proposal to close down this railway line and withdraw services.  The closure was described as imminent in the face of all these things that had to be done, the converting of the viaduct into a road bridge, getting planning permission, getting legislation through the House and getting other roads in the area up to a proper standard.  These fears were encouraged by Opposition Deputies for political purposes.  Deputy O'Kennedy goes on record in the <i>Tipperary Star</i> calling on me to step in and see that this closure does not take place.  I have not the authority to intervene to prevent closures on these lines.  That authority is vested in CIE by section 19 of the Transport Act, 1958.  It was my duty to clarify the position for the people of Thurles, Wexford and other areas concerned. Because I regard the jobs of workers in Thurles as important and the convenience of the people in south Wexford as important, I availed of an <Col N="117" /> opportunity of going to Thurles to clarify the position.  Having made inquiries I satisfied myself that it was not proposed to close the line or any part of it until an alternative and satisfactory transport system was provided. I believe that this motion is nothing more than an attempt to muddy the waters again, to create uncertainty and to exploit the fears of the people unnecessarily, for selfish political purposes.  Deputy Barrett put some of what I said in Thurles on the record.  What I said is reported verbatim in the <i>Tipperary Star</i> on 22nd January, 1977, and I would like to put the entire statement on record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I am not saying that.  The article reads as follows:</P>
      <P>The Minister was addressing a Fine Gael meeting in Thurles.  The following is the full text of his statement:</P>
      <P>I understand that there is widespread concern in Thurles and in other areas which would be affected, by the news that CIE have taken a decision to close down the railway line from Rosslare to Waterford.  In fact the closure has been described as imminent.</P>
      <P>I want to set the record straight and explain the position finally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The power to close the uneconomic lines or stations which cannot be made viable is vested in CIE by statute and as is well-known CIE suffered a substantial loss last year and required a Government subvention amounting to about £32 million.  In an effort to contain these losses which ultimately have to be borne by the taxpayer, the Company have had under consideration for <Col N="118" /> some time the proposals to terminate a number of uneconomic services. These include the recently announced station closures.  A decision is never taken in such cases without fully considering each case on its merits and taking into account any unusual circumstances.</P>
    <P>In the case of the line from Rosslare (harbour) to Waterford there are unusual and indeed exceptional circumstances which must be considered and resolved.  First of all there is no satisfactory road link between Wexford and Waterford and to establish such a link would necessitate the conversion of the Barrow Viaduct into a road bridge &mdash;the conversion presents problems.</P>
    <P>Also planning permission has to be obtained and legislation might be necessary, if it were proposed to charge a toll for the use of the road bridge.</P>
    <P>As well as this the suitability of the road network in the area has been considered and it is possible that drastic alterations may be necessary.  Furthermore the question of transporting of beet from south Wexford to Thurles with its important consequences for the agricultural sector in the area where it is grown and for the industrial sector in the town of Thurles immediately arises.</P>
    <P>No final decision has been taken to close down the Rosslare-Waterford line and no such decision will be taken until the problems which I have mentioned have been fully considered, and until a satisfactory method of transport in the area has been provided.  It follows therefore that there is no question of closing down this rail line in the immediate future as has been suggested. Indeed it is obvious that it cannot and will not be closed down for some considerable time, if at all, and certainly, as I have said, not until a suitable alternative transport service is provided.</P>
    <P>I trust that what I have said will put an end to speculation and will allay the genuine fears concerning the proposed closure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> That is what I said in Thurles.  That was the position when I spoke in Thurles as I understood it and that is the position now as I understand it.  I repeat that there is no question of closing down this railway line or withdrawing the services until such time as a suitable alternative railway or transport system is provided between south Wexford and Waterford and then to Thurles.  I have put on the record of this House the immense difficulties that are in the way of closing down this line and I am saying now that the line will not be closed down until these difficulties have been resolved.  That is my understanding and information.</P>
    <P>I regret to have to repeat that in my opinion the moving of this resolution today is simply an effort to muddy the water and to create confusion and uncertainty in this election year for political purposes.</P>

      <P>Having listened for the last 30 minutes to the lecture from the Minister for Transport and Power, I am beginning to wonder whether some of us are able to read what is written or if we are able to understand what is said.  Listening to the Minister, one would believe that the question had never been raised about closing the rail link between Rosslare Harbour and Limerick.</P>
      <P>I rise to support the motion so ably put by our spokesman on Transport and Power.  I hope to be able to contribute something about the social and economic necessity for keeping this line open.  I have listened to the Minister's lecture on what happened down the years under former Ministers dead and alive, the lines that closed and the rest of it.  There is absolutely no comparison between the lines that were closed in the past and this line that connects Rosslare Harbour and Limerick. If I survive for another three weeks and if the Taoiseach does not make up his mind during that period to see the man in the Park I will be 20 years in this House.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you are here a long time too and you never heard me say that the Minister, or anybody else for that matter, deliberately misled this House or the people.  I would hate to have to say that.  I would like to think that every other Deputy in this House would be as honest as I feel I am.  However, there are a lot of people in Wexford, Waterford and Limerick and a heck of a lot of people in Tipperary who believe that they were misled by the Minister, that he was bluffing them and that there will be a complete cover-up until the general election that the Minister talked about a few minutes ago is over.  I am sorry to have to say that.  Only last Monday at a meeting of the Wexford County Council a member of the Minister's own party got up and said what I was afraid to say, that the Minister was bluffing the people, that this was only a gimmick until the general election was over.  Why?  In the motion before us an amendment has been put by the Minister and he asks us to take note in a childish sort of way, as if we did not know about something which is in our legislation.  He asked us further to take not of what he said to his good friends in Thurles in the middle of last January.  Because we have taken note of that this motion is being pressed tonight.  There is no question about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already said, I would not accuse the Minister of deliberately misleading anybody, but I have a feeling that for some reason or another he is misleading somebody.  He is misleading the people of Wexford, Kilkenny, Waterford, Tipperary and Limerick.  I have two statements in front of me, one from CIE and the other from the Minister.  They are so much at variance, they conflict so much, that there is no way in which they can be reconciled.  The Minister asked us to take note of his statement. In his statement to his Fine Gael friends in Thurles he said no final decision has been taken to close down the Rosslare-Waterford line. <Col N="122" /> That is a statement of fact according to the Minister.  He repeated it tonight.</P>
    <P>On 11th or 12th December I and others interested received a letter from the area manager of CIE in Waterford. I am sure he is a very honest man and I take it that in that letter he was trying to give us the facts.  In that letter there is this sentence:</P>
    <P>There is no commercial justification for the operation of services on this line....</P>
    <P>He is dealing with the Rosslare-Limerick line&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>... and the Board has decided to withdraw passenger and freight services from the Waterford/ Rosslare section.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister now tell us that Mr. O'Connor, area manager of CIE, was not telling the truth?  Will he tell us he was dishonest?  Will he tell us he was conveying to us a decision which had not been taken by the board of CIE?  I am certain Mr. O'Connor is a very decent and honest man.  I am certain he did not convey to me and a number of other people something which was not a fact and was not correct.  The Minister repeated his statement several times here tonight.  He said no final decision has been taken.  That is a very definite and emphatic statement.  He emphasised it as far as it was humanly possible for any Minister to emphasise it.  I have a statement from a very high official, an honourable official of CIE, in which he says the board have decided to withdraw passenger and freight services from the Waterford-Rosslare section.</P>

      <P>I put down a question and I got a reply from the Ceann Comhairle in which he said:</P>
      <P>I regret that I have had to disallow the Question addressed by you to the Minister for Transport and Power as to whether the Board of CIE has reversed its decision to withdraw passenger and freight services on the Rosslare Harbour/ Waterford rail line.  This is a matter for CIE itself and the Minister has no official responsibility in regard to it.</P>
      <P>That was the usual way out.  I suppose there was nothing else the Ceann Comhairle could do.  Because some Minister, possibly a Fianna Fáil Minister, said years ago: &ldquo;This is the easiest way out; we will not answer a question about CIE; we will say it is the responsibility of CIE&rdquo;, these questions cannot be answered today despite the fact that questions are answered about numerous semi-State bodies such as the ESB and others.</P>
      <P>I wrote to Mr. O'Connor, the man who made the statement in the first instance that the board of CIE had decided to withdraw passenger and freight services on this section of the line.  Mr. O'Connor replied:</P>
      <P>I refer to your letter of 22nd January concerning the Rosslare/ Waterford rail service.  You will recall that in my letter of 10th December, 1976 I said that the board had decided to defer, for a reasonable period of time, the fixing of a date for the closure, while the conversion of the viaduct to a road toll bridge and the implications of the proposed road network on both sides of the bridge were being considered.</P>

I must be careful about how I use words or the Minister, being a legal man, will put me in the dock very quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply from Mr. J.F. Higgins, the general manager is quite interesting.  He said:</P>
      <P>Thank you for your letter of 10th February about the Rosslare/ Waterford line.</P>
      <P>Listen to this sentence:</P>
      <P>I am sure you will appreciate it would be quite inappropriate for me to comment on any statement of the Minister.</P>
      <P>In reading Mr. O'Connor's letter of 8th February to you, I do not think it can be regarded as an evasion as you suggest.</P>
      <P>I asked Mr. Higgins, General Manager of CIE to say yes or no to the question: have the board made the decision to close this particular section of the line to freight and passenger traffic?  One sentence or one word in reply would have satisfied me but no, he could not comment on the Minister's statement.  How could he, when he must get £32 million a year from the Minister and his Government for his undertaking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the people are concerned, it will take more than the Minister's statement here tonight to convince them that a decision has not been made by the board of CIE to close this rail link.  The Minister talks as if nothing had been done about this and as if it were impossible to close it in present circumstances.  Is he aware that CIE some weeks ago issued details of an alternative bus transport system for Rosslare Harbour to Waterford, to Limerick complete with timetable? We were asked to take note of <Col N="126" /> it and accept it.  CIE have made their plans, I would think, regardless of whether the viaduct bridge, a toll bridge or road bridge could be built across the river at this place.  As the Minister said, the Wexford county manager and the Wexford planning officer have turned down the application for a road bridge across this railway bridge, to convert this rail bridge into a road bridge.  From the start the idea was so fantastic that there was no hope of either Wexford County Council or Kilkenny County Council accepting that application and giving planning permission for the toll bridge mentioned.  I do not know if Kilkenny County Council have made a decision on it yet.  There are so many things against it.  The Minister has mentioned some of them &mdash;the roadways to this bridge in Wexford. There are quite a number of small roads down there.  The Wexford county engineer has estimated that it would cost anything up to £2 million to bring them up to the standard that would be required.  The bridge concerned, the Barrow Bridge, is 710 yards long; there is a tunnel on the Kilkenny side 190 yards long.  There would be almost one mile of one-way traffic on that bridge and through that tunnel. God help people using either if one of the big lorries going through broke down on the way.  There is also the question of shipping to the port of New Ross and other shipping going through there.  The bridge might be opened two or three times a day to allow ships to pass with delays of anything from an hour upwards.</P>
    <P>There are some other points I want to make.  First, if this line were closed it would certainly mean the downgrading of Rosslare Harbour at a time when we are seeking its development and hoping that will come about.  It is one of the most important ports of entry to the country.</P>
    <P>In reply to a Dáil question last year I was told that the number of passengers who passed through Rosslare Harbour in 1975 was 377,161 and the total number of cars was 86,289 of which 74,948 were passenger cars.  The Minister spoke some time ago about the number of cars now in the country <Col N="127" /> as compared with a few years ago and what he said was correct.  Nobody denies that.  Nevertheless, a huge number of foot passengers still come through Rosslare Harbour every year. What will their position be if they find Rosslare Harbour rail link to the south of Ireland closed?  True, quite a number of passengers now bring their own cars but there is still that business there for CIE.</P>
    <P>The second question arising is the saving that CIE propose to make on the closing of this stretch of line.  We have heard estimates varying from £133,000 to £½ million.  As Deputy Barrett said, this is not a significant figure when one considers that last year CIE lost £32 million, or at least that our subvention to CIE was £32 million and when one considers that Dublin city bus services in 1976 lost a staggering sum of over £6 million. What is involved here is certainly not a very high figure.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already mentioned some of the reasons for the retention of this line.  Quite a large number of passengers use it to get to the south of Ireland coming through Rosslare Harbour.  Quite a number of people use it going to work in Waterford city, commuters from south Wexford, and quite a number of school children from the same area use it to attend schools in Waterford.  The alternative&mdash; and the proposal is already on paper from CIE&mdash;is to go <i>via</i> New Ross which would mean an extra half-hour journey on people from south Wexford.</P>
    <P>In our motion we mentioned the economic reasons and these are the ones that really count, economic reasons as far as Rosslare Harbour is concerned but above all, the economic reasons as far as the beet growers of south Wexford and the Thurles beet factory are concerned.  As a small child, I remember hearing about a campaign to secure a beet factory for Wexford.  Possibly what I should be saying tonight is: &ldquo;Shut down this line; do not let that beet go from south Wexford to Thurles&rdquo;.  Growers in north Wexford provide about 40 per cent of the beet for the Carlow sugar factory and in <Col N="128" /> south Wexford beet growers provide 40 to 50 per cent of the beet used in the Thurles factory.  Perhaps I should say: &ldquo;Shut the whole lot down and let us seek a beet factory for Wexford.&rdquo; That would have been the ideal thing had it been done many years ago.  The Tánaiste claps his hands over there and I agree with him fully.</P>

If I felt there was any earthly hope at this stage of getting a beet factory into Wexford I would fully support the closing down of this line, the shutting off of beet from south Wexford to Thurles and from north Wexford to Carlow.  However I know how completely hopeless that is.</P>
      <P>As I said, the beet of south Wexford is all important to Thurles.  That is the main reason the Minister went to his friends in Thurles and told them that no final decision had been made, despite the fact that CIE in their letter to me had already said the board had decided to close this section.  Of course this is important to the Minister in Tipperary where there is a marginal seat that will come to us when the Taoiseach decides to have this general election.</P>

      <P>There are 900 beet growers in south Wexford serving the Thurles factory.  They grow 7,500 acres, approximately 140,000 tons of beet for that factory.  As the Minister has already said, the length of the campaign in that factory is 115 days. The number of tons from south Wexford to Thurles per day is 1,200 tons.  Somebody talked about 90 trucks but if you put 25 tons per truck it would take 50 trucks per day to take that beet from Wexford to Thurles.  There is no way beet can be taken to Thurles except by the existing rail.  There is no point in CIE talking about an alternative no matter what they do or what the private company they are talking about can do.  There is no way they can convert the Barrow Bridge into a road to carry that sort of traffic.</P>

      <P>It looks as if the Opposition think we are starting the general election campaign.  Instead of this being, as I had hoped, an all party <Col N="130" /> approach for the preservation and consolidation of this railway line from Rosslare to Thurles through Waterford, I am afraid it has become a beer garden situation.  That being so, it is right for me to remind the Opposition spokesmen that our real difficulty in relating to this railway arises out of section 19 of the Transport Act, 1958, of which the gentlemen on the other side were the undertakers, the proposers and the legislators.  We should not forget that fact.  Apparently they have woken up after a very long sleep and realised that there is a problem which is now coming home to roost.</P>
      <P>The Minister has taken a courageous, proper and statesmanlike line in making that statement in Thurles.  It has allayed fears.  One must remember that plans are now being made for next year's beet crop and those plans are being made in south Wexford.  It does not help the future productivity of beet and sugar for people to raise matters of false concern.  It behoves all of us to adopt a responsible approach to this problem.</P>
      <P>This railway serves what will be, I hope, one of the most important ports in this land, Rosslare Harbour.  It is ideally situated both geographically and economically and I hope it would have a tremendous potential for roll-on and roll-off traffic and particularly container traffic.  We know that, when industrialists want to build a factory and are looking for a site, what they are looking for is an area which is getting proper rail, road and shipping transport services to the markets they want to serve.  The market that will be served by our factories will be, by and large, the European market, and Rosslare is the nearest point of contact to Europe.</P>

I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that their present criteria in regard to grants for the furniture industry are designed to encourage the development of a capability to compete under free trade.  Applications from new entrants will be considered only for projects that are geared to compete against specifically identified imports or to supply particular export markets.</P>
