    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if any form of census will be carried out during the present year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly) John Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office are at present carrying out a sample labour force survey involving some 40,000 households which, in addition to providing information on employment, will also yield a good deal of demographic information on the total population such as age structure, marital status, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there are 150,000 people unemployed does the Parliamentary Secretary think that the sample taken by the Government will be sufficiently large to give a true reflection of the information they require?  Could the Parliamentary Secretary further indicate if the sample taken will provide the Government with the information they have not got up to now in relation to unemployed persons in certain Dublin areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like notice about the second part of that question. I have not got information which would break the country down into areas.  The answer to the first part of the Deputy's supplementary is: yes, <Col N="1382" /> it will give reliable information as to the actual number of people out of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind that there are 150,000 people unemployed would the Government not consider the carrying out of a complete census in order to take some people off the dole queues at present to carry out this very important work and to assist governments in future forward planning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This question has been raised several times before.  The Taoiseach has told the House several times what was the Government's decision in this regard.  I can tell the Deputy that there is at present an EEC regulation which will oblige all member governments to hold a census during the second quarter of the year 1981. In view of that in particular, the Government would think it unjustifiable expenditure of money to hold a census such a short time before we have to hold one anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Government will be directed now to hold a census in 1981 does that mean that they will not take effective action on problems arising between 1977 and 1981?  Would the Parliamentary Secretary indicate how the Government can formulate a forward-planning policy in relation to various problems if they cannot identify them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government identify the problems very well and easily without the necessity for a full, detailed census of the kind the Deputy has in mind.  I should like to remind the Deputy that, though this country was used formerly to having only a five-year interval between censuses, the usual thing in the other EEC countries is a ten-year interval.  If we fall into a ten-year rhythm we will be falling into a pattern that has been known on the continent for a very long time.</P>

      <P>Next question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The five-year interval was a useful exercise but it was, in some respects, a luxury which this <Col N="1383" /> country had and to which other countries had not been accustomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that our parliamentary representation is tied to the population figures and that a census, even in that respect, is absolutely essential?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is so tied&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary seriously inferring that we will not have a population census until 1981?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>A full census of the kind we have been accustomed to call a census, probably will not be held until 1981 when we are obliged to hold one anyway in the second quarter of the year because of an EEC decision binding on all member Governments to that effect.  In regard to the first part of what the Deputy said, if there is a constitutional requirement which ties parliamentary representation to census figures, it refers to the last available census figures.  That has always been interpreted as meaning a census figure even though it might lie several years further back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary really saying that the present gerrymandering of constituencies will be allowed to continue until 1981?</P>

    <Col N="1384" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Government have not got some vital statistics required from time to time to assess future development does the Parliamentary Secretary indicate that no future planning can or will take place as a result of the lack of statistical information necessary and desirable in order to carry out effective forward planning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows perfectly well that the Central Statistics Office collects information, in all kinds of ways, which is perfectly adequate to enable large scale economic planning to take place.  We are not dependent on the individual household census which in other countries, countries who have nothing to apologise for in regard to their economic record, never takes place except at ten-year intervals.</P>

      <P>It is nearly a full page. I do not mind reading it out if the House does not mind waiting.  But the <Col N="1391" /> only commodity for which the CSO tell me there is not an available figure is in respect of baby food.  I can give the Deputy the other percentages without difficulty.</P>

      <P>Question No. 4 did not relate to percentages.  It sought information about the average price of the following items in March, 1973 and in March, 1977 or the nearest available date: a pint of beer in a Dublin public bar, a gallon of grade I petrol, 20 untipped cigarettes, 1 lb of baby food, a glass of whiskey, road tax on a 12 hp car, a colour television licence, a local telephone call, postage charges for local letters and the bus fares to the city centre from Ballyfermot, Inchicore, Bluebell and Drimnagh, Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer in respect of all of them in the written reply. The figure for baby foods is not available. That is an answer.  In the case of four of the commodities which the Deputy specified, average prices cannot be provided, namely, a pint of beer in a Dublin publichouse, a gallon of grade I petrol, a packet of 20 untipped cigarettes and a glass of whiskey.  I am told the reason is that since identical brands, varieties and quantities are not priced in all areas for the compilation of the CPI, identical articles are priced at each source in successive quarters to provide for price changes required for CPI calculations, and these percentages price changes have not been provided for the four items specified by the Deputy but for the most appropriate items which the CPI distinguish.  I am afraid that is the best I can do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 9, 10 and 11 together.  The Government decision taken at their meeting on 1st April to retain and enforce their unilateral measures for the conservation and management of fishery resources still stands.  The Government also decided at that meeting to invite member states of the European Economic Community to submit fishing plans to the Irish Government for approval with a view to the introduction later by the Government of a scheme on the lines previously proposed by the EEC Commission as the basis of a Community measure.</P>
      <P>Recent statements attributed to Mr. Gundelach seem to refer to the possible introduction of such a scheme here. Fishing plans have been submitted by the Netherlands, Belgium and the Federal Republic of Germany pursuant to that invitation and are being examined at present.  The question of the Irish Government submitting fishing plans to the EEC does not arise.</P>
      <P>In relation to Question No. 8, I should like to add something in relation to Deputy Gallagher's reference to a band of 50 miles of Irish coastal waters.  The band at present being dealt with is not one of 50 miles but what I have taken the liberty of christening &ldquo;the Irish box&rdquo;, the area bounded on the north 56 degrees, 30 minutes north latitude, 50 degrees, 30 minutes north latitude and 12 degrees west longitude.  It is 100 miles, roughly, in spots from the Irish coast and 50 miles in others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I must protest at the way in which the Minister has dealt with these questions.  Each question dealt with a specific matter but he <Col N="1395" /> has taken all the questions together without dealing specifically with any of them.  This shows a complete disregard for the House.  Has the Minister seen Mr. Gundelach's statement and the statements by the fishermen which seem to indicate that the unilateral action the Government are supposed to have taken is not being fully implemented and that the fishermen do not accept that the Government are serious in trying to implement the action they have been talking about so loudly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may rest assured that I will provide for him all the information available to me in relation to each of the four questions, that I will help him in this regard in every way I can.  I do not think the decision of my Department to have all four questions answered together matters very much because I will answer any Supplementary Questions put to me subject, of course, to the Chair's decision on when the matter should end.  In relation to statements by Mr. Gundelach and the fishermen, I have read both.  On the suggestion by the Deputy that the unilateral measures are not being fully implemented, the fact is Mr. Gundelach was dealing with what might happen in the future.  We have not made any decision at all in relation to the fishing plans so far submitted to us and to which I have referred, but when they have been fully examined and decisions made on them, we will be in a position to decide whether we will accept them.  No decision has been made and none will be made until all examination that can be done has been done.  In relation to the implementation of unilateral measures, they are being implemented fully.  It is a matter between the Minister for Defence and me.  Instructions have been issued to the Naval Service by the Minister for Defence, and to my knowledge we are at the moment searching the seas for anybody who may be transgressing our Irish box.  That is the situation and it will be the situation until such time as fishing plans have been either rejected or accepted.  Our fishermen and the <Col N="1396" /> nation can rest assured that no deviation will be allowed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the fishermen are so dissatisfied with the action of the Government that they are contemplating hiring a plane to try to see that justice will be done in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware and I do not think such a foolish suggestion would be countenanced by the fishermen whom I regard as being a responsible body of men.  I assure the Deputy and the House that a plane has been purchased and that it is being fully utilised, and if further planes are necessary they will be purchased.  The Naval Service is about its work and will see to it that Irish fish stocks will be preserved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that suggestion.  The British are one of the nations who have not submitted plans and they, because of their position right beside us, would naturally be interested.  We do not expect plans from Denmark.  We will examine all the plans submitted, consult with the fishermen before any decision is made and see to it that every effort is made by the Government and by me to conserve our fish stocks.  It was pointed out to me by a fishery expert from the Deputy's constituency, Colonel Morris, &ldquo;total efficiency is total kill&rdquo;.  That is the reason for conserving stocks.  The Government will conserve, defend, and consult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to fishery plans, does it not seem strange that, as the Minister stated, the Government are demanding plans from other EEC states in relation to fishing while they, as the Minister also stated, have no plans?  It seems rather high-handed to suggest to the other nations that they should submit plans even though the <Col N="1397" /> Government have no other plans for the fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is incorrect. The Government have plans in relation to the conservation of Irish fish stocks in the Irish box and will carry out those plans.  In relation to plans which were invited&mdash;they were not demanded&mdash;from other member states of the EEC, we are awaiting them. Those plans will be gone through with a fine comb to see to it that no content of those plans will affect Irish fishermen, Irish fishing waters or fish in Irish waters.  When that has been completed the Government will consult with the Irish fishermen's organisations and then make their decision.</P>

      <P>No.  It would not be appropriate to make those plans available to Members of the House at this stage but as soon as the examination of all the plans has been carried out and we have decided one way or the other I will be as helpful to the Deputy, and other Members, as I can be at Question Time or at any other time.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will make a statement on the massive increases in house building costs between 1st January, 1975, and 1st March, 1977, as indicated by the house-building cost index published by his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the inference that increases in house building costs have been excessive.  Over the past two years the changes in the house-building cost index have been generally in line with trends in the consumer price index.  It would be naïve to expect that house building costs could be isolated from the effects of increased prices in domestic and international trade.  The increases in labour costs are in accord with the terms of the national pay agreements, together with the first phase of a special wage agreement for building workers as accepted by the Labour Court.  Increases in the cost of materials are approved by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the recommendation of the National Prices Commission where such approval is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have taken account of the increases in building costs when raising the annual capital allocations for housing and the amount of loan <Col N="1399" /> finance available from the various lending agencies has more than kept pace with house price increases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain, in relation to this important question, if he was consulted when the National Prices Commission, and his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, approved a 25 per cent increase in the price of cement a few months ago practically on the eve of the announcement by the company of the highest increase in profits they ever had?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy means by oblivious but I was aware that this had taken place and in view of the fact that the National Prices Commission, established by the previous Government to monitor price applications, made the recommendation I was satisfied it was necessary to grant the increase.  The commission must have been satisfied.  I had not the full facts; they had and they must have been satisfied that it was necessary to grant the increase.  I do not know what factors persuaded them to grant that increase.  When they made their recommendation I had no function in the matter.</P>

It would appear that sometimes the work has been done in the way suggested by the Deputy.  The accident referred to was the subject of an inquest and would appear to have been caused by the closing of a valve on the flow and return pipes from the boiler resulting in an increase in pressure which ruptured the boiler.  It is not normal practice for valves to be installed in this position. There is nothing at the present time, nor have any representations been made to me, to have anything done about the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The public capital programme allocation for local authority housing in 1977 is £74.1 million, an increase of 14 per cent on the equivalent public capital programme allocation for 1976.  When normal working overdraft at 31st December, 1977, is taken into account, the total amount available to meet local authority housing construction expenditure in 1977, and all incoming debit balances at 31st December, 1976, is £81.11 million.</P>
      <P>The amount of money which will be allocated for additional new work following a review of the programme later in the summer will depend on the extent of the demand then arising and the level of expenditure actually incurred in 1977 up to the time of the review.</P>

    <P>The capital funds actually allocated <Col N="1405" /> to housing authorities already this year are estimated to be sufficient to finance the starting of about 6,000 new houses in 1977.

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the average cost of a house in Dublin on the date that the SDA loan was raised to £4,500; and the average cost of a similar house of similar floor area as indicated in the latest publication of housing statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>During the quarter ended 30th June, 1973, the average gross price of new houses in Dublin for which loans were approved by the main lending agencies was £7,137.  The corresponding figure for the quarter ended 31st December, 1976, was £13,995.</P>
      <P>During the quarter ended 30th June, 1973, when the SDA loan limit was raised to £4,500, the average gross price of new houses in the Dublin area for which loans were approved by local authorities was £5,612.  The corresponding figure for the quarter ended 31st December, 1976, was £9,070.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The houses concerned are not necessarily comparable because standards differ and also because the lending agencies do not furnish information regarding the total floor areas of the houses or whether or not they are <Col N="1406" /> grant-aided.  Moreover, the main lending agencies in 1976 included the Associated Banks and the average gross price for the December quarter of that year of new houses in Dublin for which loans were approved by the banks was £19,500 as compared with £9,070 for Dublin local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that, between the date the SDA loan was increased to £4,500 and the present time, there is a difference of £3,400 in the price of a house suitable for an SDA loan.  Does he not consider that the time is ripe to increase the SDA loan from £4,500 to a realistic level so that young people getting married will be in a position to get a home of their own?  Does he not consider it unreasonable to ask them to provide £3,400 for an additional deposit for a house today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is completely missing the point, as usual.  He must remember that the people who are now building houses have a much wider area from which to draw their funds than from SDA loans, which did a very good job for a long period and which are still doing a good job in certain areas around the country. The position now is that the young people he is referring to can borrow money from building societies and banks and many of them can avail of a new mortgage scheme.  This will ensure that they will be able to build their houses.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of the average price of houses, the Deputy must be aware that there are houses being built in Dublin which cost up to £30,000 and an average price would not give anybody very much information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to people who are not on the waiting list; they cannot apply for the low mortgage loans because they are not on a waiting list for 12 months.  These young people who are getting married are not in a position to meet this burden. Would the Minister tell the House that the Government are prepared to assist these young couples to buy houses by increasing the SDA loans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1407" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When the SDA loan fund was paying over £30 million a year for houses, about four years ago, building societies were lending about £42 million; they are now lending up to £100 million.  That makes a big difference. The Deputy should think about this for a minute.  The amount of money he is suggesting, which is even higher than the figure usually used by his party when talking about this problem, would eat up twice over the £30 million which his party seem to think will revolutionise a new housing drive.</P>

      <P>I agree they should have made an attempt, as other local authorities did, to have these registers delivered in Irish manufactured wrappings. I believe it was as a result of complaints from public representatives of these registers being lost or the packages arriving torn that these particular wrappers were imported this year.  I do not think any Irish manufacturer would be willing to change his manufacturing process for the sake of the amount involved, £37.92&mdash;it is not a big amount&mdash;but I agree with the principle of supporting home industries and I hope that will be the practice in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A submission, proposing that duty-free facilities be introduced on air and sea routes between this State and Britain, was recently given very detailed consideration particularly in the context of preparation of the budget, 1977, and rejected.</P>
      <P>By arrangement between the Irish and British authorities, duty-free facilities have not been allowed on ships and aircraft travelling between this country and Britain since the foundation of the State.  The British authorities are opposed to any alteration in existing arrangements at this time.</P>
      <P>I might add that the case made for the introduction of duty-free facilities on cross-channel routes was less than convincing to justify the incurring of a substantial and certain revenue loss in the remote hope that resultant indirect revenue receipts might be sufficient to balance the loss or at least to reduce it to such magnitude that it could be regarded as a fair price to pay for gains to the economy and specifically to the Irish carrier companies resulting from enhanced tourist traffic from Britain.  No evidence was furnished to substantiate the suggestion that the availability of duty-free facilities is a determining factor in tourists' choice of holiday venues.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 35 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>The introduction of legislation which would single out particular categories of taxpayers for exceptional treatment under the income tax code on the grounds of the dangerous and unpleasant nature of their work would obviously lead to a plethora of claims from a multitude of groups and on that account cannot be entertained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the nature of the work involves bonuses for the hazards involved in the work and because expectation of continuity of salary is very much less than it is in the case of people earning a similar salary in other activities, would the Taoiseach not think there is a reasonable case in equity and also from the point of view of productivity to have a look at some allowances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, the only tax relief available by reference to the nature of the employment is the deduction allowable in respect of expenses which are &ldquo;wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of the employment&rdquo;.  That is applied under a schedule in an earlier Income Tax Act.  I understand it is the practice of the Revenue Commissioners to agree with the representatives of the various categories of workers the adoption of flat rate expenses for certain employments and, in arriving at those flat rates, they take into account the conditions prevailing in the particular employments.  The <Col N="1413" /> present allowance agreed in the case of miners varies from £150 a year in the case of colliers to £45 a year in the case of shunters and labourers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will accept that miners acknowledge that they must pay a proper share of tax but, in view of the development of the mining industry, the Taoiseach should consider the fact that the flat rate allowances do not take account of the special hazards involved and the limited working expectation by comparison with people in other occupations earning similar stipends.  Because of the hazards and the inevitably dirty nature of the work, ill-health is a factor which should encourage the Government to consider increasing the allowances to ensure a better rate of productivity which is, at the moment, a matter of concern in the mines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, as I have said, a special allowance of £150 a year in the case of colliers and £45 a year in the case of shunters and labourers. These have been agreed between the representatives of the workers and the Revenue Commissioners and, so far as I am aware, there have been no recent representations to have those allowances revised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If such representations are made on behalf of a representative <Col N="1414" /> group of miners, now that our mining industry is developing considerably, would the Taoiseach agree to full and effective consideration being given to an increase in the flat rate allowance in the interests both of the miners and of the economy?</P>

      <P>While the Deputy's question uses the term, &ldquo;commodities subject to VAT&rdquo; I assume that he has in mind all goods and services liable to VAT, since many services, such as car repairs and hotel meals, involve the supply of goods.

      <P>Following is the announcement:</P>
      <P>Today's Press carries reports of the final decisions taken in Luxembourg with regard to increases in EEC farm prices.  In the ordinary course these increases, together with the increases resulting from the recent green £ change, would have an immediate effect on the prices to domestic consumers of dairy products. As the Minister for Finance made clear in his budget speech in January last, the Government are concerned not only to ease the strain caused to the weekly family budget by such price increases but also to curb the rate of inflation and provide more favourable conditions for pay restraint.  This was the purpose of the large global amount of £48 million provided in the budget for food subsidies.  The Government now propose to increase the subsidies further so as to ensure that the EEC adjustments in dairy product prices will not affect consumers at home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary would explain what exactly is the improvement which this amendment hopes to achieve.  As the subsection stands at the moment it reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1435" /> (3) (a) Any person may, upon giving notice of the application to any person against whom the order the subject of the application is sought, apply to the High Court for, and may, at the discretion of that Court, be granted, an order prohibiting the publication, or the further publication, of an advertisement the publication of which is or would be a contravention of subsection (1) of this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment in the name of Deputy O'Malley is crucial to the section.  As section 8 stands at the moment it is open to any person to undertake a procedure under the section in regard to an advertisement which he does not like.  One can see the dangers inherent in that situation. It is quite possible for people to take frivolous or vexatious actions in the courts.  Business people, individuals or firms could, as a cold matter of business, undertake an action against a rival business concern to cause the maximum amount of trouble and difficulty or to delay a sales campaign to their own advantage.</P>

    <P>Deputy O'Malley's amendment is trying to bring some sort of common sense into the situation.  He suggests that before anybody can move under section 8 to have an advertisement interfered with they should have the consent of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  It seems a very reasonable precaution.  The Director of Consumer Affairs will assume a central position in consumer legislation from here on. In our general approach to this Bill we feel that he has not been made into a sufficiently important person by the legislation.  However that is something <Col N="1436" /> that can be improved upon as time goes on.  The way public opinion is moving, somebody like the Director of Consumer Affairs will occupy an important position in this area.</P>
    <P>We believe that is would be a very valuable safeguard if the Director of Consumer Affairs had to give his consent before an action could be undertaken by a member of the public.  It is not difficult to imagine how section 8 could be abused.  Our society, like any other, contains its quota of cranks and persons who have their own hobby horses to ride; and this section could be abused by such people.  As well as that, unscrupulous business people could use the section to seriously and unfairly disadvantage their competitors. It is reasonable to suggest that before an action could be undertaken the Director of Consumer Affairs, having looked at the situation and having assessed the merits, should give his consent.</P>
    <P>It might be argued that this would take from the freedom of action of the courts, but I do not believe it would. I assume that anybody aggrieved by a decision of the Director of Consumer Affairs not to grant consent could appeal that decision to the courts and could seek an order of <i>mendamus</i>, or whatever, against the director compelling him to give his consent.  Therefore, in that way, in a realistic sense it would not take from the powers, the dignity or the status of the courts, but it could serve as a useful protection and it could ensure that the provisions of section 8 would not be frivolously or vexatiously availed of by irresponsible people seeking their own interests.</P>

      <P>In reply to the point raised by Deputy Haughey in relation to amendment No. 15, amendments Nos. 15 and 17 should be read together. The difference between the section as it stands and when amendment No. 15 is inserted is the removal of the following words:</P>
      <P>... upon giving notice of the application to any person against whom the order the subject of the application is sought,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In combining amendments Nos. 15 and 17, the provision in relation to notice <Col N="1437" /> is moved down and is put in by amendment No. 17 under a separate subheading.  This is essentially a drafting or presentational amendment.  The change has no major legal or policy significance.  It is purely to separate the statement of the right, in the first case, in subsection 3 (a) and the conditions applying to it, which are set out in subsection 3 (b).</P>
    <P>In relation to the provision for the seeking of an injunction, an injunction may only be obtained where not the individual but the court is satisfied that the advertisement in relation to the supply or provision of goods services or facilities is likely to mislead and thereby cause loss, damage or injury to members of the public to a material degree.  It is only if the applicant has satisfied the court that it is such an advertisement that an injunction would be granted.  It is not simply a matter of people being able to stop advertisements just because they do not like them.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, this provision in relation to giving an ordinary member of the public a right to seek an injunction against a misleading advertisement which is damaging to the public was recommended for inclusion in this legislation by the National Consumer Advisory Council, which gave the whole subject exhaustive consideration.  I am not sure that it was a unanimous recommendation, but this council are a widely representative body and their recommendation in this matter deserves attention.  If the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Malley were to be accepted, in effect it would be the judgment of one official which would determine whether or not this power would be used in any extensive way. However good or important the Director of Consumer Affairs may be, it is not desirable that he alone should be the filter through which such rights should be exercised.  It is imposing a great burden on him.</P>
    <P>In relation to misleading advertisements, there is merit in having a degree of private enforcement.  One does not have to go too far to realise that many parts of our legislation can become dormant, not by reason of the <Col N="1438" /> will of the Legislature but by virtue of a growing administrative practice of not paying attention to certain provisions. The ability of an ordinary member of the public to go direct to the courts in respect of a matter that is contrary to the provisions of this legislation provides a barrier against a situation arising in which certain areas of advertising practice might cease to be the subject of scrutiny in the event of their being misleading. Subjects might be brought to light in this way which otherwise might not come to attention.  The existence of this alternative whereby a person who publishes a misleading advertisement may be brought to task will ensure that advertisers will take even greater care to establish, before publication, the truth of their advertisements, than if they were to deal only with the director, with whom they might be able to reach an understanding acceptable to both but not in all cases in the best interest of the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary would appear to be talking about the merits of the section.  Should he not be talking about the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the merits of allowing direct access to the courts by ordinary members of the public in respect of the type of practice we are discussing.  We are talking of a situation in which there would not be the necessity of seeking first the consent of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  Everything I am saying is directed towards demonstrating that the requirement that the prior consent of the director be obtained is not good in terms of public policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the use, in a vexatious manner, of the powers of the section, I would point out that in subsection (3) (b) provision is made whereby the court may require a person making an application for an injunction to give an undertaking as to damages and to the lodgment of money in court. The courts are very jealous of their privileges and are very anxious that legislative powers not be used in a vexatious manner.  If they had any grounds for suspicion that an application <Col N="1439" /> was vexatious it is likely that they would make a requirement for the lodgment of money so that in the event of the application being vexatious and the advertiser suffering damage as a result, there would be some fund from which he could be compensated for loss and also that by virtue of the existence of this provision there would be a barrier against a person who was not serious about the matter and who did not have real grounds for fearing that the public would be damaged to a material degree.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind, too, that by virtue of the provisions of amendment No. 17, even in the case of interlocutory or interim injunctions&mdash;this is not the case in respect of this provision &mdash;in the normal course of law notice will be required to be given to the advertiser in all cases.  Therefore, there is no danger of a person pulling a fast one so to speak, by the use of the powers contained in this section.  I might reiterate that the undertaking as to damages, which is a powerful provision, will be useful particularly in the case of vexatious actions which might be taken by trade competitors.  The introduction of a further layer of administration in the process whereby a person would have to obtain initially the consent of the director would lead to greater delay and uncertainty.  It would mean that advertisements would be under a cloud for a longer time because in the first place there would have to be an investigation of the application to seek an injunction and the director would have to be satisfied that there was scientific information as to whether there was a <i>prima facie</i> case. During this period of uncertainty the person carrying the advertisement would not know whether he was right or wrong and when that process of investigation had been completed a similar process would have to be gone through by the courts.  The section, without Deputy O'Malley's amendment, would be much more beneficial from the point of view of the advertiser in that a decision would be reached relatively quickly.</P>
    <P>The safeguard I have outlined in <Col N="1440" /> relation to the lodgment of money in court and also the safeguard in relation to the requirement that adequate notice be given in all cases mean in effect that the provision will not be used in a vexatious manner and that the additional power of allowing the ordinary individual to proceed direct to the court where he can show that matter is likely to cause damage to the public is an additional strength to the legislation and will mean that great care will be taken by advertisers to ensure the veracity of their advertisements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>To take first the last point made by the Parliamentary Secretary, he seemed to be putting forward two different arguments.  On the one hand he says that the provision whereby a private individual can go to the courts is something new and wonderful, something that will be of great benefit, but on the other hand he says that the onerous provision in paragraph (b) of subsection (3) whereby anybody proceeding to act under section 8 has to give a guarantee about damages will inhibit people from taking these sort of actions.  What does the Parliamentary Secretary want?  Is he putting forward this section on the basis that it is a great new advance which heralds a tremendous initiative in that ordinary individuals can go direct to the courts or is he putting forward the case that the penalty provisions of the subsection are very important and will prevent people going to the courts and taking actions of this kind?  However, this is something about which the Parliamentary Secretary may make up his mind and then let us know which argument he is putting forward.</P>
      <P>There are a number of matters involved in these different amendments. Perhaps it was a mistake for us to take them together but I shall try to sort them out, at least in my own mind, whatever about the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's amendments Nos. 15 and 17 are designed to bring about a change.  At the moment the section provides quite simply that anybody can go along to the courts and ask the courts to take certain action about advertisements which are misleading. <Col N="1441" /> Before doing that he must notify the advertiser of his intentions.  That seems to me to be a sensible and straightforward way to deal with this.  If I want to object to an advertisement and go to the courts to have something done about it, then in all fairness I must go along to the person who inserted the advertisement and tell him that I am going to court to object to the advertisement.  This gives that person the opportunity to go into court and argue the case for the advertisement. That is the original section and it would seem to me to be sensible and fair, but the effect of these two amendments would change that situation considerably.</P>
    <P>If these two amendments are adopted by the House it will mean that Mr. X can go into court and argue about an advertisement which he claims is misleading and until the judge comes to the point of making an order the person who inserted the advertisement need know nothing about it.  Mr. X, the opponent of the advertisement, can have the court to himself and put forward any argument he likes, make any statement he likes, and the advertiser will have no opportunity of rebutting those arguments or statements until the judge decides that he will make an order.  Surely that is a rather convoluted and complicated way of proceeding.  Would it not be better if both parties were in the court from the outset so that when one man puts forward an argument the other would be in a position to rebut it?  The new phraseology will mean that any individual, possibly a rival or competitor, can have the ear of the court fully to himself and the advertiser need know nothing about the proceedings. Only when the judge thinks he should make an order, an interim or interlocutory injunction can the advertiser be called upon.  At that stage he is at a serious disadvantage.  The judge has probably been swayed and has made up his mind to make an order.  The unfortunate advertiser then has to try to undo the impression which has been formed in the mind of the judge.  I see that demerit in the changes proposed by these two amendments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1442" /> I refer now to Deputy O'Malley's amendment, and I want to quote what the Confederation of Irish Industry have said in their <i>Newsletter</i> on the 12th April, Volume 27, No. 2.  They have a very short factual statement about this piece of legislation.  I do not think even they would argue that they have examined the legislation in depth but in their review of the legislation they state:</P>
    <P>Regarding the power to stop advertisements, advertisers must be adequately protected against frivolous or mischievous actions, by consumers or competitors.</P>
    <P>We would all accept that.  Despite what the Parliamentary Secretary's socialist friends opposite may think, most business people are decent, honest, straighforward people and the vast majority will be putting in straightforward, reasonable, honest advertisements. They are entitled not to be set upon unfairly either by frivolous or vexatious members of the general public or by competitors seeking their own advantage.  At the moment the section leaves it wide open for anyone to initiate one of these actions.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary relied very heavily on the provisions of paragraph (b).  He said that the provisions of paragraph (b) would inhibit persons from taking these actions because it envisages a situation where the court would require persons to give an undertaking as to damages and lodge money in court in support of such an undertaking.  That is all very well as far as it goes, but let us look more closely at paragraph (b).  In general it need not necessarily inhibit a business competitor.  The undertaking as to damages and the lodging of money in court might not be of any significance to a large competitor.  It might be well worth their while to give the undertaking and to lodge the money in court if they could seriously interrupt or delay a sales or advertising campaign or promotion by a rival.  One could imagine a situation where a campaign would have to take place in the spring for the summer trade or in the summer for the autumn trade.  If a rival could succeed in delaying such a campaign it could be <Col N="1443" /> rendered completely ineffective because the period in question would have passed.  It might be well worth while for a competitor to take such action even though he might be compelled to give an undertaking and to lodge money in court.  I admit that the provisions of paragraph (b) might have an inhibiting influence on an ordinary member of the general public who might be simply riding a hobby horse or indulging his whims.  In such a case the intimidatory provisions of paragraph (b) might have some effect, but I do not think they would have any effect on business people.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary can rely on the provisions of paragraph (b) as heavily as he has done in his reply to me.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary seemed to infer that paragraph (b) of section 8 (3) gives the power to the court to demand an undertaking in support of which money would be lodged.  It does not.  Paragraph (b) states that where the court wants an undertaking it can demand money in support of that.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us where it is stated that the court can demand such an undertaking. Admittedly paragraph (b) gives the court the power to demand the lodgment of money in support of an undertaking, but where is the power to demand an undertaking in the first place?  It may be in the general power of the court.  It may be something which the courts are empowered to do by virtue of the rules of court or something like that. If that is so I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me, because it is not in this legislation.  I cannot find in this legislation any specific power conferred on the courts to demand an undertaking in relation to the operation of section 8.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said it would be undesirable that one person, the Director of Consumer Affairs, should have the power to inhibit the taking of actions under section 8.  I do not think that is a very persuasive argument.  The person to whom the Parliamentary Secretary refers, the Director of Consumer Affairs, is not just <Col N="1444" /> any old individual; he will be a statutory person with very important statutory duties.  Let us look for a moment at section 9 and the sort of person he is going to be.  Section 9 (5) sets out the functions of this new director and one of those functions is to keep under general review practices or proposed practices in relation to the advertising of and the provision to members of the public of information in relation to and descriptions of goods, services, accommodation and facilities.  First, he will have to keep this situation under review&mdash;advertising practices, the sort of thing we are dealing with in section 8&mdash;and he will have to request persons&mdash;this is in paragraph (c) of subsection (5)&mdash;engaging in or proposing to engage in such practices that are, or are likely to be, misleading to members of the public in a material matter, to discontinue or refrain from such practices.</P>
    <P>Here is this man, this new statutory creation and he will have this power to ask people to cease engaging in certain advertising practices which he does not like&mdash;there are no courts involved at this stage.  How can the Parliamentary Secretary, who is prepared to confer that power on this director, object to him because he is just the one individual&mdash;having the power Deputy O'Malley proposes to give him?  If he can tell people to cease a particular type of advertising&mdash;and of his own volition he can do that under section 9&mdash;how can the Parliamentary Secretary object to his having the right to examine one of these applications to the court and to say it is frivolous or vexatious?  I think the Parliamentary Secretary is making an untenable argument in that respect.  If he were to say: we cannot have any single individual given this power to stop these applications by individual citizens to the court, I would have to listen to it, but we are not talking about an individual at random; we are talking about a statutory person who already has major powers equivalent to the powers of the court under this legislation.</P>
    <P>If I were putting down this amendment which Deputy O'Malley has put down I would go further.  He is prepared to envisage a situation where a <Col N="1445" /> person about to take one of these actions would have the consent of the director.  I would be inclined to say that where an individual member of the public or a business competitor was perturbed about a particular advertisement he would have to go in the first instance to the Director of Consumer Affairs and ask him to act and only then, if the director refused to act, would he have the right to go to the courts.  That would be a far more sensible way of proceeding.  Particularly when you are establishing this new creature of the statute, giving him these powers I think we should go the full distance and say that if anybody has a grievance he should first go to the director and only if he is unwilling, unable or unprepared to act, only then would one have the right to go to court. The very least the Parliamentary Secretary should accept is what Deputy O'Malley proposes, namely, that as a protection for legitimate, honest, straightforward, business people and firms, to protect them from unscrupulous competitors or from members of the public who are irresponsible or frivolous or vexatious, first the Director of Consumer Affairs should consider the matter and say whether he is prepared to let the court decide it or alternatively that there is no case and that he would not be prepared to give a certificate to go ahead with the matter, particularly because we must always recognise that even if Deputy O'Malley's amendment is accepted and even if the consent in writing of the Director of Consumer Affairs is necessary before one can go to the court under section 8, there would always be the provision under the general law that if a person is refused permission to go to court by the director he can still go to court and ask that the director be mandamused or whatever the procedure is to give the necessary consent.</P>
    <P>There are many things involved in these three amendments.  I hope I have put my viewpoint on the different aspects of them clearly to the Parliamentary Secretary and I would be grateful if he would reply to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The important point <Col N="1446" /> here is that the fact that an injunction has been sought or an application has been made for an injunction or, indeed, that the hearing of the application is in progress does not mean that the advertising must cease or should cease or would be under any pressure to cease.  The advertiser is perfectly in order in going ahead with it and if it is an advertisement which, for instance, is dealing with a seasonal trade as Deputy Haughey mentioned, it would obviously be wise for him to continue his campaign in these circumstances and no doubt he would do so.  He would only cease and there would only be an incentive for him to cease if an injunction had been granted.  It should be realised in this context that there is nothing lost by the advertiser in going ahead with the advertisement pending the hearing. He is not likely, as in a civil action where damage might be in question, by continuing the advertisement to aggravate the offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>But the newspapers might not accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a question of an offence; it is a very net issue; should the advertisement be stopped or not?  The judge is not empowered to award anything to the applicant other than simply stopping the advertisement. He cannot go back and award damages against the advertiser for having continued in the interim.  I believe that in most cases those concerned will continue their advertising campaigns.  Far greater loss could be suffered if any other procedure were adopted.  This is the most expeditious manner of dealing with the matter.  If there has to be an investigation in the first place by the Director of Consumer Affairs and another investigation by the court, this will delay the whole proceedings and if there is any danger that the advertiser might feel of his own volition that he was not anxious to go ahead, that period in which he would be uncertain would be prolonged by the acceptance of Deputy O'Malley's amendment and the introduction of this further layer of consent by the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1447" /> This is law which is enacted for the benefit of the whole public.  To my mind it is not desirable that the interpretation of the law by the director, or by the Minister, who is the other person with the power to prosecute, as to what constitutes misleading advertisements should be the predominant interpretation at all times.  It is desirable that access to the courts should exist for people who may feel the director is wrong in saying a particular advertisement is not misleading, and that he was wrong in not instituting a prosecution in that case. Such a person may hold a different interpretation which may be upheld later by the courts, while the director's interpretation, or the Minister's interpretation, might not be upheld. Such a person should have the right of direct access to the court.</P>
    <P>If Deputy O'Malley's amendment were accepted, the interpretation of the director would be superimposed on the interpretation of the individual who might seek an injunction and, unless the director agreed with the individual's interpretation of the legislation, there would be no possibility for him to proceed to the court for an injunction.  To my mind that would not be desirable.  It would lead to an unduly narrow interpretation of the legislation being enshrined in future practice by virtue of the fact that the director and the Minister would be the only people who could proceed to the courts, apart from the fact that an individual could take a prosecution under the common informer procedure, which is not likely to be used to a great extent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey asked me whether I felt on the one hand this provision was a new advance and I was arguing for it, or on the other hand I was arguing that it was not as bad as all that, and the inhibitions which are there are a good safeguard.  He felt I was riding two horses at once in that context.  I do not believe that is a sustainable criticism, because the courts will decide in each individual case which interpretation to put on a particular application.  If the courts feel inhibitions are necessary the power is <Col N="1448" /> there under paragraph (b) to impose the lodgment of very substantial securites and undertakings as to damages. If, in their freedom, the courts decide the matter should be heard without these provisions, in other words if they apply the former view, the idea of its being a new and valuable civil right, to the matter in a particular case, they will decide to allow the individual to proceed with the application directly to the courts, perhaps without the requirement for the lodgment of securities as provided for under paragraph (b).</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey asked me whether there is any statutory base for the power of the High Court to seek an undertaking as to damages.  He said such a power is not provided in this legislation.  That is true but, while I cannot produce chapter and verse, the provision whereby the courts may seek an undertaking as to damages is a general power, to my mind, which the courts have under the general courts of justice legislation, and there is no need to provide for their having such a power specifically in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As we say, fair play to him, the Parliamentary Secretary has endeavoured to reply to some of the points I put forward, but I am sure he will accept he has not done so to my satisfaction.  In his first remarks he conveyed to me and to the House the impression that subsection (3) (b) was a very powerful inhibitor and, because of its provisions, it would prevent vexatious or frivolous appeals under the section to the courts.  When we look at subsection (3) (b) it is quite clear that it does not do anything of the sort.  It merely buttresses up something we think may exist elsewhere, but we are not too sure of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (3) (b) talks about the circumstances where the High Court demands an undertaking about damages and suggests that the courts shall have the power, where they are demanding such an undertaking about damages to demand the lodgment of money in court in support of such an undertaking.  That is all it does.  It can come into operation only where the court has already decided and asked for an undertaking about damages. <Col N="1449" /> What I want to know is from whence derives that power of the court to demand an undertaking about damages.</P>
    <P>We all know from reading our newspapers that district justices, Circuit Court judges and other members of the judiciary from time to time demand certain undertakings from accused persons.  They are wont to use Victorian terminology in those institutions and they say: &ldquo;My good man, I will be prepared to deal leniently with you if you will give me an undertaking that you will not see Miss X again.&rdquo;  We know about that sort of undertaking.  We are not quite sure whether the district justice has the statutory or legal authority to demand such an undertaking from the good man in question, but we read in our newspapers that these undertakings are sought by judges from time to time from accused persons.</P>
    <P>I suppose these proceedings have a certain criminal tinge about them, but basically they are civil proceedings. We are envisaging a situation where a court will demand an undertaking about damages.  This is a much more serious matter.  The court is requiring the person coming before it to give some sort of an undertaking about damages and, in support of that undertaking, to lodge money in court &mdash;a very serious business.  I want to know from whence derives the power of the High Court to demand that undertaking.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it can exist in the Rules of Court as they stand at the moment.  The Rules of Court do not know anything about this legislation because it was not in existence when the Rules of Court under which we are operating were drawn up.  This legislation is creating a new situation and it would be desirable in those circumstances that the legislation itself would set out specifically the power of the court to demand this undertaking about damages.</P>
    <P>We are talking here only about damages arising out of actions under section 8 of this Bill.  This is a new situation and, therefore, it cannot be covered by any existing power of the courts in my view.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to do one of <Col N="1450" /> two things: either to point out specifically to me where this power of the High Court exists to demand these undertakings, or else to agree to spell out specifically in this legislation that the High Court can demand them.</P>
    <P>It seems very odd to confer specific power on the court in this legislation to demand the lodgment of money in support of the undertaking and not to confer the specific power to demand the undertaking itself.  The Parliamentary Secretary may tell me that the power to demand these undertakings exists in the general corpus of power which the court has, but one would have thought that would have applied to the demand to lodge money in support of the undertaking.  The fact that the legislation has to provide specifically the power for the demanding of the lodgment of the money seems to indicate that the legislation should also specifically set out the power of the court to demand the undertaking. I would be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary would clear up that point for us.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is on very weak ground in his attempt to keep the Director of Consumer Affairs out of section 8.  He said we might get a restricted and distorted operation of the legislation if the Director of Consumer Affairs had to give the consent Deputy O'Malley demanded. That is not arguable because the Director of Consumer Affairs is central to this legislation.  He is being conferred with all kinds of functions. He is being given the right to form opinions, to assess matters and to act on the basis of his assessment of situations and practices.  Therefore it is not tenable to suggest that it would be detrimental to give him power to intervene in the operation of section 8.</P>
    <P>Why should the director, who is being given wide responsibilities in consumer affairs, be by-passed in this one instance, particularly in the case of the new machinery set up under section 8?  All of us must recognise that this can be dangerous.  The section is valuable.  It is providing a new type of machinery and the Bill would be lacking in effectiveness if <Col N="1451" /> the section were not included.  People can go to the court and seek to have something done about misleading advertisements.  In the normal course of events it will be the Director of Consumer Affairs who will deal with these matters.  He has the power to ask people to stop engaging in certain advertising practices without going to any court and he also has the power to institute proceedings in the High Court.  He is the central figure in the new situation being created by this legislation and he has been given farreaching powers and functions under section 9.  Why it should be so serious and detrimental a matter in the Parliamentary Secretary's opinion that he should have to give his agreement for the taking of an action under section 8 is something I do not understand.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is valuable and important. All of us realise that it is necessary to have some such machinery as this section provides, but it creates certain dangers.  As I have pointed out already, the Confederation of Irish Industry have alerted us to these dangers.  They have said it is important that advertisers be adequately protected against frivolous or mischievous actions by consumers or competitors, and we accept that.  The section is an important new departure, but there is a danger in it.  If the safeguard suggested by Deputy O'Malley were accepted we would have a very good section.  It would be just as effective, but there would be the safeguard that frivolous and vexatious actions by competitors or by irresponsible members of the general public would be prevented because the Director of Consumer Affairs would have to give <i>prima facie</i> authority for the taking of the action.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, the only real argument put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary was the question of delay.  He has said that if somebody does not like an advertisement in the newspapers or in the media and wants to object to it instead of walking straight into the court he will first have to go to the Director of Consumer Affairs and that that will delay him in taking action.  I do not think that argument <Col N="1452" /> is a real one but even if it were I think it would be worthwhile that somebody in such a case would have to endure the little delay involved rather than having the gates thrown wide open to all kinds of frivolous and vexatious actions by irresponsible members of the public or by business competitors.  I do not think there need be delay of any substance.  The courts these days are not the most speedy and expeditious institutions we have and that is where any delay that might occur will take place.</P>
    <P>I should imagine that once the Director of Consumer Affairs is established he will be able to deal with an application by a member of the general public in a day.  He does not have to go into the merits of the application because that will be for the court to decide.  He will have to look at the situation and see whether the matter on its face is <i>prima facie</i> vexatious or frivolous or whether it is well grounded. He does not have to give a judicial opinion; he merely has to give a <i>prima facie</i> view whether the matter merits the time of the court.  To that extent the director will be helping in the operation of the court and will succeed in keeping from them frivolous and unimportant objections by people who are pursuing their own advantage or who are irresponsible. What we are suggesting would be a valuable safeguard to section 8 and it would take out of it the little danger that we see existing in the machinery which the section proposes to establish.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary did not deal with my point about the change the amendments are making&mdash;at least he did not deal with it to my satisfaction. As I see it, under the new procedure if a person wants to complain about an advertisement he can go straight into the court and he can start unfolding his tale, persuading the court that the advertisement should be stopped.  The advertiser will know nothing about it until the complainant has had a full opportunity of persuading the judge as to the validity of his objection.  Not hearing the other side of the case, the judge will come to the point of making an order but by that time he will have been influenced or swayed by the complainant.  Surely <Col N="1453" /> the advertiser is placed in a disadvantaged situation if it is only at that point, when the judge is about to make the order, that he is informed?  Presumably he can then try to turn round the judge's mind and get him to come to an opposite decision and not make the order.  I cannot see how that is a better or fairer procedure than the procedure originally set out in the Bill.</P>

      <P>As far as Deputy Haughey's last point is concerned, I probably did not answer it adequately originally.  There might be something to be said for doing something about the point he made.  According to a strict reading of the matter&mdash;although in practice I do not think it would make any difference&mdash;it is correct that the new amendment will say that an order shall not be made by the High Court for the purpose of this section unless notice of application therefor has been given to any person against whom the order is being sought.  In other words, notice would have to be given before the order is made rather than before the time the judge first hears about the matter.</P>
      <P>In practice however, one can be assured that judges will not hear a case of this nature without being satisfied that notice has been given to the other party, in view of the wording of the section.  However, there might be something to be said for making that somewhat more explicit.  I ask the House to accept the amendments as they stand and I assure Deputies that I will have further investigation made in consultation with my legal advisers as to whether there would be any good purpose served by changing the matter to meet Deputy Haughey's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against his point there is the consideration that in some restricted circumstances, where a matter is crying out for action, the judge should at least hear the case without making the injunction before notice has been given. I cannot envisage such cases too readily and I am not sure it would be desirable that such a case should be heard, let alone decided, without notice having been given first.  To that extent, while there would be something foregone in the case of extreme urgency where the judge wants to at least hear <Col N="1454" /> the case, I would tend to side with Deputy Haughey that it would probably be better to make that point clearer.  I would not like to amend this on my feet.  I would prefer to have this amendment accepted and if having consulted with my legal advisers, I can be satisfied that nothing substantial would be lost by meeting Deputy Haughey's point, I will meet it.  I do not have Deputy Haughey's confidence in the desirability of conferring all power in this matter on the director, save that the applicant has the right to seek a <i>mandamus</i>.  We must look at the wording of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for his reply on amendments Nos. 15 and 17.  Perhaps at this stage we could get them out of the way.  When the Parliamentary Secretary is considering the matter further, as he promised, will he also bear this point in mind?  I meant to say this originally but overlooked it. One danger inherent in the applicant being allowed to go into court and make his case without the other party being notified is that we are dealing here with commercial operations&mdash; goods, services and so on.  The complainant might have an opportunity in court of making all sorts of derogatory references to his rival's products without the advertiser having the opportunity to reply to them.  This is another aspect of the matter which the Parliamentary Secretary might keep in mind when he is having another look at it. Subject to that, we can agree to amendments Nos. 15 and 17.</P>

      <P>I would prefer to come back on this.  I may not have given a perfectly correct answer in this matter because the distinction here is between making the order and having a hearing. It is possible in the extreme case I mentioned that, while notice would have been given to both parties, the order might be granted without a hearing. If that is the case the provisions of amendment No. 17 would operate to ensure that notice had been given in the first place.  I am not entirely satisfied that I can speak with authority about the circumstances in which a <Col N="1455" /> matter of this nature would be dealt with without a hearing and it is to satisfy myself on that point that I have asked that some time be given to consult with my legal advisers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now deal with Deputy O'Malley's amendment.  We should come back to basic principles as to what is at stake here.  It is the right of an individual to go to the courts&mdash; in this case the High Court&mdash;and to satisfy the courts that a particular advertisement should be stopped because it is likely to mislead and thereby cause loss, damage or injury to members of the public.  He must satisfy the courts, which are an independent body and are a good deal more judicial than the Director of Consumer Affairs, before the injunction will be granted.  The only remedy he can get is an injunction that the advertisement stop or that the words used in the advertisement cease to be used.  The advertisement could continue with an amendment removing the misleading part.  That is all.  The firm would not be prevented from coming out with another advertisement which did not contain those defects or misleading material.  It would not ruin their advertising campaign for the season.  It would mean merely that they would have to change the campaign to the extent necessary to ensure that it was not misleading to the public in a way which their previous advertisements had been decided to be misleading, not by the applicant but by the court, which is an independent body which will look at this matter in a very objective way. Many of the fears expressed by Deputy Haughey take insufficient account of the fact that the court will <Col N="1456" /> be very sparing in the use of powers such as these, to ensure that it will not be accused of being, in any sense, the assistant of vexation.  It is not. Obviously it is going to be extremely careful in a matter such as this and we can have confidence that the difficulties envisaged by the Deputy will not arise because of the care of the court in a matter of this sort.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's proposal is that rather than that the individual should go direct to the court and have the matter dealt with in a judicial manner, he should have to go first to the director to get his consent.  I do not believe that the director, no matter how independent, how wide his functions, how well he is staffed and no matter how good a person he is in every way, should be the sole arbiter of the public good.  That would not be a justifiable provision to make.  We must bear in mind the sort of work in which he will be engaging.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I may put forward a hypothetical situation which could be considered in this context.  The director might, in the exercise of either his functions under this legislation or others subsequently conferred on him, wish to persuade, perhaps in the absence of statutory power, a particular firm to do a particular thing in one aspect of their operations in the general interest.  The firm know he cannot force them to do it because, in the hypothetical matter about which we are speaking, he does not have statutory power.  Given that the director has such powers&mdash;for instance, he already has power to seek codes of practice and so on which have no necessary statutory force&mdash;is it not likely that he would find himself in a position of wishing to make a deal with a particular firm to achieve a result which, in the overall, would be desirable and beneficial to the public at large?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is tearing his own Bill to bits now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the fact that he would be looking not at the individual case of a particular consumer but rather at the general code it might not <Col N="1457" /> be desirable that he alone be the person who can decide whether or not a person should take a particular firm to court perhaps in an entirely different matter, that the director should, in all cases, be interposed and be in a position to prevent the person from obtaining access to the courts.</P>
      <P>The requirement in Deputy O'Malley's amendment is quite bald. It simply says that the director must give his consent in writing.  It does not say anything about the grounds on which the director might refuse consent.  It does not say that in all cases those grounds must be reasonable. It is more desirable to avoid the type of situation I posed in my hypothetical example, that the aggrieved party should have direct application to somebody who is not involved in any sense in the market place, either for his own individual good or for that of the public at large, but have direct access to the courts which are entirely independent of all these types of pressures the best of us might find ourselves subjected to in the exercise of our office in the interests of the public at large.  The courts are not subject to such pressures. I believe it is better that the individual should have direct access to the court so that he may satisfy the court, in its independent judgment, that a particular advertisement is&mdash;if it is&mdash;misleading to the public to a material degree and that if he does that, then an injunction could be granted.  I believe, therefore, that the interposition of this further layer, apart from the delays I mentioned earlier of consent by the director, would not serve a good purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of general comment at the outset, I believe that when a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary starts to put forward this sort of argument&mdash;that we can rely on the good sense of the courts&mdash;he is automatically admitting the weakness of his legislation.  We all know the courts are there, they are independent, that we have an excellent judiciary in whom we have complete confidence. Let us take all that for granted.  We are dealing here with legislation and the courts interpret the legislation we <Col N="1458" /> send down to them.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows as well as I do that a judge very often says: I wish the law was otherwise but what is written here in front of me says so-and-so, and I am bound by that.  It is an acknowledgment of defeat to me when a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary has to start arguing that the courts will be very sensible about this; the courts will take a broad view of it; they will be very careful not to do this, that or the other.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that that is no defence. We must legislate.  The courts will then interpret our legislation in relation to any case coming before them.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that what Deputy O'Malley is trying to achieve here is worth while and sensible.  This is a good section; hopefully it will be valuable and important but it has inherent dangers. Why will the Parliamentary Secretary not accept this simple safeguard proposed by Deputy O'Malley to make the section as near perfect as we can make it and not rely on the generality of impartiality, fairness, goodwill and so on which we believe the courts possess?  Can we not spell it out in the Bill?</P>
      <P>We continue to argue at two different points.  I want to deal first of all with the one about the Director of Consumer Information intervening. The Parliamentary Secretary does himself a grievous disfavour by suggesting that the Director of Consumer Affairs we are now going to establish, a statutory person&mdash;giving him all sorts of new functions, duties and responsibilities&mdash;might be compromised in a given situation.  He is already envisaging this new pristine, statutory creature&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and is crediting him with attributes of compromise, trading and free dealing.  The Parliamentary Secretary should withdraw that argument.  Admittedly he said it was only hypothetical but he should not even put it forward in a hypothetical context.  Anyway, it will not arise.  This new Director of Consumer <Col N="1459" /> Affairs will be a fairly powerful person.  Even when he is only requesting people to do things under section 9, subsection (8) affords him plenty of power to ensure that his requests are fairly effective instruments.  Therefore, there is no question of the new Director of Consumer Affairs having to wheel and deal with big business or commercial concerns in the way the Parliamentary Secretary suggests.  That will not arise.  He takes from the value of the legislation by suggesting it ever could arise.  To be fair to the Parliamentary Secretary we will forget that suggestion was ever made.</P>
      <P>Our amendment does not propose to give total dictatorial power to the new director.  All we are saying is that instead of having this unrestricted access to the courts there should be some screening process and we are suggesting that the <i>imprimatur</i> of the director should be placed on the application before it gets to the court.  The Parliamentary Secretary admits that would not cut out the courts completely because anybody denied the consent of the director could still go to the court and demand that the director give the necessary consent.</P>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary suggests that Deputy O'Malley's amendment is too bald and if he is prepared to accept the amendment in principle, we can on Report Stage amplify it, qualify it a little or spell it out in greater detail.  Our argument is on the principle, not the wording.  The Parliamentary Secretary's main argument is that we should not insert the director as an additional step the complainant would have to take.  I do not know whether he is suggesting that we should not have the director interposed for the reason that it would delay matters or produce additional bureaucratic inhibition. Whether it is either, I think it would be worth while to have it as a protection, a safeguard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even from the point of view of the courts themselves, it would be desirable not to have anybody who impulsively feels like having a field day at the expense of the advertiser being free to do so without this precautionary provision in the Bill.  The Parliamentary <Col N="1460" /> Secretary has agreed to take further advice on his amendments Nos. 15 and 17.  We are grateful for that, but he should keep in mind that even as the two amendments are framed there can be a hearing, the complainant can attack the advertiser in court, and he should remember that the public are very sensitive about particular products.  You only have to whisper that word &ldquo;cancer&rdquo; and you can kill a product.</P>
    <P>A complainant has only to go to court and if he has one day to himself there without the advertiser having the right to reply, the complainant could do irreparable damage to a product.  He could destroy a product before the advertiser would have a chance to catch up.  Our argument is that both sides should have the right to be there at the start.  No matter how the Parliamentary Secretary interprets the wording or tries to conceal the facts, if we adopt amendments Nos. 15 and 17 it will be possible for a complainant to go to court and have one or two days knocking a particular product before the advertiser will get a chance to reply.  That is the unfairness of the position.  The complainant would have the newspapers to himself in his attempt to knock his competitor's product. He could have a field day at the expense of his competitor who would never get a chance to catch up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be clear on this.  I accept that no order can be made because before making an order the judge must notify the advertiser, but the complainant will have been in court making a case and, more important, disseminating to the public all sorts of things about the product he is complaining about.  In ordinary common justice it is only fair that both parties should be in court from the word go.  First of all, the advertiser should have an opportunity of hearing what the complaint is and secondly an opportunity to contradict statements which he would know to be false or misleading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand the Parliamentary Secretary's approach but I am <Col N="1461" /> prepared to accept that he will get further legal advice about the situation. In the meantime he should keep these aspects in mind.  It is no good telling me that the order cannot be made before the advertiser is notified because the advertiser and the product could be destroyed by that stage.</P>

      <P>I add my voice to that of Deputy Haughey.  If such an application were heard even <i>in camera,</i> where the firm would be protected until such time as an opportunity to answer the charges had been given, it does not take the brightest person to know that any firm who wishes to damage another could get an unscrupulous person to make the complaint and go before the court and get publicity.  Therefore these amendments should be looked at from the point of view of Deputy Haughey's arguments.</P>

I do not believe that the situation which the Deputy envisages, that one party would be heard in the absence of the other, would happen.  There are already adequate safeguards to ensure it does not happen in the normal practice of the courts.  However, it is in order that I may be absolutely categoric and give chapter and verse on that point that I said I would come back but there is no feeling of lack of confidence on my part.

The Deputy criticised me for laying stress on the fact that the court would act in a responsible manner in this matter.  He felt that this, somehow or other, weakened my argument.  I do not think it does.  We are not talking about the creation of an offence but simply what procedures the court will adopt in relation to a particular matter.  If the Deputy was criticising the wording of section 8 (1) which creates a substantive issue in the case and I were to counter him by saying that the courts would interpret that intelligently then he would have validity.  However, he is criticising me on a different matter, namely, whether the court would act in a responsible manner as through their procedures for hearing cases in order that justice may be done.  He was talking about their procedures as distinct from the substantive offence or the substantive matter being heard.  There is a clear distinction and I am justified in <Col N="1463" /> making that point.  Were I not to give that assurance there might be a necessity to reproduce the High Court Rules in the Bill before we could allow any case to be heard.</P>

    <P>Here we have the situation where some person, company or firm inserts an advertisement in relation to the supply or provision of goods, services or facilities which misleads and causes loss, damage or injury to members of the general public.  That is expressed by subsection (2) to be an offence and subject to the penalties laid down elsewhere in the legislation.  Deputy O'Malley wants to go a little further to try to ensure where a misleading advertisement has been published and where the court has found in effect that the advertisement has been misleading that under the provisions of subsection (1) the director can at his own discretion order the publication of some corrective advertising to undo the damage done by the misleading advertising.  That, in my opinion, is a reasonable suggestion. Where the original advertisement has been found to be misleading it is surely only right that something be done to repair the damage.  Section 8 will ensure that a person who publishes a misleading advertisement can be stopped from continuing publication and can also be fined.  That is all right as far as it goes, but we must recognise that with the power of the modern advertising media great damage can be done by misleading advertising.  The public can be seriously and grievously misled and, even though the person concerned is stopped from continuing to put in the advertisement and fined, the damage that has been done could still remain and there could be circumstances&mdash;it is not difficult to envisage them&mdash;in which it would be entirely desirable that some corrective mechanism be undertaken and that is what we want.  That is what Deputy O'Malley wants.  He <Col N="1466" /> wants to give the director the power to undo the damage in the public mind that a misleading advertisement has created.  He also wants to ensure that the Director of Consumer Affairs has the authority to take this corrective action at the expense, and rightly so, of the person who originally caused the damage.  I think the suggestion of Deputy O'Malley's is a reasonable one.  It would help to improve the effectiveness of section 8 and I recommend it to the House.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 18 is confined to corrective advertising solely where injunction proceedings have been used and an order made by the High Court.  Amendment No. 42 deals with the possibility of corrective advertising being inserted by the person against whom criminal proceedings have been taken in the normal way by either the Minister or the director.  It is not a case of injunction proceedings which have no criminal import.  I believe the type of situation covered by amendment No. 42 is far more likely to be the usual one rather than the type of situation envisaged in this amendment.  This requires a private individual or some such person seeking an injunction rather than criminal proceedings and, secondly, it requires that that injunction be granted. I believe amendment No. 19 would constitute an open-ended danger for the person against whom an injunction was being sought.  Whereas the result in the form of an injunction is clear and net, the result of an injunction plus the requirement in this amendment that the director, an official and not a judicial person, could of his own volition seek the insertion of corrective advertising&mdash;and there is nothing said as to how much corrective advertising &mdash;is a different matter.  He could impose a huge financial burden on the person who had his advertisement changed in a relatively minor respect as a result of an injunction being granted by the High Court.  The director could conceivably impose a very substantial burden on such an individual by requiring very extensive corrective advertising disproportionate to the extent to which the public had been misled.  That is the power it is here <Col N="1467" /> envisaged the director would exercise in his own competence, and he would be able to recover the cost.  The cost could be very substantial and would not necessarily be known even at the time he made his decision.  This power could be exercised in an arbitrary manner and the amendment would make any danger there might be in the injunction proceedings far more serious because it would have as a consequence the possibility of this sort of corrective advertising being imposed. That would be dangerous.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the appropriate thing is to wait until the court has decided and then impose the requirement about corrective advertising.  It is possible the court order might be formulated in a particular way and might not be sufficiently precise.  The possibility is that an individual could get around it and actually use the court order to comply with the letter but not with the spirit of the law.  An advertiser could say that what he said in a previous advertisement was wrong and then go on to make a big issue about something else.  In that way he could use the court order as a means of publicity and gain rather than lose by it. This has happened in some other countries where this sort of subsequent requirement after hearing and penalty has been imposed, and there is no comeback even if the court feels the order has not been properly complied with.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 42 is designed to ensure there is a comeback in that the advertiser can decide on his own initiative to insert a corrective advertisement and then plead in court that he has done so and by so pleading seek mitigation of the penalties.  The court in that case would have full freedom to decide whether or not the corrective advertising was adequate and clear and seeking in good faith to correct the wrong that may have been done or whether it was merely a case of wriggling out without necessarily ensuring the public mind was in fact corrected in the impression that may have been created initially.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 42 reads:</P>
      <P>When considering what penalty (if any) under subsection (1) of this section is appropriate to an offence, the Court may take into consideration any advertisement published by or on behalf of the person convicted of the offence and correcting any misleading advertising, or any false or misleading description, statement or indication to which the offence relates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to suggest that that amendment could be improved by changing it to read: &ldquo;published or undertaken to be published&rdquo;.  The amendment as it stands is very restrictive.  It can only come into operation before the penalty is imposed.  That would seem to mean that the correction would have to be published while the proceedings in court were under way.  It could also mean of course that the judge hearing the case could postpone coming to a decision about the penalty to be imposed so that the accused person would have the opportunity of publishing this corrective advertisement envisaged in the amendment.  Surely it would equally meet the case and give a great deal more flexibility to the court if the terms of the advertisement could be submitted to the court and the accused person could undertake to publish it within a certain period.  The effect of the amendment as worded would be that the person who is going to be penalised would have to put in the <Col N="1469" /> advertisement during the course of the proceedings, and I do not think that would always be a satisfactory way of dealing with the situation.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be better if the amendment offered the alternative of the accused submitting the advertisement to the court, which he would undertake to put into the papers or publicise in a week's time or on a certain day or something of that nature.  The Parliamentary Secretary said the amendment had been very carefully drafted.  I am not so sure that he can make that claim for it, because it does seem to have this restriction inherent in it, that the advertisement must be published before the fine under section 17 is imposed.</P>
    <P>Let me look back to Deputy O'Malley's proposal.  For my own part, I would be quite prepared to substitute &ldquo;the Court&rdquo; for &ldquo;Director&rdquo; in amendment No. 18.  No doubt the House could make that alteration in the amendment verbally here if it so wished.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary has argued very persuasively against the director having this power, because he has similar powers set out under section 9.  The Parliamentary Secretary shakes his head in what I take to be contradiction of what I am saying.  However, the Director of Consumer Affairs seems to have very wide powers under section 9, powers equivalent to what Deputy O'Malley is proposing to confer on him in this amendment, as the Parliamentary Secretary will see if he studies the words of subsection (7):</P>
    <P>The Director may do all such acts or things as are necessary or expedient for the purposes of the exercise of his functions under this Act.</P>
    <P>I would certainly interpret that to mean that he has the power to direct persons to publish advertisements.  The Parliamentary Secretary's attitude to this new director is very ambivalent. On the one hand, he has built this legislation around him.  If you take this Director of Consumer Affairs away, this legislation means nothing. It is all hung out of this new statutory <Col N="1470" /> creature, the Director of Consumer Affairs.  On the other hand, any time he argues a point here, the first thing the Parliamentary Secretary does is either to denigrate this new statutory creature or else refuse to trust him in certain situations.  May we please ask the Parliamentary Secretary to make up his mind?  Is he putting this new office before us as something important, beneficial and worth while, which is going to perform a useful service, or is he completely mistrusting him before he even gets into operation?</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary bases his whole argument against Deputy O'Malley's amendment on the idea that this power has been given to the director, then I am quite prepared here and now, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to substitute in the second line of amendment No. 18 &ldquo;the Court&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;Director&rdquo;, if that would make the amendment acceptable to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I cannot see what objection there is to this proposal.  A situation is envisaged under section 8 where some person or firm misleads the general public by means of an advertisement and that offence, that act of misleading, is established in court.  Deputy O'Malley's amendment would only come into operation where the court has found in effect that an offence had been committed under section 8 whereby the public had been misled, and Deputy O'Malley wants to go on and say that in those circumstances it is only right and proper that some form of correction should be made and that the general public should be informed that what they were told in this advertisement last week or last month was misleading, to disregard it, not to act on the basis of what was said, not to buy or use the product in a certain way.  Deputy O'Malley wants the situation to be put right.  He wants the damage that has been done to be undone, and I think that is a perfectly fair procedure.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, in opposing this amendment, is on very weak ground in this way.  If he was saying that corrective advertising was useless, that there was no point in it, that it was an idle exercise, then he <Col N="1471" /> would have some case against what Deputy O'Malley is proposing.  However, he is not saying that.  He himself, in his own legislation, by his amendment, No. 42, is accepting the value of corrective advertising.  In amendment No. 42 he is saying that the court can decide to mitigate a penalty if the person who has committed the offence has put in some form of corrective advertising undoing the harm done.  A court can take that into account and can fix the penalty which it is going to impose by virtue of the fact that the corrective advertisment has appeared.  The Parliamentary Secretary, his Bill and his amendment recognise that corrective advertising has a useful function to perform.  He cannot be against corrective advertising in principle because he is proposing it himself.  Therefore, what objection is he left with to Deputy O'Malley's proposal?  I cannot see what valid objection he can have if Deputy O'Malley's corrective advertising can come into operation only when it has been established in court that the advertisement has been misleading.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to substitute &ldquo;court&rdquo; for &ldquo;director&rdquo; if that would meet the Parliamentary Secretary's objection to the director having this power.  Corrective advertising, on the Parliamentary Secretary's own admission and action, is a valuable thing.  What objection, therefore can he have for this procedure being incorporated into section 8?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no ambivalence in any attitude to the director.  In all such legislation every public official in the exercise of his duty should be subject to sufficient checks and balances to ensure that he does not exercise his power in an arbitrary fashion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about my own genuinely held conviction in relation to this sort of legislation, and there is no ambivalence whatever in relation to it.  In so far as amendment No. 18 is concerned I believe that <Col N="1472" /> the powers contained in section 8 (3) for courts to grant an injunction are sufficient and adequate if we add &ldquo;in addition to the power of the court&rdquo; simply to stop the advertisement. With Deputy O'Malley's amendment or Deputy Haughey's amendment to that amendment, a further consequence might ensue, namely that corrective advertising of unknown cost and extent might be inserted by the court or by the director and as well as finding himself stopped from going ahead with the existing advertisement, the advertiser might find himself having to pay for very expensive advertising which was inserted by somebody else subsequent to the proceeding.  The very substantial cost perhaps would be tantamount to adding to the simple injunction proceeding, which would just stop the advertisement, what would be equivalent to a very substantial fine because he would have to pay for this corrective advertising.  That would make the provisions of section 8 (3) potentially unduly onerous in terms of cost for advertisers who might be the subject of these proceedings.</P>
      <P>There is provision in amendment No. 42 for corrective advertising, but that is corrective advertising inserted voluntarily by the advertiser when he has received notice that proceedings are being taken against him.  He decides to put in the corrective advertising to an extent that he himself thinks he can afford.  Then he comes along to the court and says &ldquo;This is what I have done.  Are you prepared to accept this at least in partial mitigation of my fine?&rdquo;  The court will be prepared to look at the advertisement and say yes or no and mitigate or not mitigate the fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another particularly important matter in the context of corrective advertising, the matter of time.  The sooner the corrective advertising is inserted after the original advertising the better.  Amendment No. 42 ensures that the advertiser will have an incentive to insert this corrective advertising immediately he receives notice that the proceedings are being taken against him.  The judge when he subsequently comes to hear the case <Col N="1473" /> will probably take into account the speed with which the advertisement was inserted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>He has to take it into account.  &ldquo;May&rdquo; in that sense is a bit partial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go into that. The court can take into account the speed with which the advertising was inserted and, therefore, its effectiveness in real terms.  If, as is suggested in both amendment No. 18 and Deputy Haughey's suggested amendment to amendment No. 42, one were to wait until after the matter has been determined by the court there has been, by definition, greater delay because the time taken for the proceeding, whether it be an injunction proceeding or a criminal proceeding, will have elapsed and perhaps the public will have forgotten the original advertisement or they will have during that lapse of time bought goods on a substantial scale as a result of the advertisement which is a subject of criminal proceedings of which they are unaware.</P>
      <P>It is far better to confine the option in relation to corrective advertising to advertising inserted before the court hearing because then there is the incentive&mdash;a real incentive&mdash;for the advertiser to put in his corrective advertisement quickly where it will have most effect and where he can plead to the court that it had most effect, rather than allow him the option of doing nothing about it and allowing the damage to continue to be done, and then have him coming to court when it is probably too late and saying &ldquo;I am prepared to insert this advertisement&rdquo; and the court will consider whether or not to accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To sum up, corrective advertising to be effective must be quick and the procedure in amendment No. 42 provides exclusively for relatively quick corrective advertising.  We should concentrate on that sort of corrective advertising rather than opening up all sorts of other options which in the case of amendment No. 18 complicate and make more onerous the injunction proceedings and which in the case of amendment No. 42 would provide an option for the accused party so that instead of putting in a quick advertisement <Col N="1474" /> which would be effective, he would wait for the court hearing and then make an offer which, while it might be formally all right as far as the court was concerned, would be of little benefit to the consumer.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary held amendment No. 42 to be a very careful draft and he has just now given his interpretation of amendment No. 42 to mean that the offending advertiser could have put in the advertisement before court proceedings took place.</P>

      <P>The gist of what the Parliamentary Secretary is saying was the value of amendment No. 42 and the procedure outlined in it was that before the case was explored in court the offending advertiser would have to put in an advertisement.  This is probably not possible under the wording of amendment No. 42 as it stands, because amendment No. 42 speaks about an advertisement published by or on behalf of the person convicted of the offence.  How can somebody convicted of an offence put in an advertisement before the proceedings are heard?  It seems quite clear from the wording of amendment No. 42, carefully drafted as the Parliamentary Secretary has told us, that it only refers to an advertisement put in by an offending advertiser who has already been convicted and who is awaiting the imposition of the penalty by the judge.  That is what any ordinary person reading amendment No. 42 would think.  Amendment No. 42 reads:</P>
      <P>When considering what penalty (if any) under subsection (1) of this section is appropriate...</P>
      <P>The opening words in the amendment are to the effect that a judge has heard the case, has come to a decision, and is considering what penalty he is going to impose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1475" /> ... to an offence, the Court may take into consideration any advertisement published by or on behalf of the person convicted of the offence.</P>
    <P>That can only envisage the person having been convicted and then proceeding to put in the advertisement. From that point of view the Parliamentary Secretary's whole argument falls down.  The Parliamentary Secretary's argument about the value of the procedure set out in amendment No. 42b, that it means that the advertisement be put in before the case is heard at all, is just not applicable.  Anyway, the Parliamentary Secretary is a bit naïve if he expects recalcitrant advertisers to rush in with corrective advertising before the case is heard.  They would be automatically admitting their guilt and there would be no need to go ahead with the court proceedings. That is a patently absurd argument to put before us and it is prohibited by the wording of the Parliamentary Secretary's amendment which clearly envisages the advertisement being put in by the convicted person not by a person who is awaiting the hearing of the case.</P>

Any normal person reading amendment No. 42 as put before us would take my interpretation. I will ask my colleague, Deputy Briscoe his opinion.  Amendment No. 42 reads:</P>
      <P>... any advertisement published by or on behalf of the person convicted of the offence...</P>
      <P>That means that the person must have been convicted by the court and only then can the advertisement be inserted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is guilty of another minor misinterpretation of what is involved here.  The Parliamentary Secretary seems to think that Deputy O'Malley's amendment No. 18 inserting a new subsection (4) is related only to subsection (3) of the existing section.  It is not.  Deputy O'Malley only brings in the making of an order under subsection 3 (a) of the section to establish that the offence has been established. The Deputy could have used some other words about where a person has been found guilty under subsection (2). Subsection (4) is a new subsection standing on its own, a new part of section 8 as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary endeavoured to say that this new subsection (4) will only have effect because of subsection (3) (a).  It will not. It will relate to the operation of section 8 as a whole and it can only happen if a person has been found guilty under subsection 2.  Subsection (3) (a) cannot operate unless the person is found guilty under subsection 2 and therefore the new subsection (4) relates to an offence being committed and the person being found guilty of that offence.  It is not an extension of subsection (3) (a), it is a separate independent mechanism for correcting a harm done.  In that regard it is quite reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is very little difference between the Parliamentary Secretary's approach in amendment No. 42 and Deputy O'Malley's approach.  Both want corrective advertising and both envisage that corrective advertising be an expense of the offending advertiser. Both envisage an offence having been committed and the person having been convicted of the offence before the advertisement is inserted.  Amendment No. 42 will only have effect if the person has been convicted and is about to be fined.  Both amendments are moving along parallel lines.  The Parliamentary Secretary is putting his corrective advertisement amendment into the <Col N="1477" /> penalty section, whereas Deputy O'Malley wants to put it into the original misleading advertisements section, section 8.  Deputy O'Malley's is a better amendment because no matter what the Parliamentary Secretary says, amendment No. 42 is very restrictive. In operation amendment No. 42 will only permit a corrective advertisement being inserted between the conviction and the imposition of the penalty.  It does not envisage any other time for the advertisement.</P>
    <P>Because there is so little difference between the two amendments I am quite prepared to proceed in a different way and to reconcile our differences.  I would amend amendment No. 4 to substitute &ldquo;court&rdquo; for &ldquo;director&rdquo; or alternatively if the Parliamentary Secretary would be prepared to make his amendment No. 42 more specific and indicate in it that first of all the advertisement could be published after the imposition of the penalty&mdash;it could easily be framed in such a way that the advertisement could be agreed by the court to be published at some future date which would also have to be agreed&mdash;and secondly to spell out quite clearly that the cost of the corrective advertising would have to be borne by the offending advertiser.  That is not clear from amendment No. 42 as it stands. It is inherent in it but it is not quite clear.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 42 says &ldquo;by or on behalf of the person convicted of the offence&rdquo;.  However, these are minor differences.  Both amendments are directed towards the <Col N="1478" /> same end, towards the purpose of having corrective advertisements published, having the original offender pay for the corrective advertisement and only coming into play where there is a conviction for an offence.  These are the three elements that the two amendments have in common.  Personally, at this stage, I should prefer Deputy O'Malley's approach: to put the necessity for corrective advertising into the section which creates the offence in the first place and not into the penalty section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to differ with Deputy Haughey in relation to the interpretation of statutes or in relation to the meaning of language but it is clear that amendment No. 18 is confined solely to the circumstances created by the exercise of the powers conferred by subsection (3) (a).  If Deputy O'Malley intended that to extend to circumstances which might arise under, for instance, subsection (2), he would have so stated.  Therefore the amendment is confined solely to the circumstances in which the High Court had granted an injunction, and an injunction is not a criminal sanction.  An injunction is granted to one civil party against another civil party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are independent proceedings involved.  For a criminal offence to be proved in court, criminal proceedings must be taken.  If, on the other hand, what is taken is essentially a civil action and if it transpires that in the course of that action&mdash;as will be the case in a situation where the court granted an application under subsection (3) (a)&mdash;that an offence has been committed, there would have to be independent criminal proceedings before the case would become a criminal offence.  Also there would have to be an independent hearing. The High Court hearing of the injunction would not in itself create the offence.  The circumstances whereby criminal proceedings could be taken might have pre-existed.  Therefore I <Col N="1479" /> submit that amendment No. 18 is confined solely to the provision of subsection (3) (a) and not to the generality of misleading advertising.</P>
      <P>I would not agree with Deputy Haughey's interpretation of amendment No. 42.  The amendment would come into play in the sense that the question of the mitigation of penalties would arise subsequent to a conviction, but that does not mean that the misleading advertising had been published long before the hearing of the case.</P>
      <P>Obviously a situation in which the mitigation of a penalty would be in the process of being considered by the court would arise only in a case in which somebody had been convicted of an offence since it is only after conviction that a decision on penalty would be taken.  The use here of the term &ldquo;convicted person&rdquo; does not mean that corrective advertisements can be inserted only after the conviction.  It means rather that consideration of the mitigatory relevance of the corrective advertising, whenever it might be inserted in the papers, would be considered only in the context of a penalty.  In other words, its relevance would be considered only after the offence has been proved although the advertisement could have been inserted at any time subsequent to the person concerned realising that he had committed an offence by reason of a previous advertisement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is much better to have a provision whereby the party concerned should have one option only in relation to corrective advertising, that is, to publish the corrective advertising as soon as possible after the realisation that an offence has been committed&mdash; a time at which it would be most likely to have effect&mdash;rather than to wait until after either an offence had been proved or there had been proved the grounds necessary for granting an injunction.  Such a process might not be completed for up to 12 months after the offence had been committed.  In the event of such delay the corrective advertising would be unlikely to be of any real value to the consumer.  Consequently the <Col N="1480" /> advertiser's option should be narrowed exclusively to inserting the corrective advertisement at the nearest date possible prior to the hearing.  That is the purpose of amendment No. 42.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is hanging much of his argument on the question of the immediate insertion of corrective advertising.  I suppose there is a great deal to be said for having corrective material published as quickly as possible, but on the other hand there could be circumstances in which it would be more effective to wait for a while.  For instance, advertisements published in the month of August are not as effective as advertisements published, say, in September.  Therefore I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary not to go overboard on this point.  Indeed, he goes further in suggesting that the corrective advertisements be inserted before there is conviction.  The bulk of his argument was that it would be very desirable that recalcitrant advertisers insert advertisements immediately on becoming aware that an action was to be taken against them.  Very few, if any, advertisers would be prepared to do that because to act in such a manner would be to admit that there had been an offence.  They would not be so foolish.  Most of the cases will be arguable cases, with one side arguing that material is misleading and detrimental and the other side arguing to the contrary.  Consequently the Parliamentary Secretary's argument is unreal. Apart from that, such practice would not be on so far as amendment No. 42 is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind amendment No. 42 clearly restricts the insertion of this corrective advertisement to a period of time between conviction and imposition of penalty.  Only an advertisement published by or on behalf of a person convicted can have any effect under amendment No. 42.  From an ordinary reading of the wording that means that a person must have been convicted and then the advertisement inserted.  Let us not forget that this is an amendment, an afterthought by the Minister's advisers or by the Parliamentary Secretary himself.  That is how ministerial amendments come to be put down.  The <Col N="1481" /> Parliamentary Secretary should not put it forward here as something sacrosanct and handed down from the mountain.  I am quite certain that those who drafted this amendment envisaged a situation in which a judge would say &ldquo;Mr. X, this court finds you guilty of an offence under section 8 and I am going to fine you under the provisions of section 8 for the commission of this offence, but if you are prepared to publish a corrective advertisement along the lines I indicate I will take that into account in deciding the level of the fine which I will impose&rdquo;. That is what is envisaged in this section.  The Parliamentary Secretary is now making a <i>post facto</i> argument to justify it, not <i>per se</i> but in preference to Deputy O'Malley's amendment.</P>
    <P>I accept what the Parliamentary Secretary has argued about the relationship between the new subsection (4) and subsection (3) (a).  He is right in what he says.  Subsection (4) is clearly related to an injunction under subsection (3) (a).  Perhaps I did not express myself clearly enough when I spoke earlier but I meant to say that Deputy O'Malley used subsection (3) (a) in this context as a convenient form of words to indicate that an offence had been committed under the terms of section 8.  He could just as easily have opened the new subsection (4) with the words &ldquo;When an offence has been committed under subsection (1) of section 8&rdquo;.  My point is that subsection (3) (a) is not an integral part of what Deputy O'Malley is after; it is just a convenient form of words.  The Parliamentary Secretary has argued, quite rightly, that as Deputy O'Malley has drafted this amendment it is specifically related to the granting of an injunction under subsection (3) (a).  At this stage perhaps the best thing for me to do is to withdraw this amendment in the name of Deputy O'Malley. I should prefer, and I should like to consult Deputy O'Malley about it, that the words &ldquo;the court&rdquo; should be inserted there instead of &ldquo;the director&rdquo;.  With the permission of the House I will withdraw Deputy O'Malley's amendment and oppose the Parliamentary Secretary's amendment <Col N="1482" /> No. 42 on the basis of putting down on the Report Stage an amendment which will give effect more directly to what Deputy O'Malley has in mind and to what I think the Parliamentary Secretary also has in mind, though his own amendment does not succeed in expressing it.</P>

      <P>In page 7, after line 6, to add a further subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) This section shall apply to a person within the jurisdiction who contravenes subsection (1) of this section by the publication of an advertisement in a place outside the jurisdiction which is read or seen by persons within the jurisdiction and which relates to the supply or provision of goods, services or facilities to persons within the jurisdiction.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that, however obscurantist and recalcitrant the Parliamentary Secretary has been up to now on the very sensible proposals we have been putting to him, he will certainly see the light with regard to amendment No. 19.  It is the sort of amendment which is necessary to ensure that the legislation is comprehensively effective.  Deputy O'Malley is endeavouring to repair a loophole in the original legislation.

      <P>The amendment seems to be one which the circumstances of our situation dictate.  There is no doubt that a great deal of the advertising to which we are subjected in this country comes from outside <Col N="1483" /> Quite a number of newspapers, magazines and journals circulate here which are imported and which are printed and published &ldquo;outside the jurisdiction&rdquo;, to use the words of the amendment. In certain areas of the country we also have exposure to outside radio and television programmes which contain a high advertisement content.  In those circumstances it is necessary, if the Bill is to be effective, that it should be extended to cover that situation. Deputy O'Malley's amendment covers exactly the situation I have described.  It may be that the Parliamentary Secretary will argue that this is covered otherwise in the legislation. I do not think it is, but if there is any argument as to whether there is such provision it would be as well for the Parliamentary Secretary to accept this amendment and put the situation beyond doubt or, as the lawyers say, <i>ex abundantia cautelae.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely my case.  Publication is constituted not necessarily by the place in which a magazine is printed.  If a person in Ireland inserts an advertisement in a British paper and that paper comes in here, the legal interpretation is that it is published in Ireland in the sense that it is made available and distributed and can be read within Ireland and the act of distribution constitutes publication. Therefore, according to existing interpretations the person within this jurisdiction in that situation would be subject to prosecution.  However, if it would enable us to make progress in the matter I am quite happy to accept the amendment.  There is no great principle involved and, as Deputy Haughey said, if it is only making the matter abundantly clear, there is no harm in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have discussed the section in detail by means of discussing the amendments and I do not think there is a great deal more to be said about it now.  It is a useful section and, as the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out, it is reasonably <Col N="1484" /> limited in its impact.  There must be misleading, and it is not enough to mislead; the misleading must cause loss, damage or injury to members of the public to a material degree.  There are fairly useful safeguards built into the wording of subsection (1) and it is important that all concerned should understand that.  We are not legislating to impose very onerous burdens on manufacturers or traders.  We are not being capricious in this legislation but we are seeking to ensure that where some positive loss is caused, something detrimental done, the situation can be dealt with.  It can be dealt with in two ways: by fine or by injunction procedure stopping publication.  It is important to realise that even after section 8 is enacted it will not be an offence to publish advertisements which, though misleading, are harmless. It is important that the general public should understand that.  We should use this Committee Stage to get that across: that the section only comes into operation where there is, if you like, deliberate misleading which causes damage to members of the general public.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I should have preferred that the additional safeguard that Deputy O'Malley put forward would have been incorporated, but the Parliamentary Secretary has set his face against that and we must accept that situation.  We must recognise that in the course of time, and as we get experience of its application, the section as it stands may have to be amended because, whereas we want the public defended and protected from misleading advertising which does them harm in any sense, we do not want to have legitimate, genuine manufacturers or traders penalised unnecessarily or wrongly by irresponsible members of the public or by unscrupulous competitors.  Let us recognise that the section as it is is a good step forward.  It is an advance but it has inherent dangers of some dislocation to trade and business.  We shall only be able to assess whether they are serious or not as time goes on and as we gain practical experience of the operation of section 8.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20b:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 11 to 15, to delete subsections (2) and (3) and to substitute the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The office of Director shall be a position in the Civil Service and no person shall be appointed to the office unless the Civil Service Commissioners, within the meaning of the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, after holding a competition under section 15 of that Act, have, under section 17 of that Act, selected him for appointment to the office.</P>
      <P>(3) A person appointed to be the Director shall hold office for a period of five years but the Minister may, if he thinks fit, continue the appointment (including an appointment previously continued under this subsection) for such further period not exceeding five years as he considers appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1486" /> (4) (a) The Director may be removed from office at any time by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(b) If the Director is removed from office under this subsection, the Minister shall cause to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas a statement of the reasons for the removal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This meets an argument which was made by a number of speakers, including Deputy O'Malley, on the Second Stage to the effect that the director should be drawn from the widest possible range of persons and candidates and should not be confined solely as was originally the case, to persons among the existing staff of the Minister. If I may read the amendment, it will make the matter clear:</P>
    <P>The office of Director shall be a position in the Civil Service and no person shall be appointed to the office unless the Civil Service Commissioners, within the meaning of the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, after holding a competition under section 15 of that Act, have, under section 17 of that Act, selected him for appointment to the office.</P>
    <P>That provides that the director shall be appointed by open competition and that his position will be within the civil service, but anybody can apply for the post.  The person appointed to be the director shall hold office for a period of five years but the Minister may, if he thinks fit, continue the appointment, including an appointment previously continued under this subsection for such further period not exceeding five years as he considers appropriate.  The provision for a five year term is designed to ensure that, if necessary, there can be a change in the person of the director because of a change in the nature of the office as a result of developments in the market place, or alternatively the director at the time ceasing to be appropriate to the job in his own personal capacity.</P>
    <P>However, if the director is not reappointed after a five year term, it is not possible for the Minister to appoint a person of his own whom it may <Col N="1487" /> appear to be a good idea for him to have for one reason or another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would never do the like of that.  He must use the procedures set out in subsection (2) of the amendment and have an open competition, and so on.  In subsection (4) (a) of the amendment it is provided that the director may be removed from office at any time by the Minister.  Subsection (4) (b) of the amendment provides that, if the director is removed from office under this subsection, the Minister shall cause to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas a statement of the reasons for the removal.  This disallows any capricious act by the Minister in removing the director, because he will have to explain himself through that statement.</P>
      <P>The fact that subsection (2) of the amendment requires that the new director shall be appointed by open competition removes the possibility that the Minister might exercise the power under subsection (4) to remove the director, or to get rid of somebody who is inconvenient, in the knowledge that he could substitute somebody of his own choosing in his place.  Because of the provisions of subsection (2) it would be quite impossible for him to do that.  While he can get rid of the old director, he must get a new one who will be selected in the same manner, quite independent of the Minister.</P>
      <P>In large measure this amendment meets the case made by the Opposition, amongst others.  I have thought about it and I feel it improves the legislation.  There are some slight differences between amendment No. 20b and Deputy O'Malley's proposal in amendment No. 21.  I do not know whether the House would wish me to go into detail but I will just sum them up.</P>

      <P>May I interrupt the Parliamentary Secretary?  I wonder is it clear or has it been announced that amendments Nos. 21 <Col N="1488" /> and 22 in the name of Deputy O'Malley are alternatives to amendment No. 20b in the name of the Minister and should, of course, be debated together.  It should be clear that since amendments Nos. 21 and 22 are alternatives to amendment No. 20b they cannot be moved if amendment No. 20b is accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The differences are as follows.  The new amendment specifically provides that the director will be a civil servant.  It deals more adequately with the question of the term of office.  The term of office in the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Malley would have been indefinite and could have gone on forever.  It is desirable that there should be provision for the office to be held for a determined period, and subject to renewal. That allows for the bringing of new blood into the office, if necessary. This will only happen through the procedure of open competition.  It will not happen in any capricious or partisan manner.  Provision is made for renewal of the office.  Those are the three main differences between Deputy O'Malley's amendment and the amendment now officially proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this amendment proposed by the Minister. There will be general agreement that the original proposal in the Bill was outrageous.  It could not have been accepted.  I accused the Parliamentary Secretary earlier of being ambivalent in his attitude to this new statutory person, the Director of Consumer Affairs.  I suspect his ambivalence emanated in some respects from the nature of the office as originally outlined, because the creature originally envisaged in this Bill was a pretty unworthy statutory creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It simply meant that a civil servant, a member of the existing staff of the Department of Industry and Commerce, would have been asked to take on these new functions and, he would have been nominated by the Minister and subject to removal by the Minister, obviously he would have been a person of no consequence whatever.  The office as originally suggested would have been entirely unsuitable and would <Col N="1489" /> have been a pale imitation of what most of us want.  This new office will be an important one.</P>
    <P>In this country and throughout Europe definite trends and tendencies are manifesting themselves in regard to consumer affairs.  These trends are welcomed by practically everybody concerned.  It is now recognised that with the complexity of modern society, ordinary members of the general public are relatively defenceless in the face of campaigns directed against them by large-scale commercial organisations. Advertising is now a very important weapon.  It has an enormous impact.  It has all sorts of techniques and methods which are deadly in their effectiveness.  To a large extent, large sections of the general public are not in a position to assess the merits of what is put before them.  They have not the information, the training, the knowledge, the expertise, to be able to assess properly the merits of products and services which are advertised.  As advertising becomes more expert and skilled as a profession the greater the need is to have defence mechanisms established for the general public.</P>
    <P>This legislation is important and is a step in the right direction.  However, it is a tentative, faltering first step and it does not deal with a number of matters which many of us regard as far more important than the matters dealt with.  For example, it does not deal with door-to-door salesmanship and with credit selling and some of the more urgent and immediate problems of modern society are outside the scope of this legislation.  For that reason it is all the more important that it should be completely effective in the areas it covers.  These areas are limited but they are important and, therefore, it is vital that the person who will have the duty of implementing this legislation should be a person of the necessary stature.  As the Bill was originally designed he could not possibly be the kind of official we would all want him to be.</P>
    <P>In response to pressure from Deputy O'Malley and others, the Parliamentary Secretary has come forward with this alternative proposal.  In essence he meets the suggestion which Deputy <Col N="1490" /> O'Malley put forward in his amendment, namely, that instead of the new director being nominated <i>simpliciter</i> by the Minister of the day he will be chosen by the Civil Service Commissioners. That is a procedure which we know well.  It is firmly established in the public sector and it has served the State well since its establishment.  The procedure of appointment to the public service by means of the Civil Service Commissioners has become an unassailable part of our conduct of public affairs and, therefore, it is reassuring to find that this new office will be filled through that impeccable and unassailable machinery.</P>
    <P>However, there are some questions that come to my mind about the amendments as phrased.  I suppose the wording is deliberate but I should like to inquire if it is the normal wording used in these circumstances. Amendment No. 20b states:</P>
    <P>(2) The office of Director shall be a position in the Civil Service and no person shall be appointed to the office unless the Civil Service Commissioners, within the meaning of the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, after holding a competition under section 15 of that Act, have, under section 17 of that Act, selected him for appointment to the office.</P>
    <P>I should like some elaboration on what is meant by &ldquo;shall be a position in the Civil Service&rdquo;.  Is that the normal wording used when people are appointed to the public service through the civil service machinery or is there some special significance in using that wording?  I should like to relate that to the wording used in a later subsection which states:</P>
    <P>The Director may be removed from office at any time by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Is there a contradiction there?  Can any civil servant be removed from office by the Minister?  I have a vague recollection that an established civil servant can be removed from office by the Government only but I may be wrong about that.  It may be that the wording used in this instance is to allow for the person to be removed by the Minister.  As the Parliamentary <Col N="1491" /> Secretary has gone so far as to bring in the Civil Service Commissioners to allay many of the doubts we had about this procedure, should he not have gone the whole way and perhaps have the director removed by the House or by the Government or provide some further protection for the office?  I do not think there is a great deal of protection involved here.  The statement that the director may be removed from office by the Minister is a very bald statement.  For example, it does not say &ldquo;for just cause&rdquo; or &ldquo;where it appears to the Minister&rdquo;.  It simply states that the director may be removed from office at any time by the Minister and it seems to give absolute power to the Minister.  It does not say &ldquo;where it appears to the Minister he is guilty of a breach of duty&rdquo; or &ldquo;where he is incapable of fulfilling his office&rdquo; or it does not even say &ldquo;for stated reasons&rdquo;.  It simply says he can be removed from office at any time.</P>
    <P>The amendment also states:</P>
    <P>(b) If the Director is removed from office under this subsection the Minister shall cause to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas a statement of the reasons for the removal.</P>
    <P>I wonder what is the value of that? The first thing that can be said is that it may be too late because the man will have been removed from office. It is only afterwards that the Minister will have to give a reason to the House for his removal.  There is no procedure set down as a follow-up to laying before the House a statement of the reasons.  It seems to me to be a guillotine procedure; the person is removed from office and a statement is laid before the House giving the reasons. There is no way the House can revoke the removal from office and there is no way the House can come to grips with the situation.  The power of the Minister to remove the director is absolute and total and this business about making a statement to the House is no real protection for him.</P>
    <P>I know the Parliamentary Secretary will say that Ministers are reasonable, <Col N="1492" /> that they will not fire people whimsically or irresponsibly.  He will say we can trust Ministers and that they will take this action only if they have reason.  He will probably tell us that it is necessary that the Minister should have this power, that even the impeccable machinery of the Civil Service Commissioners could load us with an unsuitable person and that after a year or two it might become obvious to everyone that the person appointed was unsuitable.  Therefore, it is necessary that in such a situation the Minister would have the power to remove that person from office.  One can see the force of that argument. On the other hand, there is the other aspect, that is, that this new person will be very important and will have very difficult and sometimes unpleasant functions to perform.  He will be a watch dog, a public guardian. As such he will necessarily incur a fair amount of unpopularity, dislike and will make enemies.  Therefore, the man or woman who occupies the office will have to be a strong person, not necessarily a strong character personally but the office will have to be fire-proofed to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>We would not like to envisage a situation where, after a number of years, a director duly appointed by the Civil Service Commissioners and carrying out his functions diligently, honourably and in the best interests of the general public offends important sections of the business community and pressure is brought to bear on the Minister to get rid of him.  The world being what it is, we must envisage that this sort of situation can arise and develop.  It is absolutely necessary, in so far as we can do so in this legislation, to protect this office.  We should make it secure from undesirable pressures.  This person in this office will be very important, like a judge.  To a large extent he will be exercising the same sort of functions, perhaps from time to time incurring the same sort of enmity, dislike and displeasure.  Therefore, it is important that he should be as immune from dismissal as possible.</P>
    <P>We have to strike a balance.  We have to try to ensure that this office is <Col N="1493" /> impartial, immune from pressure and that the person occupying it will have security of tenure and know he can discharge his responsibilities fearlessly and without any risk of intimidation.  In those circumstances, is it going far enough just to have him selected by the Civil Service Commissioners? I accept that is a very big step forward.  I also accept it is a very big step forward that he is no longer just one of the Minister's officers, that he is an independent person, and that subsection (4) still remains.  That subsection stipulates that he will be independent in the performance of his functions.  Does the fact that he is capable of being removed by the Minister more or less at will not take from, and in a very real and serious way, the independence of the office? I am putting these points forward more for consideration than in an argumentative way.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary put forward this amendment that he is trying to meet the House as closely as he can in this matter and I accept this amendment in that spirit.  The fact that the Minister has this arbitrary power to remove the director from office <i>simpliciter,</i> without qualification of any sort, is not going far enough. Again, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he would elaborate on whether there is any particular significance in the wording &ldquo;shall be a position in the civil service&rdquo; and whether the normal provisions about removing civil servants apply to this office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the last point first.  Subsection (4) (a) deals with his removal from office as director. It does not necessarily apply to his removal from the civil service.  A civil servant could hold any number of offices during his career.  The important point is that if he is removed the Minister must appoint somebody who has been recommended by the Civil Service Commissioners after a competition and his replacement will be as independent both in the mode of his appointment and in his functions as his predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the office of director is very important in this legislation.  It <Col N="1494" /> was originally intended that the provision of specialist means of its execution should be deferred to later legislation and be brought in in an omnibus measure for new enforcement of authority.  In the meantime, while new offences would be created and new laws made, so far as enforcement was concerned that should be done by the Minister in the normal way.  There would be no Director of Consumer Affairs who would have special concern in the matter.</P>
    <P>It was my decision that the creation of Director of Consumer Affairs should be brought forward and introduced in the first of this series of consumer protection legislation.  I felt it would be more appropriate to start with this person in being rather than to wait and introduce him much later.  As new legislation is enacted, it is our intention to give the director new and additional functions.  At the moment we have no final view as to what may be the totality of his functions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with genuine regret that I, as a Laois Deputy, find it necessary to move the following motion:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Education to hold an immediate public inquiry into the conduct of the County Laois Vocational Education Committee which according to a High Court decision was and is in breach of its statutory duty in relation to its failure to appoint a qualified Principal for Portlaoise Vocational School.</P>
      <P>My motion arises from the fact that the Laois VEC over the past three years have failed to appoint a principal for Portlaoise Vocational School.  Over that period they have failed, for some political reason of their own, to appoint as headmaster the qualified candidate whom they considered was more suitable for the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of this case makes very sorry telling.  I am distressed to have <Col N="1495" /> to bring this motion before Dáil Éireann in an effort to prevail upon my colleagues in the House to make this very necessary call on the Minister for Education.  In early 1974, a vacancy was created for the position of principal of Portlaoise Vocational School due to the retirement of the previous headmaster.  An advertisement was published in the public Press in April, 1974, by the Laois Vocational Education Committee inviting applications from suitably qualified candidates for the position of principal of the vocational school.</P>
    <P>Built into that advertisement was the statement that the qualifications and conditions of appointment were set out in paragraph 12 (b) and Appendix C to Memorandum V.7 of the Department of Education.  As the House knows, Memorandum V.7 is a document issued by the Department of Education governing the appointment, qualifications and scales of salary of permanent full-time teachers under vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>The memorandum also covers appointments in the case of whole-time teachers permanently established to posts of responsibility in such schools, including posts as principal and vice-principal.  The qualifications as outlined indicated that one of the requirements of the person who would be appointed to the post in Laois would be that he should have not less than five years' whole time teaching experience in the vocational education service.</P>
    <P>The Laois Vocational Education Committee received nine applications for posts in response to their advertisement. In accordance with normal practice the candidates were called for interview by a central selection board on the 17th May, 1974.  In accordance with established practice at the time, and still, the central selection board consisted of seven members, four nominated by the County Laois Vocational Education Committee, including their chairman, and one representative of the Irish Vocational Education Association and two officers of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1496" /> I think I should point out that at that time the Laois Vocational Education Committee was fully made up of Fine Gael nominees, which included all Fine Gael county councillors, and Fine Gael nominees filling the noncouncillor positions on that committee. The only exception to this, was a non-party tied parish priest&mdash; if I might use that description who had survived from a previous committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Was Mr. Campion on that committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>He was not.  I would point out that when I talk about an all-Fine Gael committee it was not a Coalition committee, as both Fianna Fáil and Labour representatives were banned from this committee by the previous Laois County Council where Fine Gael had a complete monopoly.  Therefore, Labour did not need to be incorporated into the movement at that stage as far as Laois was concerned.</P>
      <P>Arising from the selection board reviewing of the nine applications, they reduced the candidates for the position to a first and second choice.</P>
      <P>The order in which these two candidates were placed by the four nominees of the vocational education committee on the selection board was not acceptable to the other three members of the board, namely, the vocational association representative and the two nominees of the Minister for Education, because the candidate placed first by the vocational education committee nominees did not have the minimum of five years' whole-time teaching experience required by the terms of paragraph 12 (b) of Memorandum V.7, whereas the candidate placed second by the vocational education committee nominees complied with this and all of the other requirements for the post.</P>
      <P>In the event, the report of the meeting of the selection board on the 17th May, 1974, was signed only by the four nominees of the vocational education committee and also by the committee's chief executive officer as secretary of the selection board, but not by the other three members of the selection board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1497" /> The first choice candidate of the members of the vocational education committee on the selection board was a permanent full time teacher of English and history and had been in the whole time employment of the Laois Vocational Education Committee from September, 1971.  He was previously employed on a temporary basis as a teacher in Terenure College, Dublin, from September, 1970 to June, 1971.  He had not, therefore, the minimum of five years whole time teaching experience required by the terms of the Memorandum V.7.  On the other hand, the second choice candidate of the members on the selection board, was a permanent whole time teacher of science and mathematics who had been in the whole time employment of the County Laois Vocational Education Committee from October, 1963.</P>
    <P>He was, therefore, fully qualified with his teaching experience as prescribed in Memorandum V.7.  On 20th May, 1974 the chief executive officer of the committee wrote to the Department of Education indicating, notwithstanding the views expressed by the IVEA representatives and of the views expressed by the Minister's two representatives at the meeting of the selection board on 17th May, 1974 that the Laois Vocational Education Committee members of the board had selected as their first choice the candidate who did not fulfil the requirement in respect of teaching experience.</P>
    <P>The CEO requested, in that letter, an indication from the Department of Education of their view in the matter in time for a proposed meeting of the Vocational Education Committee on 9th June, 1974 at which the selection would be considered.  The Department replied to the CEO on the 30th May, 1974 stating that the first choice candidate was ineligible for appointment as Principal of the Portlaoise Vocational School.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, at the meeting of the Vocational Education Committee at which the appointment was considered and which was held on the 10th June, 1974, the report of their selection board signed only by the four members of the vocational education committee on the board was before the <Col N="1498" /> meeting as, of course was the Department's letter on the 30th May, saying that the candidate was ineligible.</P>
    <P>At this meeting, made up of a completely Fine Gael appointed committee there were two proposals.  The first was that the report of the selection board be adopted and that the full committee now approve of the appointment of Michael Parsons as principal of Portlaoise Vocational School as from the 1st September, 1974.</P>
    <P>There was an amendment.  The amendment was, that the selection board named second choice, William Phelan, be appointed to the post as principal of Portlaoise Vocational School as from 1st September, 1974. The amendment was put and defeated on a show of hands by eight to four. The original motion was carried by the same majority.  The chairman who was then Deputy Oliver J. Flannagan, accordingly, declared the first choice candidate appointed to the post as principal of Portlaoise Vocational School with effect from 1st September, 1974, subject to the sanction of the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education informed the vocational education committee, by letter dated the 5th July, 1974, that it was not open to the Department to sanction the first choice candidate's appointment for the reasons set out in their letter of 30th May, to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>The Laois Vocational Education Committee met again on 8th July, 1974, to consider the Department's reply of 5th July but this was a meeting with a difference.</P>
    <P>Between 12th June and 8th July, the local election had been held and a new committee had been appointed.  Fine Gael had failed to hold their overall majority of the Laois County Council and a Coalition grouping had taken over.  By agreement, however, four places were conceded to Fianna Fáil representatives on this new committee, but the vacancies for those four placings had been created by the removal from the Fine Gael group on the old committee of the four Fine Gael members who had opposed the dictatorial action of the majority led by Deputy O.J. Flanagan, the chairman.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1499" /> Those four people, including Deputy Charles McDonald and three colleagues of his on the outgoing vocational committee who agreed with the Minister at that time and had proposed and supported the amendment that the properly qualified man should be appointed principal, were all removed from the committee.</P>
    <P>The vocational committee have continued since then to be in breach of their statutory responsibility.  This committee, which the present Minister for Education has stated here in this House were properly constituted, have continued to carry on in a manner of complete opposition to their statutory responsibility.</P>
    <P>In the minutes of the committee's meeting of 8th July, 1974, it is stated that the committee would not accept the fact that the first choice candidate was ineligible in accordance with the terms of Memorandum V.7.  A motion of the meeting that the first choice candidate be appointed as principal in charge was carried by nine votes to two and an amendment that the second choice candidate be appointed teacher in charge was defeated by the same vote.</P>
    <P>There followed a further letter from the Department to the VEC on the matter dated 29th August, 1974.  This letter made it clear that there was not included among posts of responsibility in vocational schools a post carrying the title of principal teacher in charge and again pointed out that the first choice candidate was not eligible for appointment as principal.  You will see that this committee, led still by Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan, were insisting on not acceding to ministerial and departmental directives.</P>
    <P>The Laois VEC met again on 9th September, and a proposal was carried by nine votes to five, the five being made up of four Fianna Fáil nominees and a Labour county councillor, and those nine supporters of Fine Gael at this stage, on 9th September, decided to appoint their non-acceptable nominee as acting principal, without remuneration, as from 10th September, 1974.</P>
    <P>An amendment that the second <Col N="1500" /> choice again be appointed to the post of principal as advertised was defeated again by the same majority of nine votes to five and that has been the consistent vote ever since.  The committee were informed in writing on 18th September, 1974, by the Department of Education that this new proposal could not be sanctioned by the Department.</P>
    <P>The Department stressed in the same letter that it was essential in the interest of the pupils concerned that the vacant post of principal of Portlaoise vocational school should be filled immediately in accordance with the provisions of Memorandum V.7, with particular reference to paragraph 12 (b).  It was stated too by the Department that they considered that the first choice candidate was not eligible for the post but that the candidate placed next in order of choice should be appointed since he was fully qualified and eligible for the position.</P>
    <P>In a letter of 5th September, 1974, the then Minister for Education endeavoured to get the message across straight and fair to the chairman, Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan, and to his maverick committee.  The letter stated that, notwithstanding the availability of the candidate who fulfils all the requirements for the post of principal in accordance with the committee's own advertisement and in accordance with the relevant terms of the Department's Memorandum V.7, Laois VEC had persisted in proposing that the post be filled in some form or other by a candidate who did not comply with the requirements applicable to the Portlaoise vocational school&mdash;that the person appointed should have not less than five years' whole time teaching experience.</P>
    <P>The letter went on to state unequivocally to the committee that, while there was a candidate available who satisfied the conditions for appointment as principal in accordance with normal procedures, the Minister for Education would not sanction the filling of the post on any other basis.</P>
    <P>All of the above particulars which I have given to this House are taken from a statement made by the then Minister for Education, the then <Col N="1501" /> Deputy Richard Burke, in a contribution which he made in the Dáil in reply to an Adjournment Debate in which I raised this matter on 11th February, 1975.  All the facts stated by me already are contained in the Minister's statement on that occasion, so none of those factors can be contradicted or will be contradicted by the present Minister.</P>
    <P>Arising from that letter from the Department of Education to the Laois Vocational Education Committee and from correspondence between the Minister at that time and the chairman, Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan, this rebellious VEC sought legal advice as to how they could force the Minister for Education to sanction their proposals. They failed to get legal opinion which would justify their conduct and continued to carry on and refused to nominate the qualified candidate who at all stages, from their point of view, was placed No. 2. The vocational committee were clearly conscious of the fact that they have been out of order since June, 1974, but the maverick majority of this committee have been consistently flouting the rules and regulations laid down by the Minister and it is because of this that I am seeking the inquiry.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Education by way of parliamentary question on 20th May, 1975, if he had as yet studied the legal advice which had been offered in March to the Laois County Vocational Education Committee in relation to their dispute with him and if he could now announce his decision in the matter.  By way of reply, the Minister said that he had seen the legal advice in question.  It had been discussed at the meeting of the County Laois VEC on 14th April, 1975, and their views thereon had been conveyed to him in the minutes of that meeting.</P>
    <P>He pointed out that he was then considering the views of the committee and would be in touch with them in due course.  On that occasion I drew the then Minister's attention to a statement which had appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 19th May in which Deputy Flanagan had claimed that there was confusion regarding the regulations contained in Memorandum <Col N="1502" /> V.7 covering this particular instance.</P>
    <P>The Minister refused to be drawn on this for fear of condemning his colleague, Deputy Flanagan, at that stage, except to say that there was no confusion in regard to teaching regulations. I asked the Minister if he was not aware that the majority of the Committee of the Laois VEC were playing ducks and drakes with him and that the situation had been shown in this light in the national and provincial press.  I even went so far as to suggest that by dallying in his decision the Minister was suffering the ignominy of having those members of the committee laugh at him.  The then Minister accepted this and said that he was prepared to endure the laughter of people provided he got the right decision in the end.</P>
    <P>The situation that ultimately transpired was one whereby the Laois Vocational Committee realised that the Minister for Education could not force them to appoint a headmaster and could only recommend to them that they obey the rules.  As long as they continued to disobey the rules and as long as they refused to submit the name of the qualified man, Mr. Phelan, for this appointment, they could keep kicking for touch and avoid making the appointment and the Minister could not force them.  The only option open to him was to dismiss the committee as such.  They played on the strength of their political power in this regard, in the knowledge that no Fine Gael Minister for Education could possibly disband a Fine Gael controlled VEC.  In the event they have won the battle, despite promises made in the debate on 22nd May, 1975, by the then Minister for Education.  I was satisfied at all stages about the integrity of the then Minister for Education and I feel that if he was still Minister for Education he would have by now taken the appropriate action.  He indicated he would do so in reply to my contribution on 22nd May, 1975.  In the time at my disposal in the presentation of this case I do not expect to have sufficient opportunity to quote extracts from the Minister's statement on that occasion but such quotations <Col N="1503" /> would justify the claim I have made. That Minister was conscious of the position he held and conscious of the challenge which had been thrown down to him.  He was determined to make the right decision.</P>
    <P>The majority of the Laois VEC have played this particular card to the ultimate and when it became so obvious that there was going to be no other reaction from the Minister for Education and that it appeared that the Minister for Education was not going to perform his duty and dismiss the Laois VEC, the unfortunate victim of the whole affair, Mr. Phelan, decided to go to court and ask the High Court to issue an ultimatum to the Laois VEC to give him fair play and his just deserts which was his appointment as headmaster in Portlaoise vocational school.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the High Court hearing came to light on 28th February last, when Mr. Justice McWilliam held that the Laois Vocational Committee were bound immediately to take such steps as might be necessary to have the appointment made to the position of principal of the Portlaoise vocational school and also ruled that the committee were and are in breach of their statutory duty.  The High Court judge deliberately did not give any directions as to who should be appointed and in this regard, as I see it, Mr. Phelan did not get the decision he was expecting to get.  Nonetheless, it was open to the Laois Vocational Committee to mend their hand and appoint him as they should have appointed him earlier on, but, instead of that, the committee, despite the decision of the High Court which stated that the committee were and are in breach of their statutory duty, still refused justice to Mr. Phelan and readvertised the position.  It is in the consciousness of the fact that this position has been readvertised and a brand new interview arrangement is being set up that I raise this matter.</P>
    <P>I have no reason to think that the present Minister is anything but a decent man and he decided to instruct the committee not to go ahead with advertising this position until he had an opportunity of studying the High <Col N="1504" /> Court judgment.  Since then, during the Easter holiday period, his Department indicated to the CEO that the advertisement could be inserted.</P>
    <P>I still feel that Mr. Phelan will prove to be the best qualified, but incorporated in the advertisement is the standard statement that canvassing will disqualify.  A member of the committee has already stated publicly at committee level that if anybody opens his mouth in favour of Mr. Phelan&mdash; even my raising this tonight&mdash;he will see to it that Mr. Phelan is disqualified as having canvassed for the position or arranging to have canvassing done on his behalf.  If Mr. Phelan applies for the position of headmaster it is my personal view that he will not receive justice from the interview board dealing with this appointment. I should like to state categorically that Mr. Phelan has made no effort to contact me in relation to this motion. I am saying this in the consciousness of the fact that despite the fact that the Teachers' Association of Ireland and the new Minister will have two members on that selection committee they will prove once again, as they did in June, 1974, to be ineffective against the powers of the four members of the Laois VEC who have been nominated to hold the interviews.</P>
    <P>What hope has Mr. Phelan of being appointed by this committee?  Surely, his chance of appointment has in no way improved over the last three years.  That cannot be fair play and there cannot be a just recommendation from such a loaded interview board.</P>
    <P>I feel, (1) that the advertisement should never have reappeared and (2) that the Minister should have dismissed this committee altogether on the basis that it is impossible to get fair play from them and because of their non-conformity with their statutory obligations.</P>
    <P>When I raised this matter previously I said I did not want the Minister to dismiss the committee because I was conscious of the important part a vocational committee play at local level but this committee have gone too far in their attitude.  I note in fact, the Minister for Defence, Deputy O. J. <Col N="1505" /> Flanagan, has arranged to have himself appointed to this interview board.  I frankly think that this is disgraceful. I have never heard before in the history of this State of any Minister of State holding on to a position as a member of a county council in the event of his being appointed a Minister. Deputy Flanagan has and he has held on to his position as a member of a subsidiary body of that county council in order to use undue influence on that committee and on fellow-members on that committee.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the outcome of my request for an inquiry in this regard the Taoiseach should have called on the Minister for Defence, Deputy Flanagan, before now to give up his positions on the county council and the vocational committee.  He has already done so on the county committee of agriculture and on the Midland Health Board, but not on this committee where he and a particular colleague exert more than undue influence on the other members who are afraid&mdash;I say that deliberately&mdash; of both Deputy Flanagan and his sidekick who shall be nameless.  I know every member of this maverick committee and I am satisfied that the vast majority of them are decent men, I cannot understand why they have so consistently been a party to the victimisation of William Phelan.</P>
    <P>It was stated at one stage that one of the reasons why Mr. Phelan was not the number one choice was that he was not a &ldquo;leader&rdquo;.  If I might digress, I should like to point out that Portlaoise senior footballers won the Leinster Club Championship title this year.  They were beaten ultimately in the All-Ireland semi-final by Austin Stacks of Kerry, who won the All-Ireland and who stand head and shoulders above the rest.  The man mainly responsible for organising, leading and cultivating the young people of the Portlaoise football team to win the Leinster final and go within a few points of becoming All-Ireland champions was William Phelan.</P>
    <P>All of us know how difficult it is in a chief town in a county to keep young men together, to keep them organised, to keep them disciplined. <Col N="1506" /> This, in fact, is what Mr. Phelan did and everyone in Portlaoise is proud of the achievement of that aspect of Mr. Phelan's work.  He has the same capacity for leadership which could be ideally operated at vocational committee level and the man preferred to him will not hold a candle to him from the point of view of leadership. That is my view of Mr. Phelan's qualifications for the headmastership, apart altogether from his academic qualifications and his experience to which reference has already been made.  It has never been suggested that this controversy has been engaged in because of the fact that Mr. Phelan is politically associated with Fianna Fáil because this is simply not so.</P>
    <P>In fact, the active members of the committee opposed to the appointment of William Phelan were the very people who supported his appointment as vice-principal some years previously. He had been vice-principal and, if we had a normal committee, one would have expected Mr. Phelan to have been automatically promoted to the vacant principalship when that vacancy arose.  When the vocational committee recently, following the High Court decision, decided to re-advertise the position the immediate pupil and teacher reaction was to strike and refuse to attend the school. Now I have, as I said before in this House, met representatives of the student group who were protesting at the committee's decision.  They stressed that the administration and discipline in the school were chaotic and they instructed me to ask the Minister to examine the results achieved by the students in all examinations in 1976 as an indication of the inadequacy of the education being offered.  This, they stressed to me, was not because of any incapacity on the part of their teachers but appeared to arise from a widespread lack of dedication within the school establishment itself.</P>
    <P>Following on the student strike a short time ago, things have improved in that the Minister instructed the committee not to readvertise the post the day after my raising the matter in this House on 9th March last.  On his instructions the committee appointed <Col N="1507" /> the CEO, Mr. O'Connor, as principal <i>pro tem.</i> The result of this was that Mr. Phelan, as vice-principal, became responsible for administration and things began humming immediately. Unfortunately, however, during the Easter break the Minister, to his everlasting shame, sanctioned the readvertising of the position.  If the overall situation were not so frighteningly serious one could be excused for joining with so many Laois readers in laughing scornfully when they read in our local paper&mdash;<i>The Leinster Express</i>&mdash;an account of a contribution made by the Minister for Defence, Deputy Flanagan, at a recent vocational education committee meeting.  The following quotation from <i>The Leinster Express</i> reads:</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan described the school as one of the best and finest in Ireland and said there was a grave responsibility on the members of the Committee to do what they could to end the dispute.</P>
    <P>This was a reference to the students' recent strike.</P>
    <P>But the good name of the school has been dragged irresponsibily across the floor of Dáil Éireann by some public representatives.  I hope that those who want to be criticised by Portlaoise Vocational School will be silent from here on.  I deplore the small group of public representatives who have been decrying the service of this school.</P>
    <P>Here, once again, was a further example of the master of hyprocisy stating his claim for appointment as chancellor of its university.</P>

      <P>On the Chair's ruling that the phrase should not be used, I withdraw the phrase.  I should like now to summarise by making the following points.  The ruling of the High Court judge on Monday, 28th February, 1975, stated that the subterfuge of the Laois Vocational Education Committee appointing Mr. Parsons as acting principal and leaving him in that position over a lengthy period without the consent of the Minister was wholly improper.  I suppose if I accused the Minister for Defence now of subterfuge I would probably have to withdraw that.  The High Court judge went on to say that this committee &ldquo;was and is in breach of its statutory duty&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister to take action. At the original appointment meeting held on 10th June, 1974, the chairman, Deputy O.J. Flanagan, informed the members &ldquo;that he had confirmation from a reputable firm of solicitors, who had consulted senior counsel, that the clauses in Memorandum V.7, section 12 (b) `that the person appointed should have not less than five years' whole time teaching experience' was not mandatory, but was more a recommendation&rdquo;. This mis-statement, I assert, started the whole controversy. The minutes for that meeting show Deputy Flanagan's attitude: &ldquo;He would not accept the Department's ruling in this matter as conveyed in his letter of 30th May, 1974, to the CEO&rdquo;.  Deputy O. J. Flanagan is now a Minister himself.  I quote from the minutes of the meeting of 8th July, 1974: &ldquo;The Committee would not accept the fact that Mr. Parsons was ineligible in accordance with the terms of Memorandum V.7&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 7th March last Councillor <Col N="1509" /> Keenan announced that the vocational committee costs in the High Court case, which they lost, would be paid by way of subvention from the Department of Education.  I want to know will the Minister now inform the House if he is going to pay the costs of the case, costs which arose because of the VEC refusal to obey instructions from his predecessor and his Department.  We have had a truly laughable situation.  The committee objected to having letters written to them by the Department on the Minister's behalf.  They wanted the Minister to write his own letters to them and, if he did not do that, the letters amounted to nothing.</P>
    <P>Finally, the committee at their meeting on 13th January, 1976, at the direction of Chairman Flanagan decided they would not re-advertise the post.  Why, then, did the Minister allow them to re-advertise without rescinding the two-thirds majority decision?  If ever conduct deserved to be fully investigated surely the conduct of this committee does.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to quote instances but I do not believe there ever was an instance where a committee carried on in such a rebellious manner as did Laois Vocational Education Committee over the last three years.  My worry is that this was done at the expense and to the detriment of the pupils.  I have not seen any amendment circulated to my motion and that leads me to believe the Minister is accepting my motion.</P>

      <P>Even if it should involve repetition of some of the details given by Deputy Lalor in the interests of putting this matter in proper perspective it is important to recount the history of the case from the beginning. By way of an advertisement published in the public Press in April, 1974, the <Col N="1510" /> County Laois Vocational Education Committee invited &ldquo;applications from suitably qualified candidates for the position of Principal of Portlaoise Vocational School&rdquo;.  It was also stated in the advertisement: &ldquo;Qualifications and conditions of appointment as set out in paragraph 12 (b) and Appendix C (ii) Memo.  V.7. of Department of Education.&rdquo;  That memorandum V.7. is a document issued by my Department which governs the appointment, qualifications and scales of salary of whole-time teachers under vocational education committees.  The memorandum also covers appointments in the case of whole-time teachers permanently appointed to posts of responsibility in such schools, including posts as principal and vice-principal.  The provisions of the memorandum are reviewed from time to time and amended as and when considered necessary or desirable.  Consultations for this purpose may take place between my Department, the Irish Vocational Education Association, which is the body representative of vocational education committees which are the managerial authorities of vocational schools, and the Teachers' Union of Ireland representing the interests of vocational teachers generally.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated, the advertisement published in April, 1974 by the County Laois VEC inviting applications from suitably qualified candidates for the post of Principal of Portlaoise Vocational School specified that the qualifications and conditions of appointment for the post would be those set out in paragraph 12 (b) and Appendix C (ii) of Memorandum V.7. Paragraph 12 (b) of the memorandum in operation at the time of the adverttisement read as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person appointed in a permanent wholetime capacity to any post as Principal should be a fully qualified teacher with a capacity for organising.  The choice of teacher will depend on the requirements of the centre, but should be such that he can be employed at the centre for the appropriate number of teaching hours.  In the case of a school with a points rating over 449 the person appointed should <Col N="1511" /> have not less than five years' whole-time teaching experience preferably in the vocational education service. In the case of a school with points rating up to 449, the period of whole-time teaching experience should be not less than three years.</P>
    <P>The points rating of Portlaoise Vocational School exceeded 449 at the time, and still does, and pursuant to the above terms of paragraph 12 (b) of Memorandum V.7. the requirement that the person appointed to the post should have not less than five years' whole-time teaching experience in the vocational education service is applicable in the case.</P>
    <P>According to information supplied to my Department, the County Laois VEC received nine applications for the post of Principal of Portlaoise Vocational School in response to their published advertisement.  In accordance with normal practice, the candidates were called for interview by a central selection board on 17th May, 1974.  Seven of the candidates are recorded as having been so interviewed. One of the candidates was reported not to have presented himself for interview; no information is available to the Department regarding the ninth candidate.</P>
    <P>In accordance with established procedure, the Central Selection Board consisted of seven members&mdash; four nominated by the County Laois Vocational Education Committee and including their chairman, one representative of the Irish Vocational Education Association and two officers of my Department.</P>
    <P>The selection board reduced the candidates for the post to a first and second choice.  The order in which these two candidates were placed by the four nominees of the vocational education committee on the selection board was not acceptable to the other three members of the board, namely, the representative of the Irish Vocational Education Association and the two nominees of the Minister for Education, because the candidate placed first by the VEC nominees did not have the minimum of five years' whole-time teaching experience, <Col N="1512" /> preferably in the vocational education service, required by the terms of paragraph 12 (b) of memorandum V.7., whereas the candidate placed second by the VEC nominees did comply with this and the other requirements for the post.  In the event, in the report of the meeting of the selection board on 17th May, 1974, it was stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>We, the members of the Central Selection Board, having examined the applications received and interviewed the candidates hereby select the following and place the others in order of preference for the post of Principal, Portlaoise Vocational School:</P>
    <P>First came the candidate <i>without</i> minimum of five years' whole-time teaching experience; second came the candidate <i>with</i> more than five years' whole-time teaching experience.</P>
    <P>The report was signed only by the four nominees of the VEC and also by the committee's chief executive officer as secretary to the selection board but not by the other three members of the board.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;first-choice&rdquo; candidate of the members of the VEC on the selection board was and is still a permanent wholetime teacher of English and History, and has been in the whole-time employment of County Laois VEC since September, 1971.  He was previously employed on a temporary basis as a teacher in Terenure College, Dublin, from September, 1970, to June, 1971.  At the time of his selection therefore he had not the minimum of five years' whole-time teaching experience we referred to in paragraph 12 (b) of memorandum V.7.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;second-choice&rdquo; candidate of the members of the VEC on the selection board was and still is a permanent wholetime teacher of science who has been in the wholetime employment of County Laois VEC since October, 1963.  He therefore complied at the time with the requirement of five years' whole-time teaching experience referred to in paragraph 12 (b) of memorandum V.7.</P>
    <P>On 20th May, 1974, the chief executive officer of the committee wrote <Col N="1513" /> to the Department indicating that, notwithstanding the views expressed by the IVEA representative and the Minister for Education's nominees at the meeting of the selection board on 17th May, 1974, the VEC members on the board had selected as their first choice the candidate who did not fulfil the requirement referred to in respect of teaching experience.  The CEO requested an indication of the Department's view in the matter in time for the meeting of the VEC on 9th June, 1974, at which the selection would be considered.</P>
    <P>The Department replied to the CEO on 30 May, 1974, stating that the &ldquo;first-choice&rdquo; candidate was ineligible for appointment as principal of Portlaoise Vocational School and adding:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The relevant rule as set out in Paragraph 12 (b) of Memorandum V.7. makes it clear that a minimum of five years' whole-time teaching experience is a necessary qualification for this post and not merely a desirable qualification.</P>
    <P>The meeting of the VEC at which the appointment was considered was held on 12th June, 1974, and the report on the selection board&mdash;signed only, as I have said, by the four nominees of the VEC on the board&mdash;was before the meeting, as was the Department's letter of 30th May, 1974.</P>
    <P>Two proposals were proposed and seconded for consideration by the Committee. The first:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the report of the Selection Board be adopted and the Committee now approve of the appointment of (the Selection Board's named first choice) as Principal of Portlaoise Vocational School from 1st September, 1974.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Second was an amendment:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That (the Selection Board's named second choice) be appointed to the post of Principal, Portlaoise Vocational School, as from 1st September, 1974.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The amendment was put and defeated on a show of hands by eight votes to four.  The original motion was carried by the same majority.  The chairman <Col N="1514" /> accordingly declared the first-choice candidate appointed to the post as Principal, Portlaoise Vocational School, with effect from 1st September, 1974, subject to the sanction of the Minister for Education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department informed the VEC by letter dated 5th July, 1974, that it was not open to the Department to sanction the first choice candidate's appointment for the reasons set out in its letter of 30 May, 1974, to which I have already referred.</P>
      <P>In the minutes of the committee's meeting on 8th July, 1974, it was stated that the Committee would not accept the fact that the first-choice candidate was ineligible in accordance with the terms of memorandum V.7. A motion at the meeting that the first choice candidate be appointed as &ldquo;Principal Teacher-in-Charge&rdquo; was carried by nine votes to two, and an amendment that the second-choice candidate be appointed &ldquo;Teacher-in-Charge&rdquo; was defeated by the same voting.</P>
      <P>The next letter from the Department to the VEC in the matter was dated 29th August, 1974.  This letter made it clear that there was not included among posts of responsibility in vocational schools a post carrying the title of &ldquo;Principal Teacher-in-Charge&rdquo;, and again pointed out that the first-choice candidate was not considered eligible for appointment as principal of Portlaoise Vocational School.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next proposal which my Department received from the VEC following the Committee's meeting on 9th September, 1974&mdash;a proposal carried by <Col N="1515" /> nine votes to five&mdash;was that the first-choice candidate be appointed as acting principal without remuneration, as from 10th September, 1974.  An amendment that the second-choice candidate be appointed to the post of Principal as advertised was defeated by the same majority.</P>
    <P>The Committee were informed in writing on 18th September, 1974, that this new proposal could not be sanctioned by the Department.  The Department stressed in the same letter that it was essential in the interests of the pupils concerned that the vacant post of Principal of Portlaoise Vocational School should be filled immediately in accordance with the provisions of Memorandum V.7. particularly paragraph 12 (b) thereof.  It was stated, too, that the Department considered that as the first-choice candidate was not eligible for the post, the candidate placed next in order of choice should be appointed since he was fully qualified and eligible for the post.</P>
    <P>The Department's letter of 18th September, 1974 was considered by the VEC at its meeting on 23rd September, 1974.  It was proposed and seconded:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Department's letter of 18th September, 1974, be marked `read' that no further action be taken on it, and that this Committee confirm the temporary appointment of (the `first-choice' candidate) as acting Principal, without remuneration, of Portlaoise Vocational School.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>An amendment to this motion was proposed and seconded in the following terms:</P>
    <P>That the instructions in Department's letter of 18.9.74 be carried out and that (the `second choice' candidate be appointed to the fulltime permanent post of Principal at Portlaoise Vocational School.</P>
    <P>On a vote, the amendment was defeated by nine votes to five, and the original motion was carried by the same voting.</P>
    <P>At this stage my predecessor caused two letters to be addressed to the <Col N="1516" /> chairman of the VEC, the first on 4th October, 1974, signed by himself, and the second on 22nd October, 1974, signed on his behalf because of his absence abroad on official business. The following is an extract from the first of those letters:</P>
    <P>I am sure that on reflection your Committee will agree that the circumstances of the case are such that I cannot sanction the appointment proposed without contravening the regulations and thereby perpetuating an injustice on fully qualified, eligible and suitable candidates.</P>
    <P>In the second letter, of 22nd October, 1974, following a reiteration of the previous position taken by the Minister in the matter and a statement that this was a position from which the Minister was not empowered and had no wish to depart in all the circumstances of the case, it was added:</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot but regret that the Committee should, in a relatively simple matter which should not give rise to contention, persist in an attitude which cannot be regarded as being in the best interests of all concerned.  Accordingly, the Minister is constrained to request again that the Committee will reconsider the filling of the vacancy in question and will submit a proposal of which he will be able to approve in accordance with established practice, procedures and regulations.</P>
    <P>Consideration of these letters at the Committee's meeting on 11th November, 1974,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister go ahead with that second letter of 23rd October, to embrace the bit I put into it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not quoted it. Consideration of these letters at the Committee's meeting on 11th November, 1974, again led to opposing motions for the appointment of the &ldquo;second choice&rdquo; candidate to the substantive post of principal and for the appointment of the &ldquo;first choice&rdquo; candidate as acting principal.  The <Col N="1517" /> second motion, which was an amendment to the first, was carried by eight votes to four, and the first motion was declared lost by the same margin.</P>
      <P>The minutes of the committee's meeting on 11th November, 1974, incorporated a statement in justification of the action hitherto taken by the committee in the matter.  My Department wrote to the committee on 5th December, 1974, indicating that the Minister was satisfied that the considerations outlined in that statement were entirely irrelevant in the context of the central point which was at issue.  The Department's letter went on to say:</P>
      <P>The central point on which the views of the Minister and of his Department have been made abundantly clear in correspondence with the Committee is that, notwithstanding the availability of a candidate who fulfils the requirements for the post of Principal in accordance with the Committee's own advertisement and in accordance with the relevant terms of the Department's Memorandum V.7., the Committee has persisted in proposing that the post be filled in one form or another by a candidate who does not comply with the requirement applicable to Portlaoise Vocational School that `the person appointed should have not less than five years' whole-time teaching experience, preferably in the vocational education service'.</P>
      <P>This letter was read at the committee's meeting on 9th December, 1974, and the following resolution was carried by nine votes to five:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Laois Vocational Education Committee instruct its solicitor, Mr. J.G. Bolger, to initiate High Court proceedings forthwith to establish the priority of the Committee's actions in appointing the &ldquo;first choice&rdquo; candidate to the position of Principal, Portlaoise Vocational School, and in presently maintaining him in the position of Acting Principal without remuneration, and further to determine whether the word `should' in paragraph 12 (b) of memo V.7. of <Col N="1518" /> 1/9/72 and section 16 (2) of revised memo.  V.7. of 1/9/74 was mandatory or optional, as the Committee acted in the premises that the word was optional.</P>
    <P>The committee's legal adviser sought and obtained the advice of senior counsel in the matter.  The advice was dated 7th March, 1975.  I do not think it necessary for me to go into the nature of the advice in detail except to say that senior counsel stated that he could not guarantee that proceedings in the High Court would be successful.</P>
    <P>Correspondence read at the committee's meeting in June, 1975, indicated that the &ldquo;second choice&rdquo; candidate was contemplating taking High Court proceedings against the County Laois VEC.  The candidate subsequently lodged a statement of claim in the High Court and, since the case became <i>sub judice</i>, accordingly, my Department was precluded from taking any further action in the matter pending the hearing of the claim.</P>
    <P>Now we move to the present time &mdash;from June, 1975, to early this year. The claim was heard in the High Court on 16th and 17th February, 1977.  The plaintiff sought:</P>
    <P> (a)  A Mandatory Injunction directing the first named Defendants (the County Laois VEC) that they shall take all necessary steps to appoint the Plaintiff (Mr. Phelan) to the position of Principal of the Portlaoise Vocational School and submit his nomination and appointment for the sanction and approval of the Minister for Education, and if sanctioned and approved, that they shall appoint him to the said position.</P>
    <P>(b)  If necessary, a Mandatory Injunction directing the first named Defendants (the County Laois VEC) to rescind and revoke any purported appointment of the second-named Defendant to the said post.</P>
    <P>(c)  Damages for breach of Statutory Duty.</P>
    <P>(d)  Further and other relief.</P>
    <P>(e)  Costs. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1519" /> Reserved judgment on the claim was delivered on 28th February, 1977, and, while I understand that a certified copy of this judgment is not yet available, my information is that the judgment was generally to the following effect: (1) That Michael Parsons is not principal or acting principal of the school and (2) that the committee is bound forthwith to take such steps as may be necessary to have an appointment made to the position of principal of the school.</P>
    <P>The general tenor of the High Court judgment was considered by the County Laois VEC at their meeting on 7th March, 1977.  Two motions were proposed and seconded at the meeting: (1) &ldquo;That the name of Mr. Liam Phelan be now submitted to the Minister for Education for sanction to post as Principal, Portlaoise Vocational School&rdquo;.  (2) &ldquo;That an advertisement seeking applications for the position of Principal of Portlaoise Vocational School be inserted in Dublin daily papers of 9th and 10th March, and in the local papers in the week ending 12th March&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On a vote, the second motion was carried by eight votes to five; the first motion was defeated by the same margin. On becoming aware of this decision my Department officially informed the committee by letter dated 8th March, 1977, that the post should not be advertised pending consideration of the legal issues involved arising from the High Court judgment. Subsequently, having obtained legal advice in the matter, my Department issued a letter to the VEC on 6th April, 1977, conveying sanction for the committee's proposal to advertise the post.</P>
    <P>The present position, accordingly, is that an advertisement has been placed in the public press by the County Laois Vocational Education Committee inviting applications for the post of Principal in Portlaoise Vocational School.  In the advertisement the points rating of the school was given as 1419 and the qualifications stated to be required are as follows:</P>
    <P> (a)  Candidates must be fully qualified <Col N="1520" /> post-primary teachers with a capacity for organising and administration and a minimum of five years' satisfactory teaching experience, preferably in the vocational education service.</P>
    <P>(b)  A knowledge of Irish of the standard of the Department's Céard Teastas Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>(c)  Qualifications and conditions of service are set out in memo.  V.7. of the Department of Education.  In addition to salary and other allowances at the usual rate, the post carries an annual allowance of £1,170 (under review).</P>
    <P>(d)  Application forms and terms of appointment may be had from the Chief Executive Officer. </P>
    <P>Completed application forms must be returned to reach the administrative offices of the vocational education committee not later than 5 p.m. on Friday, 29th April, 1977.</P>
    <P>That is the end of this current action. I anticipate that after the closing date for the receipt of applications the normal procedure will be followed for the selection of the teacher for this post and that a proposal in this regard will be made to me in due course by the vocational education committee.  It will be a matter for me to decide at that stage whether the proposal which will be made to me may be approved or not. Because of the duties involved, I cannot visualise a more inappropriate time than this stage of the procedures for the filling of the post for the introduction of this motion.  I do not know what could have motivated Deputy Lalor to put it down at this time and how his sense of judgment and timing could have so deserted him in doing so. I shall be acting in an objective and completely impartial manner in discharging my statutory duty when the relevant proposal comes before me from the VEC and it would not be proper for me, nor do I think that it could be expected of me, to make any statement just now which might be interpreted as being in any sense prejudicial to my subsequent objective approach to the matter.  I do not, therefore, intend to comment further on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>My comments on this motion will be brief.  I support the <Col N="1521" /> motion for an inquiry as set down in the name of Deputy Lalor.  I was slightly angered by the Minister's remarks just before he sat down.  The Minister said that there was no more inappropriate moment for this motion and that he did not know what had prompted it.  Injustice prompted it and the Minister should not look around for another reason.  From listening to the Minister, who is a man of some character, I gathered that he was ashamed of what he was reading.  It was obvious to me that he wanted to rush through it as quickly as possible because he did not like the brief because there was a smell about what had happened and he did not want to be associated with it.</P>
      <P>In view of what Deputy Lalor said about the imminence of the interviews for this position, I ask the Minister for an assurance out of respect to this Parliament that this discussion will not in any way affect the interviews for this position in Laois.  Will the Minister give an assurance that he will write to the interview board and state that a discussion in the national Parliament will in no way prejudice the case for an applicant for the position of headmaster of Portlaoise Vocational School?</P>

      <P>I pointed out earlier on how untimely this motion was.  I am sure Deputy Lalor did not think deeply enough about it before putting it down.  It has been put down and has been accepted by the Chair and in view of what Deputy Wilson has said I am willing to write to the chairman of the VEC and whoever else is involved to tell them to ignore in their interviews of each candidate anything that is said in this House tonight.</P>

      <P>Mr. Burke, the former Minister for Education, stated in this House that a person who did not have qualifications at the time the original interview was held and the original appointment was advertised could not by the passage of time gain those qualifications because they were time qualifications.  I would like that to be recorded as it was recorded before in this House.</P>
      <P>I did not particularly want to take part in this debate but the goings on convinced me that I should say something. One of the sad things is that this is going on since 1974.  Anybody who is familiar with the workings of a school will realise that that is a long time.  When we are at school we tend to regard the five or six year period of our post primary education as a long period.  In retrospect it looks very short.  We must remember that since this thing started people have finished a full group certificate course and others have finished a full intermediate certificate course in this school.  It is sad that our elders and who are regarded as our betters should not have solved this problem long ago in the only way that it should have been solved, that is, by applying the rules laid down by the Department of Education, and manfully adhered to by the former Minister for Education, Mr. Burke, now our Commissioner in Brussels.  The facts of the situation were stated by Deputy Lalor and repeated by the Minister for Education. It seems that an unqualified man was recommended for the post and was rejected by the Minister.  A qualified man was placed in second position.  I note with interest that this man's qualifications were in science and mathematics and I should think that not merely were his qualifications acceptable timewise but the very subjects which he had were particularly suited to a vocational school where the bias should be, and usually is, towards the practical, towards science and towards technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Subject to the sanction of the Minister&rdquo; are the important words wisely written into the memo in times gone by.  The actions of the committee, the attempt to appoint somebody else, were not agreed to by and did not <Col N="1523" /> receive the sanction of the Minister. When the present Minister for Defence, then Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan, returned from an extended trip to the United States and Canada, he made a statement at Dublin Airport that he agreed with the system of patronage in political life which obtained in the United States.  Provided that the people had the necessary qualifications Deputy Flanagan said he would give positions to people who belonged to his own political party.</P>
    <P>That evening the present Minister for Foreign Affairs was speaking in Trinity College and when a student taxed him with this he said that there was no place in the future Fine Gael Party for people who held those views. In the intervening years I always thought that Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan, now Minister for Defence, was the more honest of the two when one considers what happened in other spheres, particularly in judicial spheres, since this Government took office.  I had a kind of respect for Deputy O.J. Flanagan but he fell down in this case when he attempted to have somebody appointed who did not have the basic qualifications for the job.  All kinds of stratagems and devices and all kinds of attempts were made to justify the selection of a man whom the rules, the Department and the Minister for Education regarded as being unqualified for the position.</P>
    <P>Acting principal, principal in charge, and all kinds of titles were thought up to justify what Deputy O. J. Flanagan was trying to do.  Each time the old lady in Marlboro Street said no, but the committee, led by the Minister for Defence, came back and said they would have their way.  This man, who was arrogating to himself the procurator-generalship of the County of Laois, intended seeing to it that the Minister for Education and the Department, regardless of what they thought, would be set at naught.  Then the case went to the High Court where, in effect, the decision was that in their shenanigans, the committee were doing wrong.  Consequently, an order was made that the appointment be made in accordance with the rules laid down by the Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1524" /> That is the position we are at now. I referred to the harm that can be done in a school.  In his brief Deputy Lalor referred to the disruption, the discontent and the effect this sort of situation can have on the studies of the pupils.  That is the most important point.  Anybody who understands schools knows that a spirit exists in schools, that schools have their own kind of life, albeit artificial, transient and temporary, but it is that kind of spirit that enables reasonable study to be undertaken.  Obviously this situation has not been the case in Portlaoise since this whole shameful exercise started.</P>
    <P>I would agree with Deputy Lalor when he says that the committees are important.  They are important for many reasons, some of which I will refer to later.  The previous holder of the office of the Minister for Education refused to abolish that committee or to suspend it.  I can think of a possible reason for this other than the purely political one&mdash;that the principle of a local committee having responsibility in education was somewhat in danger.  But this principle was not put in danger by the Department of Education.  It was put in danger by the majority of the Laois VEC, led by a man who holds an important post in our Government.  This is the sad part of the affair.  This is irresponsible for a man who holds high office, particularly when that office is one in which it is important to have rules and regulations and, what is most important, that these be obeyed.  I do not think there is any Department of State in which the principle of laying down regulations and obeying them is more important than in the Department of Defence.  Consequently, the man concerned must stand condemned.</P>
    <P>I shall refer now to the importance of the committees in general.  Not merely in our society but in all societies recently there has been a movement towards the community, towards devolution in political, social and economic circles.  As the degree of sophistication and expertise in the people improves throughout a country, this movement gathers power.  It is very sad that an abuse of power at <Col N="1525" /> local level should in any way interfere with that movement.  In our society there is a strong concentration on the local community.  The idea in giving to the vocational education committees the powers they hold was for the purpose of enabling local people who knew local needs and who knew the local scene to exercise that power and exercise it better than people who were removed further from the scene.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the antics of the majority of the VEC in Laois will destroy people's belief in the effectiveness of vocational education committees but one is shaken badly by this kind of action.  It has been said that the fact that in the US, for example, education was controlled locally was harmful, that the people who held power in the local community, particularly in the black/ white situation, perpetuated their power through the schools and the education system generally.  Therefore, there is a danger where there is not a strong central power.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons I suspect for the proviso that all these appointments be subject to the sanction of the Minister is to prevent the possibility of such abuse.  But here we have a committee led by a man who should be giving an example, a man who is now in a position of power, who will be sending down orders to various towns and expecting these orders to be obeyed, who will, if he is doing his job properly, be the jealous guardian of the rules and regulations of the Department of Defence, and this man is flouting rules and regulations and challenging his own colleague, the former Minister who, to his credit, would not yield to Deputy Flanagan.</P>
    <P>In a recent issue of the magazine of the Teachers Union of Ireland there is a cartoon depicting two candidates for a position with a vocational education committee.  They are standing on two blocks while written on each block are the words &ldquo;political influence&rdquo;, with one block being higher than the other. This is an obvious reference to what the TUI think of a situation such as the one that obtains at Portlaoise.  I have here a letter, dated 20th May, 1975, which is subscribed by Maurice <Col N="1526" /> Holly, General Secretary of the Teachers Union of Ireland and which was sent to the then Minister for Education, Mr. Richard Burke.  It is regarding the post of principal in Portlaoise Vocational School and reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Dear Minister,</P>
    <P>I wish to inform you that my Executive Committee discussed this matter at its meeting on the 17th May.</P>
    <P>The members of the Executive Committee requested me to commend the Minister on his endeavours to uphold Memorandum V.7 to which the Union is a party.  They would urge that the Minister should continue to do so.  Further they would request the Minister to ensure that County Laois Vocational Education committee does not succeed in its efforts to set aside Memorandum V.7.</P>
    <P>Clear words do not need interpretation. There are no clearer words than those contained in that letter to indicate that the TUI were behind the Minister for Education at that time and were in total opposition to the Laois Vocational Education Committee and their chairman, Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan, now the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education is a decent man.  He is honest.  From the way in which he made his case he has indicated that he is ashamed of the activities of his colleague.  However, there is no point in his trying to make this whole matter respectable by setting up now something which abides by the rules but which avoids the issue which began back in 1974.</P>
    <P>All local effort, all committee work, all new management in primary schools as well as purported new management in secondary schools will be looking at what happens here.  They will want to know exactly how they stand <i>vis-á-vis</i> Department regulations. The Minister for Education has in his hands the power to validate way ahead of time the actions of all local groups by seeing to it that the rules and regulations within which they work are strictly adhered to.  I am grateful to the Minister for the undertaking which <Col N="1527" /> he gave to me when I started my brief contribution.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lalor's motion states:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Education to hold an immediate public inquiry into the conduct of the County Laois Vocational Education Committee which according to a High Court decision was and is in breach of its statutory duty in relation to its failure to appoint a qualified Principal for Portlaoise Vocational School.</P>
      <P>This motion refers to the recent High Court decision.  The terms of the judgment are that Laois VEC should proceed immediately to fill the vacant position and appoint a principal of Portlaoise Vocational School.  It is proper that this position should be filled immediately and I am glad to see that this is being done.  It is essential, especially in the interests of the pupils attending this school, that the most suitable and best qualified person should be appointed now. We have been discussing the events which have occurred since April, 1974, and three years have now passed since the commencement of this business. There are many people who may be interested in obtaining this appointment and I am sure that the appointments committee will select the best candidate available.  Portlaoise Vocational School deserves the best possible principal.  Irrespective of the questions one wishes to raise, I would ask Deputy Lalor if he really believes that the public inquiry to which he refers would be in the best interests of Portlaoise Vocational School.  Will it be to the benefit of the pupils now attending that school who will be sitting for examinations in June?  I do not think it will serve any useful purpose.</P>
