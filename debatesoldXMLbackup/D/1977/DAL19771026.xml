      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): While I do not want to be controversial, I understand that the European Assembly Elections (No. 2) Bill has been ordered for today.  I made very careful inquiries last week about the timing of this Bill and was led to believe, on good authority, that it would not be taken this week.  This important Bill has been ordered to-day.</P>
      <P>There has not been a meeting of our Parliamentary Party since the Bill was published but there is a meeting today.  I am not in a position to proceed with the Bill and respectfully ask the House to leave it over until tomorrow morning at the latest while I prepare myself for it, notwithstanding the fact that I understood it was not being taken until next week.</P>

      <P>I understand the Whip's office was notified yesterday that this Bill was to be taken today. It was intended to take it this morning but in deference to the Opposition Whip the Bill was postponed, not to be taken first.  I want to tell Deputy <Col N="1162" /> Fitzpatrick that the Bill is exactly as it was drafted by his Government with the single exception of the change in the Schedule&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): When the debate was adjourned last evening I had dealt with a number of matters arising out of the Bill.  I was making the point that in my opinion the length of training given to Garda recruits in the Garda Depot, Templemore was very inadequate having regard to the complex nature of the duties which the gardaí have to undertake on taking up duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out, and I repeat, that they have to undertake considerable work of a legal nature.  They have to enforce practically every Bill passed by this House.  I have checked since and found that the total training given to Garda recruits in the depot is 22 weeks for physical training and instruction.  Then <Col N="1163" /> they are put on the beat or into a station.  It may be said that they are put into a station with experienced men but in these days, when the demands on the gardaí are heavy, I would regard this training as inadequate.  I further understand that refresher courses are given but there is nothing very definite about them.  They are a sort of hit and miss occurrence.  I would suggest that the Minister give serious consideration to extending the course to Garda recruits and also consider having refresher courses for young gardaí on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with machinery for resolving difficulties which arise between the Garda Síochána and their superiors and the Minister.  Nothing is more calculated to give rise to unrest and discontent between gardaí and their superiors and the Garda themselves than the question of overtime.  It was a grave mistake to introduce a system of overtime into a force like the Garda Síochána.  It is regrettable that a dedicated force like the Garda should have to resort to overtime to get an adequate salary.  I believe the strength of the Garda should be adequate to do the duties they are called upon to perform and that they should be adequately and well paid for the job they have to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Deputy but we had some maiden speeches on this Bill and allowed a lot of leniency but we are dealing with conditions and structures in the force.  I would not like the debate to wander too far beyond the general ambit of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I hope I will not do that, but this Bill is designed and calculated to deal with this type of difficulty, disputes between the rank and file of the Garda and the Commissioner, disputes between the Garda as a body and the Minister and the Government.  I do not intend to spend very much time on it but I cannot think of anything at the moment that is more likely to give rise to discontent within the force and between the force and the Minister and the Government than the question of <Col N="1164" /> overtime.  The best way of resolving these difficulties is to remove the cause.  That is the case I am trying to make at the moment.</P>
      <P>The Garda should be brought up to strength.  The former Minister increased the strength of the Garda by approximately 1,000 and they are numerically stronger than at any time in the history of the force.  If more gardaí are required the number should be further increased.  If the Garda are not being adequately remunerated at the moment their salaries should be increased.  The system whereby a man has to do overtime to augment his ordinary salary and bring it up to acceptable standards is wrong. It is bound to lead to differences of opinion and misunderstandings between the gardaí and their superiors from sergeant up to commissioner and up to Minister.  It is bound to create misunderstandings within the force in certain barracks as the question of who gets the overtime arises and the question of overtime becomes the burning question in the day to day and week to week working of the force.  It was a bad day's work to introduce that system.  The force should be increased numerically and their salaries should be increased to do away with this problem.  The Government seem to have money <i>ad lib</i> for anything that is wanted, or they certainly had it in very substantial sums before the election and they did not seem to have any trouble in getting it.  If the same money is still available this is one way of spending it, of making the Garda happy and of removing this bone of contention.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the recent allegations that have been made against members of the Garda.</P>

      <P>The Bill will not permit us to go into these matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): For two reasons I ask the Ceann Comhairle to bear with me. I will lay the grounds for my proposal. This is a Bill to regulate complaints within the Garda about the Garda and to give gardaí an opportunity of meaningfully making any <Col N="1165" /> legitmate complaints they may have. On that basis the points I wish to make are permissible.  It is highly desirable that what I have to say should be said now, having regard to a radio programme which took place last Sunday between 1 o'clock and 2 o'clock in which a member of a tribunal, commission or board of inquiry, before as far as I know that that body had ever met, discussed terms of reference and discussed what he was going to do, and said among other things, as I heard and as is reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Monday, 24th October, 1977 on page 1:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Committee would take the allegation as established, and see what could be done to prevent any recurrence of the alleged incidents.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wish to use temperate language and that is not easy having listened to this programme and having read this statement. I do not condone for one second any improper treatment of suspects or of accused persons, or persons held in custody whether that custody be of the Garda or the Army.  I disassociate myself and this party from any such treatment or any such conduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to prevent the Deputy from making reference to this but he is getting deeply into what could be a totally separate and irrelevant debate.  There will be other occasions.  It is not relevant to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am saying this in order that I may not be misunderstood.  It would be contrary to the proper treatment of prisoners and the administration of the criminal law, it would be contrary to our way of life, to our traditions and to all we have learnt, and I disassociate myself and my party completely from it.  If such things happen and if accusations are to be made they should be made to the accused people, the members of the Garda.  As far as I know the Amnesty investigators simply spoke to some unknown lay and professional people. The names of these people were not furnished.  The people against whom the accusations were made were not <Col N="1166" /> given any chance of defending themselves. They were not even told that these accusations were being made. Yet if Sunday's programme and the report in Monday's paper, which is an accurate report of what the learned gentleman said, are to be accepted on their face value the entire force are to be blackened in the public eye. The allegations are to be accepted, it says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is still persisting in dealing with this matter which is undesirable for many reasons.  It is irrelevant to the Bill before the House.  It is a matter which is under consideration at present to the extent that it could even be held to be <i>sub judice</i>.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I do not know what the standing of the tribunal is so how could it be <i>sub judice</i>?  If this is a judicial tribunal, I am forced to say that it is not behaving in a judicial way.  It was regrettable that the chairman of this board should see fit to fall for an invitation to come on the radio, because he was tempted by a member of the Fianna Fáil Party who talked about shaping and reforming the law at the same time.  This gentleman came on the radio after the tribunal had been set up and before it completed its work.  That is unthinkable.  The learned gentleman concerned has a long and honourable tradition at the Bar.  He was a prosecuting Counsel when I was a young solicitor, he then became a member of the Circuit Court, he became President of the Circuit Court, then he was seconded to Cyprus where he was President of the High Court.  His behaviour on Sunday was contrary to everything that anybody would expect from a legal gentleman of his standing and experience even from a final year law student never mind a man of that standing.  Apparently we have reached the age that when a microphone is put under one's &ldquo;gob&rdquo; one is bound to talk.  There is a time for talking and a time for remaining silent.  There is a time for going on the media and a time for staying in the judge's office or commission's room.  I ask the Minister <Col N="1167" /> to think seriously on what I have said. It is also something to which the Government should give thought at the very highest level.  I thank the Chair for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): There will, but the time has come when we should take a look at one's right to make a statement or not to make a statement; the right to give evidence or not to give evidence; the right of the prosecution to comment on the failure to make a statement or to give evidence.  It is time we had a look at the onus of proof. Should the onus of proof never shift? Should it remain where it is?  Those are all things worthy of consideration and thought and will have to be given such.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): But when we are bandying accusations about and putting people in the dock, it is correct that these things be mentioned, if not in depth certainly in a passing manner.

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I have rarely been more amazed, perhaps because of my legal background or training.  The Bill is a good one and should do a lot to create a healthy atmosphere for the Garda Síochána.  If we have a dissatisfied police force because its members have to keep their eyes on their notebooks in order to chalk up overtime, get a decent living or for any other reason, it is bad for the country.  They have served the country well.  I am confident that, given a fair crack of the whip, in the way in which they perform their duties and so on, they will continue to serve this State as fearlessly, courageously, impartially and unselfishly in the next 50 years as they have done in the last 50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I do not think any Member of this House would envy him his job; it is a most onerous and difficult portfolio.  Indeed, I would think that the prospects of success in that portfolio for our parliamentary colleague are good, not the least of which arises from the fact that he is not a lawyer, he is one of the very few non-legal luminaries of this House who has taken over the portfolio of the Department of Justice.  As such he may well see a new perspective in his task, in that very difficult and controversial Department where there are plenty of knocks to be taken and very little kudos to be received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I know it is not the brainchild of the present Minister. We are fully aware that it constitutes the outcome of tortuous, detailed, very complex and difficult negotiations between the Garda Representative Body, the Department of Justice and the former Minister.  I welcome the Bill in as much as it is a step forward in what I would hope ultimately would be a proper, democratic and responsive system of industrial relations to cater for the Garda and also, I would hope, for the other branch of our security <Col N="1169" /> forces, namely, the Army where there is no parallel system either of conciliation or of arbitration.  As we know, the situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Army is much more intolerable.  In the so-called open society we are supposed to have, in the parliamentary democracy we are supposed to administer, we have a situation in which both the Garda and the Army have but the minimum opportunity of exercising democracy in its truest and most responsible sense while performing their daily duties on behalf of all our citizens.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that, over the years, the Garda Síochána have been caught in a vice in relation to their industrial relations.  Once in power the political parties&mdash;and this applies as much to the Fine Gael and Labour Parties as it does now to Fianna Fáil&mdash;regard the Garda Síochána as a disciplined force. Indeed, the words &ldquo;disciplined force&rdquo; appear with monotonous regularity in relation to responses and representations in respect of their industrial relations system.  All the political parties, including my own, have been very slow, not very imaginative and very reluctant to concede that there should be a very sensitive and flexible system of industrial relations within the Garda Síochána.  There has always been this abiding fear within the Cabinets that somehow or another if one gives way in terms of representations over the years the Garda Síochána will finish up going on strike, that the country would be in a state of prospective peril were they to receive such a concession in terms of trade union organisation and ordinary conciliation and arbitration procedures.  It is true to say that the country is now somewhat more mature in terms of the fear to which I have just referred, or in terms of that over-reaction illustrated down the years.  This Bill is a slight indication of that maturity of reaction from the political parties.</P>
    <P>Another matter that has affected the Garda Síochána, of course, is the Department of Justice.  There has always been this tension&mdash;I suppose it is healthy in many ways&mdash;between the permanent public service, the hierarchy of the Department and the representative body, in so far as they are representative, <Col N="1170" /> of the Garda Síochána.  It is a necessary tension because we politicians come and go.  Essentially Ministers for Justice are birds of passage who leave their marks behind them.  I suppose the public servants regard it as their national duty to keep the game under control, if you like, while politicians make their entries and exits over the years.  But on occasions there has been excessive tension.</P>
    <P>In relation to traditional departmental attitudes regarding the industrial relations system of a disciplined force there is still an excessive rigidity. In his span of office&mdash;it may be a period of four years&mdash;the Minister will be able to take a long view of the role of industrial relations in the Garda Síochána.  I hope he will loosen the umbilical cord between the Department and its ever permanent eye keeping a watch on the system of industrial relations in the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>There are three factors that come into consideration&mdash;the political parties, the Department and the Commissioner. During the years the one terror the Commissioners have had is of being called before the Minister and the Government of the day and being asked what is going on within the force, what the members are doing and what they are writing in the journal of the Garda Representative Body.  We have had many eminent Commissioners during the years but all of them were subjected to the same pressures.  They have been extremely sensitive about the Garda Síochána having a proper system of industrial relations lest they lose the sense of discipline they exert over the force. Many of the Commissioners have been quite ruthless in exerting that discipline.</P>
    <P>In spite of the three pressures I have mentioned I am glad we have a Bill that goes a small step of the way towards having formal trade union organisation, representation and rights, and I stress the word &ldquo;rights&rdquo;. Of course, security duties run parallel to that.  We have gone but a small step of the way.  As in a number of western European democracies, I <Col N="1171" /> believe the Garda Síochána and the Army should have a formal right to have a trade union.  The right to strike is a security matter and it is one on which most of the political parties tend to share a common attitude.  If the Executive in the national interest deny to the Garda Síochána or the Army the right to withdraw their labour and thus put the country in peril we must, as a parallel, have systems of industrial relations that are exceptionally sensitive to the needs of the security forces.  We have not done that, even in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not necessarily critical of the Minister.  Perhaps I would be more critical of the extent of the response in relation to the previous negotiations in which the Minister was not involved. During the years I have asked that the State should not stand in the way of the Garda Representative Body seeking direct liaison with and possibly applying for membership of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions&mdash;whether they would be accepted is another matter.  I have always held the view that they should be allowed to do this and I do not think there is any danger in it.  I do not think the Commissioner would have to examine the constitution of the ICTU to find out if it was a subversive organisation if the Garda Representative Body were given the right to apply for membership of, say, the Public Services Committee of the ICTU.  They do not have that right. They should not be left in a situation where isolation inevitably produces tensions and a sense of being left out in the cold in the public service.  I would urge the Minister to have an open mind on this matter and to use his good offices.</P>
    <P>This legislation is an agreed measure and is the outcome of negotiations.  The Labour Party do not propose to oppose it because it is part of the package settlement between the Garda Síochána and the Minister.  I suggest it would be in the national interest if at a future date the Minister would sit down and consider the matter calmly, well away from what happened prior to the last election.  I had a certain sympathy for <Col N="1172" /> the former Minister for Justice because the closer the election got the more the questions we are discussing now became political footballs.  There is no better footballer on the political scene than the Minister, Deputy Collins.  I think he fielded quite a few more balls than did Deputy Cooney during the closing weeks of the last Dáil and he managed to emerge in a favourable light, at least from the public relations point of view.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, the Minister now has four years to consider what might be done.  He has sufficient confidence and is tough enough to ask his own Department to prepare a position paper whereby in the future there would be mutual agreement that the Garda Representative Body would be able if they wished to apply for membership of the ICTU.  That would be a step in the right direction.  It would be most beneficial to the conduct of negotiations in the Commissioner's office.</P>
    <P>There would also be other benefits. A person who spends all his life as a politician finishes up a marked man. The scars of politics, of office and the hurly-burly of political life leave their mark.  Similarly, a journalist finishes up with scars also.  The same can be said for a garda who may have to wait for 40 years before he can claim his pension. Inevitably that will have an effect on a member of our security forces, on his personality and on his social and industrial relations within the force.  That is why I am in favour of the various segments in the public service, in the State-sponsored sector, in the Garda Síochána and in the Army having an opportunity of becoming totally involved in other spheres of industrial relations.  They should have a close relationship with other trade unions in the ICTU.  It would be mutually beneficial.  Many of the myths, the phobias and the tensions which emerge when one is exclusively engaged in one profession would tend to be eliminated.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the following point.  The Garda Síochána are not given the right to strike because of security considerations. That prohibition has never been fully debated in the House in a calm, <Col N="1173" /> objective manner.  It is almost impossible to debate this in a political party because you run into the brick wall of attitudes.  Debating it in public tends to be less conducive to clarity than debating it in private.  The Garda now have access to a more sensitive system of conciliation and arbitration.  This was not won without a fair degree of internal battle.  I am not referring to the Department alone but to the Commissioner's office also.  I do not think there is much point in elaborating too much on this because people become so sensitive in relation to their attitudes that it does more harm than good.  It is no use giving the Garda beautiful operational systems and beautiful representation systems.  We know, unlike any other section of the public service, who can go on strike, that we have the Garda in the long run.</P>
    <P>The Minister should ensure that since there are clear limitations on the extent of the negotiations at conciliation and arbitration level there will have to be an exceptional response.  I refer particularly to procedures relating to discipline, transfers, promotions, conditions of employment, pay and remuneration. I believe those will follow the pattern of the public service.  There has been a great improvement in the levels of pay and conditions of employment of members of the Garda Síochána over the years but one always has expectations, no matter how well paid one is, even a politician.  Higher levels of pay very often create expectations.</P>
    <P>I have always been extremely concerned about overtime within the Garda Síochána.  I do not propose to elaborate on this because it is outside the scope of the Bill.  I urge the Minister and the Garda representative body not to permit a recurrence of the situation which we had some years ago where the standard of living and the expectations of the force became dependent on the level of overtime.  They then had a standard of living in excess of the normal salary.</P>
    <P>I believe we will have in 1979 and 1980 a situation where the State, in terms of projecting budgetary revenue <Col N="1174" /> in the context of the policies followed by the Minister for Finance, will be adding on another £3 million or £4 million per annum for overtime rates. It will become so much part of the pattern of remuneration that in the long run we will not have a contented force.  I would prefer to see such money spent on responsibility, allowances, and increases above the norm of the national pay agreement.  I am not a Margaret Thatcher in that regard where she is just scoring cheap political points in Britain asking that members of the police force be paid above the national norm.</P>
    <P>I believe a great deal of dissatisfaction and of the retrospective problems within the Garda Síochána arise from the system of overtime which is operated.  The Minister should ask his staff to consult frequently with the Garda Representative Body to ensure that the system of conciliation and arbitration does not get bogged down on that issue.  When politicians talk about security issues they often talk without very much consultation and put forward their own pet prejudices and in the long run we sometimes do more harm than good.  I hope I have not done so in my reaction to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I wish it a speedy passage through the House.  It is not our intention to put down amendments.  When we saw it first we were tempted to put down amendments. One could put them down but I think the agreements arrived at should be speedily implemented and we should move forward.  I believe that in the years ahead a new generation of young Irishmen serving their country in the Garda Síochána will have very different social and political attitudes than the men of my generation and my father's generation.  They will not be prepared to take some of the retrospective and historical conditions and attitudes which in a previous day were all right.  In ten years' time such men and women going into or coming out of Templemore, or anywhere on the beat around the country, will be a very different group.  The politicians should plan ahead for that type of social <Col N="1175" /> change and for the kind of problems which will face the people.  I commend the Minister for his speedy introduction of this Bill and wish him well in his portfolio.  I hope the House will give the Bill a speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish, first of all, to congratulate the Minister for Justice on the introduction of this Bill.  Everybody must be aware of his commitment as Minister for Justice to the many problems of his Department.  He has had many achievements in another Department.  I am quite confident that he will tackle many of the inadequacies he is aware of in the Department.</P>
      <P>This Bill is very welcome because it brings a new dimension for the Garda Síochána who have had a pretty tough passage for the past few years. They have been stretched to the limit. They have major tasks and responsibilities and have carried out their duties in an exemplary manner.  They have never surrendered to the pressures and stresses that have been on them individually and collectively.  The fact that the Bill proposes new rights for the Garda Síochána is indicative that the Minister very clearly understands the problems involved.  I believe the Bill will be the first of many initiatives he will take to restore morale within the force.  Morale has suffered severely.</P>
      <P>A compliment has been paid, with which I agree, to the previous Minister for Justice.  It was at the end of his Ministerial term that he really commenced to consider what was required in this regard.  The Garda have a very proud history.  Our force differs from police forces throughout the world in that it is comprised of the sons and daughters of farmers, business and professional people.  This has ensured that not alone are the Garda unique but they know and understand the public and their problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary function of the Garda has always been the protection of life and property and the prevention and detection of crime.  From time to time during the course of our history we have had violent and sinister periods. The Garda have at all times vigorously pursued the subversive, showing great <Col N="1176" /> bravery and competence, particularly in recent years they have been scarce on the ground.  It is gratifying that the Garda are once again to be seen in increased numbers in the streets of Dublin and in towns and villages throughout the country.  This has happened during the past few months.  It can only be seen as evidence of the seriousness of the Government and of the Minister for Justice in handling a crime situation which many people thought was getting out of control.  It is evidence of the importance being placed on the protection of life and property and the maintenance of an ordered society.</P>
    <P>One of the tragic features of the shortage of manpower in recent years was the fact that many small or minor crimes did not receive the necessary attention and investigation.  Resulting from that, the situation must arise where the minor can carry on criminal activity for a number of years and is only detected when involved in major capital crime.  One of the main reasons for the ineffectiveness of the pursuit of all types of criminal activity was, I believe, that overtime was largely terminated at a time when the force were employed on other important duties.  This affected not alone the morale of the force but the attitude of the public.  Gardaí were frustrated because they found themselves restricted and hampered in carrying out their duties.  The Garda have always been regarded by the people as a responsible body of men and women.</P>
    <P>It is delightful to note in the Minister's speech that the word &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; has been used frequently in relation to the introductin of this Bill. This quite clearly indicates the confidence of the Garda in the Minister and the harmonious relationship that will ensue.  The Bill brings about a new dimension for the Garda in so far as for the first time they are accorded the opportunity to involve themselves in their own affairs, efficiency and development.  They are being given the opportunity to have elections in which members who subscribe can participate.  They may concern themselves with discipline and promotion. <Col N="1177" /> two areas which have always been of great concern to the Garda.  We acknowledge that it is a disciplined force but if we are to have equity we must allow members of the force of all ranks to be involved in the enforcement of discipline.  In the past certain doubts and grey areas existed in relation to certain decisions concerning discipline.</P>
    <P>The opportunity to associate with certain agreed or approved outside bodies must bring about an openness and for the first time gives the members of the force the right to learn, develop and expand rather than continue on an insular course.</P>
    <P>With regard to the promotional aspect, in recent years the number of members seeking promotion from the lower ranks has been reduced and I have no doubt that the Minister is conscious of this.  If a man is promoted from the rank of garda to sergeant, he may be transferred to another area, at the expense of discomforting his family and changing his friends and associates.  He may have to start all over again in the provision of a home for his family and, as we all realise, this is a major task which can be more difficult as one gets older.</P>
    <P>The hazards of employment as a garda are unusual and very different from the conditions in many other jobs. The demands are great and the risk of personal injury is always there.  In fact, the risk of death exists and deaths have occurred too frequently in recent years.  Members are regularly separated from their families by the call of duty. In order to get the greatest response from the force we must try to give them the greatest possible protection. We must also try to ensure that the highest standards are maintained and rigorously suppress any tendency by any member of the force that would affect the high code that has always obtained within it.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that this Bill is the beginning of a close and concerned examination by the Minister of the structure of the force in relation to training.  At present the training period is four-and-a-half months and one <Col N="1178" /> often wonders whether this is sufficient. Training should be considered as ongoing throughout the service of any member.  For that reason, there should be more opportunities for members to specialise.  Every member has an important role to play and members should be afforded an opportunity to acquaint themselves with some particular area of police work.</P>
    <P>Public relations is very important at this time.  Many people have grown to understand and admire the humanitarian nature of the force through the good work of the Garda choir and band.  This type of public relations should be developed.  The Garda choir and band should be encouraged to participate in all types of community functions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I have no doubt that the Minister realised the implications for the force if he had not pursued the course he has in trying to restore the morale of the force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and wish to congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I wish him well in his difficult role, one which many politicians would not like as it has proved to be onerous in recent times.  Any effort to improve the welfare and efficiency of the Garda Síochána is to be praised.  The Garda need all the assistance that can be given to them by us because they too, like the Minister, have had a tough time in recent years. The Garda are part of a system which involves every citizen, a system which involves the preservation or the downfall of law and order.  In the main the public are helpful and do respond to appeals from the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Judiciary are also a part of the system but I have reason to be critical of certain aspects of their performance. I should like the Minister to bear in mind that a common criticism is the laxity with which a number of district justices treat habitual criminals.  For appointments to State positions there is generally a rigorous examination process. I do not know the criteria for the appointment of district justices but political patronage seems to be an obvious method.  However, we cannot afford to point a finger at anyone else <Col N="1179" /> in that regard.  I want to find out what qualifications are needed to be appointed to the Bench.  Whatever the method of appointment, the outcome seems to be unsatisfactory because a number of people have been appointed who do not seem to be suitable for the job.  The work of the Garda is seriously undermined by district justices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, a Cheann Comhairle, I am trying to pinpoint a serious undermining of the effectiveness of the Garda.  If any part of the system breaks down their work is undermined and I believe there is a breakdown in this regard.  Some district justices do a good job but far too many do not.  Senior and junior members of the Garda have spoken to me from time to time of the frustrations of bringing habitual criminals before the courts and having them given the benefit of the Probation Act or suspended sentences.  Recently a case was brought to my notice of a person who had been convicted twice of taking motor vehicles and driving without&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The authority of the Garda is being undermined by the manner in which habitual criminals, who assault and maim people and destroy private and public property are being treated.  I do not wish to adopt a hard line because many people who come before the courts are affected by the social illnesses in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will get an opportunity to discuss this matter under other headings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda should be given more support.  I do not support a hard line attitude but the system <Col N="1180" /> for appointing district justices does not always lead to a good choice.  Perhaps the problem is that solicitors are earning too much money at present. Any solicitor with ability can earn much more than the salary of a district justice.  I should like the Minister to consider this aspect of the problem because without the back-up of the Judiciary, gardaí can become frustrated, their morale can be lowered and, consequently, they will not put the same effort into their work as might otherwise be the case.  The whole country suffers as a result of that sort of situation.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell us, too, whether he has any intention of pursuing the policy of re-opening in rural areas stations that were closed in recent years.  These closures have resulted in many instances in a serious breakdown in communication between gardaí and the public who, as I have said already, are generally very willing to help the authorities.  The vital contact that was afforded by the presence of gardaí in rural areas has been lost by the closing down of various stations.</P>
      <P>The Minister should endeavour, too, in as far as possible to remove from gardaí the carrying out of routine tasks which could be undertaken by other personnel, thereby leaving the gardaí free to deal with the more serious aspects of their work.  The innovation of traffic wardens throughout the country was a major step in this direction. However, far too many gardaí are still involved in traffic control and in ordinary clerical duties.  In conclusion I wish the Minister every success in his task of ensuring that crime is controlled and that law and order is maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with the other Deputies who have spoken, I welcome this Bill.  I am very pleased, in particular, that the Minister has moved so quickly to implement this aspect of our manifesto which promised the setting up of satisfactory negotiating procedure for the Garda to investigate such areas as work, conditions, disciplinary complaints, transfers and promotions. <Col N="1181" /> This Bill is another indication of our commitment to that manifesto.  The setting up of this association is being acclaimed widely throughout the force. Obviously, the association will need to have very strong powers in order to represent adequately the interests of the Garda who, during the past four-and-a-half years have suffered a certain amount of injustice internally.  It must be difficult for members of the Garda to enforce the law and to be just in the administration of the law if they are not finding justice within the force.</P>
      <P>I have in mind, for instance, the whole area of transfers and requests for transfers.  What has been happening in recent years is that in the event of a member applying for a transfer to a location which, for family, humanitarian or, maybe romantic reasons, would suit him better than the area in which he was stationed, his request would be dealt with by transferring him to an area far removed from that for which he has asked.  For example, a garda serving in Donegal and wishing to be transferred to Roscommon, might be transferred instead to Cork. The result of this situation was that gardaí deferred requesting transfers until such time as there was a change of administration.  They are aware now that in the new Minister for Justice they have one who is humane, who is a man of integrity and one who will do his best to see that their interests are protected.</P>
      <P>The new association will provide the Garda with appeals machinery and with proper representation at the highest level.  The Garda have sufficient confidence in the Minister to believe that the association will operate properly and fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another situation that led to dissatisfaction in the force during the past four-and-a-half years was the direction to gardaí from the Commissioner to issue as many summonses as possible. Apparently, the greater the number of summonses a garda issued, the higher was to be his esteem.  It is my contention that the reverse is the case, that the best garda is the one who issues the least number of summonses. In other words, he is the one who has a good relationship with the community <Col N="1182" /> he is serving, who helps them as best he can.  The aim should be to build up a good relationship with the public and this means issuing summonses only for serious offences.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred to the work undertaken by traffic wardens.  I object to traffic wardens assuming Garda duties.  I have expressed my objection to the employment of traffic wardens in Roscommon town and in other towns throughout my constituency because they do nothing to improve relations between the authorities and the public. Local gardaí could, if they wished, ensure that illegal parking, for instance did not occur in a town but they use tact in their approach to the problem so that they can maintain their good relationship with the community.</P>
    <P>In order to maintain this good relationship a garda must be sensible and practical in regard to issuing summonses. To alienate the public would result in a very bad situation.  One section of the public who I think help in their own way in the fight against crime are taxi drivers by reason of their having radio contact facilities at their disposal.  Recently, though, I spoke to a taxi driver who told me that while on his way to Limerick at 1.30 one morning, he was apprehended for exceeding the speed limit by about one mile per hour.  He was duly summonsed and found that the entire incident cost him between £50 and £60.  It is regrettable that this should happen to a man who was doing his share in the fight against crime in this city.  Certainly, the incident will not enhance his opinion of the Garda.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of Garda conditions that I should like to mention is that of housing, a matter which I trust the new association will consider.  I expect it is something on which they will be able to make representations to the Minister for Justice.  I am thinking, in particular, of those gardaí living in NBA houses but who find that the dwellings are not being sold.  This leaves the gardaí in the position of being in the houses on a temporary basis only.  This is an unsatisfactory situation because, apart from the obvious considerations, if a man died <Col N="1183" /> while in the service, his widow would have to leave the house.  In these circumstances I urge the Minister to consider making provision for the sale of these dwellings to the gardaí concerned. Otherwise, they may have to build houses for themselves.  The NBA should be encouraged to build houses for gardaí in various locations because it is important that the gardaí are given every possible facility.</P>
    <P>Where gardaí have become established they should not be transferred unnecessarily.  Because they build up a good relationship with the community they are in a position to administer justice fairly but if the garda is to be changed from pillar to post he will not have the opportunity of building up this good relationship.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay a special tribute to the members of the Garda Síochána.  They have had a difficult time over the last few years.  Garda Dick Fallon, a native of my area, died in the course of his duty and I pay tribute to him and to all other members of the force who did the same. They have given their lives for this country and have shown how dedicated they and the members of the force are to their duty.</P>
    <P>The question of the Garda being an armed force has come up many times.  I am opposed to this idea and so are the members of the force.  They have survived for so long and they have worked well without being armed.  When we go abroad to Spain, America or elsewhere it is not encouraging to see members of the police forces there having to be armed when carrying out their duty.  We are lucky that in this country this has not been necessary, up to now at least.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  It should have been brought before the House many years ago.  The Minister is starting on the right foot in relation to the members of the force when they see that within four months of coming into office he has brought before the Dáil a Bill that will improve their situation. I encourage him to bring in as many measures as are necessary to improve the lot of the Garda.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief. In taking the opportunity of speaking, I welcome the Bill and I reiterate the support of myself and my party for the Garda Síochána.  We are glad to place on record our appreciation of the proud service that has been rendered to this State since their foundation by the Garda Síochána. Their record has been a noble one, and anything which tends to improve the conditions of the force must be welcomed by all parties in this House. The Bill goes a long way towards satisfying the legitimate aims of the members of the force in giving them an opportunity to express their problems and in providing a way of having these problems dealt with. It will help to improve the morale of the force and any Bill which can do that is to be greatly welcomed.  On that point, at this time when allegations have been made against a few individuals in the force it behoves us all to put the matter into perspective. The force have approximately 8,000 members and the fact that allegations have been made against the few individuals should not give rise to any feeling on the part of the public that the force are not doing their job as well as they can do it.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the suggestion by Deputy Harte of a police authority.  It is a new idea which the Minister might consider.  We do not expect an immediate answer from him, but if such a police authority could have the effect of further improving the morale of the force, of depoliticising the force and removing them from the immediate control of the Department of Justice, it may have some merit.  I ask the Minister to give consideration to this question.  In the main I record our welcome for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I thank very sincerely the Members of the House who contributed to this debate and I appreciate the <Col N="1185" /> many expressions of confidence in the Garda force and the support for them in the discharge of their very onerous and often dangerous duties.  It is fitting that the force know that they enjoy the confidence and support of the House as well as that of the community at large.  Indeed without that support and confidence the task of the Garda would certainly border on the impossible.  I thank Deputy Harte, spokesman for his party in this area, and Deputy Mrs. Desmond, spokes-person for her party, for the very fine contributions they made.  It was obvious to me that they supported fully on behalf of their parties the contents of the Bill, a Bill which I clearly specified at the beginning resulted from an agreement made by my predecessor.  I say again that he is to be complimented for his part in that agreement.</P>
      <P>There were a number of loose balls thrown in the air by one or two speakers which I do not propose to follow.  I say to Deputies Harte, Desmond and O'Keeffe that I am not referring to any remarks of theirs.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harte initially raised the question of a police authority.  This is one of many matters that will be examined when I come to study the report of the consultants who have carried out an examination of the management and organisation of the force.  These reports, as the Deputy knows, have not yet been finalised and until such time as they are, naturally any examination by me is hanging in the air.  I am quite prepared to examine this question to see the merits of it when the time comes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make one point in relation to Deputy O'Keeffe's contribution. It is not the view that the police force should be separated from the Department of Justice.  It is the Minister for Justice, acting on behalf of the Government, who is responsible to Parliament and the people rather than the officials in the Department of Justice.  I say that knowing well that efforts have been made in the past and are being made even now by people sitting on the steps of my Department to pinpoint certain officials within the Department in a way to do harm to <Col N="1186" /> them in their professional capacity. If the finger is to be pointed at anyone, let it be pointed at the occupant of the office of the Minister for Justice. That is his job, and the officials are not to be pilloried.  I know quite well the Deputy did not mean it, but I am glad to take this opportunity of coming to the rescue of a very loyal official of the Department who is being pilloried by people whose characters would not be in the same race, as it were, with that of the man to whom they are trying to do harm. However, as regards the police authority, I have an open mind on it and I am prepared to look at it when I am ready to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte also referred to the question of courtesy towards the public by members of the Garda Síochána particularly at frontier posts whether at airports, sea ports or land frontiers.  I agree that if there is room for improvement in our PR exercise there, it should be done.  I am sure Deputy Harte will agree that in a force the size of ours it is not easy for them at all times, with the pressures under which they work, to put on a good face.  What he has said in this area might also be said about people in other areas, and this was brought to my notice recently by the Director General of Bord Fáilte, that seemingly we have not the smile on our faces as often as we used to have when we were on the way up battling to win a place in the tourist world.  Anyway, I will make a note of what the Deputy says and see that it is conveyed to the proper places.</P>
    <P>The other matters raised by Deputy Harte, rent allowances, night duty allowances and so on are all matters being dealt with through the conciliation and arbitration machinery.  I can assure the Deputy they will be processed as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Eileen Desmond raised the question of affiliation with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  This is the view that was held earlier on by the Garda Representative Body when they commenced negotiations with my predecessor. The fact that they were able to concede there helped to bring about <Col N="1187" /> the agreement for which we are legislating here today.  There are many arguments for and against it, but as agreement has been reached I think we should leave it as it is at present.  In the course of negotiations which were held the bodies themselves made it clear that they certainly would not want to become involved in industrial disputes among other sections of the community, as they fully recognise and accept their responsibilities as members of the Garda force.</P>
    <P>Deputy Niall Andrews referred to promotions.  Again the conciliation and arbitration machinery is being extended in agreement with the representative bodies to enable principles of promotions to be discussed in the conciliation council.  This will enable the bodies to give full expression to their views on the subject and to put forward suggestions as to what changes they think are desirable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick of Cavan-Monaghan dealt at length with the question of the chairman of the body set up recently as a result of allegations of brutality made against members of the Garda force.  The committee had a preliminary meeting last week.  That is a fact, and I think it was a little unfair of Deputy Fitzpatrick to attack a man who is not able to defend himself in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

      <P>I am sure the self-same gentleman will be able to defend himself if he feels it necessary to do so. It is a little unfair, but I do not want to raise the temperature in any way and that is why I am saying as little as I am about it.  Deputy Fitzpatrick also made comments on the question of pay and overtime rates for members of the Garda.  I might say that he was the only Deputy who threw the political high flyers into the arena.  I am not going to chase them, but it is very difficult to hold one's tongue with the knowledge that Deputy Fitzpatrick, as <Col N="1188" /> a Member of a Government up to very recently, was fully aware of the many problems that faced the members of the Garda Síochána.  He certainly had his tongue in his cheek when speaking here this morning about conditions, pay and so on.  I would not be doing any good by chasing the hares he raised, but I think his remarks were irresponsible, particularly those in relation to Judge Barra Ó Briain.</P>
      <P>I covered the points raised by Deputies Doherty, Leyden and Barry Desmond when I was replying to the points raised by Deputies Mrs. Eileen Desmond and Harte.  On the question of the appointment of judges, which was raised by Deputy Deasy, I would like to think that any of the judges that were appointed during my time in Government were people that the Government and I thought fit for the positions.  The remarks about political patronage by Deputy Deasy in relation to appointments to the Judiciary by his own Party cannot be levelled at my party, because offhand I can identify for this House, if I am requested to do so, Members who supported parties other than ours and who nevertheless were appointed to the Bench on their ability.</P>

These are matters which will receive consideration by me in the same way and at the same time as the question of a police authority is being considered.</P>

      <P>In page 2, line 15, after &ldquo;institute,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;college,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment will insert the word &ldquo;college&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;institute&rdquo;. The purpose is to remove any ambiguity regarding the inclusion under &ldquo;institution&rdquo; of university colleges, colleges of technology or regional technical colleges.

      <P>I should like to tell the Minister that I have no intention of holding up this Bill and I hope we will get it finished with quickly.  When in Opposition the Minister tabled an amendment along these lines except that the word &ldquo;university&rdquo; also occurred as well as the word &ldquo;college.&rdquo; Although his predecessor agreed to the amendment in its present form I am not so sure that the Deputy's own amendment was not better in its original state because, although we have not any university institutions which are not simultaneously colleges at the moment, it is not unthinkable that we might have such in the future. I am surprised that the Minister did not reinstate his original amendment in the form which it first was.</P>

I can see a kind of justification for it, but is it intended that the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy will now shed all responsibility in this field?

The work of the board will to a fair extent be long term planning work and in so far as it is that it is thought more appropriate that it be dealt with by the Department of Economic Planning and Development.  Of course a lot of the work of the board will be involved with the industrial application of science and technology and the industrial application of research. <Col N="1191" /> Those aspects of the matter will continue to be dealt with under the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3.</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection 1 (c), line 1, to insert &ldquo;and of public with private investment&rdquo; after &ldquo;investment&rdquo;, and in line 2 to delete &ldquo;such&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;public&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment was agreed to by the Special Committee after long discussion between myself and my predecessor. It is based on an amendment of mine which, as far as I can recall, was reamended somewhat to represent the collective views of that Special Committee.  In its present form it represents those views and is what was ultimately agreed by that Special Committee. It is intended to ensure that in promoting co-ordination of public investment in science and technology the situation in the private sector is taken full account of and that public investment is not dealt with as if it existed in a vacuum without any interrelationship with private investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I am inclined to think that it might have been better to leave the matter as it stood.  I agree that the amendment before the House was conceded by the Minister's predecessor. What occurs to me, if I understand the matter correctly, is that it is conceivable that there might be a system of incentives to the private sector for the encouragement of research in science and technology which might come under the heading of promotion. I am not altogether clear that it is necessary to restrict the latter part of this amendment to public investment. I see the general sense of what is happening to this paragraph and I agree with it, but I do not see that the latter part of the paragraph, in <Col N="1192" /> line 2 to delete &ldquo;such&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;public&rdquo;, improves it very much.  I would not have any apprehensions about it if that change was not made.</P>

      <P>In page 3, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f)  to promote research,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is considered necessary arising out of two other amendments relating to the application of science and technology&mdash;amendments Nos. 5 and 6, which were agreed by the Special Committee.  Originally the support and development of research and of the application of science and technology by the board were regarded as implicit in the legislation.  This amendment is designed to highlight the importance of fundamental research and to strike a balance with amendments Nos. 5 and 6, which refer specifically to the application of science and technology.  If this amendment was not included it might be felt that fundamental research <i>per se</i> was being downgraded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the amendment. I read the report of the Second Stage debate on this Bill&mdash;I did not take part in it&mdash;and although the Minister and his predecessor spoke about the problem of drawing boundaries between this new board and existing institutions dealing with science and technology, it was not clear from the debate exactly how this Bill was going to draw those boundaries.  In regard to this amendment I should like to say that it and other parts of this subsection seem to collide with parts, for example, of the Higher Education Authority Act. Perhaps the Minister will find an appropriate moment in the course of this Stage to tell the House how it is proposed to prevent such a conflict. Perhaps there is not any way of doing it but how does his Department see the possibility of preventing conflicts between <Col N="1193" /> the operation of this board and the operation of the Higher Education Authority and the operation of other institutions like universities in which the promotion of research is carried on?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(g)  to promote the application of science and technology to economic and social development,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to promote the application of science and technology to economic and social development. This was originally regarded as being implicit in the function of the board.  However, the Special Committee was not satisfied that this, particularly in relation to industrial aspects, was so and it was therefore agreed that there should be specific reference to application to economic and social development which, of course, comprehends industrial development. I asked for that myself at the committee and it was agreed by the whole committee.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(h)  to promote the development of Ireland's natural resources through the application of science and technology,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, this is an amendment which was agreed by the committee at my suggestion.  The addition of subparagraph (h) has the effect of making it a function of the board to promote the development of our natural resources through the application of science and technology.  It was felt this was implicit <Col N="1194" /> in the board's powers but the committee thought it proper to spell it out specifically to draw attention to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be no objection to the amendment but I want to take up what the Minister said about certain functions being thought implicit in the board's work and that he and the special committee thought it would be best to spell these things out.  That being so, I would ask the Minister to consider whether the Bill ought not to contain a specific reference not just to Ireland's resources but to the submarine resources which may not belong to Ireland in the specific legal sense but to which Ireland might have access under international law now or in the future. I realise this is a sphere in which he himself is interested and so I hope he may think it worth considering.  I am referring not only, of course, to problems of fishery conservation and other problems surrounding the whole fishing industry, but I am talking also about the exploitation of the resources of the seabed on the Continental Shelf, and not only the seabed on the Continental Shelf appurtenant to Ireland to which we may be found by the pending arbitration to be entitled, because it may be that we will have a share in the further out seabed when technology has reached the point of being able to exploit that bed.  The direction the Conference on the Law of the Sea is taking is towards sharing the deep seabed between all the nations of the world with a heavy bias in favour of the under-developed nations and it is by no means clear that countries like this will be excluded from participation in the product of the deep seabed far away from our Continental Shelf when it is available.  It is possible we may ourselves have to produce a technological input to give ourselves the benefit of that.  I quite agree with the Minister that all this line of country might be thought to be implicit in the Bill but, if certain things are being spelled out, I think between now and the Report Stage, if the Minister has no objection, he might insert a specific reference to this also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>My feeling is that the sort of things to which the Deputy <Col N="1195" /> refers are covered by the phraseology in the Bill.  I would have no objection to changing the wording here to read:</P>
      <P>...to promote development of the natural resources under Irish jurisdiction through the application of science and technology.</P>
      <P>That comprehends things that are not precisely our property in the traditional sense but property over which we might have control as a result of decisions of the Law of the Sea Conference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's willingness to meet the point, but I am not entirely sure whether&mdash;I am speaking now off the top of my head&mdash;&ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; is the right word.  Would the Minister consider this?</P>

      <P>In page 3, line 22, to delete &ldquo;to promote the co-ordination of&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;to co-ordinate&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It was felt that the section as it stood required strengthening and that something more might be expected from the NBST rather than simply the promotion of co-ordination.  Its main function as a board will, of course, be the co-ordinating of activities in relation to science and technology. This amendment was agreed by the committee after a fairly full discusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the point of it but it again raises the question which the Minister has undertaken to deal with of concurrence between different institutions. For example, if the power of this board is being strengthened by the amendment and if the board is now able to brandish an Act which shows its entitlement to co-ordinate activities related to science and technology, is it then in a position to indicate <Col N="1196" /> imperatively, or fairly imperatively, to a university science department that its projects in regard to research of one kind or another or development are extravagant or do not go far enough?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention to the provisions of subsection (4) (a) of this section which is a saver for existing institutions and their powers, rights and duties, and that would avoid the sort of conflict the Deputy appears to think might be troublesome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the sub-section and I quite agree that reasonable men behaving reasonably will not have any trouble but we must always consider the others.  This strengthening would seem to me to give the board a certain power, if nothing more, of making a nuisance of itself by interfering with the work of university departments.</P>

      <P>In page 3, between lines 52 and 53, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  to promote the application of science and technology to the development and improvement of industrial and commercial design,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Special Committee agreed the board should have a role to play in relation to commercial and industrial design.  The formula used is that agreed as a compromise by the committee.  It will serve the purpose of emphasing the scientific and technological involvement of the board and at the same time ensure that other public bodies concerned with industrial and commercial design would not feel that their functions were being pre-empted.  The body we had particularly in mind here was the Kilkenny Design Workshop.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(m)  to advise and assist inventors in registering and protecting their inventions.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Special Committee agreed the new board should have a role in advising and assisting inventors from the patents angle.

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words about clause (e) in subsection (3).  No doubt the Minister and his predecessor are happy enough about this. It is not suspect if one is always dealing with reasonable people.  There are, however, activities related to science and technology in which some Minister&mdash;I do not say he is present in this House; I hope he never will be&mdash;might direct the board to engage in and which would by no means meet with the approval of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I give two instances.  One would be to engage in activity related to science and technology with a military bearing.  I am not one of these people with a kind of one-sided pacifism whereby any operations of a self-defensive kind undertaken by a democracy are suspect while those undertaken by other kinds of state are not.  I do not want the Minister to misunderstand me.  The phraseology of paragraph (e) does in fact&mdash;and it is hidden in a large number of paragraphs&mdash;seems to confer a fairly wide discretion on some future Minister who might not be of the same disposition as any of the parties in this House to require the board to carry out work or direct others to carry out work of a military complexion which would not meet with the approval of the House.  I realise that there are all kinds of controls operating even on a bad or a tearaway <Col N="1198" /> Minister but to that extent the discretion seems rather wide.</P>
    <P>Another instance is the scientific question now beginning to worry those who understand and are expert in such matters, the matter of genetic manipulation, on which only recently the Royal Irish Academy have set up a Committee for the purpose of offering advice to the Government in regard to legislation which might be necessary in order to control undesirable, really wicket experiments in genetic manipulation.  While I do not wish to raise alarms in regard to the paragraph, these are two instances of scientific or technological research in which as it now stands uncontolled discretion given to a Minister seems to present in the future a potential danger.  I do not want to make a meal of this point but I should like the Minister to think about it between now and the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been represented to me that perhaps the Minister would consider the extent to which the State currently affords protection in regard to nuclear fission and use of nuclear energy generally.  It has been suggested that the activities of the board might be extended to give it an advisory function in regard to this matter.  Rather than coming to any conclusion on the point, I think I should be more interested in having clarification from the Minister as to whether he would see any useful purpose in the suggestion and as to what extent currently the State has formal consultative provision in regard to radiation safeguards and so on which might generally under this Bill be co-ordinated. The Minister might comment on the matter on Report Stage and we could consider it then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I want to make about paragraph (e) of subsection (3) is that it does not provide for any initiative by the Minister. There may have been a misunderstanding about this on the part of the two Deputies.  Initiative, in so far as it was exercised would come from the board itself but it would be subject to the approval of the Minister. Therefore the Minister would not be <Col N="1199" /> initiating any activities that might be carried out under paragraph (e); he will simply approve or disapprove of the proposals of the board to carry them out.</P>
      <P>This subparagraph was inserted to provide for the undertaking of activities by the board in relation to what might be described as gaps or gap areas in the general science or technology field where other institutions are either unable or unwilling to act. The requirement of approval by the Minister is inserted in order to ensure that the board would not engage in activity without having due regard to the functions of other institutions or the possibility that they would act if requested or prevailed upon.  So far as the specific matters referred to are concerned, the initiative would come from the Board.  I cannot see any military initiative coming from the board but, if Deputies wish it, I have no objection to inserting here after the word &ldquo;such&rdquo; the word &ldquo;non-military&rdquo; or &ldquo;civil&rdquo; whichever is the opposite to &ldquo;military&rdquo; in this context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The initiative would have to come from the board and, as I understand it, any military-minded Minister could not instruct them to carry out research of a military character.  I do not think it likely that this country would want to engage in military research, which is abnormally expensive and for which, happily and hopefully, we shall have little need.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was expressing the view that I do not anticipate that this board, which has a great variety of matters of considerable importance to <Col N="1200" /> this country to deal with, will seek to divert any significant, or any section at all, of its budget to the undertaking of military research which I think might more appropriately be done elsewhere.</P>
      <P>As regards nuclear energy mentioned by Deputy Desmond, the position is that the Nuclear Energy Board are obviously the advisers of the Government in relation to matters concerning nuclear affairs and I envisage that situation continuing.  I do not think this board would have any significant functions in regard to nuclear matters and the existing Board that has been established to deal with those matters would obviously be the appropriate one to continue to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the way the Minister is meeting the cases made by Deputy Desmond and myself but it is not unfair to remind the Minister that in his contribution as a Deputy on the Second Stage debate on this very same Bill he devoted quite a lot of his speech to talking regretfully about the apparent limits that lay on us technologically in regard to the development of an armoured car.  It was in the context of this very Bill that the Minister when in Opposition went out of his way to raise military matters which had not been adverted to by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that I have not the least objection to this board having a role in military matters when the national interest requires it.  I am not happy with the idea that this might be in the discretion of the Minister at any time.  Although I see the Minister's point about the word &ldquo;approval&rdquo; for him meaning approving only when the board have initiated the suggestion, I do not think the language in the paragraph yields that result with entire clarity.  I will try to make a suggestion for improvement on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Kelly referred to the possible military activities or research by this board not being excluded, I had in mind nuclear research in the context of research and the general discussion which has taken place here.  I did not advert to the vehicle referred to in the previous debate which is clearly not of a nuclear nature.  That is an armoured personnel carrier not an armoured car.  I understand its construction is now about to commence anyway.  It was regrettable&mdash;and I am sure Deputy Kelly will agree with me&mdash;that the construction of that vehicle which was invented and developed by an Irishman actually started in Belgium.  I thought that was a great pity at the time.</P>

      <P>The only effect of amendments Nos. 11 and 12 together, because they are essentially the same thing, is simply to change the enumeration of the section and to take what is now section 6 (2) out from section 6 and call it section 7 on its own, the reason being that it was thought appropriate to separate them into two different sections rather than possibly run the risk of the two subsections of section 6, as it stands, being read and construed together.

      <P>I drew attention to this at the Special Committee the last time, and my predecessor agreed that there was a drafting error in the Bill as it stands, because while the period of office of the members would be specified as not exceeding four years, it being open to the Government to determine the length provided it does not exceed four years, the period of office of the chairman would not be specified and will be indefinite.  That is unsatisfactory from two points of view.  Either he could be there for too short a time or too long a time.  It is better to specify his period of office the same as the ordinary member.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the point but I do not think the drafting is entirely clean yet.  Section 8 (1) provides:</P>
      <P>The members of the Board shall be a chairman and such number (not being more than ten) as the Minister may from time to time determine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, subsection (1) describes the chairman as a member.  A certain contradiction of a minor drafting kind seems to remain in the section even with the Minister's amendment. In other words, subsection (1) which the Minister's amendment does not touch, mentions a chairman and a number of other persons but they are <Col N="1204" /> all equally members according to that subsection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>My predecessor made the same point as the Deputy is now making in reply to me at the Special Committee, and I pointed out to him in reply to that point that subsections (2) and (3) deal with the chairman quite separately from the ordinary members.

All I am saying is that the drafting is not very clean.  I see the Minister's point and I suppose he will have no difficulty with it.  It is only a tiny point.  The fact remains that, although the chairman obviously is dealt with in a special way, he remains a member of the board and the other subsections speak about a member of the board without making it clear that it is an ordinary member of the board they are talking about.  So, <i>ex facia</i>, whatever the intent may be which, of course, is obvious enough, there is a drafting conflict.  I will try to introduce an improvemnt on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>In page 5, paragraph (a), line 33, before &ldquo;interest&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;material or financial&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had these amendments down for consideration at the Special Committee <Col N="1205" /> but they had not been reached or decided when we stopped.  The amendments are intended to make more specific the references to the kind of interest which a member of the board must disclose, the kind of interest in any body corporate with which the board proposes to make a contract.  For example, if some member of the board was a staff member of a university and the university had certain contacts with the board which might lead to contracts, I consider that it would be unreasonable to exclude a member of the university from talking about this, particularly if the matter referred to a department in which he had no direct interest.  I propose, therefore, to put in the words &ldquo;material or financial&rdquo; because there could be a very slight interest which would not be material and which certainly would not be financial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps on reflection the Minister may feel that he has unduly narrowed the matter of interest.  One may not have a material or a financial interest but still have a beneficial interest because an individual with whom one is friendly may have an interest but this could in no way be construed as being a beneficial interest to the member of the board. Here where we have such a small community, particularly from the point of view of the field covered by this Bill, persons could have a great interest and I suggest that either now or on Report Stage the Minister might have a look at the unduly narrow effect of the section because of the excessively rigid nature of the proposed section as amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be clear about what the Minister has in mind. <Col N="1206" /> For example, the Chairman of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, or someone of that kind, under the unamended section would have an interest but not under the proposed section as amended.  Is it to prevent complications of that kind that the Minister wants this amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There might be an allegation that the chairman, under the unamended section, would have an interest, but it would be so remote that it would be unfair to exclude him.  Assume that the Chairman of the IIRS was a member of the staff of Trinity College, in some department which was totally irrelevant to some matters the board had under discussion, it might be alleged that because the chairman was a member of the Trinity College staff that he had some kind of interest in seeing some other staff member of some other department being given, say, a research project under the direction of the board.  That would put him in an unfair position.  It is impossible in such a small country as this totally to exclude the kind of situation Deputy Desmond referred to.  Everyone in a particular field knows everyone else and, therefore, we should try to narrow the form of interest involved.</P>

      <P>I am asking the Minister to have another look at it. Not only are we a small society but the number of people inevitably who would be affected in their daily work by the ramifications of this board would be very small, members of a very closed community.  There is a great deal of contractual research work being done outside the academic institutions, increasingly so, and many such persons have more than one finger in the pie.  There is a multiplicity of interests which a person could have and I am afraid the Minister might be opening up something under which a person might have a beneficial interest: a person could have a beneficial <Col N="1207" /> interest and he could by sleight of hand do another individual not just a good turn but such a good turn that he should be obliged to disclose it.</P>

      <P>The Minister might consider the advisability of inserting some such phrase as &ldquo;subject to sanction by the Minister&rdquo;.  The Minister is well aware that many boards, particularly in relation to the premises they occupy, tend to develop empires of their own.  The section states &ldquo;provide, equip and maintain offices and other premises&rdquo;.  One could have a board going off and spending 50 per cent of their allocation on their premises.  We are a small country and any money we allocate should be spent on science and technology, not on bureaucracy, not on expensive offices.  I do not want unduly to inhibit the National Board for Science and Technology or the Science Council who get little enough money, but in the years ahead we may well need the kind of constraint I am suggesting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to spell this out.  The Minister has ultimate financial control.  If the board are going to splurge their badly needed funds on elaborate accommodation for themselves, the Minister will step in and tell them they cannot do it.  The section refers to equipping and maintaining offices.  If <Col N="1208" /> you make all that subject to the consent of the Minister it will mean they will have to get his consent if they want to buy some trivial piece of office equipment.  A board like this should be given a reasonable degree of autonomy and should not be subject to petty ministerial restrictions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment puts on the board the obligation of classifying information as confidential where they consider this necessary and so eliminating any doubts about the matter.  Confidentiality is considered important in relation to the work of the board, particularly where it may interact with industry and where patents or inventions are involved.  As the section stands, it would prohibit the disclosure of any information coming to the knowledge of an officer or servant and I think that would be unreasonable because it is too wide.  It would mean in practice that officers of the board could not give public lectures even though they would be talking <Col N="1209" /> about matters which had no confidential element in them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to say about this section bears on the drafting of subsection (1).  I agree with both the general object of the section and the Minister's amendments but it seems to be defective in two ways. First, the subsection, as drafted, exempts from penalty anyone who may disclose information after he has ceased to be an officer, servant, consultant or adviser.  The section would be improved by the inclusion of words such as &ldquo;or has been&rdquo; after &ldquo;is&rdquo;.  In the case of an officer who has served for a long time&mdash;20 years might have elapsed between the time he gained certain classified information and its publication&mdash;the publication of that information would not be of any importance because the technology in question would have been long since overhauled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of a consultant or adviser it would be different because the <Col N="1210" /> period of his consultancy or advisership may be very short.  The purpose of this section, with which everyone must agree, is defeated if the criminal sanction resting on the person aimed at is lifted once his consultancy comes to an end.</P>
    <P>The second point is that the expression &ldquo;while performing duties&rdquo; is an infirmity in the subsection.  I can imagine some of the people in the categories named, particularly advisers and consultants who may be there for a short time, may, because of their past status or their known involvement, whether past or present, involuntary, not while performing duties, become recipients of classified information.  I am drawing a distinction between a person receiving information in that way and his getting it while actually performing consultancy duties.  I am only making the point a defence counsel would make for a consultant or adviser prosecuted under this section.</P>
    <P>These are two respects in which the section might be tightened and I will put an amendment down on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's first point is valid, that is that somebody should not be subject to prosecution only while he is a member.  If the disclosure took place afterwards, it is fair that he should be still liable if he originally acquired the information as an officer or servant.  If the House agrees, I suggest that in line 9, after the word &ldquo;is&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable The Stock Exchange to introduce a new and computerised stock settlement system.  Before getting on to the provisions of the Bill itself I would like to put it in context.  Deputies will know that stock exchanges in Ireland and the United Kingdom were amalgamated in 1973 into a single stock exchange with the aim of improving standards and giving a better service to investors.  The single stock exchange serving Ireland and the UK is called simply The Stock Exchange.  Individual stock exchanges existing prior to the amalgamation have become local administrative units of The Stock Exchange.  Thus, what was formerly the Irish Stock Exchange and now called The Stock Exchange &mdash;Irish, is the administrative unit in Ireland of The Stock Exchange.  Of course, under the amalgamation arrangement  The Stock Exchange&mdash; Irish continues to hold a special position in a number of respects: For example, Irish brokers continue as before to deal in Irish securities on the floor of The Stock Exchange&mdash;Irish in Anglesea Street on a broker to broker basis without the intervention of a jobber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also say a few brief words about the operations of The Stock Exchange.  The Stock Exchange normally operates on a two-week dealing period during which bargains or deals to buy and sell securities are made but not settled.  Settlement takes place during the following settlement period. <Col N="1212" /> I do not propose to go into the complexities of the settlement system in practice.  I think it is sufficient to say that, although this period runs for seven working days, most of the work is done towards the end of the period. Thus, paper work such as splitting bought shares into bundles of sold shares; instructions for delivery; preparation of transfers and payments are crammed into two or three days at the end.  In most cases sellers of securities are obliged to sign open transfers because the ultimate buyers of those securities at the end of the dealing period are not yet known.  This has the disadvantage that sellers are reluctant to release their stock under an open transfer until the very last moment because of risk of fraud or misappropriation.  This adds to the concentration of paper work at the end of the settlement period.  Taking The Stock Exchange as a whole it is understood that during the settlement period more than a half a million pieces of paper in the form of tickets&mdash;that is to say instructions for delivery&mdash;and transfer forms can pass around the stock market every fortnight in the paper chase necessary to link buyers and sellers.</P>
    <P>A system of such extent and complexity must obviously be costly and open to error and the advantages which could accrue from computerising it are obvious.  However it did not prove possible to devise a fully satisfactory computerised system which would handle the transactions involved in accordance with Company Law as it stands today and the purpose of this Bill is to make some changes in the intermediate steps, without of course altering in any way the ultimate realities of transfer, so as to permit computerisation.</P>
    <P>Two points should be emphasised. The first is that the new system which this Bill will authorise is not concerned with the procedure for dealing or making bargains on The Stock Exchange but with the system of settlement which takes place afterwards, that is to say, the paper work by which sales and purchases of securities are matched up, payments made and transfers completed.  The second thing which <Col N="1213" /> I wish to emphasise is that the operation of Talisman, which is the name given to the new system of settlement, is a matter for The Stock Exchange itself.  The main purpose of the Bill is merely to make technical adaptations of the law to enable the system to operate.</P>
    <P>Central to the new settlement system is a nominee company of The Stock Exchange called SEPON Ltd.  Under the new system bargains to buy and sell will continue to be made in the usual way, but instead of the seller legally transferring title in the securities to the buyer he will transfer it to SEPON.  The seller will however retain beneficial rights attaching to the securities until he is paid.  SEPON will hold the securities transferred to it in a central &ldquo;pool&rdquo; of stock on behalf of sellers until the settlement period when securities will be transferred out of the pool to the various purchasers to satisfy purchase bargains.  The Stock Exchange will also maintain computerised records of all holdings by SEPON of the securities of companies participating in the system. Talisman will eliminate much of the paper work already described and will level out the present peaks in workloads.</P>
    <P>The transfer of securities to SEPON as opposed to the present system of a seller executing an open transfer will reduce the scope for mistakes or fraud and will thus encourage the early execution of transfers.  In this way transfer work will be spread out rather than being concentrated in the few days at the end of the settlement period.  I should add that the new system is not expected to have any effect on the volume of employment in The Stock Exchange&mdash;Irish or in stock-brokers' offices in this country.</P>
    <P>For investors Talisman should mean less delay in obtaining certificates and also result in fewer mistakes in other areas such as the allocation of dividends in respect of shares in the process of transfer.</P>
    <P>There should also be benefits for professional company registrars, that is to say, those people whose profession it is to keep the records of other companies up-to-date and prepare <Col N="1214" /> new certificates when existing holders of securities in the company sell them to someone else.  Under the present system a registrar can receive notification of transfers from a variety of brokers who have purchased on behalf of clients.  Under the new system all communications will be through The Stock Exchange and most of the documentation relating to transfers will be computer produced in a standard format.  Notifications to company registrars of transfers will be reduced to notification from The Stock Exchange about transfers into SEPON and transfers out of SEPON. In this way the work of registrars will be simplified.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the subject of Talisman I should mention that gilts such as Government and local authority stocks will not be affected by Talisman. These types of security are paid for by cash and do not fall within the complicated machinery of the settlement system which I have already described.</P>
    <P>I would like now to pass on to the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>SEPON will merely act as a depository for shares in process of transfer and the size of its holdings in companies participating in the system will be constantly changing.  Section 2 of the Bill will exempt companies from having to issue certificates in the name of SEPON in respect of transfers of securities into SEPON, as required by the Companies Act, 1963.  Obviously it would be a mere waste of time to issue certificates in a transient situation of this kind.  Indeed it would be adding to rather than reducing the amount of paper work.  Of course, once securities are transferred from SEPON to the buyer certificates in the name of the buyer will be prepared as usual.</P>
    <P>It is common for the articles of association of a company to require that share certificates must have the common seal of the company affixed in order for them to be valid.  Large companies frequently entrust registration work to an outside firm of professional registrars which, having prepared share certificates, for example, must return them to company headquarters <Col N="1215" /> to have them signed and sealed with the common seal.  This procedure can cause delays.  In keeping with the objective of speeding up the processing of documents relating to securities section 3 will allow a company to have a special &ldquo;official&rdquo; seal which can be entrusted to the company registrar for sealing certificates and transfer documents.  The consequential amendments of the Companies Act are dealt with in section 5.  I feel that the use of the official seal could be a useful improvement generally.  For this reason section 3 and 5 have general application and are not confined to the Talisman system.</P>
    <P>The new system will involve computerisation of some company records. In particular it is envisaged that records, such as the register of members, will be kept on computer by some of the larger companies.  This will further simplify the work of registrars and speed up transfers.  There is uncertainty as to whether company law permits the keeping of company records in non-legible form.  Section 4 will remove any doubt that computerised records are acceptable provided that they can be reproduced in legible form.  Although it was framed with Talisman particularly in mind section 4 has a wider application so that modern methods of storing information, such as on computers, can be applied to the keeping of company records generally.</P>
    <P>Section 6 applies these amendments of company law, allowing for any necessary adaptations or modifications, to unregistered companies, that is companies not formed or registered under the Companies Act but to which certain provisions of that Act apply.</P>
    <P>Under Talisman sellers of securities will be encouraged to transfer title to SEPON in advance of payment and buyers to pay in advance of receiving title.  Strictly speaking, trustees and personal representatives dealing in this manner with securities held in trust could be chargeable with breach of trust.  Section 7 will remove this danger for trustees participating in Talisman.</P>
    <P>Talisman will involve the use of two <Col N="1216" /> transfer forms, one for transferring securities to SEPON and another for transferring securities from SEPON. The Stock Transfer Act, 1963, which is administered by the Minister for Finance, includes provisions which deal with stock transfer forms.  An amendment of that Act will be necessary to allow the use of the types of forms which will be required in the case of Talisman.  Section 8 provides for this.</P>
    <P>It is important that Irish industry and investors should not be denied the facilities of the new Talisman system. Over 100 of the larger Irish companies are listed on the stock exchange and have raised considerable capital on the stock market.  Anything which can improve the operation of the stock exchange can have only beneficial consequences for Irish companies and investors.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, this party supports and welcomes this Bill.  I understand it has been drafted in full harmony and in consultation with members of the stock exchange.  When I made inquiries about it I was more or less told that any attempt to improve it would only cause chaos worse than that from which the Talisman system hopes to extract the stock exchange. Of course, it is an improved system which means, as the Minister has explained, that the process of buying and selling securities goes through a pool.  It is a progress which will be largely continuous now rather than accumulating like a log jam at a fortnightly sluice.  The system is one which, as the Minister says, will benefit Irish investors, business generally, and I hope industry.</P>
      <P>I observe that the sections of the Minister's Bill&mdash;except for absolutely necessary divergences&mdash;are, word for word, based on the fact that we live in different jurisdictions.  But most of the sections are, word for word, identical with the corresponding sections of the British Act.  I suppose that is only natural because, as the Minister explained, the Irish Stock Exchange is merely an administrative unit of a larger one of which the British Stock Exchange is also part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1217" /> I should not conclude without saying that I found the Minister's speech a great deal more helpful than that made in the British Parliament in February, 1976.  Those who assisted the Minister in drafting it must be entitled to the credit for making a complicated matter a good deal more lucid to a non-expert than the officials in the corresponding British Department of Trade and Industry who assisted, to my surprise I found, a private Member in the British House of Commons in promoting a similar Bill at the beginning of last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this non-controversial Bill.  I commend the Minister and his staff for its lucid presentation.  It is a model of presentation.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party support the Bill. We have long regarded the operations as being of divine confusion and we welcome the amalgamation that took place.  Certainly, we welcome this rationalisation and the facilitating of the overall work of the stock exchange.</P>
      <P>I shall not dwell further other than to extend our support for its provisions. I have no doubt that it will lead to considerable improvement in the floor arrangements, in the general work of the stock exchange and in particular, in helping Irish companies and investors to have a service which at times, to say the least, has been somewhat confusing.</P>
      <P>There is only one minor point I wish to raise, that is the confidentiality aspects of computerisation.  Increasingly they have come to the fore, particularly in relation to American company shareholdings where they are computerised, as such.  Certainly, I would assume that the nominee company, in its operations within the State, has sufficient inbuilt safeguards to meet that growing need in company operations.  With further computerisation, it is a point which will increasingly have to be made in the House.  I welcome and support the Bill in full.</P>

      <P>I am obliged to the two Deputies for their welcome of the Bill for facilitating its speedy passage.  Deputy Kelly mentioned <Col N="1218" /> that much of this Bill is identical with the British Act passed last year to cover the same matter. I acknowledge that that is so.  It is deliberately so because it is the same stock exchange, the one computer and the one holding company with which we will all be dealing.  Therefore, it is important, that, in so far as is possible, the law&mdash;both in its legislative form and its subsequent interpretation&mdash;be as close as possible in both countries.</P>
      <P>I might mention that, as I understand it, this Bill does not apply to private companies lest there be any confusion on that point; they will continue to operate in the same manner.</P>

      <P>As to their use, I understand that it has been suggested that there could be a possibility of complaint of trespass on lands by users, or of articles of archaeological interest being sought on or near sites known or thought to hold such things, but even if there were grounds for complaint on this score it would not be a matter within the responsibility of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.</P>

      <P>In regard to their use it is understood from the Department of Education that the National Museum have expressed concern about those detectors and about the fact that they could be used by private individuals to locate archaeological finds which are properly the property of the museum.  This concern is not considered sufficient to necessitate any action.  If any action were required it would be taken by the Department of Education.</P>

There is serious concern that the growth in the use of those detectors could lead to irreparable damage being done.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 24 together. With regard to the Emergency Powers Act, the position is that the operative section of the Act expired on 15th October, the Government having previously decided that the provision would not be continued in force after that date.  So far as the state of national emergency is concerned, the Government have as yet taken no final decision.  In the meantime they do not propose to ask the Houses of the Oireachtas to rescind the resolutions of 1st September 1976.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say why there is such a delay on the part of the Government in deciding that an emergency no longer exists in view of the fact that when in Opposition both the Taoiseach and the Minister condemned the introduction of the emergency in 1976, one saying that it could not exist because there was not a state of war and the Minister saying it was a phoney emergency?  What has happened since 1976?  Is the situation worse or better, or is it the same?  Is there as good a case for keeping the emergency as there was then?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister answer the question why he now believes that there is a reason for the existence of a state of emergency which a year ago he said did not exist?  Does the Minister not agree that he was one of the people who made the point that the laws made under the Emergency Powers Act had been abused, even the 48-hour detention provision had been abused, and that it has reduced the level of civil liberties in our society, reduced the conditions of democratic protection for individuals and, therefore, is something that any responsible Government, in the light of our history in this regard, should repeal without delay?</P>

So far as I am concerned it must be 25 years now since I first expressed an interest in the degrading conditions within our prisons.

      <P>The answer is <b>&ldquo;No&rdquo;.</b></P>
      <P>The Government could not agree to accord trade union status to the Garda Representative Bodies having regard to the special nature of the functions and responsibilities that are discharged by members of the force.  I am glad to be able to say, however, that negotiations have already been completed between my Department and the representative bodies for the garda, sergeant, station sergeant and inspector ranks about changes in the status of the bodies and in the negotiating machinery available to them and that as a result of these negotiations agreement was reached regarding the changes to be made.  That agreement is now in the process of being implemented. It will entail among other things the enactment of legislation to amend the Garda Siochana Acts and a Bill for this purpose has already been initiated by me.  It has been enacted here today as far as the force is concerned.</P>
      <P>I should add that, while the negotiations with the bodies were undertaken and completed during the term of office of the previous Government, the present Government fully subscribes to the changes that were agreed upon and are committed to implementing them as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The Garda Siochana consider that the provision of a station in the area would not be warranted, bearing in mind that the existing stations at Kill O'Grange and Cabinteely are only one-and-a-half and two miles respectively from the area.  I understand that the complaints relate mainly to certain activities of some members of itinerant families camped on private property in the area and this, as the Deputy will appreciate, presents difficulties for the Garda.  They will, however, continue to do all they can to minimise the grounds for complaint, and policing arrangements for the coverage of the area will be fully reviewed when extra manpower becomes available for assignment to the various centres.</P>

      <P>The Garda Síochána have indicated that the present opening hours of Athy station have been so fixed as to enable the station party to carry out the maximum amount of the more important outdoor police duties, while maintaining an adequate office service.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>At present the Assembly of the European Communities consists of delegates designated by the Parliaments of the member states from among their members.  The treaties establishing the Communities envisage the introduction of a system whereby the Assembly will be elected by the people of the Communities by direct universal suffrage in accordance with a uniform procedure in all member States.  In pursuance of this aim, a Council decision and an Act providing for direct elections to the Assembly were signed by the Council of Foreign Ministers at Brussels on 20th September, 1976.  These instruments laid down certain provisions in relation to direct elections and provided that, pending the entry into force of a uniform electoral procedure, the procedure for the elections will be governed in each member State by national provisions. The purpose of this Bill is to lay down the provisions to apply in relation to the direct elections in this country until such time as a uniform electoral procedure comes into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision signed at Brussels in September, 1976, does not fix a specific date for holding the elections but refers to the intention to give effect to the conclusion of the European Council held in Rome in December, 1975, that the first direct elections to the Assembly should be held in May or June, 1978.  The Government consider it very important that the elections should take place on the target date.  Failure to meet this deadline would reflect on the credibility of the Communities and on their ability to fulfil their commitments.  The Government earnestly hope that each member State will be in a position to hold <Col N="1259" /> the elections in May or June next and I am sure the House shares our determination that this country at least will be fully ready to proceed with the elections at that time.  May I say that I have assured my colleagues in the Council of Ministers that, irrespective of the change of Government and the consequences this would have for reintroducing legislation here, it was our firm intention to proceed with this legislation?  I think I was able to anticipate that I would have the support of the House in getting the necessary legislation through so that we could meet the target date.</P>
    <P>Turning from the European to the national level, this Bill is an important development in our domestic affairs. The constituencies set out in it have been determined by a process which ensures that there cannot even be a suggestion that it was inspired by the aim of achieving electoral advantage for any particular political party.  I think this is a step forward which will be welcomed without reservation by everybody who is involved in the democratic system of this country, as a Dáil Deputy or a public representative at any other level or as an ordinary elector.  The House will be aware that, as long ago as September of last year, the Taoiseach gave it as his opinion and intention that this would be a suitable occasion to introduce the Commission for Constituency Revision, and I am glad it has been possible, even in the short time available to us, to do just that.</P>
    <P>The constituencies proposed in the Second Schedule to the Bill were drawn up by the commission, under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Walsh, which was set up by the Government for this purpose.  I think the House owes a debt of gratitude to the members of the commission for the thorough and conscientious way in which they carried out their task in a relatively short time. The proposed arrangement of constituencies, in the words of the commission's report, &ldquo;appears to provide a reasonable basis for the fair conduct of elections and has due regard for social and economic factors, the <Col N="1260" /> electorate and density of population as well as to total population.&rdquo; I have pleasure in recommending the proposed constituencies to the House.</P>
    <P>Constituencies apart, the provision of this Bill are essentially the same as those of the earlier Bill on this subject presented last April which lapsed with the dissolution of the Dáil on 25th May.  Reference is made in the second paragraph of the explanatory memorandum to a small number of departures from the text of the previous Bill.  These changes are minor ones of a tidy-up nature with no question of principle involved.</P>
    <P>As to the major principles contained in the Bill, I am confident that the House will be able to give them its unanimous support.  The most fundamental question to be decided was the matters of the elector system.  In adopting the single transferable vote we are choosing a system with which our electors are fully familiar and which affords them a wider range of choice between parties and candidates than would generally be available under any other system.  The STV system appears to be the most suitable in our particular circumstances and we should not regard our freedom of choice in this matter as being in any way restricted by the fact that the other member States may adopt different systems.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that nationals of the other member States ordinarily resident here will have a vote at Assembly elections on the same conditions as Irish citizens.  We know that some of these electors may have the right to vote by post or otherwise at Assembly elections in their country of origin and that for some the possibility of voting in more than one country may arise. However, the European instruments forbid double voting and this Bill makes it an offence under our law to vote at the same Assembly election in this country and in any other member State and lays down a penalty for doing so.  Until a uniform procedure is introduced for all member States anomalies of this kind appear inescapable. Meanwhile, the proposal in the Bill appears to be the most &ldquo;European&rdquo;<Col N="1261" /> solution as well as being the most suitable arrangement in the circumstances of this country.</P>
    <P>In regard to the qualification of candidates and the procedure for their nomination, it seemed sensible to follow the same general procedure which applies at Dáil elections and the Bill provides accordingly.  Probably the main question arising here is the size of the deposit which it is proposed to require of candidates.  Generally there are two ways of doing this.  The right to nominate candidates could be restricted or a substantial deposit could be required.  The requirement of a deposit seems more in keeping with our tradition and more likely to be acceptable.</P>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, proposes to rely on a deposit and recommends the same level of deposit as proposed in the previous Bill on this subject.  I know some Deputies may have misgivings about a deposit of this order but this must be weighed against the necessity to ensure that every candidate whose name appears on a ballot paper will be a <i>bona fide</i> contestant.</P>
    <P>In relation to the nomination of candidates, there is another matter which I think ought to be mentioned and that is the provision that a person may not be nominated in respect of more than one constituency.  This embargo is considered desirable in order to avoid the possibility of a person being elected to fill more than one Assembly seat and the complications that would arise from such an eventuality.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill the role of political parties will be the same as at Dail elections but it will be open to candidates, where appropriate, to use the name of the relevant Assembly political group on ballot papers in addition to the name of their political party.  Provision is also made in the Bill for the registration of parties specifically organised to contest Assembly elections.</P>
    <P>One of the most difficult problems related to Assembly elections is the selection of a method for filling casual vacancies.  In the electoral law of this country two methods of filling such vacancies in the membership of elected <Col N="1262" /> bodies are recognised.  Vacancies in the Dail and among the elected members of the Seanad are filled by by-election while vacancies in the membership of local authorities are filled by co-option.</P>
    <P>In relation to by-elections there are two very serious objections in the context of Assembly elections.  First there is the considerable expense and inconvenience of holding a by-election in the large constituencies proposed in the Bill but, more important, there is the distorting effect which by-elections could have in our representation in the Assembly.  There is of course a strong argument for by-elections in relation to the national Parliament in that they provide a useful method of testing public opinion between general elections and can, thus, have an important bearing on Government policy.</P>
    <P>This argument has no relevance in the context of the Assembly which will not have the task of appointing an executive to be responsible to it and for this reason their representational aspect becomes more important. A by-election is therefore not a suitable device in this context but on the other hand, direct co-option by the Assembly itself is also not appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Bill therefore attempts to bring together the idea of filling vacancies by co-option with which we are familiar in the local government field and the view that, once the political composition of the Assembly has been decided by the people at a general election, this balance ought not to be upset by accidental casual vacancies. Section 15 provides that casual vacancies will be filled by appointment by the Dail.  If at the last election the seat had been won by the candidate of a political party, the appointment will be made on the nomination of that party, provided it furnishes a nomination within three months.</P>
    <P>The detailed provisions of the Bill are dealt with very fully in the explanatory memorandum and it seems unnecessary for me to dwell on them at this point.  I will, of course, be glad to deal at greater length with any point on which the House may desire clarification.</P>
    <P>Introducing this Bill is a pleasant task for me.  The Bill was largely prepared <Col N="1263" /> by the previous Government and, apart from the question of an delineation of the constituencies, we in this Government found it possible to adopt it virtually unchanged.  This brings home to us that there are issues on which all parties in this House can agree.  One of these is the necessity to make the institutions of the European Communities more responsive to public opinion by the early introduction of direct elections to the Assembly.</P>
    <P>Our standing in the EEC is based on our wholehearted participation in the Community's institutions and our constant support for the principles of the Treaty.  Equally, we have always promoted the need for strengthening the democratic process in Europe and to the extent that a directly elected Assembly provides a direct link between the people and one of the institutions, can only be welcomed by all who want a truly democratic European Community.</P>
    <P>The fact that 83 per cent of the Irish people voted in favour of Europe in our referendum for accession has always provided our negotiators and representatives in the Community with considerable moral backing.  Direct elections will further enhance our position within the Community by providing a direct democratic link between our citizens and decision-making within the Community.</P>
    <P>Direct elections will also ensure that the Community remains consistent with its own ideas and has a greater sense of reality with regard to its present commitments and future obligations.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that there be a wholehearted commitment by all parties to direct elections.  There must be no indifference. Might I say that those who might seem to have some degree of opposition to the whole concept of direct elections, are in an intolerable position.  This position would seem to me to be, one might say, a democratic aberration.  How can anyone genuinely oppose direct elections which simply mean that the people are getting a right to be consulted <Col N="1264" /> democratically or are they happy to say that the people have no right to be consulted democratically?</P>
    <P>Whatever the evolution of the powers of the directly elected Assembly, we must be effectively represented to ensure that our voice is strong and that the Community remains consistent with its own objectives and ideals.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are no doubt aware, Parliament has at present perhaps the negative power of dismissing the Commission and also rejecting the Community's draft budget.  There is also the conciliation procedure which affords Parliament an effective voice at the Council of Ministers on matters with regard to which Parliament is directly concerned.</P>
    <P>At present, Parliament has considerable budgetary powers.  It can reject the Community's draft budget which this year is in the nature of £8.2 billion.  It is worth remembering that 75 per cent of the EEC expenditure is on the Common Agricultural Policy. While the Community budget represents only 2.15 per cent of the total of the budget of the member states and about 0.69 per cent of the Community's GNP, the European Parliament has a considerable role to play in restoring expenditure in areas which are of vital interest to Ireland.  Indeed, as recently as yesterday the Budget Committee of Parliament accepted an amendment tabled by our representatives there which will increase by £110,000 funds available for studies on cross-Border projects in Ireland.  This extra expenditure is to allow for more comprehensive socio-economic studies of the whole Irish Border region to be undertaken with Community financial assistance.  The proposed amendment will increase the funds available for these purposes to £317,000.  It is my determination that the Council of Ministers will accept this.</P>
    <P>Direct elections will require the active participation of all to ensure an adequate turn-out of voters.  Might I say that those who aspire to direct elections should inform themselves with regard to the functioning of the present Parliament and European matters? In this regard I should like <Col N="1265" /> to assure Deputies that I will facilitate them by making arrangements for them to visit both Parliament and the Commission in liaison with the Information Departments of the respective institutions.</P>
    <P>One of the issues that has surfaced here in Ireland with regard to direct elections is the question of the level of salaries for the European Parliamentarians. While no definite decision has been taken on this matter I might say that the figures mentioned have aroused public interest as people become aware that these salaries reflect the enormous difference in living standards between various regions of the Community.</P>
    <P>This is because people do not relate sufficiently to the Commission, are not sufficiently aware of who is serving the Commission in the first instance and because it is frankly too remote a problem in the second instance.  The interesting thing here is that this question is now being asked for the first time because through their elected representatives, the people do relate to this assembly and obviously are more aware of the level of salaries applicable in Europe.  To that extent it is a vindication of the role of the Deputy and also must pose a question to the Commission as to how this matter has not been raised beforehand and is now being raised only when we are talking in terms of parliamentary salary.</P>
    <P>While the present Bill provides that the dual mandate, that is, membership of Dail and European Parliament, is not incompatible, nevertheless, this must be considered more as an interim arrangement, which is what it is.  Hence it would seem desirable that the dual mandate be abolished in all countries in the event of a uniform electoral system being adopted.  Furthermore, the burden of work and responsibility would be such that membership of both Dail and European Parliament would be extremely difficult.  Nevertheless, we shall have to arrange that there is effective consultation between Members to the European Parliament and the National Parliament to ensure that the views expressed in the European Parliament are not in direct conflict with our interests.  Each party will have <Col N="1266" /> to elaborate within its own ranks arrangements which will ensure close liaison and a consistency of approach between Euro Members and TDs.  A low turn out to direct elections would not only be very damaging for a directly elected Parliament but it would also hinder our standing with our European partners.  The mere act itself of holding the elections will not be enough in itself. The elections must be a genuine exercise in democracy with a very large degree of vocal participation.  We have a very good record in Europe and it is vitally important that we maintain that record and strengthen our own position in the Community and also the position of this newly directly elected assembly. Arousing the necessary public interest will be a task for all parties and I am confident that, as in the past, that will be done and that Members of this House will play their full part so that we collectively can continue to play a fully committed part in the development of Europe.  Accordingly, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I regret having to commence my reply to the Minister's introductory speech on a note of protest because of the manner in which this Bill finds its place on the Order Paper today.  Last week I made very careful inquiries to ascertain whether the Bill would be taken this week.  I learned through the Whips that it would not and the reason was that&mdash;it is understandable&mdash;the Minister for the Environment would be out of the country. Apparently the Government had second thoughts and a note that the Bill would be taken today appeared on my Whip's desk last night after 7 p.m. when he had left the precincts. When the matter was raised this morning on the Order of Business by me both the Taoiseach and the leader of this party agreed that the difficulty should be resolved between the Whips, meaning, I took it, that there would be discussions between the Whips. There were no such discussions other than a communication from the Government Whip that the Bill was proceeding. I want to put that on the record and I want to suggest it is not <Col N="1267" /> the best way of getting business done. It is true the Bill appeared on the Whip which was sent out that week, but the understanding was it would not be taken this week for the reason I have stated.  I want to put that on the record.</P>
      <P>Ireland entered the European Community on 1st January, 1973, and since then our experience in Europe has been one of finding that it is beneficial for this country.  Our experience endorses the view of this party when we advised the people to join Europe by voting in the referendum which brought us into Europe.  Having considered the matter, we believed our entry was good for the country as a whole and for the economy as a whole and our experience there has been a vindication of our approach.</P>
      <P>I was particularly pleased to hear the Minister for Foreign Affairs speak of our high standing in the European Community.  It is, indeed, a matter of gratification that we hold this high position and are so highly regarded in the European Community.  I would be less than human if I did not think that the part played by the leader of this party as Minister for Foreign Affairs over our first four-and-a-half years in Europe had not contributed to a major extent in projecting a favourable image of our country in Europe and earning for us as a nation the high regard and esteem in which we are held.  I am confident the present Minister will follow in the footsteps of Deputy Dr. FitzGerald as Minister for Foreign Affairs and continue to project the country in Europe in a favourable light.  I do not envy him his task but I am sure he will measure up to the size of it and that we will continue to enjoy our high reputation in Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The fact that the Minister has to leave the House&mdash;I am not complaining about his leaving because I am sure he was just as much inconvenienced as I was by the putting of this Bill on the Order Paper today&mdash; is evidence of the unsatisfactory approach and the arrangement I mentioned earlier.  I do not think it is good enough.</P>
      <P>I was speaking about the high standing in which this country is held in Europe and I was saying I would be less than human if I did not attribute that to the performance of the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy FitzGerald, in his capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs in the four-and-a-half years of our membership.  Those were four-and-a-half very important years.  A good beginning is half the work.  Had we created a bad impression, had we acted in an irresponsible way, had we not measured up to the high standard expected of international statesmen, we would now have a bad reputation to live down.  We all know how difficult that can be.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, the opposite is the position.  We have built up a good image; we have given a good performance and I trust that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has left the House to keep another appointment, will give a performance in Europe during his term of office that will do credit to this country.  That is what we all hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This party is in favour of direct elections; we think that is the next important step after the enlargement of the Community from six to nine members which happened in 1973.  The next step is direct participation of our people through universal franchise in <Col N="1269" /> the government of Europe.  We have supported that and, on behalf of my party, I am here to continue to afford that support and to say that I believe that if our people are really to become part of Europe and get the best out of Europe the direct elections are a must.</P>
    <P>It might be expected that as a result of the fact that we were in Government for four-and-a-half years the National Coalition played a big part in bringing these elections forward. I should also like to record that some time ago it was not thought that it would be possible to have these elections held before 1980 but at a meeting of the summit in Paris in December, 1974 the then Taoiseach, Deputy Cosgrave, proposed that the date be brought forward from 1980 to 1978.  That proposal was accepted by the other eight heads of state.  I believe and I am informed that the European Parliament regard the moving forward of the date from 1980 to 1978 as a very big achievement and welcome the change.</P>
    <P>In Government we were also responsible for securing the present representation for this country in the European Parliament.  It was proposed to allot 13 seats to Ireland.  For a number of reasons we thought we were entitled to more and refused to accept 13 seats.  We thought that this country, with its small population scattered over a very wide area, with some scattered in remote parts of the country, required a larger number of seats.  We fought for the larger number and secured 15 seats instead of 13. That was a much greater achievement than might be appreciated.  The additional two seats for us involved a complete revamping of the membership of the European Parliament.  The fact that we got those two seats had the effect of increasing membership of the Parliament from 398 to 410 seats in order to maintain a balance. Getting those extra seats really has a profound effect on the Bill we are now discussing because we are providing constituencies for 15 seats instead of 13.  As mathematicians know, there are far more possibilities when dividing up 15 seats compared with 13.  Therefore, <Col N="1270" /> the advantage gained after hard bargaining in Europe by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dr. FitzGerald, is of great benefit to us both in numbers and in dealing with the constituencies.</P>
    <P>Further, we made the case, and it is important to know, that we thought that with 13 seats we would have great difficulty in manning the 12 sub-committees of the European Parliament in addition to the Parliament itself.  There are 12 sub-committees and we are expected to be represented on a good number of them, if not all, as well as holding our place in Parliament.  It is important, therefore, to have as many seats as possible.  I may have been wrong when I said that the allocation of the two extra seats increased membership of the Parliament from 398 to 410&mdash;that was due to another fight we made and with which I shall deal later. In fact, the increase in the number of seats from 13 to 15 had the effect of increasing the size of the Parliament by 50 seats.</P>
    <P>We also thought, in view of conditions prevailing in Ireland, that it was necessary that Northern Ireland as a unit, although a part of the UK, should have as many seats as possible in the European Parliament.  We thought that because of the political situation there the area should have as many seats as possible and also so that minorities should be catered for.  We had to fight for this and again we got the result because it had been proposed to allot only two seats to Northern Ireland but as a result of the fight put up by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dr. FitzGerald, the number was increased by 50 per cent to three seats. The matter did not end with just giving an extra seat to Northern Ireland.  That had the effect of increasing the size of the European Parliament from 398 to 410 seats, we having already been instrumental in increasing it by 50 seats to 398 when we got our own membership increased from 13 to 15.  I should like to think that the enormous goodwill and respect which the then Minister had built up for this country must have played a major part in getting an additional two seats for the Republic of Ireland, and an additional seat for <Col N="1271" /> Northern Ireland, notwithstanding the fact that that had the effect of increasing the overall membership of the Parliament by 62 seats or thereabouts.  It is only right that we should take credit for these things.  It may not be very easy for the Minister introducing the Bill to be lavish in his compliments for the work his predecessor did, nevertheless it is right that the facts should appear on the record and that is why I am putting them on the record of this House.</P>
    <P>The Second Schedule to the Bill which deals with the constituencies comes before the House exactly as recommended by the independent commission presided over by Mr. Justice Walsh of the Supreme Court.  I should like to join in the compliments paid by the Minister to Mr. Justice Walsh, to the Secretary of the Department of Local Government, and to the Clerk of the Seanad, for the amount of work they put into it.  I notice the Minister did not say: &ldquo;What a good boy am I&rdquo; or &ldquo;what good boys are we&rdquo; on having introduced the commission.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commission.  It is a good idea.  I hope I will not sound ungracious if I say nobody had a better right to introduce the commission system than the Fianna Fáil Party because, over the past 50 years, the constituencies were revised a goodly number of times and they revised them in their own way, for their own benefit, and for their own purposes, on each and every one of those occasions, with one solitary exception.  If the commission system were to be introduced, nobody had a better right to do it than the Fianna Fáil Party.  I hope this is the beginning, and now that the ice has been broken and the precedent has been set, all future constituency revisions will be carried out by a commission. This is desirable and it is a good thing.  It is also refreshing&mdash;may-be I am taking credit for a number of things&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The Bill provides for four constituencies: two three-seat constituencies, a four-seater and a five-seater. The fact that we have 15 seats in the European Parliament leaves the drawing of the constituencies open to innumerable possibilities, several of which would be reasonable.  The Bill introduced by the previous Minister for Local Government provided one set of constituencies.  This Bill provides another.  Each is acceptable in its own way.  Each conforms with criteria which are acceptable to us.</P>
      <P>We made a short submission to the commission setting out our views.  We said that the 15 seats secured for Ireland in the negotiations offered four possible combinations instead of three. With 15 seats it was possible to have three five-seaters; a five-seater, a four-seater, and two three-seaters; three four-seaters and a three-seater; or five three-seaters.  Some of those possibilities would result in four constituencies and we supported four constituencies.  We argued that advantage should be taken of the possibility offered by the 15 seats to have four rather than three constituencies.</P>
      <P>We also felt, and we said so to the commission, that they should have regard to the undesirability of constituencies of uniform size.  In other words, we were against five three-seater constituencies.  I am glad the commission accepted that argument. Having five three-seater constituencies. we felt, would impose too rigid a pattern on the whole country, making inadequate allowances for varying sizes in terms of population and the different socio-economic regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other considerations we suggested the commission should have regard to may be summarised briefly as follows.  We argued to the commission that, as far as possible, the constituencies should represent coherent regions with broadly similar socio-economic characteristics.  I am satisfied that the constituencies as drafted measure up to that suggestion. <Col N="1274" /> We also argued that they should comprise groups of existing Dail constituencies so as to facilitate the organisation of the election and thus help ensure a high turnover representative of public opinion and that as far as reasonably possible they should avoid breaching county boundaries.  Again, I am glad that has been done.</P>
    <P>We argued that they should be such as to be likely to give representation to political parties broadly in line with their share of the overall national vote.  That can be done in various ways and I am satisfied that the way proposed by the commission is reasonable and that no reasonable man can say it is unreasonable.  We also argued that the dominant democratic principle of equality of parliamentary representation be respected by not having more than a minimum divergence of ratio of population to seats as between constituencies.  There is a difference and a divergence but it is not so marked or so unreasonable as to be objectionable.</P>
    <P>The Bill is almost unique in that it gives votes to citizens of all Community states.  That is an innovation for us.  I understand that the legislation proposed by other member states, with one exception, does not follow this pattern.  They propose to give votes only to their own nationals and do not propose extending the franchise to the nationals of other member states.  I suggest that the Minister for Foreign Affairs argue the case with his colleagues in the Community that they should follow our example and give votes not alone to their own nationals but to the nationals of other member states resident there.  That is a reasonable request.  We have set the good example and it should be followed by other states.  It is possible that very few votes will be at stake, but the principle is important.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in the Bill that the election be held within the given period on some day from Thursday to Sunday, inclusive, and the object of that is to fall in with the procedure for election in other European countries. It is also provided that the count will not commence until the Monday <Col N="1275" /> following the Sunday which is the last day for taking the poll.  That means that we could have an election here on a Thursday but the count would not start until the following Monday.</P>
    <P>The Minister should tell us what he has in mind in relation to the date for holding the election.  I also observe that the Bill provides that the count will take place in a convenient place in or adjacent to each constituency. That means that in the entire province of Munster the ballot boxes from each polling station will have to be brought to one centre where the entire count will be conducted.  Most of us are interested in elections, the counting of votes and procedures at elections and I am sure many will agree with me that it would be a formidable task to bring the ballot boxes to one centre. Eight counties are involved in the constituency of Connacht-Ulster and the ballot boxes will have to be brought from every polling station in those counties to one centre.  There is danger involved in bringing them long distances and presumably it will mean starting at 10 p.m. and travelling through the night to the counting centre.  I am raising this matter now to give the Minister an opportunity of thinking of the problems involved between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Would it not be better if the Presidential Election counting system was adopted and the votes counted in each Dail constituency? I realise that it would not end there because the transfer of second and subsequent preferences would have to take place. I suggest to the Minister that there might be a happy in-between and that the first count be conducted in each constituency.  For example, the ballot boxes for County Donegal could be opened in that county, the votes sorted and the first count take place there. Assuming there are six candidates for five seats in Connacht-Ulster there would only be six boxes to transfer from the Donegal centre to the centre where the second and subsequent counts would take place instead of transferring in the region of 200 boxes from all areas of that county.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the Bill follows <Col N="1276" /> the pattern of the Bill drafted by the former Minister for Local Government, which, in turn, is largely a re-enactment of the Bill for the holding of Dáil elections.  The fact that it was drafted by the former Minister for Local Government or that it follows the procedure for the holding of Dáil elections does not necessarily mean that it cannot be improved.  Improvements can be made on it and I hope to be putting forward a number of amendments for Committee Stage in this regard.</P>
    <P>I would dearly like to see a tidying up of the procedure for voting by elderly people confined to institutions. I do not mind who benefits or looses&mdash; may be that is too much to expect from a politician&mdash;but it is unseemly and unsightly to see the pressure that people in institutions or homes for the elderly are subject to at election time.  A system of voting through companions was introduced and the terminology is good, kind and nice.  I assume, when that was enacted a few years ago, the drafters meant the people would be assisted by a relative or friendly neighbour. It can be truly said that in many cases the companion is nothing but a political agent who is interested in getting the person into the booth, getting the vote recorded and that is that. Something should be done about that.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points I wish to raise but I will not bore the House by going into them now because they would not be proper on Second Reading. They are more appropriate for the Committee Stage.  For example, the time for nominations seems to be very short, seven days from the date the elections are announced nominations must be closed.</P>
    <P>The Minister's addendum is further evidence of the panic there was to have this Bill taken today.  I do not think I have ever seen an addendum to a Second Reading speech before.  This addendum was probably the thinking of the Minister as distinct from the thinking of the Department which drafted and handled the Bill, and shows the Minister's intervention.  In it he deals with the salaries European parliamentarians will be entitled to receive. That is not dealt with in the <Col N="1277" /> Bill.  He pointed out, and I would not disagree with him, that the work required of European parliamentarians is very substantial.  The travel involved, the time they are away from home and the number of committees they have to serve on are quite considerable. He also pointed out that the salary paid is evidence of the great gulf that exists between the European and Irish standards and cost of living.</P>
    <P>A serious study of what is involved will prove that substantial salaries are justified.  I would not like to think that this Bill was responsible for introducing monetary considerations into Irish politics.  The Minister has dealt with that point in his addendum.  It would be a sad day for Ireland if the reward for parliamentary service, whether at European or national level, was the salary paid.  It can be truly said that that has never been the case so far as the national parliament is concerned because salaries were never pitched at such a level as to make them the sole consideration.  Indeed, they were pitched at a level that would discourage rather than encourage people to enter politics.  That does not mean that we could not have the other extreme.  Let us not judge European salaries without first considering the work involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome this Bill and the speed with which the Government have dealt with transferring the commitment of the previous Government and the report of the commission into proposals for a Second Stage reading.  I would like to place on record my party's concern with the way in which this has been managed by the managers of business in the House.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has said all that has to be, and should be, said on this matter.  The House is a little poorer because we have not had more notice of this.  If it is any indication of interest in the European elections, it does not augur very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As spokesman for the Labour Party. I would like to talk about the European elections and against the background of the referendum held in which 83 per cent of the electorate voted for the EEC.  They were persuaded into voting for that Community <Col N="1278" /> by the two major parties.  Part of the carrot that produced that 83 per cent was the prospect of a substantial regional policy, social fund and the immediate democratisation in the foreseeable future of the institutions of the Community.</P>
    <P>If we were to have a referendum today, we would be hard pushed to get 83 per cent to vote in favour of the EEC.  We should not take the commitment of our people, based on a judgment that the EEC would work out, to be constant approval for the EEC.  Many people are far from happy with the way the EEC is functioning both in the area that has immediately benefited from it, the agricultural sector, and in other areas where there has been a net loss in terms of the results of membership of the EEC.</P>
    <P>I view with a certain amount of concern the statements made by both the Minister and the Fine Gael spokesman for the Environment with regard to how well we are received in Europe. I think there is an element of inferiority complex in all this, that somehow we have to be seen to perform well in Europe.  I do not deny that the Irish Government have acquitted themselves well over the last four years. I am confident that individual Ministers in this Government are more than capable of maintaining the standard set in the first four years.</P>
    <P>Of much more concern and importance to the Irish public and to the people we represent is how well the EEC performs for us and for our constituents. While recognising that it is a legitimate and praiseworthy aspiration of any politician in executive office to do the best that can be done to maintain Irish standards abroad and the reputation of Irish people abroad, there is an obligation to ensure that the EEC delivers to the Irish people all that was so bountifully promised by the two major parties in the referendum.</P>
    <P>We were told that the regional policy and the Social Fund would be part of the basket of goodies for the Irish people.  It has been a very small basket.  We are now told that the European elections and the democratic <Col N="1279" /> control of the European elector of his member in the Assembly would somehow transform the Community.  We as a political party welcome the advent of direct elections.  We are happy that the date was brought forward at the Paris summit from 1980 to 1978 and we look forward to participating fully in these elections, but we will be pushing for something far more than the simple direct election of members to an Assembly which in itself is incapable of effectively redistributing wealth and power within the EEC community.  In relation to terminology I reject the shorthand that we have tended to slip into in referring to nine states as Europe, excluding other states within Europe which are not part of the Community.  We should refer to the Community when we mean the Community and refer to Europe when we mean Europe.  We welcome the prospect of direct elections and the prospect of an extension of democratic control to the European Commission budget, but in doing that we fully recognise that that is extremely limited.  The unity of Europe is a common objective in political opinion here and to that extent the direct elections when held will be a milestone along that road.</P>
    <P>If an historical analogy is of use, I suggest we are now at the stage historically, of discussing the Chartist reforms of the 1830s.  As far as the labour movement is concerned, it was a long time in Britain, between 1830 and the advent of a Socialist Party, before it made any significant impact on the lives and livelihood of the majority of the people in that State.  In welcoming the direct elections and this Bill, and in commending the Government for the speed with which they have introduced it, we wish to point out, lest the enthuasism of the Minister for Foreign Affairs runs away with him, that direct elections or a European Parliament on its own given the power that it has now, will not initially do very much to solve the problems of the millions of people who are at present unemployed, and will not do a lot to resolve the peculiar problems which confront the Irish people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1280" /> I do not wish that to sound a begrudging comment.  It is not meant to be.  I am merely being consistent with the position that this party held before the referendum on the EEC and subsequent to it.  We accept the democratic decision of the overwhelming majority of the people.  In accepting that, we rededicate ourselves to democratising the European Parliament, and attempting to get some shift from the centre out to the periphery.  From the statistics, I understand that there has been no significant shift in either power or resources from the rich nations to the poor nations.  To the extent that the proposed salaries for European members has caused comment, nothing is a greater indictment of the imbalance between the rich and poor sectors of the Community than the level of those salaries.  The salaries should not be seen to be excessive.  A salary which would be considered normal for a TD in Germany or France, is perceived to be enormously bountiful in Ireland or in Southern Italy.  That is an indication of how much work lies ahead of the European Parliament in tranferring resources from the rich to the poor regions.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that:</P>
    <P>In adopting the single transferable vote we are choosing a system with which our electors are fully familiar and which affords them a wider range of choice between parties and candidates than would generally be available under any other system. The STV system appears to be the most suitable in our particular circumstances and we should not regard our freedom of choice in this matter as being in any way restricted by the fact that the other member states may adopt different systems.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister in making that perfectly acceptable statement did not advert to the fact that on two historic occasions by way of referenda the Irish public by majority vote came out in favour in principle of such a system and that the Irish adoption of the STV system in this context should not be seen merely as a matter of procedural convenience.  It should be seen as something upon which the Irish people formally <Col N="1281" /> made a decision, that therefore we are committed to such a system, and that in any discussions that may take place between the various member states about an integrated and uniform system of election for the nine or perhaps 12 member states, our commitment as a nation should be made fully clear to all the other member states.</P>
    <P>The election date has been referred to.  Nobody seriously expects the European elections to take place in the spring next year.  Informed commentators have already adverted to the fact that they did not expect such elections to take place then.  The possible dates referred to are this time next year or the spring of 1979.  In some respects it is to be regretted that this delay will take place, but given the context of politics in France and in Britain it seems inevitable.  The present Government no less than their predecessors, are to be congratulated on removing any barrier to the holding of those elections at the prescribed time.  To that extent I, on behalf of the Labour Party, support the introduction of this measure, and appreciate the speed with which the present administration have introduced this Bill.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the commission that was established and to the findings of the commission.  I follow Deputy Fitzpatrick on this.  We welcome the establishment of the commission.  We welcome the fact that the European elections provided a unique opportunity in which the whole idea of a commission, which had been voiced on numerous occasions, could be tried out, to see how it would work in the context of domestic politics where there would be a certain amount of trepidation about the functions and workings of such a commission.  On balance it is fair to say that the speed with which the commission made their decision, and the final content of that decision, is, generally speaking, seen to be fair and acceptable to majority opinion.</P>
    <P>One will never satisfy everybody with regard to boundary proposals.  I am sure when the Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government of the day was drawing up his boundaries <Col N="1282" /> there were a lot of alternatives proposed behind closed doors.  I am sure that was equally the case with regard to the last Minister for Local Government. However, it is fair to say that, given the terms of reference&mdash; the options contained in alternatives for 15 seats&mdash;the commission have done a job that certainly is acceptable in principle to the Labour Party and we welcome it.</P>
    <P>When those elections take place one of the provisions of the Bill is for the allocation of names of domestic political parties, national political parties, if you like, and European political groupings.  I could not help but smile at the opening speech of the Minister for Foreign Affairs when he referred briefly to that fact in that I look forward with a certain amount of interest to the designation of Fianna Fáil candidates on the ballot paper and to the policy put forward by them on the grounds that the Minister's personal commitment to some form of federalism within Europe is quite clear and apparent.  However, the same commitment is far from shared by the Fianna Fáil colleagues in France.  It will be of interest to us who are so concerned with the democratisation of the European Parliament to ascertain whether the influence of the Fianna Fáil Party will extend to the Gaullist Party in France to the extent that they will relax some of their virulent anti-federalism and antagonism towards the European Parliament generally.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might address himself to what appears to be a contradiction in regard to the aspirations for the future of the Parliament: I refer to the position adopted by the Constitutional Court in France regarding France's participation in direct elections.  It seems to us in the Labour Party that, in effect, there will be a very substantial brake put upon the democratic evolution of the European Parliament.  If I understand it correctly&mdash;and I am open to correction on this&mdash;the French have said: &ldquo;We will participate in this Parliament only if its powers are not increased significantly&rdquo;.  In effect, that rules out the aspirations not merely <Col N="1283" /> of the Labour Party with regard to the development of this Parliament but equally so those of the Fianna Fáil Party, if I understand the intent of the Minister's speech.  Perhaps the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary, at the closing of this stage of the debate or on Committee Stage, might refer to that point.  If the Minister and the Government wish to get support for the European elections they have to hold out the prospect of some real evolution of that Parliament in Strasbourg above and beyond its current role.</P>
    <P>At this stage I would urge on the Government that in order to maintain the high credit rating, if you like, of the Irish public's interest in the EEC institutions, they should not resort to the tactic of holding the European elections on the same day as local elections in order to guarantee a high turn-out.  That would be a dishonest approach to the Irish attitude to the European Assembly.  It would be an apparently convenient way in which to kill two birds with the one stone.  I have heard it voiced&mdash;not, may I add, by Members of the Fianna Fáil Party but by people who are described as &ldquo;committed Europeans&rdquo;, whatever that means, because we all happen to live in Europe; rather I should redescribe them as committed members of the EEC&mdash;that in case we cannot whip up sufficient interest in these elections so remote from the Irish public it might be necessary, useful or smart to run the two together.  On the assumption that the direct elections do not take place next spring&mdash;and consequently are more likely to take place in the spring of 1979&mdash;we would be running up to the end of the term of office of present local government members.</P>
    <P>I believe that would be totally dishonest. It would be dishonest in terms of using it as an indication of how much the Irish cared about the European Assembly.  But, speaking as a former member of a local authority, I would say that the prospect of combining a campaign for local elections with that for the European Assembly is daunting at the least.  One cannot but think of the extraordinary situations <Col N="1284" /> that would evolve in attempting to clarify issues about the European Assembly, about its future evolution and, at the same time, deal with the very legitimate concern of local authority members and local communities. Therefore, I should like an assurance from the Government that that temptation will not be yielded to because, in the long term I believe it would damage the body politic of this country.</P>
    <P>One point not adverted to as yet is the fact that for the first time since 1918&mdash;I am subject to correction on this&mdash;all of the adult electorate, the people of this island will be voting together at the same time the same day within the framework of the same election.  In view of the position of all three parties with regard to the reunification of this country that historical fact should not go without comment.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned we will be campaigning in the European elections as a member of the Socialist International, as a member of the Confederation of Socialist Parties within the EEC.  In the North of Ireland the SDLP is a sister member of both those organisations.</P>
    <P>It is my hope that the joint policy programme in which the Labour Party will participate in these elections with other members of the Socialist International in the nine member states will contain an attractive prospectus for the electorate North and South of the Border.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the short notice with which this Bill has been brought before the House.  But it would be unfair to use that as an excuse for attempting to delay or complain about the contents of the Bill.  As far as my party are concerned we welcome its introduction.  We welcome the commitment the Government have displayed for its speedy implementation so that we cannot be accused in any way of delaying the official date for a European election.  We believe a positive lesson has been learned from our experience of the commission. To that extent we hope that in view of the general widespread, positive acceptance with which that comission's <Col N="1285" /> report has been received our Government will take their courage in their hands and introduce a similar kind of commission with regard to Dáil constituencies should that become necessary.</P>
    <P>When the elections take place we feel they should be uncluttered by any considerations of local elections or any other domestic issues that would get in the way of the real political issues centred around the European Assembly.  To that extent, as spokesman of the Labour Party on the Environment, I might add that we would like formal reassurance from the Government that they will not resort to insisting or attempting to combine the two elections, side by side, for the reasons I outlined earlier.</P>
    <P>An exercise in political education is required in order to explain to the public the implications of this Bill and of the European elections.  I hope that the Commission in executing this exercise will make adequate funds available for those people who have reservations about the nature of the Community's capacity to deal with social and economic problems.  Otherwise many people who are dissatisfied with the performance of the EEC&mdash;largely because of its failure to deliver to the Irish public much of the social and economic policies promised in the 1972 referendum&mdash;those who are essential to the democratic life of the country, will not participate at all.  In that event the election, as a democratic expression of the people's support for the Assembly in Strasbourg, will not be a true or accurate one.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said that as Minister for Foreign Affairs he is prepared to facilitate parties, and presumably other individuals, in connection with visits to the Commission, to the Assembly in Strasbourg and other aids with regard to information and so on.  I should like clarification as to whether this facility will be coordinated with the work of the commission through their office in Merrion Square or whether it will be channelled through some pro-Community movement such as the ICEM.  Will the Minister clarify what he has in mind and <Col N="1286" /> the kind of budget envisaged in order to provide this kind of information?</P>
    <P>We have reached a very historic stage, which to my mind, has not been sufficiently highlighted.  For the first time since 1918 there will be an election for the entire island of Ireland.  If anything is likely to generate interest in the South on this question of the European Parliament and the Assembly at Strasbourg it might be this fact and the Government should bear it in mind.</P>
    <P>In his closing speech on this Stage the Minister might clarify how he, as a Member of Fianna Fáil and a constituent part of the European Progressive Democrats, can reconcile his aspiration for the enlargement of the European Parliament and the democratisation of the institutions of the Community with the Government's alliance with the Gaulist Party in France and the steadfast opposition of that substantial grouping to any significant democratic enlargement of the powers and roles of the Commission and the European Parliament.  To what extent does he as Minister for Foreign Affairs see the decision of the French Constitutional Court effectively putting a bar on the hoped-for evolution of the European Parliament?</P>
    <P>We welcome this Bill and we offer the Government our co-operation in getting it through the House.  We hope it will go on the Statute Book without too much delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, not just because it was introduced by Fianna Fáil but because it is a most historic Bill.  The whole concept of the European Community grew from the efforts of men such as M. Schumann and M. Monnet in the original coal and steel pact.  Now we are about to enact legislation that will allow the Irish people to send elected representatives to the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the EEC referendum our people voted overwhelmingly to join the Community. One thought was uppermost in the minds of people in Europe; it was that this would mean peace, that we would not have to endure the wars that have raged in Europe every 20 years&mdash;the conflicts in 1870, 1914 and <Col N="1287" /> 1939.  We saw that countries such as France and Germany could bury their differences, could come together and work for European integration and prosperity.  The problems between the two countries were thrashed out in Strasbourg or Brussels instead of on the plains of Europe with the destruction of so many people.</P>
    <P>Today we are playing a significant part in remembering the 28 million people who were killed or maimed in World War II.  Quite apart from any material considerations we are playing our part to unite Europe and to prevent war.  I should like to see the Community enlarged.  I should like to see every country in Europe in the position of working together peacefully for a prosperous Europe, thus ensuring peace.  I welcome the principle of the Bill as well as the subject matter.</P>
    <P>The Bill is really an expansion of our domestic election machinery. There is not much difference.  Certainly the deposit is higher but ten or 15 years ago the £100 deposit required in the national elections must have meant quite a lot to the people concerned. I do not think the deposit in this case is too high, nor do I think it will cause embarrassment to any candidate.</P>
    <P>We should thank the commission which this Government set up to draft the boundaries for the new constituencies. They did their work quickly and well and we wish to thank them for that.  The Government have set a headline for the future.  Without being petty, I am sure the previous Government now wish they had referred the matter of the new constituencies to a commission.  They could not have done any worse in the election.</P>
    <P>There are certain matters in the Bill than can be dealt with on Committee Stage.  In the meantime I want to refer to Deputy Quinn's speech and his reference to their opposition to the referendum some years ago.  It is a pity the Labour Party members make the same speech.  If I were a foreigner and I listened to some of the British Socialists speak about the EEC and I heard Deputy Quinn speak afterwards I would assume that the Irish Labour <Col N="1288" /> Party are merely a regional part of the British Labour Party.  The people in the Irish Labour Party are their own worst enemies because they trot out the arguments of the British Socialists and they try to justify their opposition to our joining the European Community by the fact that they are Socialists.  They do not seem to remember that the vast majority of Socialist parties on the mainland of Europe were behind this integration of the six nations and then of the nine nations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn now informs us that they will campaign in the next election with all the Socialist parties of Europe, as members of the Socialist International. That is a great turn around. They opposed our joining the Community because they are Socialists and now they will campaign with their European counterparts to try to ensure that their candidates are elected.  This is very inconsistent and not on a par with European thinking.  We have a part to play in Europe.  The Government brought forward this Bill very quickly to ensure that we will keep the date set for the elections by the European Commission.  The only country dragging its feet on this is the United Kingdom.  The other countries want to keep this date the same as we do.  When this Bill becomes law we can say to any of the countries in the European Community that we are ready for the European elections.</P>
    <P>I will have more to say about this on Committee Stage because there are parts of the Bill that are difficult to assess quickly.  I want to mention something I mentioned previously on Bills concerned with domestic politics, that is, the ballot paper.  It has been proven by political observers that the place where one's name is on the ballot paper may decide whether or not one is elected.  I am not complaining because it does not affect me.  The first letter of my name is the thirteenth in the alphabet.  I have never finished thirteenth. We should have a look at our ballot paper as well as the European ballot papers which may be a different shape.  I have often thought if we had a round ballot paper it would be the ideal thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>He was not arguing against it.  We should look into this matter.  I do not know what the shape of the European ballot paper is.  Candidates could perhaps draw for a place on the ballot paper.  It is a small point but this Bill, like many others, is made up of small points which are brought together, become a Bill and eventually an Act.  Deputy Fitzpatrick said that he would not like to think that financial reward would be an overriding consideration.  We also share this view. I do not believe that this is a consideration with any politicians that I know. If it was one would select other fields for one's endeavours.  If a politician were to work the same hours in a professional capacity he would get a greater reward.  The reward in politics is given to politicians because they are involved in politics, are giving service to people and are part of the whole democratic set up.  I do not believe anybody will try to go to Europe for financial considerations.  It is tough having to go to Europe so frequently and possibly having to learn a third language in order to be a good member of the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1290" /> I believe this Bill is another part in the process of restoring our place in Europe.  It will mean that our Members can partake in deliberations in Europe which must surely bring about the prosperity we all seek.  We know that unemployment is as big a problem in Europe as it is here.  If one looks at the amount of money we have got from the Community fund since we joined the EEC one can see that we have got a lot more than we put into it.  We should consider the European Community as an agency for the better distribution of wealth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling, Sir.  The point I was making is that the new European Parliament will be an instrument not only of governing generally but also a weapon in the fight for a more prosperous Europe. Deputy Quinn said that the Labour Party accepted the decision of the people in the referendum.  What else could they do when the people voted by 83 per cent to join the Community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's party could not because they would have been laughed out of the House. Britain had a big task before she joined but now she has accepted the facts of life, as the Deputy's party have.  There is no future in opposition to the EEC.  When the Deputy says that his party accepted the decision, they had no choice in the matter.  I suppose the commission which set up the boundaries here will be criticised. We will probably be told that they could have done this and that.  I believe it is generally taken that they have done a good job.  They have fashioned the constituencies in a way that will give us the opinion of the people in those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see this as our return to <Col N="1291" /> Europe because we have always had European connections.  This time we are going in as equal members of the European Parliament.  We fought for so long to get rid of the coat tails of our neighbour and those who opposed our entry to the Community were prepared to perpetuate our hanging on to those coat tails.  If we had not entered the Community, partition would have been perpetuated because the Six Counties would have formed part of the Community and we would have been outside it.  The Irish could see where their future lay and we have benefited enormously from our membership.  We are a sovereign nation in Europe.  Anyone elected to the European Parliament will have the opportunity of playing a major part in the Community.  There is now a possibility of three other countries becoming members and we welcome the expansion of the Community and hope that eventually it will encompass every state in Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy again but I would point out that the Bill is to regulate the conduct of elections to the European Parliament.

There are no fewer than ten reports on the Order Paper for discussion in the near future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quinn mentioned holding the two elections on the same day.  We are still not quite sure of the date of these elections but we will be ready when the time comes.  I do not know what the Government will do about holding the local elections on the same day.  It is not an important point.  The people will be very interested in these elections since they will be held on a nation-wide basis and this will generate tremendous interest.  An extra fillip will not be needed to get people to vote.  A great deal of effort will be put into this campaign and everyone <Col N="1292" /> will recognise the importance of sending the best people to Europe, whether men or women.  I look forward to this historic election and I believe that the legislation here will enable people to come out and vote.  There are one or two small points which I hope to raise on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Apart from the material good that the new Parliament will do, it is a pledge to the people who have suffered in the wars of Europe that at last Europe has learned a lesson, that we are coming together and that we have seen the last of the European wars.  I look forward to a prosperous Europe in which this country will play an important part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. Ahern Mr. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to congratulate Deputy Andrews on his appointment and wish him well during the next few years.  I want to make a number of brief points.  At present the Assembly of the European Community consists of delegates designated by the parliaments of member countries from among their own members.  The original treaty envisaged the introduction of a system whereby countries could elect people in the same way as in their ordinary internal elections.  The Act of 1976, from which this Bill has arisen, laid down the provisions to apply in relation to direct elections here until such time as a uniform electoral system comes into operation.  I should like the Minister to tell us what is happening regarding electoral procedures.</P>
      <P>The Bill also mentions that the election might be held in June, 1978. We have all accepted that this will not happen.  I agree with Deputy Quinn in that this election should not be held at the same time as the local elections. This is a very important matter and if we are sincere about it we should decide on a single voting day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All who are interested in democracy, as is everybody in this House, welcome the fact that the constituencies have been drawn up by a totally independent commission and no advantage is given to any grouping. I congratulate Mr. Justice Walsh and his staff.  It is often said that commissions are set up simply to delay <Col N="1293" /> matters.  This commission was set up some time in July and very speedily accomplished their work.  Mr. Justice Walsh has stated that a reasonable basis for the fair conduct of elections appears to be provided, with due regard to social and economic factors, the electorate and density of population, as well as total population.  I accept that and, having looked at the constituencies, it seems a very fair split-up.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the STV system is the one with which the electorate are fully familiar and it affords a wide range of choice between parties and candidates.  I agree with that.</P>
    <P>There is reference to the fact that until a uniform system is introduced anomalies appear to be unescapable. A person might be able to vote in two countries.  We cannot solve this kind of problem in our own country and a person who has moved to a new house may be entered twice on the register and thus have two votes.  When several countries are involved it may be difficult to eliminate this kind of thing.</P>
    <P>The qualifications for candidates and the deposits required are very much in line with our domestic system and should not cause any difficulties for prospective candidates.  Hopefully, the holding of by-elections will be avoided because of the massive expense involved and the size of the campaigns which would be carried on.  The domestic affairs of a country would probably be affected for several weeks. It seems to be a fair system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore seems to think that we may not have a problem in arousing interest in the European elections. Most people know very little about the European Parliament and it may be a difficult task to arouse sufficient interest in order to get a high percentage vote.  I should like to congratulate Mr. Justice Walsh and his staff and the Government for the speed with which they have put this Bill before the House.  We cannot be accused of delaying the European elections.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us if there will be a delay and the countries responsible for it.</P>
    <Col N="1294" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment Deputy Andrews on his new appointment.  He is suited to it.  If you look across the House at him you will see that he has the European look, with his long flaxen hair that we associate with Germans and Danes.  He could pass as a representative of these countries.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  We are all disappointed that we are getting only 15 representatives for such a vast Assembly.  Like yourself, a Ceann Comhairle, coming from the large areas of Connacht and Ulster, we too are disappointed that our population only permits us to have three representatives.  It is a pity that it has been done on a population basis.  It is wrong that a large area such as Connacht and three counties of Ulster are only entitled to three representatives. It takes longer to travel through the constituency that I represent than it takes to travel through Dublin.</P>
      <P>It is amusing to note the comments of political commentators in regard to the salary of £30,000 per annum. As parliamentarians, we have been too apologetic to the Irish people in the past in regard to our salary, which is in the region of £5,000.  Many salesmen earn more than £5,000 per annum and there is not a word about it.  When people talk about £30,000 salaries they do not realise that many sacrifices will have to be made by politicians if they are serious about the European elections.  Many of them will be away from their homes for weeks, working 70 to 80 hours per week.  It is only right that the salary should be high because it will encourage a better type of individual to stand for the European elections. One of our faults at present is that we are not enticing enough people of the right calibre to offer themselves as candidates for Dáil elections.  Many managing directors pay more in income tax than the amount of our salaries.  If you want the right kind of representation in Europe you must pay the right salary and we should not be apologetic about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill provides for a wider franchise as far as voters are concerned.  It is worth mentioning that <Col N="1295" /> many American citizens who are living here in retirement are not using their voting rights.  The American Ambassador should be asked to notify them that they are entitled to vote.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that postal voting will be confined to the Garda Síochána and the Army.  There is no doubt that injustices were done to many people in local elections because of the postal vote.  I know of constituencies in which the system was abused right, left and centre.  In some towns and cities large numbers of votes were made use of because of the postal voting system.  I often wonder whether our voting system is the right one.  We must all admit that impersonations are carried on.  In towns with a population of between 15,000 and 20,000, candidates have been known to collect ballot papers and misuse them.  I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should consider the problem in regard to the European elections.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I asked the Minister for Local Government if it was intended to introduce photographs on driving licences.  If this was done a driving licence could be used as a means of identification for getting a ballot paper.  It is our duty to ensure that this type of impersonation is wiped out.  The only way in which it can be wiped out is to insist on proof of identification for voting.  There is nothing to stop people who live in flats from voting several times at an election.</P>
    <P>Some speakers said they were in favour of holding the two elections at the same time and some were against it.  It would be a good idea, particularly in country areas, to hold both elections at the same time.  If this were done it would ensure a full turnout of voters.  It distresses me to see so few Deputies taking an interest in this important legislation.  Unless the election coincides with some other election it is likely that many people in country areas will not bother to vote.  Already there are indications that people in some of the political parties will not be in favour of these elections, but in common with many others I often ask myself what situation <Col N="1296" /> we would be in today if we had not joined the EEC.  I was not a great advocate of membership but in hindsight I realise the extent to which agriculture has benefited from it. Hopefully we will benefit, too, so far as fisheries are concerned.  At least we have vetoes in regard to all these spheres of activity and we should not be shy about using those vetoes where necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 15 is very interesting.  It might be to our benefit as Dáil Deputies to introduce the kind of legislation that is proposed in this section whereby casual vacancies can be filled by the nomination of a person from the political party of which the person causing the vacancy was a member.  Those of us who have been public representatives for some time are aware of the time that is wasted on the occasion of by-elections.  We spend weeks campaigning when, properly, we should be attending to legislation. The other system would be fair and just.  When a party or parties are elected by the people to rule, they should be allowed to rule until such time as a general election is necessitated. It is in this context that I am advocating a change in the system of replacing members who die or who for some other reason must be replaced.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I welcome the Bill. It contains many good points which we here might adopt for this Parliament.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>First I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his appointment and wish him well in his new post.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of direct elections to the European Parliament.  Consequently, I welcome the Bill.  Unlike Deputy White, I was one of those who advocated our joining the EEC. I spent a fair deal of time discussing the question and urging a vote in favour of membership because I could not see any other realistic way of facing the future economically or even socially.  At the time we were facing the removal of the EFTA tariffs in respect of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very happy with the arrangement as provided by the European <Col N="1297" /> Assembly Constituency Commission. This represents a fair division of seats. I am glad, too, that there is proposed provision for three seats for Northern Ireland.  This should ensure that the minority will have representation in Europe.  I understand that this provision involved a certain amount of negotiation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn has said that he has been critical of the European Parliament and of the Community to date on the basis of performance.  However, it is evident that our economy has been saved during the recent period of recession by, particularly, the advantages and the stability that were achieved in respect of agriculture.  It is important that we recognise this and that consequently we are prepared to be enthusiastic about making further advances into our total commitment in the Community.  At this stage we are involved fully in Europe as members. We have gained a great deal of experience in the administration of business within the Community, something that we lacked and about which there were real fears in the early days of our membership.  However, having gained so much experience in regard to administration we are now in a good position, backed in many ways by the experience gained at the level of the European Parliament, to take the further step of these direct elections.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed at the EEC's failure to provide immediate remedies in respect of the energy crisis, remedies that would solve the problems of the various member states and, in particular, the problems that the crisis created for Ireland.  Much of the responsibility for this failure lies in the fact that in Europe we were not thinking and working as one.  I see the proposed direct elections as a step further along the road to such unity of thought, concern and consideration for one another.  I see the proposal also as a means of bringing about much greater democratic control of the EEC's bureaucratic system.</P>

      <P>Of necessity the administration of such enormous budgets and diverse systems requires an enormous bureaucracy, but this bureaucracy must <Col N="1298" /> be answerable to the people of the various member States.  It is in this way that I see the greatest influence of the direct elections because the people who will subsquently be representing us in Europe will be speaking with the full backing of the people and will be able to speak with a degree of confidence which I trust will result in greater control of the systems that operate in Europe.</P>
      <P>The direct elections, too, will provide an open forum for review, for debate and for agreement on the policies which should be pursued within Europe.  In this respect it is self-evident that we will get from the EEC returns that are only in proportion to the efforts which we as a people put into the Community. We have been rather shy in this respect to date but it is time that we put a wholehearted effort into the development of all the member States. The EEC is a very adult and fastmoving Community.  Therefore, through the direct elections we will need to have the strongest possible representation. It is on that basis that I trust the people who will be representing us will be chosen.</P>
      <P>Because of changing circumstances, changing social and material conditions, our younger people may not realise what went before.  They will know very little of the worries and concerns we had prior to our membership of the EEC.  They are growing up as Europeans and they will look to us to set up the systems, the organisation and the methods of democratic control which will enable us to avail whole-heartedly of the opportunities presented by our membership of the Community.</P>
      <P>I hesitate to mention the word &ldquo;salaries&rdquo; but I am glad that Deputy White raised the question.  In this regard I am very much in agreement with him because I detest the sort of small-mindedness that could operate where this matter is concerned.  Those who go to Europe will have an onerous task.  There is plenty of evidence of that.  Deputy Clinton has indicated clearly that the burdens carried by such an onerous and diverse office are considerable for the individual Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a view expressed fairly <Col N="1299" /> widely to the effect that the salaries of directly-elected members of the European Parliament should in some way be restricted.  I do not agree with this view.  If we are to be Europeans we must make up our minds that we will be Europeans in the full sense.  I might add that I am not particularly anxious or involved directly in that respect, but we must face up to the situation.  The disruption to the lives of families of Deputies, the inconvenience and the wear and tear to the members who will be elected will be very considerable.  The positive contribution which will be expected and is very much needed from these people will mean that they must be free to participate fully as equal members of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore has said that he is very anxious to see an enlargement of the Community and there are plans for enlargement in motion at present.  I agree with this political desire for a wider involvement but I am disappointed that the EEC have not addressed themselves to structural and development problems which still exist in both the North and South of Ireland and in other parts of the Community.</P>
    <P>We should be prepared to take things step by step.  The movement towards direct elections is very important for the member States, and in relation to it we should establish ourselves in a democratic way before going much further with all the other economic and social problems which will arise from enlargement.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am in favour of direct elections.  They will bring the plain people of Ireland more directly into contact with Europe because the people would be making their own decisions about our representatives in Europe.  Our democratic involvement in European administration will be increased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assert my welcome for the proposal and I suspect there will be unanimous approval of the provisions of the Bill.  It is an historic Bill in so far as it sets out to enshrine the continued contribution by this country to European affairs and to the international stage generally. <Col N="1300" /> It will give solid realisation to the natural aspirations of the Irish people who have traditionally faced in the European direction with the traditional selflessness shown by their input and contribution to European affairs generally.</P>
      <P>The Bill is not controversial.  It is, with one or two minor exceptions, precisely the Bill which was drawn up by the Coalition Government prior to the general election.  It underlines also, on the eve of the historic occasion of the first direct elections to Europe, that there is much to be gained economically and socially by this country from direct involvement and participation in the European structure. Economically we have already had indications, particularly in the agricultural sector, of the type of benefits which may be anticipated. Socially and culturally the advantages will be more obvious as the years go by.  We are an island country off another island which is off the coast of Europe and it is vital that our people have access to the depth of culture, tradition and history which Europe can offer us.  I see an opportunity for representatives of our nation at all levels to come into closer contact with people of other European states, and I welcome that.</P>
      <P>It is a pleasure to see that the new constituencies have been drawn up and introduced by an independent commission. I presume that this will be the standard format for all constituency revisions at all elections from this day forward.  Also, the party that I represent can feel proud to have a part in welcoming the voting system. But for the resilient attitude that this party took in defence of that voting system some years ago we might not now have the opportunity of ensuring that all sections of the community are represented fairly and adequately in the election outcome.  The single transferable vote will ensure, perhaps in a degree unprecedented in Europe, a genuine effort to see that all sections of our community have a voice on the European stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that those parliamentarians who will become members of the European Parliament <Col N="1301" /> will in some way be defecting from the Irish cause and in some quarters there is unease that the excellent services, of these men and women will be lost to the domestic scene.  I hope that that will not be the case.  I see the role of the European parliamentarians as being an extension of the role that they have been and are playing in the Irish political situation.  I anticipate that the strains and stresses which will be upon these people will be compensated for to some degree by the fact that they will be working with a depth of experience gained in many cases from the hard task of political activity in this country, and they will be an enlargement of our political life.  They will represent our country proudly and well on the European political stage. It is important that the support and encouragement of all Irish people go with these ambassadors.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties, undoubtedly, in trying to convince people that they should be especially enthusiastic about the need to represent them in a European Parliament.  I trust the Government will give thought to the ways and means of encouraging maximum participation among the public.  If there is not a high degree of participation in the European election the result in terms of democratic emphasis will be distorted.  The Government probably have that in mind and may have devices to ensure the maximum turnout of voters.  This might be the opportunity to take other measures relating to the queries and questions which the Fianna Fáil Party had and presumably still have in relation to the Constitution and other matters of that nature.  This will afford us an opportunity of putting to the people, in the most economic way and the best manner possible for our democratic institutions, a number of other questions which have been troubling the present Government over the last four years.  This opportunity to get a public response to some of the proposals they have been putting forward must appeal to them.</P>
    <P>I hope that our European Parliamentarians and representatives will be able to tackle in a real way many of the problems of Europe which confront us.  As a small nation we are in <Col N="1302" /> a vulnerable situation, but I have no doubt that those who are elected will ensure that they represent this country in a way which is adequate and strong in relation to the role they play.  I do not propose to go into the type of problems facing the European situation, but the relations between Europe and other parts of the world and, perhaps, specifically between Europe and the Third World, will undoubtedly be attracting a good deal of attention in the years to come.  The casual observer at least would be concerned at the <i>laisser faire</i> approaches in relation to the Third World which Europe at present adopts.  I am thinking of the talk we hear&mdash;and I am speaking as a Dublin Deputy&mdash;of large masses of intervention beef, butter mountains, wine lakes and so on.  There will be a need to consider a planned approach to food production in relation to the projected needs of the world and particularly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that and I will not continue along those lines.  I just wanted to say in essence that there are major issues with international implications facing those who go forward and are successful in the election. Some people have a relatively narrow view of the role which our European parliamentarians will play. I suggest it is very much an international issue which we are debating and that this is an historic occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One issue that strikes me as being worthy of some consideration is the likely implications of the growth in our population in relation to the number of seats we have at present and are likely to have.  I am not aware of any provision whereby reconsideration will be given to the number of seats this country has at a particular time depending on the new trends in the population.  Ireland is probably unique in the fact that population patterns are very different from what they are on the mainland of Europe.  In some countries there is a contraction of <Col N="1303" /> population; in other countries the population is standing still; Ireland does not show too many indications that that will happen in the immediate future.  It would worry me slightly that this country, with representation which is already thin on the ground, might have an even more disproportionate voice at some time in the future unless our representatives are fully conscious of the need to stress their full right to adequate representation relating to the population of the country as it might be at any particular time. Obviously, that is not covered in the Bill, but presumably somewhere in the European context that matter will be looked after and I would commend that it would be closely watched.</P>
    <P>This is a new venture for Ireland and for Europe, and I would suggest with the greatest respect to heads which are older and wiser than mine is, that there is a need for flexibility, a need, for example, in two, three or four years' time to look again at what has been achieved and how it has been achieved, and to ask whether a review is possible, and whether it is desirable that the Bill as it now is should be amended.  In other words, I am saying this may be the beginning of a process rather than the end of a process.  It is very important that Europe as a whole should adopt an attitude which will allow flexibility, which will allow for the undoubted major social, economic, cultural and other developments which will take place in the Europe of the eighties and the nineties and the great challenges which will confront Europe not merely internally but in relation to other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>On the filling of casual vacancies, one very minor question mark arises in my mind.  I know there is provision for the Dáil to fill any casual vacancies, and one would not be expecting a great number of these to occur.  For the political parties obviously there is no great problem. There is provision for the political parties to nominate their replacements; indeed, there is provision for them to nominate, apparently, any replacements which are necessary.  It might be <Col N="1304" /> worth considering the aspects in relation to independent or non-party people who might find favour with the electors when these elections take place.  There does not seem to be as full a consideration of the implications of that as might be desirable.  In other words, it is theoretically possible that a significant proportion of people who would vote for and elect an independent would be disenfranchised by decisions reached by the consensus of major political parties, and that is something that this parliament, as a democratic parliament, would probably not wish.  I do not know to what extent this would be a problem, but I thought it worthy of mention in passing.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's stated intention of ensuring that these elections are held on time.  It is very important that we do not have a long period of speculation and unease, of rumour and counter rumour, which undoubtedly would help to undermine not merely the morale of the parties and individuals who might aspire to success in these European elections but also that of the public.  I think there will be a problem in getting the public concerned and interested in the European situation.  We do not want to aggravate that by unseemly tussles over, perhaps, a year or 18 months relating to the time of the election and their impact on, perhaps, the domestic politics or neighbouring countries.  It would be most unfortunate if that happened, and I have no doubt from the Minister's statement today, that the Government will endeavour to ensure that these elections are held as close as possible to the date for which they have been set.  Accordingly, it is a pleasure to welcome this Bill and a privilege to be able to say a few words on what I believe to be an historic occasion for this island of ours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Parliamentary Secretary will hopefully be playing a fairly active part in the propagandising of the European direct elections, and I have felt that, in the circumstances, it is proper that I should make a short contribution on what has been described as an historic Bill before the Dáil.  The standard of debate has not been affected by the suggestion that the Bill itself was introduced in a hasty fashion, but the history of its circulation is that the Coalition produced a Bill with the exception of the new constituency boundaries as enshrined in the present Bill, in addition to a number of drafting amendments.  Therefore, the Bill was in circulation during the halcyon days of the past Coalition, and I understand the new Bill as drafted has been in circulation since the 18th October.  In all the circumstances, there has been a considerable amount of time available to Deputies who are interested in the whole concept of Europe and the direct elections in particular. I would hope that would in some way answer the criticisms about the allegedly hasty manner in which the Bill was introduced today.</P>
      <P>The absence of Deputies from the House early in the debate was commented on.  If the Deputy who did so were here now he would agree there have been a great number of contributions and a large volume of expressions of views on the importance of the Bill since he voiced his criticism. Indeed, if he goes to the trouble to read the Official Report he will agree that though the criticism may have been reasonable when it was made, it has no validity now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contributions made reflect the tremendous interest in this important Bill.  It is important to realise that the Bill has received the unanimous support of the three parties in the House.  By virtue of their welcome for the setting up of the boundaries commission it is clear all parties also accept the constituency boundaries recommended by that commission and set out in the Bill.  It is good to know that every Deputy in the House is behind the Bill, even though there may be some <Col N="1306" /> drafting amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is another matter of extreme importance in relation to direct elections to the European Parliament.  It is that the three parties have a responsibility to ensure that there will be a massive turnout for the elections in May or June next year.  As a Parliament we have a duty to do what we can to ensure such a turnout in support of the various candidates going forward. The situation will be somewhat different from the referendum on entry to the EEC when there was an 83 per cent vote in favour.  A massive turnout in 1978 will indicate that we have proved our worth in the European Parliament and in the Commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn is right&mdash;we should not be going around with some sort of Celtic inferiority complex.  It may have something to do with our history.  Our important contribution to the affairs of the EEC and the Council of Europe has been recognised as such by the eight other EEC members and the 18 other Council of Europe members&mdash;it will be 19 others when Spain accedes in November&mdash;twenty in all.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a high place in the corridors of power in Europe and this has been achieved by hard work by successive Irish Governments.  Our reputation is high, but to copperfasten it it is important that the electorate turn out in equally high numbers as when they voted in the referendum. As Deputy Quinn suggested, such a high poll would ensure the strengthening of the democratic institutions of EEC because it would indicate support for the philosophy of our involvement in Europe, of the continued exposure of one national culture in Europe to another.  As the views of Irishmen have been broadened by exposure to other cultures, I have no doubt that other nations have benefited from visits to this country.  We have seen that the EEC is not all about crude economics &mdash;that there is something else.</P>
    <P>Unanimity has been displayed here today and we have an obligation to communicate that to the electorate between now and next summer, to ensure that we get across to the electorate <Col N="1307" /> the message of the importance of the direct elections.  Naturally, the three parties in the Dáil will be vying for the 15 seats so they will be doing their own thing, but generally there must be an effort to get the public to appreciate the importance of these elections and we must do this with the co-ordination of existing European agencies here.</P>
    <P>On the question of salaries, if you place a valuation on yourself people will place that same valuation on you.  When we are talking about £25,000 or £30,000 that European parliamentarians will get it reflects the size of salaries which national parliamentarians are getting in Germany, France and elsewhere.  I accept the suggestion on salaries made by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  We should not be in politics for the salary <i>per se</i>.  When we are in politics on a full time basis the matter of salaries becomes a reality.</P>
    <P>At this point it is as well to disabuse the public mind of the view that salaries are tax free.  They are not.  It is my view that there could well be an improvement in the existing salaries. It is not unusual for parliamentarians to do a great deal of travelling to and from Europe and that means they are away from their homes and from the country for a large portion of the year.  They have a great deal of work to do.  The dual mandate may go eventually but initially there will be Deputies who will have to work in their constituencies and also work in the European Parliament.  Compensating these will be very difficult.  No doubt a salary of £25,000 or £30,000 is very attractive but let us not pretend that those going to the European Parliament will not be worth that sort of money.  Europe is an extremely expensive place in which to live. When in Copenhagen recently the bill for bed and breakfast was £35 per night.  That is the reality.  We must keep this in perspective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity of wishing the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary good fortune and success as Ireland's representatives in our Department of Foreign Affairs.  They know that any help that can be given to them by this side of the House will be given whole-heartedly.</P>
      <P>There appears to be almost complete unanimity on the Bill.  It is vitally important that only top class candidates go forward in these elections to the European Parliament.  The candidates must be of the highest calibre.  I am confident that Fine Gael will put forward some first-class people.  We must emphasise here and in Europe that we regard the Community as so important we want only the best representation looking after our affairs in Europe.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Government most of their top people are in Government but that is no reason why Ministers should not go forward as candidates thereby demonstrating that they recognise the importance of these elections.  That is not to say that other than the best are required at home to look after domestic affairs but there are 148 Deputies and only 15 will be required in Europe.  That 15 must be people in whom we can have confidence at all times, in their ability, their diligence and their dedication.</P>
      <P>The Minister dealt with the date of the election and he hoped that it would take place in May or June of next year.  As a politician, looking at the scene in Europe, I have certain reservations as to the likelihood of these elections taking place next May or June.  They could well be held in 1979.  There may possibly be a time lag but it behoves all of us to be ready.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1309" /> These elections must not be held in close proximity to local elections. With local elections due in 1979 the danger is the Government might decide to have the European elections and the local elections on the same day.  I would urge the Minister to ensure that this will not happen. We have a highly intelligent electorate, an electorate that has shown keen perception at all times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>They could not go wrong with Deputy Connolly and myself. It is absolutely important that no other elections are held simultaneously with elections to the European Parliament.  Remember, if local elections were held simultaneously there could be no fewer than three ballot papers.  This could lead to confusion. It would be an easy way out for politicians and, let us be frank about it, politicians are not overfond of elections.  We like good results but we would prefer, if we could to avoid the actual work beforehand.  Holding local elections and the election to the European Parliament on the same day could detract from the importance of the latter.  Any semblance of confusion must be avoided.  I trust the Minister will take heed of what I say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to another point to which the Minister referred.  It deals with casual vacancies, by-elections, resignations or otherwise.  Section 15 of the Bill contains a proposal that would allow the vacancies arising to be filled by Dáil Éireann.  This takes away some of the rights of the people regarding filling of vacancies.  It would be unwise that Dáil Éireann should have the power to fill such a vacancy because, to be frank, the number of people who would have the actual filling of it would be very limited.  A registered political party will have the power, if they nominate a candidate within three months when they have lost a seat, to fill the vacancy.  Without <Col N="1310" /> considering the different numerical strength of parties you could have a situation in which 12 or 15 people or, in extreme cases, four or five people would have the decision regarding the filling of a seat in the European Parliament which would be the overall right of perhaps close to 250,000 otherwise.  This would leave too much power in the hands of a small group and would be unwise.  It would put the European Parliament in the position where people would say: &ldquo;This is a very sorry move.  There was a vacancy and four or five fellows in the Dáil were able to push in a pal of theirs to get £30,000 a year and all the perks that go with it.&rdquo; This could lead to a certain amount of scepticism.  We must ensure that is avoided.</P>
    <P>The Minister very fairly pointed out the position in regard to there not being a necessity for European Parliament by-elections.  I shall quote the Minister He pointed out: &ldquo;This argument has no relevance in the context of the Assembly which will not have the task of appointing an executive to be responsible to it and for this reason the representational aspect becomes more important&rdquo;.  If something was going wrong in Europe and there was a vacancy in Leinster and the Leinster people decided to have a rap at the people in Europe, their only chance of doing so other than waiting for a further election would be through the ballot box.  All three political parties will be involved in Europe but the people might say: &ldquo;Let us get rid of all of them&rdquo; and they might put forward somebody that we might consider an oddity but that the people in Leinster might consider would teach us all a lesson.  It is essential that the Leinster people should be entitled to put in somebody they think would teach us all a lesson so that the other 14 representatives in Europe would be able to go there and say: &ldquo;See what happened to us at home because of the policies being pursued in Europe.&rdquo; We do not like by-elections; they mean a lot of extra work but it is nevertheless essential to have them and I would be in favour of amending the Bill to provide that by-elections will be held similar to the by-elections we have here.  By-elections will take <Col N="1311" /> place in this Dáil also but the logic of the other procedure would be that it is no longer necessary to have by-elections here.  You either have them in both assemblies or in neither and I believe it is essential that we should have them.</P>
    <P>A further reason why by-elections may be essential is that our representatives in Europe will be representing Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour and will be members of some of the other party groups in Europe.  If party groupings in Europe become more powerful and get greater executive functions&mdash;I believe it will be essential in time that the Assembly should get real powers and have an executive because it is only with an executive they can get real power&mdash;and if there is a seat being contested and the people in the party grouping want it, they will come over here and help to contest the election.  If this occurs it will be for the benefit of the European Parliament in that institutions will benefit through people from other countries coming here and taking an interest in what is going on.  Similarly, it will be of benefit for our people to go throughout the Community and see what is happening there.  All this will benefit the Assembly and the Community.  Otherwise, we would be taking the easy way out and personally I would be against this, irrespective of what anybody else may think.</P>
    <P>The deposit is another item of importance.  I am sure Members here would have some party backing if they were badly stuck.  In the time of the last Dáil or two we had a number of by-elections and some most unusual candidates arrived in certain constituencies.  In one constituency I think the candidate did not arrive at all.  At least the candidate&mdash;I think it was a woman&mdash;was entitled to have her name down as a candidate.  She put down her deposit and contested the election.  It is important not to scare off people from contesting the election.  Individuals contest elections irrespective of what views they hold and they are entitled to put them before the people to see what the people think.  The people very quickly give <Col N="1312" /> their answer if they are not satisfied with what such candidates represent. I do not think we should bring in a regulation under which money would be a bar to any person contesting an election here.  The Irish people are shrewd enough to make a decision and I think it would be wrong to specify a deposit which would scare off would-be candidates.  I am against having the deposit too high.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Bill as proposed. The Chairman, Mr. Justice Walsh, is to be congratulated on the Bill and also his commission for formulating the proposals very quickly and very fairly.  I am largely in agreement with it but, personally, if I had the say as to how the constituencies would be worked I would go for a 15-seater. I would have the one constituency.  It would be difficult, complicated, and so on.  In a 15-seater constituency the three major political parties will get their own percentage of the votes.  The vast majority of Fianna Fáil supporters will vote for Fianna Fáil.  The vast majority of Labour supporters will vote for Labour and the vast majority of Fine Gael supporters will vote Fine Gael.  Each of these parties will follow their own traditional pattern of voting.</P>
    <P>A 15-seater would give the minority groupings a much better chance of having a representative in Europe.  In the proposed constituencies I cannot see anybody other than the major political parties being represented in Europe.  Independents in this House are a help.  Independents in a county council are a help.  In their own way, political parties are restricted in a great deal of what they say and do. Independents are essential.  I will go further and say many Independents will be needed in Europe to try to ensure we are not smothered in red tape and by the actual size of the institutions. Independents would have a good leavening effect in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>I am confident the people will make a very wise decision about who they will select from the candidates offered to them.  There is no danger that people representing the Leinster constituency will just consider the interests of the <Col N="1313" /> Leinster area or that the people in Munster will be just Munster-minded. The same can be said of Connacht, Ulster and other areas.  I hope people will consider themselves as Irishmen first in the election and, when they are elected, that they will consider themselves as Irishmen and the Europeans.</P>
    <P>We will be contesting this election under party political banners and, when the posters are taken down after the election, I hope the 15 people who will go to Europe will look after the interests of the people of Ireland in a united manner.  It is important that, whatever political differences we have, will be forgotten once we go into Europe, and that we will work hand in hand for the betterment of the Irish people and the future of the people coming after us.  It is essential that these 15 people will work as a team on behalf of the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is an historic occasion.  I am glad to have had the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  I am delighted that so many people are speaking on the Bill.  I hope the Minister will take cognisance of the points I have raised.  I look forward to this election.  I will not be trying very hard to be a candidate but I will work hard to ensure the success of the election.</P>

      <P>Like other speakers I congratulate the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary on their appointments and I wish them well in their work which is of vital importance to the projection of our Irish image.  I am glad to see the Minister has been creating a very good impression in European circles.  The Minister and other speakers laid stress on the importance of having a very big turn out for the European election. It is vitally important to ensure that there is a very large turn out in the election if we are to live up to the very high vote for entry into Europe. We must use every means at our disposal to ensure that we have that turn out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and I look forward to its enactment with the least <Col N="1314" /> possible delay.  Judging by the general agreement among all parties and among all members of the House it appears that it will go through without any real delay.  With the implementation of direct elections to the European Parliament, for the first time the people of Ireland will be able to identify closely with European affairs and institutions.  They will be able to get first hand information from their elected representatives from each area, information which now appears to be almost classified as secret despite all the publicity given to Europe and European affairs.</P>
    <P>Because of the lack of information, in Mayo we have lost a great deal of financial help for various schemes. Our own county manager had to go to Europe to find out the various grants and aids which were available.  It was only then that the flow of assistance came to us from various schemes which should have been coming to us for three or four years.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill is an indication of our determination to be full and true Europeans while, at the same time, conscious of our own traditions and nationalism.  We hope all&mdash;and I stress all&mdash;the other members will be ready to hold their elections in 1978 and that petty nationalism by any member will not prevent the early holding of direct elections.</P>
    <P>This is an historic Bill in that it is the first constituency Bill introduced with constituency recommendation from an independent commission.  I congratulate the commission on the expedition with which they delivered the goods, so to speak, and made their recommendations.  We find ourselves in the Connacht-Ulster constituency grouped with people who have diffferent backgrounds.</P>
    <P>Many of them will not know the different candidates.  Deputy White felt it was wrong that the constituencies were chosen on a population basis.  Those living in western areas felt that for some time.  Fianna Fáil tried hard&mdash;in retrospect we were probably wrong to have tried at the time if one is to judge by the subsequent results&mdash;to get representation in western areas increased in the last redrawing <Col N="1315" /> of constituencies.  We would welcome a commission.  In so far as western areas are concerned smaller constituencies with fewer representatives than originally proposed would suit.</P>
    <P>Unlike Deputy Enright, I view the insistence on a large deposit as being indicative of the importance of the occasion.  While £1,000 is a lot of money it should be remembered that our first direct elections to the European Parliament will be important and only those with a reasonable chance of success should put their names forward.  Deputy Enright suggested that we should have just one constituency for the country and he put up a good case for minority groupings.  However, if we had one single constituency the areas with the greatest population would get the greatest number of seats.  If we are to identify with Europe we must hold our elections on a regional basis, as proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>For Dáil elections many people, through no fault of their own, are defranchised. Commercial travellers and those working away from home do not vote because they cannot make the long journey home before polling stations close.  The Minister should look at that situation now, particularly since this is the first occasion we will have direct elections to the European Parliament.  It has often been stated that returns from some constituencies were low but if we took into account the number of people who were anxious to vote but could not rather than the number on the register the percentage would be much higher.  I hope the Minister will reintroduce the postal vote for those in hospitals, those genuinely ill at home and those who work a long distance from their polling booths.  We can introduce safeguards against abuses.  In a small area in my constituency 30 people were absent for the last election through no fault of their own.  I accept that the system I suggested could be abused but in my view it would be worth the risk to ensure that those who are genuinely entitled to vote have the opportunity of doing so.  The existing <Col N="1316" /> rules were laid down when the work patterns of people were different.  Because of the number of people involved it is essential that the Minister amend section 5.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright also spoke of the need for Irish representatives when elected to the European Parliament to forget that they are members of political parties at home and unite on matters that affect Ireland.  In my view that is generally the case and I believe it will continue to be so.  However, occasions will arise when their membership of the various European groupings will lead them to vote against one another.  It should be stressed that on certain occasions they should vote as representatives of the Irish people and not as members of the various political groupings in Europe. The Bill also provides that the result of an election may be questioned by way of petition procedures similar to that applying in Dáil and local government elections.  I have had experience of being involved in one of these and it is my view that such problems are only sorted out from one election to the other.  I do not know if there is any real strength in the petition procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I thanked the education spokesman of the Labour Party for his good wishes, I also thanked Deputy Keating for his good wishes.  It is, of course, a very popular kind of motion which was introduced by Deputy Horgan and subscribed to by members of the Labour Party. I notice that the Fine Gael spokesman on education did not subscribe to this motion.  It has always been a popular <Col N="1317" /> thing to talk about the &ldquo;poor scholar&rdquo;.  An old Irish stanza of four lines reads:</P>
      <P>A mbeith i mbrataibh loma</P>
      <P>Ní náir do mhacaibh foghluma</P>
      <P>Buille ar meath ní náir do neach</P>
      <P>Ach a dhán a bheith ar biseach.</P>
      <P>No shame to students to be poorly clad; no shame provided they are furthering their fate and improving their lot.  During the period of rule of the Coalition Government their &ldquo;brataibh loma&rdquo; was no concern of anybody apparently.</P>
      <P>This is an important subject for debate and I have never ceased to say since I came into this House that subsidising education at all levels, having it adequately financed at all levels, is not merely an educational exercise but a most important social exercise as well.  There is in our community no other way to social mobility, no other way where the poor man's son may make his way, walk tall and be as good as those who have wealth, inherited or acquired.</P>
      <P>We could broaden the subject of debate here.  Deputy Keating who, as I said, approached this subject humanely and was allowed wander considerably from the theme, mentioned other possible methods of financing third level education, including loan finance.  This debate is about the level of grants and eligibility limits. Last February I put down a motion practically in the same words.  I said at that time that the philosophic motivation was that of providing equal educational opportunity for all.  I said also that throughout the world the idea of providing equal opportunity for all citizens in all states has taken firm root.  I said too, that this was partly due to the influence of socialist thinking, although higher education seems to be available to more people in the classic capitalist country of the United States than in the Soviet Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Be that as it may, it is generally accepted that it is a poor state that does not provide equal opportunity for all its citizens and does not remove this anomaly of a person because of his lack of means not being able to avail of education to the highest possible <Col N="1318" /> level.  Having been motivated by that principle with regard to secondary education, in 1968 Fianna Fáil introduced the third level scheme so that ability and intelligence could be exploited and could proceed to third level education.  At that time the standard for the grants was laid down and was criticised as being particularly high, in a way above the level demanded for entrance to the university itself.  Since then the two standards have been drawing closer and very shortly they will be equalised.</P>
    <P>The 1968 pioneering effort was a success.  All we have to do is look at the figures which started at 1,119 in 1968-69 and have progressed to 2,348, 3,662, 4,333, 4,954, 5,454, 5,942 and 6,168.  In 1976-77 there were 6,108. The significant thing about that figure is that it was the first to show a decrease since the plan was introduced. The people who must bear the responsibility for that reduction are the members of the former Government and in particular the members of the Labour Party who are supposed to be supporting the underprivileged in our society.</P>
    <P>Between 1968-72 we had inflation&mdash;nothing like the mad gallop from 1973-77; it was a low inflation compared with what we had to suffer between 1973-77.  Yet those bad old boys, the soldiers of destiny, the fellows who are supposed to be representing the privileged classes, adjusted the grants and the eligibility limits.  Fees were raised in 1971-72.  A distinction was made in 1972-73 between fees and maintenance.  In 1972-73 these wicked old fellows who were being maligned by the socialists of the sixties made a one-third adjustment upwards of those grants.  These are facts I call to the attention of Deputy Horgan who put down this motion.</P>
    <P>Compare the period 1968-72 with the period 1973-77.  No&mdash;repeat no&mdash;adjustment in eligibility limits, none whatsoever, despite the fact that inflation raged during that period. Everybody knows that is a fact.  There was one small adjustment in the actual grant.  Did we hear a squeak out of the Labour Party?  Not at all.  In <Col N="1319" /> February, 1977, I put down a motion to give them a chance to show their mettle.  I did not see them at all.  They were not here.  I know Deputy Horgan was then Senator Horgan and was in the rarefied atmosphere of the Seanad looking at the lovely stucco work and swimming in a luxuriant sea of liberalism with Senator Mary Robinson, all swimming steadily for the one shore.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is praising the beautiful stucco work and the liberalism of the upper House.  I am just saying that at that time Senator Horgan, as he was then, was there. I searched the records of the Seanad in vain for a motion about grants. There was no mention of grants.  There was a creditable motion on adult education, but not a word about the poor old students and their grants that suddenly become his concern when he arrives in the lower House. Nobody came in here to support poor old Deputy Barry, then Minister for Education.  I looked around in vain. Deputy Barry Desmond was sulking somewhere.  It is no wonder that Deputy Noel Browne is smoulderingly sorrowful about what has happened to the Labour Party.  At that time Senator Horgan was independent, he could not say it was the Whip who was keeping him from putting down a motion.  He had a good motion down on adult education but he had no motion in relation to grants.  Then there was an announcement from the Minister, Deputy Richard Burke, that there was going to be a fundamental review of the grants.  &ldquo;Fundamental&rdquo; was used to give the idea of depth.  They went down deeper, stayed down longer and came up muddier than any other reviewers I know of.  This review should have taken three weeks at the most. The grants when increased were to apply in 1977.  That was the general election year, and lo and behold, on 25th May we had something from the Minister for Education.  On 26th May the Fianna Fáil manifesto, a very <Col N="1320" /> important document, was published. This was referred to by the proposer of this motion and by Deputy Keating. I have no fault with a fundamental review provided it is not a stunt for delaying action and provided that it is not an effort to put things on the long finger.  On 25th May improvements in the scheme were introduced but they were to refer to 1977-1978.  Last night Deputy Horgan was careful to remind me that the Fianna Fáil manifesto was published on 26th May, subsequent to 25th May.  My motion of February, 1977 begot the 25th May scheme in a sense.  Last night I was accused of being vociferous in this cause, of bitching about this cause, and I contend that the 25th May was a pup out of my bitch, but there were other factors involved as well.  Because the general election was around the corner and the students were fed up waiting, the document was produced to satisfy them after a long delay.  I called upon the Labour Party, the party that invokes the name of James Connolly, to support me last February and to vote with me.  I asked them to turn up.  From 1973 to 1977 they had been kept under the Whip, and I thought that perhaps on this issue they would be serious.</P>
      <P>Under Deputy Barry Desmond they had an educational committee and they sold themselves to students as being serious in the cause of education. What measures did they take?  What motions did they put down?  What new face did they show to the Government with regard to grants or eligibility limits?  None whatsoever.  Deputy Keating last night talked about the Fianna Fáil election manifesto as possibly being an albatross around my neck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ancient Mariner shot an albatross and thought that all his bad luck could be traced back to that accident. It was what happened to his mind when he shot the albatross that caused the trouble.  Had the Labour Party taken their courage in their hands and shot the albatross that was around their necks, namely Debuty Richie Ryan, then Minister for Finance, it would not have been such a bloody exercise and they would have been able to back up their own views on <Col N="1321" /> higher education.  They would have been able to achieve something.  They had the votes; they could have stopped the Minister in his tracks and told him to raise the eligibility limits for grants for working class people or that they would not vote for him. Instead they trotted faithfully behind Minister Barry at that time and defeated me on this issue.  It was not a matter of shooting the albatross in a bloody fashion, they only had to support me on this issue to bring about the desired result.</P>
    <P>This is not the only area where this Government have to put the broken pieces together, but it is important. It would be much easier for me if I had to deal only with higher education. The Department circular of 25th May, 1977, which was the result, translated into action, of the fundamental review, came unashamedly late in the day to convince anybody, let alone students.  The Union of Students in Ireland who have hammered Ministers in the past and who will probably hammer me in the future, have always been in touch on this point.  I did not go out waving banners or walking with them, as somebody asked me to do, and criticised me for not doing, and as Ministers in the former Government did when they were in Opposition, but I have been talking to the Union of Students in Ireland. They trust me and I trust them.  We will fall out, but interest, if only because it is self-interest, is far more sincere, and they are far more involved in this situation than Deputy John Horgan and other members of the Labour Party who let them down for four long years.</P>
    <P>I am also undertaking a review of the operation.  I see that Deputy Horgan does not believe in reviews, but we did not hear him criticising the last review which was started in September, 1976, and lasted until May, 1977.  This review will deal with the impact of the revised terms of eligibility by way of income and poor law valuation in the case of the students being admitted to the colleges this year.  I welcome the views being expressed by Deputies in the course of this debate in relation to their practical experience of the revised conditions of eligibility. <Col N="1322" /> It is my intention that the review should be completed as quickly as possible, so that I shall be in a position to place my recommendations in the matter before the Minister for Finance and the Government as early as possible. By &ldquo;as early as possible&rdquo; I do not mean the god of the previous Administration&mdash;the long finger.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan said that education was an important issue in the general election.  I am glad he realised that.  I hope he takes note of the result of the general election.  I do not know who told him that now; I do not know whether it was the association of Labour teachers who told him.  They had a right to come and tell the Labour Party before the general election took place but they did not do that.  Consequently, the previous Government were sent for their tea.  I am surprised that Deputy E. Collins, the spokesman for Fine Gael, is not in the House. The manifesto was published on 26th May and the then Minister for Education's announcement was made on 25th May.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan spoke last evening about the first 100 days.  I want to remind him that I have been out in Belfield, in University College, Dublin where the students are clamouring to get into the Fianna Fáil Party and they had only been back in the university for less than two weeks.  Therefore, the Deputy expects me&mdash;and I thank him for the tribute&mdash;to do in two weeks what the Government which he supported or to whose shore he swam could not do from 1973 to 1977.</P>
    <P>The first drop in the number enjoying third level grants took place in 1976-77.  That was significant and indicated what had been happening in regard to those grants because the eligibility limits had eroded the grants and so had the small figure that was being allowed.  We have to look at this scheme again, said Deputy Horgan. Now, in a Shakespeare play there are various definitions of blindness.  One that strikes the imagination is sand gravel blind.  Deputy Horgan and his colleagues must have been sand gravel blind from 1973 to 25th May, 1977. The scales fell from their eyes; the sight came back; was there a pool of <Col N="1323" /> Siloa?  There was, and it was the general election.  Down they went, got their dip, came up and now they could see much more clearly and were in to help me raise the grants for third level students.</P>
    <P>There was some criticism of Fianna Fáil for seeing third level education in terms merely of universities.  I noticed Senator Horgan, by way of Freudian slick, talked of third level universities when making his contribution.</P>

If he makes a contribution I hope his mind will not be boggling because I have been listening to the boggling of his mind for the last four or five years.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keating knocked the whole system.  He talked about elitism and said that we were compounding it by this scheme.  I do not believe that at all.  It is my desire to ensure that the people of ability, no matter what stratum of society they come from, no matter how poor their parents are, may have an opportunity of going on to third level education, whether it be to regional technical colleges, institutes of technology, the National Institute of Higher Education or universities.</P>

The present Minister's speech was neither historic nor creative.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I should like to wish the Minister every success in his Ministry and hope that he will succeed in the objectives set out in the &ldquo;Book of Genesis&rdquo; of 26th May, 1977.  Paragraph 8, page 41 of that book says and I quote:</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of associating myself with this motion.  I shall endeavour to confine my remarks to the terms of the motion although, as Deputies know, education is all-embracing, it is on-going and has a profound effect on us as individuals and collectively as a community. Consequently, it is difficult at times to adhere rigidly to the terms of the motion unless one does what <Col N="1325" /> the Minister has done&mdash;politically bashed people around for reasons best known to himself.  I think we are all agreed that education is the most important element in our survival as a nation and, in particular as a democracy. That is stating the obvious.  But, in recent times, one is tempted to say that this ideal has been lost sight of. There was a time when education was not used as a political scoring vehicle. I thought it was a problem that had been surmounted.  But having listened to the Minister's speech this evening I have lost all hope of that day approaching in the near future or even in the immediate future as the Minister for Fisheries would say. In the heat of the competition for finance that goes on within a Cabinet education is likely to come off second best.  This will happen for a very good reason&mdash;because the political advantages accruing to any Government from investment in education are long-term rather than short-term.  At a time when promises seem to be the order of the day&mdash;and seem to work with the electorate&mdash;it would be very short-sighted of the Minister to commit himself to any great degree of extra investment in education because of the demands that would be made on our finances as a result of the Fianna Fáil manifesto.</P>
      <P>The idealism which characterised the approach of Ministers and Governments has long since been abandoned and despite the hollow assertions concerning the importance of education and of treating all the children of the nation equally there are glaring inadequacies in the system. These are due mainly to lack of finance and to the fact that the idealism which was once there no longer exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to use statistics very much because they have been used by Deputy Horgan and by the Minister. The Minister mentioned that in 1971-72 the number of students availing of higher education was in the region of 4,300.  At that time the cost amounted to £1,116,314.  In 1975-76 the number of students exceeded 6,000 but the cost was more that £2,400,000.  Despite what the Minister has said, to me and to any logical <Col N="1326" /> person that is a significant increase both in terms of places made available and in terms of money.  Let nobody think that I am satisfied or that the Minister of the day was satisfied. No doubt the present Minister will find himself dissatisfied with the amount of money that will be made available to him to carry out his objectives and ideas with regard to higher education.</P>
    <P>What was needed then and what is needed now is what the Minister referred to in a jocose manner&mdash;a radical approach with regard to the whole system.  He mentioned in a very disparaging way the idea of a fundamental review.  I had hoped that tonight the Minister would give the House an indication of his intention to undertake a fundamental review of the whole system of higher education, not merely concerning grants.  For example, an area that needs scrutiny concerns the diversification of courses at third level.  The financing of higher education and the provision of equality in the system&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With due respect to him, I would say he was out of order as it was.  I am glad that the scope of higher education grants were broadened in 1974 to include technical and regional colleges.  This was a very small step in the right direction. It is my view that in the past we have been hidebound in our approach to academic-orientated education.  There was a time when that might have been a laudable objective but because of present-day pressures and our mode of life I do not think that idea can be justified any longer.  The broadening of the scheme gave to the regional and technical colleges rightful recognition of the part they were playing and rightful recognition to the students they were training.  I suggest to the Minister it would be a logical sequence to <Col N="1327" /> scrutinise the whole concept of our approach to technical education.</P>
      <P>In the past week there was created in this House a new Department concerned with planning and development. I would hope that Department, in conjunction and in consultation with the Minister for Education, would look critically at the third level education question with a view to having it play its part in the overall strategy set out in the Minister's brief.</P>

      <P>The present means levels are blatantly inadequate and that is something on which all of us agree.  There is also the practice which I regard as dubious of equating assessed income with valuation.  I realise some barometer must be found whereby farmers' incomes must be assessed but I hold that the equating of incomes of workers in the normal way with assessed incomes on rateable valuation is not just a system.  There are cases where the system is equitable, somewhere along the line the equation works out, but overall there are blatant inequalities in the system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly it is equitable at the centre but it is unequal at both ends.  That is my mathematical calculation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is inequitable in the case of people in certain parts of the country whose income is assessed on rateable valuation.  Perhaps I might give an example to the Minister.  Let us take the case of a man in Mayo or somewhere along the west coast who <Col N="1328" /> has a valuation of £40.  That is being equated with an income on the other side of the country.  The assessed income on that valuation cannot compare favourably with the income on the same valuation on land in the midlands or on the east coast and that is where the inequality arises.  The farmer in the midlands, in the south or on the east coast will gain greater financial return from land with the same valuation and in that way it is not equitable.</P>
      <P>There is also the whole question of entry into third level education being governed by the capacity of the person to pay.  Where is the equality when you have one student who must have four honours because he cannot pay and another student need only have two honours because he can pay?  The word &ldquo;scholarship&rdquo; is mentioned in relation to money given as a grant.  The word has unfortunate connotations in that context.  My interpretation of the word is that it presupposes the idea of a concession or a gift.  This money, in the context in which I am speaking, is actually the right of the student.  If we have any sense of social justice the word &ldquo;scholarship&rdquo; in this case is not appropriate.</P>
      <P>The higher education grants are not adequate.  I recall in the debate on the motion put down by the Minister last February that he instanced the cost of books, lodgings and the very meagre social life which a student could lead. He made an impassioned appeal to the Minister to have a look at the level of grants that were being made available then.  I am very disappointed that the Minister gave no indication whatever tonight what he might do.  He is the man who signs on the dotted line and he can deliver increased grants if he wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a danger that unless we keep higher educational channels open for the poor man's son and daughter it will revert to what it once was&mdash;the Minister used the word some time ago&mdash;the province of elitism because education will become so expensive that only the very few can avail of it.  In my experience on local authorities I have seen cases of students who attended university and third level institutions, like <Col N="1329" /> regional and technical colleges because they were the younger members of families of four or five whose brothers and sisters were able to help out with the extra cost involved.  In many cases it was the older brother or sister who was now helping the younger people who should have been in that third level institution, based on his or her ability and IQ.  We can ill afford the luxury of that type of wastage.  A person's entry into a third level institution should not be dictated by his or her father's ability to pay.</P>
    <P>There is a difference between what is desirable and what is possible but a genuine effort should be made to ensure that every aspirant is given the opportunity if he wishes to avail of it. There are people in different groups who probably wish that we would revert to the elitism we had in the past because they have a vested interest in perpetuating that elitist idea.</P>
    <P>Third level education at the moment is a means to an end.  In very few cases do we see third level education being availed of for the sake of the scholarship. If we are to expand industrially, if we are to have a proper approach to life in general, we must ensure that the level of grants which are made available to our youth to enter third level institutions are realistic and are capable of seeing them through.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to act quickly to ensure that the students for this year can avail of whatever increases he may be able to give.  I also suggest that he try, so far as he can, to eliminate the anomaly which now exists since the last increase was offered where the new increased rates are applied only to students who did the leaving certificate in 1977.  A father could have a son in first year in Belfield this year and a son there since last year.  The son who is now in second year cannot avail of the increased grant or possibly receives no grant at all whereas the son in first year can avail of the grant.  That grant is assessed on the same man's income. That anomaly should be eliminated if possibly.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the motion moved by Deputy Horgan. It is not a political motion, it is not designed to apportion blame on one Government rather than another, it is not one designed to embarrass.  It is simply that we are using the forum open to Opposition Deputies to bring our views to the Minister as forcibly as we can.  I hope the Minister will accept it in that light.</P>
      <P>The Local Authorities Act, 1968, which introduced the scheme of higher education grants, was welcomed by spokesmen of all parties.  Its purpose, as stated by the Minister at the time, was to divert the flow of the then existing financial provisions which county councils were making for second level scholarships and which were no longer required because of the introduction of free secondary education, to the old third level education and to provide sufficient additional money to enable in the Minister's words all students who reached certain academic standards and who satisfied the means conditions to avail of the higher reaches of education open to them.  The scheme was welcomed by everybody.  I recall at the time saying that even if it were to bring higher education to only one other student who heretofore was debarred because of the financial difficulties of his parents, it would be welcomed by me.</P>
      <P>I had no illusion that it was a scheme which would cater for all students.  Like other speakers, I voiced my reservation at the time and the first reservation was that the academic requirements varied for those who happened to have money and those who did not.  We instanced that four honours were required for a grant but two honours were required for university entrance if one had the money to pay.  I can recall saying that I thought it might level out at three honours in both cases.  I think the anomaly still exists and I do take the point that the increase in the number of points now required for university entrance has tended to narrow the gap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is still an anomaly, though <Col N="1331" /> the Minister has no personal responsibility for this, in the store set on certain subjects by the universities which makes it very difficult for people to gain entrance to university from vocational and technical schools.  The subjects which they study do not qualify for points.  The aim of the scheme was to ensure that people of inadequate means, from either the secondary or vocational stream, should be able to gain entrance.  Even today it is very difficult to gain university entrance from the vocational schools. In 1974 the scheme was broadened to include colleges of technology but there should be access from the vocational schools and this is virtually impossible.</P>
    <P>Very often it is necessary for students to repeat the leaving certificate examination and this is easily done in the family with substantial means.  This brings me to what has always been our main criticism of the scheme.  I recall saying that the system of grants being introduced would be an incentive to those who were reasonably well off, though perhaps not comfortable enough to afford a university education for their children, but it was of no use whatsoever to those at the bottom of the income scale who could not subsidise their children, people who could not forego the earnings of their sons and daughters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan made the point that this caters only for the survivors of the secondary system.  The second level system, free to a certain extent, did not benefit those children whose parents could not afford the high cost of books. It did not cater for the children of parents who, because they were deprived, could not see the value of education and would not forego the earnings of their children.  These children were left out.  The purpose of the debate is not to cover that aspect but it is worth mentioning.  It was by no means a solution regarding opportunity. If one looked at it as an instrument of social justice or as an egalitarian measure, it started in the middle. Certainly it did help to open up third level education for a great number of students with the capacity to benefit from education rather than the capacity to pay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1332" /> We had then and still have the question of income in terms of wages and salaries versus valuation.  This has never worked out as equitably as we would have wished.  Before the recent adjustment we had a situation in my own county where very few outside the agricultural community qualified for grants.  While a £60 valuation might not represent much, in some cases it represented a considerable income.  I know of people who had very considerable wealth and who had two or three children at boarding schools and perhaps one or two others at college and who seemed to be able to spend £2,000 or £3,000 annually on the education of their children.  Such people got grants while the children of ordinary industrial workers did not qualify.  I am not saying that this is so in all cases but there were glaring injustices in the scheme and there still are.</P>
    <P>The recent adjustments were overdue and they do improve the scheme, but it is still a very inadequate one. The rate of £250 for a student who is not living adjacent to a university town is inadequate.  Bed, breakfast and an evening meal for a student, not to mention a meal during the day, would cost at least £14 a week and the cost over 32 weeks would be £448.  The grant is far short of the minimum requirements.  Flats are another problem for students and those who succeed in getting flats would pay at least £6 per week.  The cost over a year would be about £192 and that amount does not include the cost of food and all the other costs of maintenance. Books for third level students very often cost between £5 and £20 each.  A subsidy from home is required if a student is to avail of third level education.</P>
    <P>Where does that leave the children of widows, unmarried mothers and deserted wives?  I know of one such student who, in order to sustain himself at college, teaches the four children of the family who maintain him. He has no wages.  He has board and lodgings and in return he teaches these four children.  He considers himself lucky to have made such an arrangement but, in fairness, this boy is not competing on fair terms with more <Col N="1333" /> fortunate people.  He is a very exceptional boy and his mother is also exceptional. There are few people who would even think in terms of third level education from their disadvantaged position.  The grant system must be sufficient to maintain the student, otherwise it will not help those who are most in need.  We want a system which will ensure that all children who can benefit from grants will do so.  This is the purpose of our motion. There is discrimination against the very poor and the under-privileged in an area where we could be of the greatest help and where discrimination can be most keenly felt and have the most far-reaching effects.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to entrance requirements for colleges of physical education.  I have a particular case in mind.  While we must insist on minimum academic standards for entry, there needs to be greater flexibility.  I instance a case where a college of physical education has been presented with a candidate of exceptional athletic qualities, a girl who has achieved success and prominence on the international scene and who would be of benefit to the country if she were allowed to train as a teacher of physical education.  It appears that she is very slightly short of the required academic qualifications and may not get through.  This is a serious loss to physical education because there are so few openings available for girls who wish to train in physical education.  It may well be that this girl will have to take up some unsuitable work when she has so much to offer in the area of physical education, which is neglected in our schools and colleges.</P>
    <P>The State's investment in education is sizeable.  It is important to have some idea of where the jobs are likely to be.  I recall that when the system was introduced the Minister said that we should plan the system on the basis of where the job requirements would be and that we should train our children towards job requirements. We should be taking practical steps towards having a community in which talent is used to the fullest extent.  To my knowledge, students are given very little guidance.  Students <Col N="1334" /> elect for a faculty from secondary schools which have no idea of their talents and which therefore cannot guide them.  Students select their faculties by sticking pins in papers. Then they enter college and stumble along without guidance.  I know that many bright students fall by the wayside because of lack of support and guidance.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the need for doing something about this matter. Students can be very lonely at college, especially in their first year and need all the help and guidance they can get.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention a problem that exists in the Cork area in regard to higher education.  I understand that Deputy Horgan referred to it briefly during his address.  In adopting the scheme for higher education grants in 1968 Cork County Council applied the higher rate, that is the rate applicable to students whose homes are not adjacent to universities.  They applied this rate to all students in the county council area.  The county council decided that none of their applicants could be deemed to be adjacent to the university within the terms of the Act.  Neither the Act nor any Department directive was specified in regard to the term &ldquo;adjacent&rdquo;.  It appeared to be a flexible term, and Cork County Council opted for a more liberal view of it.  That liberal view benefited many students who would not have been able to avail of third level education.  During the time that the grants fell so hopelessly behind the rate of inflation the Department paid the grant on that basis without question until 1975.  In 1975 the Department paid £250,000 on account, leaving the county council short of £42,275.  That money has still not been paid to the Cork County Council.</P>
    <P>In 1976 a letter was received from the Department.  It stated that the Department wished to impress upon the county council that the question of whether the normal family residence was adjacent to the college or university should be decided in the case of each successful candidate and that the lower scale should be applied in the case of every candidate who could reasonably be expected to travel daily. <Col N="1335" /> The county council considered the letter and influenced by the views expressed by its members, continued to pay the higher rate to all students. They were influenced by a number of points.  One point was that even where bus services operated the cost worked out at £140, which was the total allocated for maintenance.  Even where those bus services operated, it was found that the connecting services left many students late for their lectures. It was agreed that it would be administratively impossible, in the Cork area in particular, to ascertain who was on the bus route, where their houses were, and the hours of lectures for each student.  The hours varied for each student and varied in each faculty from year to year.  It was brought to mind that there is a need for students to return to college at night, not alone for college activities but for the practical reason that library facilities are so inadequate that it is impossible for students to avail of them during the day.  I know of a law faculty which has only one copy of a report and 70 students clamouring for it.  There is no way that a country student could get that report and still get his bus home in the evening.  The council opted for a liberal view and continued to pay the higher rate of grant but they were not paid the money due to them under the scheme for 1976, £234,284.</P>
    <P>A further £260,000 is required this year.  So far, grants have not been allocated and students have not been notified whether their grants will be allocated.  To date the county council have been penalised to the extent of half a million pounds for their enlightened attitude towards higher education. The county council have now been asked to check on all the grants allocated since 1970, to check on grants paid at the higher rate which should have been paid at the lower rate, and to recover from the students the grants which have been paid. Apart from the high cost of this and the fact that it is almost administratively impossible, it is not possible to trace the whereabouts of all the students who received grants in 1970.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1336" /> Cork County Council have asked the Minister to receive a deputation to discuss the matter.  I am asking the Minister to please accede to the request of Cork County Council.  Many students are very concerned about this matter and it is important that the matter be clarified without delay.</P>
    <P>The Minister heard the comment that his motion of May last had the effect of improving the scheme.  I trust that the motion moved by Deputy Horgan will be adopted.</P>

      <P>It is now painfully obvious that the message going out to students from this House tonight is very simple and can be summed up in three words&mdash;&ldquo;not a bob&rdquo;.  Those students who voted for Fianna Fáil, who were misguided enough to vote for them at the last election, did so because they had been promised an increase.  What they are getting is a review.  I doubt that they will be satisfied with the way they are being treated just as I doubt that this debate is the last time this particular stratagem will be used by this Government to get them out of an embarrassment, to put it mildly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, we have had a debate which was interesting and which for the most part serious.  I must make an exception, though, for the contribution earlier in the proceedings from Deputy Power.  Those who read his contribution considered it to be not much above the level of low knockabout farce which did very little for the reputation of this House, a reputation which needs all the showing up it can get.  Deputy Power's contribution in its examples and its attitudes gave the impression that what goes on here is some sort of sham fight, that we are all laughing at each other behind our sleeves and laughing also at the electorate. This is not a sham fight.  It is a very serious affair which deserves to <Col N="1337" /> be treated seriously.  The poverty of Deputy Power's arguments pointed to poverty of another kind, the poverty of resources, resources that were promised immediately in the Fianna Fáil manifesto but which, apparently, are not to be made available.</P>

      <P>The statement in the manifesto was simple.  It did not refer to reviews but to immediate increases. Ultimately the people directly concerned will be able to reply to the Government in the next general election unless they have been forced to emigrate in the meantime. From this side of the House it does not look as if the Government are going to adhere to their promise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keating made what I considered a thoughtful speech and although I might take issue with him on one or two points, in the main I could agree with him.  He was particularly good when he talked about the problem of access, a problem that is related intimately to <Col N="1338" /> the level of grants and to the eligibility criteria.  When the Minister's famous review is under way he might look again at the access situation and he might ask himself why it remains the position that so many of the subjects that are vitally necessary if Ireland's economy and agriculture is to progress and grow are still not accepted by the university for matriculation purposes. He might ask himself why a child who wishes to pursue agricultural science at the university is advised by his teachers at school not to take that subject in the leaving certificate unless he can &ldquo;twist&rdquo; a few university arms, something that I have been trying to do for a long time.</P>
    <P>I have a slight difficulty in regard to Deputy Keating's suggestion of an alternative to the present system because, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, whether money is given by way of loan or grant, in effect it is a transfer from one section of the community to another.  In so far as student grants and/or loans are concerned, it is a transfer from the general taxpaying population to that relatively small portion of the population who are enjoying third level education. We should be very careful when we are looking at the circumstances of that transfer in order to ensure that it is going in the right direction, that it is not a transfer to people who, fundamentally, do not need the money and who, perhaps, can afford to pay anyway.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves whether it is a transfer to people who could not afford higher education without this aid and who, therefore, need it on a grant basis.  The other main difficulty about loans is that effectively there is no way of ensuring that they will be repaid.  There is in progress in the Netherlands a major political row about this issue where a similar scheme has run into extremely heavy weather.  By and large, I think it is the experience that loan finance tends to produce rather more problems than it solves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating made a good point when he talked about the under-utilisation of some of the other educational <Col N="1339" /> resources, noticeably the buildings, the physical plant of many of our third level institutions.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to the Minister's contribution and before making any comment on his remarks I should like to let him know, given that he made two specific references to the absence in this House of the Education spokesman for Fine Gael, Deputy Edward Collins, that the Deputy is in Lisbon as a delegate from this country to a Council of Europe meeting.  I am sure the Minister would not want it to be thought that there was any inference in his remarks that Deputy Collins was absent from this Chamber during this debate for any less worthy reason.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time, I must confess that while the Minister's kind words about myself and about the Labour Party were rolling thunderously past my ears, I began to be suspicious of his goodwill.  The Minister gave so much advice to the Labour Party that the innocent observer or our friends in the Press gallery might be forgiven for assuming that the Minister's kind concern was the welfare of this party, that his sole desire was to see our party in its rightful place as the sole party in Government. However, those of us who know the Minister will be aware that his main concern is nothing of the sort, that it is basically the welfare of Fianna Fáil. That is a legitimate concern, too.  I do not think anybody will be taken in by the Minister's mock turtle words about our policies and our attitudes.  At the beginning of his speech he sought to discern in my remarks a belief which I would not dare to express, that Fianna Fáil were the only party who had ever made any real progress in the sphere of education.  I do not believe anything of the sort.  It is true that Fianna Fáil have occasionally discerned some of the problems.  It is also true that they have always failed to apply radical solutions because they never have been and never will be a radical party.  Worse than that, having <Col N="1340" /> applied half measures at best&mdash;usually quarter measures&mdash;to serious problems which needed fundamental and radical solutions, they have passed on leaving the entire problem to be solved and left the situation almost as bad as when they found it and in some respects even worse.  They will attempt to persuade people, their own supporters in particular, that this problem no longer exists.  They are experts at devising the shadow of a policy.  There is rarely enough substance in it to make it worthwhile.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke of the fact that the two standards for eligibility were now drawing closer together and would eventually coincide.  This is a classic example of the kind of thing I have been talking about.  Apparently he does not mind how many people suffer in the meantime, how many people have to do without the grants or how many people fall into this poverty gap, as long as the two standards coincide eventually, as of course they will.  Here again is the key to the policy of equity expediency. Basically of course it is financial expediency as well.  I have already given my opinion of the Minister's under-taking to get a review.  I am interested that as part of this review he is apparently going to ask the students how they feel like living on the present grant and eligibility levels.  If we are to believe him, the students have already told us how they feel by voting him and his party into Government; they believed, apparently, that in doing this all their problems would be solved.</P>

      <P>I beg leave to doubt that.  I suspect there is a great measure of suspicion outside this House also. I am being as charitable as I can when I say that it is not entirely impossible that the famous increase which was promised, and which will of course come, may not arrive before the next academic year, at which point the Government, being a year-and-a-half in office, may be half-way through their term in office.  If that is the case, as a definition of &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; it stretches our credibility more than somewhat.  If <Col N="1341" /> we are going to have the decisions earlier as a result of this motion, so much the better, but I would be very surprised if that were the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of capital has been made in the last few hours of this debate about the attitude of this party and some of its Members to this problem during the period of the last Government.  This must be faced and tackled because it involves the credibility of all of us as Members of this House and as public representatives.  The Minister, when he abandons his mask of faked concern, will know very well that when we talk about grants we are talking about the allocation of resources.  As a Member of the Government he will also know that resources are allocated within Governments as a result of political decisions.  He will know that the decisions about the raising or not raising the grant levels during the period of the last Government were political decisions, but they were taken by a Government of which this party was a member.  What came out of the general election among other things was apparently a verdict by the electorate that those decisions were at least in part wrong.  However, the electorate did not make that decision in a vacuum or without comparing what we had done with what else was promised.  They <Col N="1342" /> made it in the context of a general election campaign, specifically of a Fianna Fáil manifesto with Fianna Fáil specific principles.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is not merely legitimate but absolutely essential for us to put down this motion to test the accuracy and truth behind those statements here tonight.  Just as the electorate put the Fianna Fáil Party in, misguidedly as we may or may not think, to perform this great graft of promises, so also they put us in to make sure in so far as we can that the Government matched up to their promises.  Because of the voting strength of the parties in this House we are ultimately powerless to force them to do something they do not want to do whether they promised to do it or not, but we are not powerless to expose failure to match up to promises.  I believe that is what we have done tonight.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party to accept the motion.</P>

      <P>In all essential details the powers of control over animal imports provided for in the British legislation referred to, which is largely a consolidating measure, already exist here by virtue of our Diseases of Animals Act, 1966 (No. 6 of 1966) and orders made thereunder, particularly the Importation of Livestock Order, 1970 (S.I. No. 296 of 1970) and the Rabies (Importation, Landing and Movement of Animals) Orders, 1972 and 1976 (S.I. Nos. 16 of 1972 and 95 of 1976).  Some points of difference do exist between the British legislation and ours but they mainly reflect the different patterns of import of animals which occur in the two countries.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that any need exists for the introduction of new legislation of this kind here, but if the Deputy is concerned about any particular aspect of this matter and indicates to me what it is I shall be happy to have the question further examined.</P>
