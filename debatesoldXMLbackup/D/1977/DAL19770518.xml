    <Title>National Agricultural Advisory, Education and Research Authority Bill, 1976: From The Seanad.</Title>
    <P>The Dáil went into Committee to consider amendments from the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Clinton) Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Clinton)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps amendments Nos. 1 to 5 could be taken together.  I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Title: In page 4, lines 11 and 12, Long Title, &ldquo;Advisory, Education and Research&rdquo; deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1011" /> These amendments arise from the change of the title of the authority to be set up under the Bill.  It will now be known as the National Agricultural Authority.  During the debate in the Seanad various suggestions were made from all sides of the House about alternative titles for the new body. Although Senators had differing ideas what the new title should be, all were agreed that the National Agricultural Advisory, Education and Research Authority was unwieldly and unmanageable. When introducing these amendments in the Seanad I said that I was never very happy with the name originally proposed.  However, the House will agree that the position has now been rectified.  I am sure the new title will be readily recognised and quickly established as a by-word among the farming community.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested also that the title of the Agricultural Institute, An Foras Talúntais, since it is already firmly established and widely acknowledged, would be a suitable name, but it would not at all of course describe the new authority which is an all embracing one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the title he suggests has the merit of brevity but I would not say it has the merit of accuracy.  While it is a good thing to change the outlandish and ridiculous original title the organisation had, the National Agricultural Advisory, Education and Research Authority&mdash;it would take too long to say that the corn would be overripe and everything out of control before that title could be said&mdash;I must express a fear that I think will be felt by more people than myself that the very implication of the new title, the National Agricultural Authority, against the structure of chairman and board that the Minister has adumbrated in his Bill looks very like the concentration of too much power in the hands of the person who will be appointed by the Minister.  Everybody has a fairly good idea who that person will be, this pocket Hitler.  I am anxious and worried about the concentration of too much power in that <Col N="1012" /> person's hands.  The Minister for Agriculture, whoever he may be, has to be elected by the people; he is acting on behalf of a Government and he has the authority of suffrage.  With regard to the appointee of the Minister, some people would say that the <i>eminence grise</i> behind the Minister has no such authority at all nor can it be easily dismissed.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I am concerned that the area the Deputy is now entering into seems to be quite unrelated to a change in the title of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir, the implications of the new title must make one think.  For instance, consider the use of the word &ldquo;authority&rdquo; in the new title, and remember that this authority is vested in one person who is the nominee of the Minister.  I merely want to warn the Minister that this would be the feeling of the farming community.  The Minister would be unaware of this feeling, having no connection with the agricultural industry, but I want to tell him that it exists.  It is hardly worth the Minister's while because we will be changing the Bill now before the House in a very short time.  We are not going to oppose the change in title.</P>

      <P>Section 65: In page 26, line 25, &ldquo;and following consultation with the recognised staff associations and trade unions concerned&rdquo; inserted after &ldquo;section 34&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment obliges the board to consult with representatives of the staff concerned prior to any transfers being made.  This provision simply binds the board to a procedure which I am sure they would have adopted in any case but, in response to requests from some of the staff to be transferred, I agreed to take this condition and make it more explicit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recall that when the Committee Stage was before the House I pointed out the obvious shortcomings of section 26. I reminded the Minister of the widely expressed fear of people, especially those in the Agriculture Institute, of unfair treatment and victimisation under the Department's scheme.  It has been hatching in certain parts of the Department for the last two decades and has now come to fruition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the provision the Minister is introducing now is sufficient to protect the interests of the people working for the new authority. We have had enough examples of discrimination against people in certain areas in the sector covered by the new authority to be anxious and worried that with the new political shape the National Agricultural Authority is taking on almost certainly there will be <Col N="1014" /> discrimination and people discriminated against will have no proper court of appeal.</P>
    <P>The entire agricultural advisory and research establishment of the country is being put on a political basis by the Minister and the redress that people working in the service must have is not adequate.  If the Minister had the vision, the generosity and fairness of mind during Committee Stage to accept our amendment to delete section 26 altogether he would have a better Bill.  It would not be a great deal better because any Bill that embodies the demolition of one of the finest research establishments in Europe must be a bad Bill but within the context of the destructive design behind the Bill the interest of the people in the service generally should be protected as much as possible.  That is not being done.  The amendment proposed by the Minister goes some little way but not nearly far enough.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Minister straight and fair that there is a great deal of anxiety throughout the length and breadth of the new service, or what is about to be the new service for a short time, about the new political structure of the National Agricultural Authority.  People are worried about their jobs and their prospects of getting jobs if their political allegiance is not to the liking of those in charge. That is what the Minister is doing now. It was the basic idea behind the Bill because nowhere in it is there any suggestion that the service will be improved.  There is no guarantee that the number of advisers will be increased. There is no promise of any improvement; in fact, in one section of the Bill there is an undertaking which is unprecedented, namely, that the service will not get any worse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the job prospects and security of people who will be working for the new service.  I am telling the House that there is grave anxiety throughout the service itself.  There is also grave anxiety that people who would like to work in the service, for instance <Col N="1015" /> young graduates, will be discriminated against on a political basis.  There are enough examples in the record of the present Government to show that this is a legitimate and well-founded fear and it is not in any way sufficiently relieved by the Minister's amendment. I will not oppose the amendment because it makes a gesture but it is only a gesture.  This Bill will be the most short-lived Bill that ever had anything to do with agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kelly) Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kelly)">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1016" /> That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Fifth International Tin Agreement, signed by Ireland on 28th April, 1976, which has been laid before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>With the Dáil's permission I will also be moving motions seeking Dáil approval of the terms of two further international commodity agreements, the International Coffee Agreement, 1976, and the International Cocoa Agreement, 1975.  Dáil approval of the terms of the agreements is necessary before Ireland can proceed with ratification.  It is necessary under Article 29.5.2º of the Constitution which stipulates that &ldquo;the State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.  In the case of these agreements the charge on public funds is in respect of Ireland's contribution to the cost of administering the agreements. Ireland's contributions for the year 1976-77 amount to a total of about £10,700.</P>
    <P>The three international commodity agreements which are before the Dáil are striking examples of continuity in that they are successors to earlier agreements covering the same commodities. The tin agreement before the Dáil is, in fact, the fifth of its kind; the first was negotiated as long ago as 1956.  The coffee agreement is the third of its kind; two earlier coffee agreements were negotiated in 1962 and 1968.  The cocoa agreement is a successor to the first international cocoa agreement which came into force in 1972.</P>
    <P>It would, however, be wrong to see the agreements as being simple renewals of their predecessors.  There are a number of modifications in the substantive provisions of the three agreements.  These, in fact, reflect the influence on the negotiators of the ongoing debate on economic relationships between developed and developing countries.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising that, in the context of this debate, the developing countries place great emphasis on the need to change the structure of trade in raw materials.  Their high dependence on commodity exports for foreign <Col N="1017" /> exchange earnings and the notorious instability of commodity markets which inhibits long term investment help to explain their preoccupation.</P>
    <P>The basic aim of the three agreements which are before the Dáil today is to prevent excessive fluctuations in the price of the commodities in question. Each of the agreements employs different mechanisms to achieve this aim.</P>
    <P>We must recognise, however, that, whatever the mechanisms employed, there can be exceptional circumstances in which a commodity agreement can be inadequate to deal with the problems of the market.  For example, the coffee agreement is quite clearly not equipped to deal with the present rising price of coffee.  It is doubtful whether any agreement could provide adequately for eventualities such as the 1975 frost in Brazil, which severely affected the output of the world's largest coffee producer.  We are all aware of the unprecedented increases in coffee prices which have resulted. Agreements designed to cope with all eventualities are not economically feasible. The best we can hope for is a system which will reduce the uncertainties of a normal commodity market.</P>
    <P>Explanatory memoranda on the three agreements have been prepared and are available to Deputies.  These give a detailed account of the provisions of the individual agreements and cover the question of the costs involved in Irish participation in them.  I propose to confine myself to making some general remarks on the three agreements.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that the present tin agreement is the fifth agreement of its kind.  Each has been of five years' duration and all have been negotiated under the auspices of the United Nations. The International Tin Agreement has the distinction of being one of the oldest commodity agreements in continuous existence and it is the only international agreement covering a major metal commodity.  Throughout its existence it has served as a model of producer/consumer co-operation in the field of commodities.  However, the present agreement has not yet entered definitively into force.  This is due to the fact that Bolivia&mdash;one of the principal <Col N="1018" /> tin exporters&mdash;has delayed ratification. The latest information available suggests, however, that Bolivia will now ratify the agreement in the near future and thereby ensure its definitive entry into force.</P>
    <P>The main operational mechanisms are the use of a buffer stock and the application of export controls when necessary in order to adjust supply to demand.  The operation of the buffer stock is related to floor and ceiling prices which are fixed at intervals within the Council by majority vote, or much more frequently by consensus, taking into account market conditions and production costs.</P>
    <P>Tin is not produced in Ireland and Irish consumption of tin is the lowest of those states subscribing to the International Tin Agreement.  However, the availability of tin and materials containing tin is important to Irish manufacturing industry, particularly to the can making and canning industry.</P>
    <P>While many of the provisions of the 1976 coffee agreement are similar to those of its two predecessors, its emphasis has been changed.  The new agreement is designed to deal more effectively with the complex trade relationships between developed and developing countries.  To this end the agreement provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for a mechanism for the establishment of price ranges and price differentials for the principal types of coffee, a system of export quotas and a price mechanism for the adjustment of quotas.</P>
    <P>The International Coffee Agreement would have implications for the Irish coffee processing industry whether or not we adhered to the agreement because about 98 per cent of the world's exports of coffee will be controlled by the new agreement.</P>
    <P>The 1975 International Cocoa Agreement is, like its predecessor, based on a dual intervention mechanism for stabilising prices within a fixed range, that is, an export quota system, subject to adjustment, to maintain cocoa bean prices within the price range and complemented for this purpose by a buffer stock with a maximum size of 250,000 tonnes of cocoa beans.  The buffer stock is financed by means of <Col N="1019" /> a small levy on cocoa beans, and, proportionally, on other products, payable on first export from a member country or first import by a member country from a non-member country.</P>
    <P>The Irish cocoa and chocolate industry use a significant amount of cocoa beans for the home and export trade and generally imports its requirements from producing countries in Africa.  The substantial increase in cocoa bean prices over the last 3 or 4 years, especially in the past year, has been a source of concern to the Irish industry and its counterparts in other countries.  Adverse weather conditions and crop disease have been major contributory factors to the shortage of cocoa supplies and consequently to high prices.  Market prices for cocoa beans are still considerably above the maximum of the price range in the 1975 cocoa agreement and, as in the case of the 1972 cocoa agreement, this has resulted in a situation where certain important mechanisms of the agreement, such as the export quota and buffer stock systems, are not yet operative.</P>
    <P>These three agreements&mdash;on tin, coffee and cocoa&mdash;are going to influence our trade in these commodities whether or not we adhere to the agreements.  By becoming party to the agreements, however, we are enabled to participate in the decisions made and to influence them.  In addition, the adherence of all the member states of the Community is necessary if the Community, as such, is to participate fully in the agreements. Thirdly, and also of importance, is the fact that through participation in the agreements Ireland can demonstrate its readiness to co-operate with commodity exporting developing countries within commodity agreements. This is of particular significance at the present time in view of the developing countries' preoccupation with the establishment of an Integrated Programme for Commodities.  I commend the motions to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is very much in line with other motions we have been dealing with recently.  The last one dealt with the programmes <Col N="1020" /> for food development projects in the developing countries.  We are concerned in these motions, as we were in that agreement, with establishing a better order of market arrangements between the producer countries and the consumer countries.  These motions indicate fairly clearly, first of all, the increasing dependence of the consumer countries on the developing countries for what are for many of us our basic commodities, coffee, cocoa, tin, and tea also.  It shows&mdash;I have been saying this for a long time and there is agreement on both sides of the House&mdash;the dependence of the developed world on the developing world which to a considerable extent, is being highlighted every day.  The need to have new and acceptable market arrangements between the producer and the consumer countries, which basically correspond to the developing and the developed world, is absolutely essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To that extent, therefore, I support both the intention and the content of these three agreements.  This side of the House will support their being put into effect without delay.  It is important, though, that we should consider the overall position when giving effect to these international agreements.  Within each of the producing countries there have been climatic conditions that have brought about a decline in the production of coffee or cocoa and leading to a world shortage which, consequently, has led to increases in the world prices for these commodities. That is one element of the situation but when, on the other hand, we have regard to what is happening in the agricultural countries, our own included, of the developed world, we realise that there is a fall-off in overall production in that area.  Obviously, there is a need to consider the whole question of our economic programming and development with special reference to the agricultural food producing sector in order to ensure that we produce to the greatest extent possible on our own capacity and also that we would endeavour in some way to direct or modify the eating habits of our people in order to take account of the commodities that are increasing <Col N="1021" /> continually in price.  In other words, we should encourage the consumers to rely more on native produce.</P>

      <P>The founder of the Deputy's party was on the same line about 40 years ago when, for the same reasons, he suggested that we drink light ale for breakfast instead of tea. The difference then was that he, and not the producers, had caused the adverse conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the distinguished founder of this party made that statement 40 years ago confirms me in my expression of that view now, not to the exclusion of imports from other countries but to highlight the situation.  The Parliamentary Secretary must recognise that there is a fall-off in food production at home.  This trend is regrettable.  We must do everything possible to encourage increased food production because should we become a consumer as opposed to a producing country, we would be in real trouble, as these agreements indicate clearly.</P>
      <P>The agricultural Bill which has just been concluded can do a lot not only to change the nature of our agricultural production but to influence our people to consume more native products rather than imported produce. At the same time, it is important that, in so far as we need an established world order which can be maintained and promoted in the interests both of the producer and consumer countries, such order would be effected through agreements of this nature, agreements which, as the Parliamentary Secretary has said, are successors to original agreements which, generally, have been effective.  However, there are some hidden factors that are not covered by this agreement.  For instance, in regard to coffee the Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
      <P>For example, the coffee agreement is quite clearly not equipped to deal with the present rising price of coffee.  It is doubtful whether any agreement could provide adequately for eventualities such as the 1975 frost in Brazil, which severely affected the output of the world's largest coffee producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1022" /> That seems to relate the increase in the price of coffee very significantly to the 1975 frost in Brazil.  It is a simple enough relationship of cause and effect. However, when we look at the objectives of the agreement we find that somewhere between those objectives and the Parliamentary Secretary's statement there seems to have been some change because in the explanatory memorandum circulated we read that the general objectives of this agreement are to help us to arrive at economic provisions designed mainly to secure adequate supplies of coffee to consumers at fair prices and to secure markets for coffee at remunerative prices for producers.</P>
    <P>That is not consistent with what the Parliamentary Secretary has said here. The explanatory memorandum goes on to refer to the avoidance of excessive fluctuations in the level of world supplies which are harmful both to consumers and producers.  It says that the aim of the agreement is to produce and increase the consumption of coffee by every possible means and to further international co-operation in connection with world coffee problems in recognition of the relationship of the trade in coffee with the economic stability of markets for industrial products. In other words, it attempts to achieve what the Parliamentary Secretary says cannot be achieved.  This is why I refer to hidden factors.  During the past three years, for instance, the retail price of eight ounces of coffee has increased from about 80 pence to £2.10 or almost 300 per cent.  Can all of that increase be related directly to increasing prices to the producer in Brazil?  Are the producers there receiving almost three times as much for their coffee as they were getting three years ago?  They are not receiving any such increase.</P>
    <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary says that this agreement cannot maintain or control the price of coffee I agree to the extent that the market arrangements in the consumer countries are such as to prevent us, perhaps, from controlling the spiralling prices of coffee.  What control have we in regard to the processing industry?  Can we relate the entire increase simply to <Col N="1023" /> climatic conditions in Brazil in 1975 and then imply that that was where it all started?  Similarly, in relation to the increases we have experienced in petrol prices, we cannot place all the blame on the Arabs because while their contribution to the increase was small, the Government were responsible for by far the greatest proportion of the increase and this has been responsible in turn for the inflation that followed.</P>
    <P>Therefore, to the extent that the agreement we are discussing is not directed to the middleman, it cannot achieve what the Parliamentary Secretary claims it can achieve&mdash;regulate effectively the price of coffee to the consumer which, in effect, is what we are concerned with in the final analysis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the price of coffee has increased it is still far cheaper here than it is, for instance, in Germany, where one will not get a cup of coffee in an ordinary cafe for less than 50 pence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two reasons for that.  First, the standard of living and the wage structure in Germany are much higher than they are here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is because coffee and tea are placed in the luxury groups there and, consequently, carry luxury tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but one cannot compare the consumer price of coffee, tea, whiskey, brandy or anything else in Germany with the situation at home because the consumer in Germany in paying for these commodities is, in effect, paying mostly his tax because of the indirect taxation system in operation in that country as opposed to the system of direct and indirect taxation here.  The level of direct taxation in any of the EEC countries is much lower than it is here so that when continentals pay for their coffee they are, in effect, paying their income tax also.  We are not really comparing like with like and all this nonsense of comparing prices in <Col N="1024" /> Ireland with France and so on does not tell the full story.  The countries in Europe have a much greater tradition of coffee consumption than we have.  We are gradually catching up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That should tend to push the price down rather than up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so if there is a greater demand between them and the other countries.  I am not saying that this is a question of market supply, but with the tendency towards increasing coffee consumption here it is vitally important that we would, in so far as we can through the European Community and the agency of an international agreement, try to get what the Parliamentary Secretary says we cannot really get.  Suppose that next year is a good year in Brazil, can we expect a reduction?  I do not suppose we can. It would be unfair to the producer countries to say that they have been the cause of the increase.  They have not to that extent.</P>
      <P>What is true of coffee is also true of cocoa.  Again we find that it is mainly the less developed countries who are the main producers of cocoa and we have to expect that at some stage inevitably, having regard to the imbalance which exists between their economies and the developed economies, they were going to try to rectify this imbalance, and understandably.</P>
      <P>What is being attempted in these agreements is to co-ordinate consumer need with producer capacity and to ensure that there will be justice and fair play for both sides.  We have seen a huge increase in the price of cocoa in the last two or three years, perhaps not to the same extent as with coffee. Again there may be some good reason for looking at the marketing and processing of coffee and cocoa as distinct from the production.  It is the middle stage that we have to examine in order to see to what extent the big international interests are getting a big cut before the product reaches the table of the consumer.  This is a real problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is it that we are only now getting these agreements?  In each case they were ratified in 1975.  If we want to give effect to what these agreements represent so that we can have a binding <Col N="1025" /> commitment between the producer countries&mdash;I do not know what votes we have, but we have votes&mdash;surely it would have been desirable to introduce these proposals before the House 12 months ago when they would have met the same ready response as they are going to get now.  The need would not have seemed to have been as great 12 months ago as obviously it is at the moment with the huge increases in the three areas concerned.  Could I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to explain why there is not a similar agreement for tea, or if there were what effect it would have?  This is the commodity we consume probably more than any other of these beverages.  Tea has increased in price over 100 per cent in three years.  We as a consumer of these commodities, and of tea in particular, are going to suffer unless we can look to international arrangements to control these price increases to some extent, unless we can gear our own agricultural products and our own drinking habits to ensure that our balance of trade apart from anything else will not be upset.</P>
    <P>Regarding the balance of trade, irrespective of the optimistic forecasts which may be made, figures for the early months of this year, for January and March in particular, indicate that this nation is becoming a consumer nation.  Our balance of trade is widening all the time and our consumers must become aware that this trend must not continue.  We are ignoring some obvious realities.  This again is where an increase in our native production must be encouraged and if possible there should also be warning signs with regard to increases in the import of consumer goods.</P>
    <P>The tin agreement would not seem to be directly of concern to us to the same extent as the coffee and cocoa agreements.  Bolivia, which I recall from my school days is the biggest tin producer in the world, has not yet ratified this stage of the agreement. I want to know the reason for that, the effect of it, and to what extent this agreement has any reality without the concurrence and support of Bolivia for what it is intended to do.  While we might not seem to be a big consumer of tin, every day all of us meet <Col N="1026" /> with new forms of packaging and processing and new drives for hygiene. If we look at any of our stores or supermarkets we see that tin does play a big part in our economy to the extent that we are importers of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary tell me why we have not had it before the House before now?  If there is any hope that a similar agreement for tea and the related beverages could be made between the producer and consumer countries we should make proposals that the European Community, speaking of the European Community as a group, should make arrangements to try to get to the real cause of the huge increases in each of these matters, namely the distributing and processing industry as distinct from the producers. It is the only way we can guarantee that the huge increases in these areas will not continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To the extent that any agreement we reach here will be effective then it has our support.  I note that the cost to us of signing and approving these agreements is something notional; it is a matter of some thousands of pounds in each case.  In so far as this expenditure gives us an influence and a voice through the agencies of these agreements <Col N="1027" /> it must be welcomed.  I hope we can see more effective control over the next few years, particularly in the area of coffee and cocoa, than we have seen recently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy O'Kennedy for his contribution and support for these motions.  He asked a question which he did not include in his final summary in regard to Bolivia. I understand that the reason as one might have guessed, why the Bolivians have not ratified the tin agreement is that they are not happy with the price range.  I cannot tell the Deputy anything more about the situation in detail.  In regard to the delay in bringing these agreements before the House I should like to tell the Deputy that all these agreements contain a clause which empowers signatory Governments to apply them provisionally in advance of ratification.  In the three cases before the House the Government have done that.  In regard to tea I am told that an agreement on tea is in the course of negotiation in the FAO. With regard to the Deputy's final question, I hope that the EEC which is taking a part as the EEC in the so-called north-south dialogue, will play a useful part in getting at what the Deputy calls the real causes for the price rises in these commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The truth is, unpalatable and difficult though it may be for an Irish consumer to absorb, that we have been used all our lives to getting the commodities we are talking about, cocoa, coffee and tea, at an absurdly low price considering that these are all either tropical or sub-tropical products which have to be transported not just to another country but to another continent. I can remember 20 years ago when cocoa actually fell in price.  The price of Fry's Cocoa dropped by about two pennies from eight pence per quarter 1b to six pence for a finely processed and very nutritious food. That quantity would keep a cocoa drinking family going with cocoa for a couple of weeks.  The idea that a country producing this in West Africa could process it and transport it to be <Col N="1028" /> sold to the consumer at that price is something mind boggling.  Something similar is true of the situation in relation to the other products.  We find it an incredible price to pay, £1 per lb for tea, compared with other beverages but when one considers the difficulty of getting it here, of packaging and distributing it, it is still a relatively cheap commodity.  We are not able to see that because we have been spoiled for so long.</P>
    <P>The reason we were spoiled was that the people in the tea gardens and in the coffee and cocoa plantations were being paid next to nothing for their labour.  We were getting these products so cheap because they were produced at what would be regarded as absolutely sweated labour.  The substantial increase in the price of these commodities will find its way into the pockets of those who work to produce them.  If that is what Deputy O'Kennedy meant in the course of his contribution we all agree with him.  I am sure that is what is in the mind of the EEC in the part it is playing in the north-south dialogue.  It is largely an attempt to make sure that the producers of such commodities&mdash;&mdash;many countries have only one such commodity that is worth talking about &mdash;are paid enough to enable those who work on such plantations to get a decent wage so that they can live decently and do not work themselves to an early death.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;employer&rsquo;, in relation to an employee, means the person by whom the employee is (or, in a case where the employment has ceased, was) employed under a contract of employment, and for the purposes of this definition a civil servant of the State or of the Government shall be deemed to be employed by the State or the Government (as the case may be) and an officer or servant of a local authority within the meaning of the Local Government Act, 1941, or of a harbour authority, health board, vocational educational committee or committee of agriculture shall be deemed to be employed by the local authority, harbour authority, health board, vocational educational committee or committee of agriculture (as the case may be);&rdquo;.</P>

With such an amendment it appears that somewhere along the line there is a fall-out regarding the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Bill which means that the double elimination which this amendment suggests has not been implemented in the 1974 legislation.  At that time the Minister said that he was introducing further legislation to bolster this.  The Minister was referring to the Bill now before the House.  At that time our spokesman Deputy Dowling referred to the fact that any legislation which needed such support <Col N="1031" /> was in itself bad legislation and that the correct procedure would be to ensure that each piece of legislation could stand by itself.  We all know how the back-tracking occured in the 1974 legislation.  It does not say a lot for the Minister's complete commitment to this type of legislation.

      <P>I thank the Minister for considering this amendment. It was desirable and it proves the necessity for scrutiny by the Opposition of a Bill.  Undoubtedly, the Minister realised the need for this amendment when we brought it to his attention.  On Committee Stage the Minister said that he was not convinced by my argument in relation to this amendment but that he would have a look at it.  The Minister has now looked at it and has decided to include the amendment.  The fact that there is an Opposition committed to the principles of the Bill which is basically designed to give equal opportunity of promotion to women tends to improve the final legislation.  The other House of the Oireachtas will probably debate some of the sections and amendments to this Bill in great detail also.  I agree with the amendment entirely.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1032" /> In page 5, to delete lines 40 to 44, and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(6) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), a person shall be taken to contravene that subsection if he discriminates against an employee in the way he offers or affords that employee access to opportunities for promotion in circumstances in which another eligible and qualified person is offered or afforded such access or if in those circumstances he refuses or deliberately omits to offer or afford that employee access to opportunities for promotion.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We had a lengthy discussion on Committee Stage about the provision on promotion.  It will be recalled that I was concerned to ensure that equal opportunity in promotion be covered in the Bill.  I believe this amended provision meets that objective as well as some of the objections that were voiced on the original section.  Under the amended provision, if the process under which promotion is made, that is the arrangements for selection, are shown to be discriminatory, a disappointed woman applicant would have means of redress.  The employer would have to prove that he did not deliberately omit to afford a woman the same opportunities for promotion as were afforded to a man if she was as eligible and as qualified as he was.  Equal access to opportunities for promotion would cover areas such as the application of discriminatory rules in relation to promotion, seniority, selection criteria or job assessment or appraisal schemes.</P>

      <P>This amendment created much controversy on Committee Stage.  I had submitted an amendment that the original subsection (6) be deleted.  I was disappointed when we discussed the Bill at a later stage that the Minister had not seen the sense in the point I was making.  It was not that I wanted the subsection deleted. In the form that it was in the Bill at that stage it was absolutely impracticable. Many of my colleagues pointed out the defects in that original subsection. Those defects meant that it was unworkable because a ridiculous situation could arise where if there were <Col N="1033" /> only two opportunities and six people were equally qualified despite the fact that there were only two promotion opportunities the employer concerned would commit an offence by failing to promote six qualified people.  Despite the fact that we spent some time on it and the Minister was inclined to charge me with taking the real content out of the Bill, if that subsection were removed. The pleas and the reasons for them have been appreciated at last. The amendment has tidied up the situation and has made it specific.  The ridiculous charge I maintained could have resulted under the original section cannot arise now.  The amendment reads:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 40 to 44, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), a person shall be taken to contravene that subsection if he discriminates against an employee in the way he offers or affords that employee access to opportunities for promotion in circumstances in which another eligible and qualified person is offered or afforded such access or if in those circumstances he refuses or deliberately omits to offer or afford that employee access to opportunities for promotion.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That conveys what I believe should be in the Bill and what the Minister originally intended to have in the Bill.  It does not create the stupid position which arose under the original subsection which read:</P>
      <P>(6) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), a person shall be taken to discriminate against an employee if he refuses or deliberately omits to promote that employee to a post for which the employee is qualified in circumstances in which other persons equally qualified are promoted.</P>
      <P>We spent some time on this subsection. Column 848 of the Official Report of 31st March reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has had a full week to look at this matter, discussion of which ended in a rather unmannerly fashion on the last occasion.  I need hardly stress that the bad manners <Col N="1034" /> did not emanate from this side of the House.  If the Minister refuses to comply with our request to amend the subsection let it be on his head that we are sowing the seeds of disruption in industrial and commercial concerns.</P>
    <P>That is what we would have been doing.  The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>However, I am still hoping that the Minister will meet us on this point in order that this Bill, like the two previous ones, may make a contribution towards better industrial relations.</P>
    <P>I thought the Minister should have introduced an amendment at that stage. However, he has now introduced a new subsection which guarantees equal opportunity and improves the section. The subsection is now a practical one. It can be implemented and it is understandable. A lot depends on it and, in its original form, it was not realistic. I am glad that later on we will be discussing changing the title of the Bill.  I do not like the word &ldquo;anti&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I charge the Minister with using legislation for political ends.  As we all remember, this Bill was introduced hurriedly prior to the Mayo by-election of 1975.  My recollection is that its First Reading was in October of that year.  We have had many amendments since for which the Minister and his staff are to be thanked.  The Bill, as passed in Committee, which we are discussing today bears very little, if any, relation to the Bill as introduced other than that the principle and intent are the same.</P>

      <P>I want to claim credit for having highlighted the difficulties presented to employment agencies in the original section 7.  I asked for the omission of subsection (1) (b).  I thought there was a necessity for a refinement here&mdash;&ldquo;in the terms on which it offers to provide any of its services&rdquo; has a completely different meaning from, &ldquo;in the terms on which it offers to provide any service&rdquo;.  Paragraph (b) reads: &ldquo;by refusing or omitting to provide any service&rdquo;.  That was very wide and far-reaching.  Possibly it could have meant that the agency should provide unlawful services&mdash;&ldquo;by refusing or omiting to provide any of its services&rdquo; has an entirely different meaning and makes things easier for employment agencies and yet contains them within the restraints of the Bill.</P>
      <P>In its original form the Bill could have had the effect of putting employment agencies out of business.  The National Manpower Service and private employment agencies should get all the assistance and encouragement possible. I welcome the amendment.  It changes the nature of how agencies could be alleged to have discriminated.  An individual running an agency has the right to decide that he will provide only a service of a particular nature, let it be clerical, manual or managerial. It may be a small agency with expertise in one field and not in another and the owner might want to contain his business to a certain size and specialise in a particular area.  That can be done with this amendment and for that reason I accept the amendment.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(3) Subsection (1) does not apply where the service concerns only employment which an employer could lawfully refuse to offer to the person concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment provides that the subsection does not apply to occupations which are excepted.  Amendment No. 8 protects an agency against liability if it acts on false statements by an employer. It is important that an agency should not find itself in conflict with the law arising from a misleading statement by an employer who seeks the services of an agency.  The purpose of amendment No. 9 is to put a penalty on an employer who misleads an agency by making a false statement which could result in the agency discriminating and thus getting itself into trouble.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are welcome.  They give a certain amount of latitude to an agency which may have been taking the rap or which was the victim or the target of a charge and perhaps was saving the employer who was guilty of an offence. It also gives a certain amount of latitude.  I said on Committee Stage that it was very difficult for an employment agency to distinguish between selection and discrimination.  They must be allowed the freedom necessary for these powers of selection otherwise the employers will dispense with the services of these agencies because they are too tightly controlled and genuine selection will not be available. An agency will not be free to produce an application list in case a charge of discrimination could be brought.  These amendments do allow a certain amount of latitude and they go part of the way to easing the burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 provides that subsection (1) does not apply where the service concerns only employment which an employer could lawfully refuse to offer to the person concerned. Amendment No. 8 is also an improvement. It relieves the employment agency of some of the responsibility which could be attributed to it and <Col N="1037" /> it prevents the terms of the Bill from being circumvented.</P>
    <P>The amendments are accepted.  As it read on Committee Stage this was one of the more objectionable sections. I welcome this improvement and hope that the contributions from this side of the House have helped the Minister to introduce these amendments which will no doubt be of assistance to employment agencies in continuing their business.  Very substantial problems could be raised even for the National Manpower Service.  It would be under control because of being a Government agency and people might tend to abuse it in order to find ways and means around the Bill.  There are other points one could make but the important factor is the extra latitude.</P>

      <P>I want to claim a certain amount of credit for that improvement.  On Committee Stage this was section 8 of the Bill; it is now section 9.  Taking amendment No. 10, on which the others hang, the new form of section 9 is far more desirable and seems to aim at the right people. The original section was very far reaching.</P>
      <P>I will quote from my Committee Stage speech on this section:</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the wide interpretation of section 8.  The section states that a person shall not procure or counsel another person to do anything which constitutes discrimination.  That is very wide; it embraces anybody.  If you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in West Limerick or I in Mid-Cork held a &ldquo;clinic&rdquo; and in a moment of forgetfulness untentionally gave some wrong counsel or advice to someone as a result of which they commited an offence under this Bill, would it be possible that you or I could be brought before the tribunal here on a charge?  There could be a very wide interpretation of this.</P>

      <P>A person shall not procure or attempt to procure another person to do in relation to employment anything which constitutes discrimination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to the amendment but it falls very far short of what I had hoped.  This refers to the employments excluded from the application of the Act.  We have discussed at length the Defence Forces, the Garda Síochána and the Prison Service and also the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission. Quite honestly, I am not pushed whether it be &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; or &ldquo;Commissioners&rdquo; but it does appear that we are setting up special concessions for the commission or the commissioners which will not apply to other people.  It may well appear that the public service are doing an excellent job, that there is no discrimination within the public service and that no appointments or promotions should come within the terms of this Bill.  One must remember that the Local Appointments Commission covers a very wide field&mdash;the local authorities and the health boards and any position within those bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would of course assume that this would be an exemplary body, a headline setting body.  At the same time it is also desirable that these commissions or bodies would be open to the same investigation, that an opportunity be afforded those people who would be interviewed by them and <Col N="1040" /> not appointed to complain if they feel they have been discriminated against. Remember it is in recent times only, due to the tenacity, ability, ambition and determination of women themselves, that they have succeeded in breaking through to some local authority posts, where appointments are made by the Local Appointments Commission.  More power to them; congratulations and well done.  However, I see no justification for differentiating here between such a body and a private interview board, whether it be an employment agency or an employer.</P>
    <P>We had looked forward to amendments in the public service generally, in the case of the Garda Síochána and the prison service, to bring them within the scope of the Bill.  Such amendments have not been forthcoming. I want to express my party's disappointment that the Minister has not seen his way to extending the Bill to cover those groups of people.  There is no reason why it should not have been done.  Bad as that is, and it is most disappointing, it is more disappointing to realise that this Bill as it goes to the Seanad&mdash;and I am sure Senators will have many comments to make on it&mdash;carries this section 12 excluding from application of the Act the Local Appointments Commission or the Civil Service Commission. According to the amendment we will be calling them commissioners; whether it be commission or commissioners it matters little.  What is important is that they have not been included.  For instance, if a county engineer was being appointed in Cork or any other county, if a woman was equally qualified but was unsuccessful at the interview, and if she felt she had been discriminated against because of her sex, she has no right to bring her case to the equality agency, as she would had she gone, for example, to a building contractor or public works contractor and been unsuccessful there.  That is a glaring defect of this Bill I do not understand.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to explain very clearly to the House why he has seen fit still to exclude in particular the Local Appointments Commission, but <Col N="1041" /> also the Civil Service Commission, because the comments I have made apply to both.  The local Appointments Commission is more widespread. Indeed a Deputy from this side of the House asked a question recently whether any chief agricultural officer of the female sex had ever been interviewed.  Strangely enough, soon after that question, one was appointed.  I congratulate that woman who has, by her own ambition, determination and qualifications, broken through what had been a male confine.  Perhaps the Minister would explain why he has excluded these interview boards and has not examined further the inclusion of the Garda Síochána and the prison service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We had this discussion on Committee Stage.  I indicated that I would prefer there were no exclusions under this Bill. We have already covered the security aspects of this in reference to the Garda Síochána and prison service, so I will not go into that argument, and the reasons for their exclusion. But to offer a defence for the exclusions referred to in this Bill I would say this.  We must remember that the work of these commissions is accountable, the selections made by them and the appointments which arise from their work of selection.  The appointments are made formally by the Minister but they, in a very real sense, effect the appointments, since there are no precedents known to me where there has been a discrepancy between decisions of selection and appointment. Each of these commissions operates under statute, under which it was set up.  The commission body are answerable, through the appropriate Minister, to Dáil Éireann.  Therefore, it is not a group on whose work we cannot cast judgment, we can.  They have been and are accountable under their statutes to this House.  All commissions operating in this area are expected to comply with the provisions of the legislation by not discriminating in the selection process.  It is important to bear in mind that both bodies of commissioners referred to here are independent and completely separate <Col N="1042" /> from the Government Department whose Minister's function, if he makes the actual appointment, is purely a formal one.  I would stress that for our purposes here the actual appointment by the Minister comes within the scope of the Bill, not only that but a civil servant or a local authority employee can seek redress under its provisions on every aspect of his or her employment.</P>
      <P>One of the main objectives of the establishment of the commissions excluded here was to ensure that candidates be treated fairly.  I do not think anybody contests the impartiality of the commissions in the performance of their functions.  It has been and is understood as part of the commissioners' duties that they must ensure impartiality and that part of that impartiality is that they would seek to eliminate any kind of discrimination, including that on grounds of sex.  We must understand that, as distinct from the private employer area, the people taking part in the selection process under these commissions act in an honorary capacity. They are groups of civil servants and professional people who come together for the purpose purely of selection at a given time.  They are in a totally different position from the direct employment connection that exists in the private area.  These people are acting under statute under the commissions in question.  There is accountability to the Dáil on the effect of what they do finally.  Therefore, there is a very legitimate defence that can be entertained here for the exclusion of the work of these commissions in the selection process, though, I would emphasise that the result of their work comes within the scope of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note that in anticipation of this legislation the grade of clerical assistant is open to boys and girls in the 1977 competition.  Always, I am informed, the commissioners have taken steps to ensure that membership of their interview boards would not be confined to one sex.  That initiative of theirs was taken long before there was any reference in Europe to the question of equality between the sexes.  In <Col N="1043" /> particular, where there are female candidates for posts which had traditionally been regarded as more appropriate for men, every effort has been made to ensure that women would be on the interviewing boards in question.</P>
    <P>These are valid arguments that can be advanced for the exclusion of the selection process and procedure of the commission in this case.  Personally I would prefer to see them included, but these arguments were advanced for their exclusion and any fair-minded examination of them will accept that there is a strong case to be made for excluding them.  The personnel taking part in this process are part-time or are acting in a honorary capacity to ensure impartiality.  They are accountable to this House for their work, a position that does not obtain in relation to employment elsewhere in the country.  For these reasons a case can be made for their exclusion.</P>

However, I do not think it will be possible to get any other changes, although I will continue to look at the matter.  There are valid arguments on either side.

    <P>I am not entirely happy with the wording of the amendment and I would ask the Minister to have it examined before the Bill is sent to the Seanad.  The amendment refers to &ldquo;a place where the laws or customs are such that the duties can only be performed . . . &rdquo;.  I am not so sure that the problem is confined to the laws and customs of a country outside this State.  I know something about the construction business and its tough nature.  As the Minister said, an increasing number of women are engineers and many are working at various levels in the building and construction industry.  In fact, a few of them are very successful managers and managing directors of very successful building companies in the country.  I feel that a very different situation exists regarding contracts in the Middle East or Far East where <Col N="1047" /> not only may there be a problem of laws and customs but there could be very practical problems as well.  This may be covered in some of the other sections of the Bill.  The Minister may need to have this examined between now and the time he brings it to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>There could be a practical reason why it would be impossible or undesirable from a woman's viewpoint to be engaged in one of those contracts. Other problems may arise.  Our State bodies are doing some of those contracts abroad.  They may be in an even more embarrassing situation at times than the other contractors.  I believe this area needs a little more attention. I said on Committee Stage that I had been approached in regard to this amendment.  I said that people believe, not only the ESB but public contractors, that this could present real problems for women.  I believe they may like to mix the sexes.  I accept the amendment but I believe some further broadening other than the laws and customs of the countries where the work is carried out, is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

      <P>I welcome this amendment.  My Committee Stage amendment suggested calling the Bill &ldquo;Equal Opportunities Employment Act, 1977&rdquo;.  I knew the Minister would not accept that word for word and I <Col N="1052" /> am quite happy with his new name for this Bill.  Since I assumed the role of spokesman for my party on the Department of Labour I have consistently made the point that I did not agree with the word &ldquo;anti-discrimination&rdquo;. I did not feel at any stage that &ldquo;anti-discrimination&rdquo; should have been used in any of the Bills brought before the House.  I am glad that the Minister has now seen, not only in this Bill but in some of the others as well, that a positive title to a Bill appears more progressive than talking about anti-something, whether it is anti-discrimination or anything else.  The Minister should not introduce a Bill with such a title.  Perhaps he thought there were political kudos to be gained by introducing a Bill with such a title, but I advised him to amend the name of the Bill.  The Minister seeks to substitute &ldquo;Employment Equality Act, 1977&rdquo; for the &ldquo;Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Act, 1977.&rdquo;  The latter was introduced in 1975 but did not reach Second Stage until the latter part of 1976 and it is being put through Report Stage on the eve of a general election.</P>
      <P>I agree with the amendment.  The tragedy is that the Minister ever called one of these Bills an anti-discrimination measure.  It was not a proper title and did not give the impression that the Minister or the Government were looking positively at this matter.  To me &ldquo;anti&rdquo; denotes a negative approach.  Such legislation should have a positive title to it.  I have consistently looked for changes in the titles of Bills introduced here and I am glad that the Minister has agreed with the suggestion I made on this and other pieces of legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There was agreement on this Bill regarding the provision of equal opportunity of employment for women in our society.  Such legislation has been supported by my party and we were committed to it from the time the Commission on the Status of Women issued their recommendations. Women have achieved a lot in our society and many organisations have contributed a great deal by highlighting areas of discrimination. They deserve to be complimented on this.  The women in our society who reached the top of their profession through their own ability, ambition, determination and dedication to the task are also deserving of our compliments. Attitudes were the main obstacle we had to this progress for a long time, but they are breaking down.  I agree that the establishing of the equality agency is of great importance, but what an ideal situation it would be if that agency never had to be used. That is an ideal we might never reach in this life because, human failings and frailities being what they are, I expect there will be either an alleged breach or a breach brought before the agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1054" /> Many functions have been given to the equality agency and I regard that as a major step forward.  I do not agree with its composition because the Minister has power to appoint too many.  A colleague this morning expressed similar reservations about ministerial powers in the appointment of an agency in another Department. He said that because of the performance of the Government in the making of appointments we must, of necessity, suspect the political affiliations of the people appointed to any agency.  If the equality agency is to be successful it must be seen not to discriminate in any way, not only on grounds of sex but on political grounds also.  If it is seen that the agency carries with it a certain political flavour, that will be the first nail in its coffin as far as efficiency is concerned.  The Minister will have to accept the blame for that. The Minister must see to it that the appointments are impartial and are based on suitability and experience in the organisations that have done so much for women, particularly in the field of employment.</P>
    <P>I realise the Minister agrees with me on the issue I raised in relation to the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission. Certain credit must be given to the Minister for the Bill but it could go a lot further if an equal opportunity of investigation of an allegation, wrong though it may be, was given.  The public must see that they have in certain cases access if they suspect discrimination. I appeal to the Minister to see to it that this facility is given to people and have included under the terms of the Bill the members of the Civil Service Commission or the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    <P>I have never heard of a case of unfair appointment that could be substantiated against those august bodies. That does not mean that there should not be the same facility for investigation of their activities as is available for assessing the operation of private interview boards.  That is an omission. It is also disappointing that the Garda Síochána and the prison service especially have been excluded from the terms of the Bill.  The point was made very strongly by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn <Col N="1055" /> that the Garda Síochána could be and were excluded.  I leave her to deal with that aspect.</P>
    <P>I hope that we have contributed something to equal opportunity in promotion and access to employment for women.  Again I say that all this legislation has come together as a package.  We have had some very interesting Committee Stages in this House, Committee Stages that have undoubtedly, as has again been proved this morning, improved the content of the Bills before us.  This can be seen from the Report Stage amendments to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am still concerned as I have said many times, about the small employer who does not and would not deliberately set out to commit an offence under this or any other legislation. Because he is small he is probably doing his own books, or perhaps his wife or one of his family is doing them part-time for him.  He or she may not be up-to-date on legislation of this nature.  The point I would like to make on this is that the equality agency, particularly in the early stages, would act probably in an advisory capacity to this type of employer.  I am not so concerned about the bigger company or industry that would have personnel sections or personnel managers to look after legislation such as this.  The Minister should encourage the equality agency to act in an advisory capacity, particularly to the small business.</P>
    <P>No Bill in this House has ever changed so much from its introduction to its Final Stage as has this Bill.  The First Stage was introduced in October, 1975, for political purposes prior to the Mayo by-election.  It lay on a shelf somewhere until the real content of the Bill was promised almost a year later on Second Stage when the obvious omission of an equality agency or an agency of that nature was seen. That omission was made good on Committee Stage.  The whole proceedings have taken a long time.  We would have taken less time and done less changing and there would not be such a different Bill from the original if a little more time had been allowed for its preparation.  Any Minister, no <Col N="1056" /> matter what Government or Department he represents, has a duty to the people not to introduce legislation for party political or narrow political motives, but rather for the common good.  The only worry I have is that while now the Bill is for the common good and originally it may well have been intended to introduce it for the common good, the rush about its introduction was influenced very strongly by the timing of the West Mayo by-election.</P>

      <P>There is tremendous significance in the fact that the Minister has seen fit to complete the Bill and bring it to this Final Stage in the Dáil, particularly when we remember that from the introduction of the Bill in October, 1975, the main reason for its expedition had been political.  That is very wrong in any legislation that comes before the House.  The Minister may smile about it but it is a fact that on the eve of a general election it is particularly significant that the Minister would be anxious to woo the votes of the women of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;particularly in his own constituency, and the votes of women who may be influenced by their various organisations who have done such tremendous work down the years and in particular since this Bill was introduced.  The expedition with which this Bill has been dealt has been due largely to pressure put on the Minister by the various women's organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are exclusions in the Bill, and if we are serious about getting rid of discrimination of all kinds ideally there should be no exceptions.  I will refer in particular, as my colleague, Deputy Fitzgerald, has already done to the prison service and the Garda Síochána. The Minister will remember that on Committee Stage we urged that the Garda Síochána and the prison service should be included.  The female members of the Garda Síochána cannot be categorised and therefore cannot be asked to perform a certain type <Col N="1057" /> of job within the force.  They are entitled and are supposed to be able to cope with all situations.  The Minister mentioned on Committee Stage that they could not be expected to cope with a riot situation.  In the past we have seen that they have done so and were asked to do so just as any member of the Garda Síochána should and must do.  Therefore, these exceptions should and must, if at all possible, be eradicated before the Bill leaves the Seanad.  I hope the Minister was serious today when he said that he would have another look at these two exceptions in particular.</P>
    <P>I said on Committee Stage that once again in the anti-discrimination Bills before this House the public sector have been left out to a considerable extent and that they have been given loopholes where may be, as the Minister said, they may not discriminate. However, I feel they should have been included in the Bill.  We all know the scandalous situation which resulted in the public sector after the Equal Pay Bill where the Minister tried to omit the discrimination and in fact created a further discrimination by bringing in the marital status.  The public sector should set an example for all employers throughout the country.  If the Minister feels that he must shield or protect them in some way through the medium of this Bill this is wrong.  I urge him to have another look at this before it goes to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear the Minister's claim this morning that the most important part of this Bill was the inception of the equality agency.  This was not included at the beginning when the Bill was introduced and when the Fianna Fáil speakers had continuously called for the setting up of an equality agency.  There would be no redress if this agency had not been set up.  It is tragic that so many of the appointments to the equality agency have been left in the hands of the Minister.  As my colleague has already stated, we know what has happened in the semi-State bodies throughout the country and the type of appointments that have been made. To any of us who are serious about cutting out discrimination, political discrimination is the worst type that <Col N="1058" /> can be carried out by any Government. There was much talk by the Minister and his colleagues when they were in Opposition about the type of jobs for the boys provided by the Fianna Fáil Government.  Beyond a shadow of a doubt there was nothing of any significance then compared with what is being done by this Government. It would be a sad reflection on this Bill if such appointments were made now to the equality agency.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to have a look at the various points we have made regarding the shielding of the public sector, the exceptions of the prison service and the Garda Síochána which should be included.  Again, regarding the Minister's appointments to the equality agency, I urge that the criteria for this should be that they be the best people possible, that there should, if possible, be representation from both sexes and that most definitely appointments to this equality agency should not be made, as they have been made by the present Government, because of political bias or favour.</P>

      <P>Those advisers who are with me today are on the staff of the equality section of the Department.  They have been advising me during the course of this legislation. As Deputy Coogan points out, in this case all are women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the overall significance of this piece of legislation. The Bill is significant because it addresses the question of the most basic inequality between men and women in our society; that is, the difference that exists between the kinds of jobs open to men and women.  Women take the lowliest jobs.  The remedy for this sad situation lies in the improvement of the education and training that is provided for women before they enter employment. This Bill seeks to remedy the <Col N="1059" /> imbalance in job opportunities.  I have said always that it is the status of women's jobs which more than anything else determines their place in the economy and, ultimately, their place in society.  It would be my hope that this legislation would provide women with equal opportunity with men to realise their full potential and employment in respect of job training, job promotions and working conditions.  The most significant aspect of this Bill will be the establishment of the employment equality agency.  That will be an independent agency, a governing body, staffed by people for the purpose of carrying out its functions.  My hope for that agency is that it will be a significant force in achieving equality for women in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite refer to the Bill being introduced for political reasons. Obviously, all such measures coming before the House are the result of my political convictions.  I believe in them for political reasons.  There is nothing to be ashamed of in that.</P>

      <P>Allowing for the normal exaggerations that one would expect from Opposition spokesmen in dealing with legislation, Deputy Fitzgerald has scrutinised diligently the various sections of this Bill and of other Bills with which he has been concerned.

This is <Col N="1060" /> the eighth Bill in the area of labour reform to be introduced here in recent years.  There remains only the Safety, Health and Welfare Bill.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been speaking yesterday evening about the importance of providing the necessary incentive for farmers to increase production and I stated that the taxation system proposed in this Bill will have the direct opposite effect.  Therefore, this is a matter which the Government must tackle without delay especially since the agriculture industry is our greatest national asset and is responsible for more than 50 per cent of our total exports</P>
      <P>In regard to taxation and, in particular to the taxation of farmers, it is the policy of Fianna Fáil that the necessary incentives be provided at all times.  We favour greatly the notional system.  It has now been agreed by all concerned that farmers must pay their fair share of taxation.  They have no objection to that but they must be given the necessary scope to increase production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The notional system must be retained if this very necessary incentive is to be given.  While retaining the <Col N="1061" /> notional system we must take into consideration the other various expenses associated with farming such as contract charges and wages, including family wages.  The Government have fallen down in relation to these considerations.  Most of the work on quite a number of farms is done by the family and they must receive compensation for their work in contributing towards farm output.  From time to time we have had assurances from the Minister for Finance but later on we found that those assurances meant nothing.  We had an assurance in relation to farming taxation two years ago and we now find that more and more farmers are coming into the tax net.  Small farmers and farmers with very low valuations who have to resort to other work to augment their incomes are included in the tax net.  This is a further disincentive to increased production.</P>
    <P>Among the worst anomolies contained in this Bill is the one where a farmer will pay double the amount of tax when compared with a person earning a similar income in a different walk of life.  That is the muddled thinking contained in this Bill.  Rates can also be considered as a further taxation on a farmer's line of production. People in industry pay taxation only on their profits, but a farmer pays rates irrespective of his income, in a good year or a bad year.  Farming is a type of industry which depends on the climate.  This is not taken into account particularly by the members of this Government who complain that farmers are not paying their fair share of taxation.  The notional system of taxation must be retained, taking into account the various other expenses that arise, otherwise the taxation imposed on farmers through the notional system can be drastically increased at the whim of any Minister for Finance who finds himself short of money.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious in this Finance Bill that the Minister finds himself very short indeed through the mismanagement and inability of the Government to right the finances of the State.  We must take a careful look at the system of taxation for farmers, because they are the wealth of the country.  With <Col N="1062" /> increasing farm incomes all the other sections of the community benefit. Farmers are not a privileged class of citizen, but as builders of our staple industry they should not be subjected as they are now by this Government, to repressive taxation.  We should consider what farming could mean to the development of our country in the years ahead.  We should realise that we cannot hope to increase agricultural production under the present system of repressive taxation.</P>
    <P>The concept of taxation as outlined by the Minister last year and this year is harsh and repressive.  I find it extraordinary that a man who says he is committed to the development of this country and its industry and its people should take this extremely harsh attitude to agriculture.  It has become fashionable for some sections to say the farmer is doing well.  We must consider the good years with the bad years.  For many years the farmer found it difficult to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to have a major rethink on the whole question of farming taxation and to ensure that the incentives which are necessary for increased production are safeguarded. The Finance Bill does not do that.  I hope that on Committee Stage the Minister will consider the many fine suggestions made from this side of the House on this matter and many other matters which affect the economy.  The Government are responsible for inflation and unemployment because of their budgets this year and last year.  The taxation imposed in last year's budget was responsible for 4 to 5 per cent of the inflation which hit the country last year.  We hope the days of this Government are numbered and that, when we are discussing the Finance Bill next year a Minister for Finance from the Fianna Fáil Party will be leading the country again to the progress and prosperity we enjoyed up to 1973.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking around the House and noting the absence of any member of the Government we see the contempt the Government feel for this House and for the democratic process which sent us all here.  That contempt is well represented by the <Col N="1063" /> fact that not one single member of the Government would deign to grace the House with his presence during the debate on the Government's own Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>It has become more or less standard procedure during the reign of the Coalition that one may find oneself talking in the House to nobody except possibly one person from the Government side such as the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Begley who has been sent in, presumably against his will, to hold the fort for the whole National Coalition.  This is an indication of the contempt in which the Cosgrave Government hold this House and the democratic institution it represents and their unconcern for the observations of Members of the House who have been sent here by the electorate in their constituencies to offer opinions and suggestions on the situation in which the country finds itself at present.  It is apparent, it is manifest, that the Government are not interested in what Members of the House have to say.  If they were, one of them at least would come in to hear what was being said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It so happens that we, the Irish nation, find ourselves in what I hold to be a crisis situation.  The crisis arises on the one hand, from a flagging, falling economy, the running down of of industry and the running down of agriculture.  Agriculture is running down and I will demonstrate that in due course.  On the other hand we have a quite peculiarly composed population of three million which is rising rapidly.  It is peculiar in its composition in that an extraordinary number of young people make up that population.  I understand about half the Irish population are under 25 years of age, and a very large proportion of those are still attending school.  The vast majority of those who left our educational establishments over the past couple of years found no place to work and nothing to do.  They are contributing to the building up of a time bomb of disillusion and frustration which will be all the more dangerous to our social structures in that the people who make it up will have been well educated in <Col N="1064" /> our educational system which developed, as it happens, under Fianna Fáil Governments over the past couple of decades, and will have nothing to do.</P>
    <P>It is disturbing to find oneself worrying about the implications of the frustrations of the young people of one's own nation.  That is what we must worry about now.  The minimum any nation can guarantee to its young people is an opportunity to work. Having given that guarantee, rejecting as I do the socialist concept that the State owes you everything else, the guarantee of the right to work and an opportunity to work, the State would then have discharged a great deal of its obligations to people, apart from the disabled, the sick and people who are unable to provide for themselves.</P>
    <P>In that context the duty falls on the Government to strengthen the Irish economy which has been flagging and stagnant for so many decades for good and sufficient reasons, because of our total economic bondage within the United Kingdom market.  We have now broken out of that bondage by our entry into the European Economic Community which was opposed by part of the National Coalition.  Now we have the time and the opportunity to say to ourselves that we must throw off the lethargy which was imposed upon us by our incapacity to expand beyond a certain point prior to our entry into the EEC and make an Ireland which will cater adequately for our young people.  Nothing has been done.  In fact, all the economic indicators are in reverse.</P>
    <P>Let us look for a moment at our biggest industry, the agricultural industry, and look at the prime indicators. In 1973, the number of cows and heifers in the country was almost 2,400,000 or, to be accurate, 2,355,000. That has fallen 2,187,000.  These cattle are the source of the national herd upon which the whole dairy and meat processing industry, as far as beef is concerned, depend.  Up to 1973, and particularly since 1965 under the influence of the incentives offered by Deputy Paddy Smith when Minister for Agriculture in the 1960s, the herd had been rising very rapidly.  The Irish cattle herd is our main source of wealth <Col N="1065" /> and the biggest contributor to employment. This should be remembered by the Labour Party and particularly by Deputy Barry Desmond and Senator Michael Mullen.  Under the management of the Coalition Government this resource is being severely damaged, though it will not be totally destroyed.</P>
    <P>The bacon industry is vital.  Twenty years ago Holland had the same number of pigs as we had, about two million. They now have 12 million and we have 109,000.  We had 130,000 in 1973.  The figure for 1976 is a recovery figure; prior to that it was about 90,000. There is much talk about the Minister for Agriculture bringing the French Government before the Court of Justice in Strasbourg on the question of the French system of excluding imports of mutton and lamb.  What has happened to the sheep flock during the period of the Coalition Government? The number of ewes in the national flock has fallen from about 1,900,000 to 1,600,000.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, there is an urgent need to provide more wealth, more production, more jobs for the people coming after us.  Our time is nearly finished.  The most important sector of our population is the young people and the resources upon which they must depend must be developed regardless of anything else.  The Government have been meticulous, as I have demonstrated, in allowing agriculture to run down.</P>
    <P>The use of fertiliser is about half what it was in 1973, and this is a vital factor.  The picture is really worse than it seems when it is expressed in tonnage. The vital plant nutrients&mdash;potash, calcium, phosphates&mdash;are not being used; as a kind of substitute nitrogen &mdash;based fertilizers are being used. The use of nitrogen in this unbalanced way means that existing resources of calcium, magnesium, phosphorous and potassium in the soil are being flogged and torn out of the soil by the use of nitrate fertilisers which are, essentially, stimulants.  They have a stimulating effect on the soil because there can be no plant growth without a drawing off of the other minerals, and nitrogen, of course, is not a mineral.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1066" /> Following the most recent meeting of Agriculture Ministers in Luxembourg for the annual price review, one of the newspapers announced a bonanza in the region of £150 million for the Irish industry.  The prices paid for agricultural exports are being raised very steadily by the European Community.  There is no particular act of heroism on the part of the Minister for Agriculture or the Coalition Government because they actually delayed the introduction of the green £ for about nine months and they have dragged their feet on each successive devaluation of the green £. In doing that, largely unknown to the majority of farmers, they taxed the farmers to the most appalling extent.</P>
    <P>During the early months of this year the amount of taxation on one steer being exported to the Continent reached about £100 and the tax was paid by the seller.  The existence of that tax was denied both inside and outside this House.  It was very imperfectly understood by the Minister for Agriculture and by his colleagues. Whether understood or not, the tax was levied.  Measures taken by members of this party in the European Parliament and this Parliament to highlight the imposition of monetary compensatory taxes on Irish exports&mdash; discriminatory as they are&mdash;got no support at all from the Coalition Government.  On the contrary they were embarrassed by the exposure of this situation and forced into the position of lessening by the devaluation of the green £ these discriminatory taxes against our basic industry.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the revolution which has taken place in agriculture and marketing since our accession to the European Community has been dramatic.  The effects of it have been dampened down by the tardiness of the Government in seeking a proper solution to the question of monetary compensatory amounts.  Behind a screen of what amounts to falsehood, the Government have been painting a picture of success in the agricultural field.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>Drilling ships or mobile drilling rigs, and not platforms, are used in connection with offshore petroleum exploration.  I presume, however, that the Deputy has in mind the building of platforms for use in the development of petroleum finds.  The Kinsale Head gasfield is the only such development at present and some £12 million worth of orders for the construction of several component parts of the two production platforms needed have been placed with Irish firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a firm set up in County Mayo that did quite an amount of preliminary work in anticipation of receiving orders for this kind of work have had to leave the country and take away their resources because they did not get any orders?  Furthermore, does he see any future for firms of this kind or any hope that they might be in a position to get orders in future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of points that arise out of this.  First, there is a considerable world surplus of platforms at this time.  Secondly, the programme of drilling is really only getting under way this year. Thirdly, the Kinsale development which I talked about and where there have been £12 million worth of orders was on head of the Marathon agreement which I inherited.  Under that Marathon agreement the Minister has no right to require companies to place their contracts in Ireland.  It has been possible nonetheless to get co-operation from the company.  However, in this <Col N="1070" /> respect the Marathon agreement differs fundamentally from the 1975 licensing terms which include a provision that the licencee is to use Irish goods and services where possible.  I think people would be imprudent to spend large sums of money until there are definite finds, but in the event of the finds being on a scale that many experts anticipate, there would certainly be a future for such work in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Under the 1975 licensing terms, as I have said, we are in a position to require firms to use Irish goods and services whenever possible.  But whether there is a future or not for firms depends on the extent and timing of the discoveries.  If those discoveries take place, then there is certainly a future and we are in a position to insist on their services being used wherever the discovering company comes from; if not, no.</P>

      <P>I have no evidence that there <Col N="1071" /> is unfair loading by insurance companies of insurance for disabled drivers.  Insurers examine each motor insurance proposal on its merits. Frequently in cases involving disabled drivers the insurer will insist on a medical examination to evaluate the degree of disability and care is taken to establish that the vehicle concerned has been adapted to the needs of the prospective insured.  In general there is no standard scale of loadings for disabled drivers, although most of them are loaded to some degree depending on the extent of the disability and the suitability of the vehicle.</P>
      <P>I have had this whole question brought to the attention of the motor insurers on several occasions and have been assured by them that they are generally sympathetic to disabled drivers and anxious to accommodate them.  I would be glad to have any individual case in this area reviewed.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 6 and 7 together.  The training course for Garda recruits in Templemore is in two parts.  The first part covers a period of 22 weeks after which the recruit is assigned to a station. After an interval he is recalled to the <Col N="1072" /> training centre for a further period of three weeks.</P>
      <P>About 200 recruits on part I of the course can be accommodated at the centre without interrupting the programme of courses provided there for other members of the force.  If needs be, however, the courses for other members can be temporarily postponed to permit accelerated recruitment and, in fact, that is what is proposed in respect of the next intake.</P>
      <P>All successful candidates from the competition held in May, 1974, have now been recruited and the total number of them still in training at the centre is 16.  In addition eight gardaí recruited by means of a special competition for technicians are also in training there.</P>
      <P>The Civil Service Commissioners expect to be in a position to announce the results of the recent entrance examination before the end of this month and the Commissioner will immediately commence notifying the candidates who have obtained the highest places to attend for interview, medical examination and oral Irish test.  It is estimated that about 300 recruits will be taken into training by the end of July, the first intake being about the beginning of that month.</P>
      <P>The total number of recruits who completed parts I and II of the training courses held since January, 1976 were 198 and 490 respectively.  Particulars of the number who attended each course are given in the attached tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to have circulated with the Official Report.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Particulars of the number of indictable crimes reported or known to the <Col N="1077" /> gardaí during the period 1967 to 1976 in respect of the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area are in the form of a tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, will be circulated with the Official Report.</P>
    <P>I stated in reply to a question on 12th May that the Garda authorities exercise a continuing supervision over the police needs of all areas and the allocation of Garda resources in modified from time to time according as the needs of particular areas vary.  As I indicated to the House on the 3rd <Col N="1078" /> May, the provision of extra funds to permit increased Garda patrolling was being investigated.  These funds have since been made available and as a result additional foot patrols are now being operated in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area.</P>
    <P>I may add that Dún Laoghaire is one of the areas to which extra gardaí will be allocated when the additional manpower at present being recruited becomes available for assignment.</P>

    <P>*Since 1975 crime statistics have been compiled in respect of calendar years.  The statistics for earlier years relate to the years ended 30th September.</P>
    <P>&dagger;The apparent decrease in the number of indictable crimes in this category is accounted for by a change in the system of recording crimes.  Some crimes previously recorded as &ldquo;other indictable offences&rdquo; are now recorded in one of the other three categories.</P>
    <P>The Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area is served by the Garda Stations at Dún Laoghaire, Blackrock, Dalkey, Kill O' The Grange, Cabinteely and Shankill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>How many of the extra gardaí will become available in that area?  Is the Minister aware of the concern of the people and the gardaí in that area at the lack of foot patrols? Is he further aware of the increase in the number of break-ins and assaults in the area over the past number of years?  The gardaí and the people attribute this entirely to the lack of personnel. No action appears to have been taken in the matter, except in the past few days with the prospect of the general election in view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I get the impression that Deputy Andrews is disappointed that remedial action is being taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying how many gardaí will be allocated because that will be a matter for the commissioner's professional judgment. Extra beat patrols are being made available, as I indicated in my reply.  I share the Deputy's concern and the concern of the citizens at the increase in crime but the Garda have not indicated to me that they consider gardaí numbers have been a causative factor in the increases in the crime rate. There is no proven connection between the two things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the causative factor in the rise in crime?  Is it something to do with the lack of foot patrols?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nothing to do with the lack of foot patrols.  It is, unfortunately, <Col N="1079" /> a phenomenon which has manifested itself throughout the western world.  Crime in all western countries is on the increase.  That is a regrettable social phenomenon and has many and varied causes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not blamed the oil crisis for this and that is a help.  He must be aware of the serious concern of the gardaí and the people of the area at the increase in crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I am aware of the increase in crime and I share that concern.  As I indicated to the Deputy, steps to remove that concern so far as gardaí are concerned are being taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will give a direction under section 38 of the Health Act, 1970, to the Midland Health Board to ensure that the County Hospital, Tullamore, County Offaly, will not be downgraded in capacity, services or status.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>In September, 1973, Comhairle na nOspidéal produced guidelines which they believed should underpin future general hospital development in this country.  In summary, the guidelines provided that future general hospital planning should be based on three basic principles.  These were: that acute hospital services should be organised so that the population served would be within 30 miles of a hospital centre; that the minimum staffing levels in each hospital would consist of two consultant surgeons, two consultant physicians and other consultant staff as required by the hospital's caseload; and that a minimum scale hospital should usually serve a population of about 100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accepted these guidelines as reasonable in Irish circumstances.  On 9th October, 1973, I issued a memorandum to the chairmen and members of each health board, each regional hospital board and Comhairle na nOspidéal in which I outlined the guidelines and asked that working <Col N="1080" /> parties representative of these agencies be set up for each health board area to prepare options for hospital development within the context of the guidelines.</P>
    <P>I should say at this point that no health agency, including the Midland Health Board and the County Offaly health advisory committee, questioned the validity of these guidelines as a basis for future hospital development. Within the context of the guidelines, the working party for the Midland Health Board area, which included representatives of the Opposition party, put forward three options for future hospital development.  These were&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  one large general hospital at Tullamore,</P>
    <P>(b)  two smaller general hospitals at Mullingar and Portlaoise,</P>
    <P>(c)  two smaller general hospitals at Athlone and Portlaoise.</P>
    <P>These options were submitted, <i>inter alia,</i> to the Midland Health Board and the Laois, Longford, Offaly and Westmeath local health advisory committees for their consideration.  Even at this point, I am not aware that any of these agencies questioned either the guidelines or the options which arose from them.  Rather each agency was concerned to choose the option which it thought best.</P>
    <P>Following their consideration of the options, the Laois, Longford and Westmeath health advisory committees agreed unanimously to support two hospitals at Portlaoise and Mullingar. It is clear that there was no party political disagreement in these counties. The Offaly County Health Advisory Committee favoured a single hospital in Tullamore.  In the case of the Midland Health Board, they decided in favour of two hospitals, one each in Portlaoise and Mullingar, with members of all political parties voting on non-party lines.</P>
    <P>Following this exercise in intensive consultation with the relevant health agencies, it was clear that majority opinion in the Midland Health Board area favoured hospitals in Portlaoise and Mullingar.  The Government accepted this view since it was fully democratic and since it was fully in <Col N="1081" /> accordance with the guidelines I had issued, which had not been disputed by any health agency.</P>
    <P>If I were to seek to reverse the Government's decision on the matter now, I would be flaunting democratic opinion in the midland area.  If the Midland Health Board and the other local health agencies had recommended to me that Tullamore hospital should be developed instead of Portlaoise and Mullingar hospitals, I think the Government would have accepted that democratic recommendation, because it too would have been within the guidelines issued.  This was not the case, however.  If the Government were to reverse their decision now and develop Tullamore uniquely, the people of Laois, Westmeath and Longford would rightly say that we were reversing a democratic recommendation made by their representatives, including representatives from all political parties.</P>
    <P>Tullamore Hospital will be retained in its present capacity for many years to come.  Subsequently, it will become a community hospital.  As such, it will provide consultant staffed out-patient clinics in medicine, surgery, obstetrics, gynaecology and psychiatry.  Radiology, pathology and physiotherapy will be available for both out-patients and in-patients.  The question of what other services it could provide will be discussed in detail with the health board in the meantime and it will be open to the board to prepare proposals in relation to these.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry but I would not, and I do not mean any offence to Offaly County Council or any other public body or organisation.  But, as I told the Deputy and the House previously, I took the precaution before a decision was made of receiving any deputation which asked to see me. In all, I saw about 21.  They put their cases before me but unfortunately some of those who wanted to have a hospital sited in a certain area had to be disappointed because, as I said in the reply, if Tullamore were to be regarded as an acute general hospital it would upset the guidelines not only in the Midland Health Board but in other areas as well.  I should point out that it was a decision that was not taken against Tullamore but a decision taken by the Midland Health Board in which they voted by an overwhelming majority for the upgrading of Portlaoise and Mullingar.  I accepted that as a democratic decision, but I can understand the feelings of the people of Tullamore and Offaly.  I should say in respect of the decision made, the people of Leix and Offaly and the Midland Health Board area generally can be assured of a very good hospital service.</P>

There are priorities in various areas that have to be attended to first as far as the building and expansion of hospital services are concerned.  As I said in the reply, Tullamore hospital will retain its <Col N="1083" /> present capacity and use and fulfil the same role as previously for several years to come.  It takes quite some time to plan a project like this and have it finalised.  I could not put a number of years on the time when the other two hospitals will be completed but it will take quite a number of years before the status of Tullamore will become that of a community hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to Deputy Connolly, I have endeavoured to produce a hospital plan although I know that plan would not be universally accepted when one has regard to affiliations to counties or a particular <Col N="1085" /> town.  When I took over in the Department of Health there was no evidence of any plan for hospitalisation and it was generally agreed by the profession, public representatives and the general public that the days of the single-handed hospital were numbered.  I do not think it would be unfair to refer to the FitzGerald Report which contained provisions for the designation of 16 acute hospitals.  I disagreed with that report, as did my party when in Opposition.  With the Comhairle and in consultation with the Department, I laid down certain guidelines which were acceptable to the health boards and county health advisory committees.  The Fianna Fáil Party, who were then in Government, had the FitzGerald Report in 1968 and three years within which to make a decision on it.  They did not make any decision on it, meaning that they were prepared to dump the idea of any hospital plan in case any town or county would be dissatisfied.</P>
      <P>The people of Tullamore and County Offaly are not the only ones who are dissatisfied.  It is inevitable that somebody will be hurt in the establishment of a hospital plan, but I do not think anybody would want us to continue <i>ad infinitum</i> with the present county hospitals we have, bearing in mind always the excellent service they have given under bad conditions.  I suggest to the Deputy that his party are not blameless in this matter.  They had five years to make up their minds and did not do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment of the debate we had been discussing, against the background of the contemporary pre-election good news campaign being conducted by the National Coalition at present, the realities of our economic situation, against the background of propaganda films about the life and times of the Taoiseach, Deputy Cosgrave, to the daily news of new factories and industries to be established in the west, north, south-west, all over the place.  Every day there is a new batch of good news. Against that background we were trying to pin down the reality of our economic situation at present.  We had delineated the flagging and dropping of agricultural production and illustrated it with the key figures governing the size of the herd and flocks in the country, all of which have diminished alarmingly, and against the key fertiliser-usage statistics which as we have seen, are about half what they were in 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been attempting to expose the fraud, for that is what it is, of the pretence being maintained by the National Coalition Government that the high structure of agricultural prices being enjoyed at present arises in some way from Government policy.  On the contrary, as everybody who stops to think for a minute knows the price structure we now enjoy, inhibited and all as it is by the incidence of MCAs, arises from our membership of the EEC <Col N="1090" /> which was bitterly opposed by the Labour Party before our entry.  The very fact that the Labour Parliamentary Secretary for Social Welfare can now boast of being the benefactor of the poor and disabled derives from the Fianna Fáil policy of bringing this country into the EEC that he opposed tooth and nail.</P>
    <P>We tried to review this dropping down of agricultural production, of food processing and the running down of industrial effort generally, the closing of factories here, there and everywhere throughout the country, in spite of the glad news the Minister for Industry and Commerce scattered around the west last week when he had returned from foreign parts.  Whether it was Australia, Japan or his spiritual home in Russia I cannot now remember.  At any rate he was announcing a lot of these pre-election phantom factories. As every Deputy knows the reality is that, as well as the statistic of registered unemployed which is at an unprecedentedly high figure&mdash;it may have varied a thousand or two in the last year or so&mdash;in the Coalition context, there have never been such unemployment figures as have been produced by them.</P>
    <P>Although that is so and although all of the Government's efforts should be aimed at encouraging investment, the expansion of industry and in particular the agricultural food processing industry, we have a situation of possibly 115,000 registered unemployed. Along with that we have perhaps 50,000 unregistered unemployed.  The Government deliberately monkeyed with the rules by which unemployed people come on to the unemployed register.  All the young people leaving school in the last couple of years, with a few fortunate exceptions, are now joining the growing army of disillusioned, frustrated, well-educated people.  That army will continue to grow and become more frustrated unless the Government, whatever Government that may be, take immediate, radical and dramatic steps to ensure that there is more employment, more development of industry and, above all, more development in agriculture because it is in that area the <Col N="1091" /> largest opportunity for employment reposes.</P>
    <P>In spite of the window-dressing, in spite of the phoney bonanzas trumpeted every time the Minister goes to Brussels, we have diminishing herd and sheep flocks and diminishing employment in the meat industry&mdash; and no other prospects&mdash;against the unpardonable Government policy of exporting calves in vast numbers because they are unable or unwilling to create conditions in which it would be unnecessary to export them.  I am not quarrelling with the people who will accept the highest market price available for their calves.  What I am quarrelling with, very bitterly and profoundly, is the situation that has developed under the Minister for Agriculture in which it is necessary and possible for Irish calf producers to sell their calves, thereby compromising the future dimensions of the Irish cattle herd on which the future prosperity of our agricultural economy ultimately depends.</P>
    <P>I charge the Government with direct responsibility for that.  It is a blow of such enormity that for the city Deputies in the Government it is difficult for them to comprehend it.  However, workers in Clover Meats in Waterford, in Slaney Meats in Bunclody, in Amalgamated Meats in Bagnalstown and in meat factories throughout the country know because their future and their jobs are involved.  There is a drop of nearly one million in the size of the herd since the National Coalition Government took over and this will be reflected in the level of employment in the meat factories throughout the country.  Unemployed butchers will have to walk the streets because of the Government's failure to take the necessary action.  They have allowed the process to continue that will ensure that the size of the herd in Ireland will continue to diminish. They have allowed a situation to develop where it pays Italians to feed Irish calves while it does not pay the Irish farmers to feed our animals. They are being exported hand over fist each day.  It will take Fianna Fáil at least three years to restore the Irish <Col N="1092" /> cattle herd.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>He is responsible to this Parliament.  The Parliamentary Secretary may not appreciate the importance of what I have said but the farmers and those in the food industry, particularly in the processing sector, will understand.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with one serious aspect of the fraudulent and false facade that has been put up by the Government with regard to farm profitability, the profits being made by farmers and the measures being taken to impose taxation on them.  I would remind the House that, as Minister for Agriculture in the previous Government, I said, and I repeat it now, that there is no way in which a situation can be justified that would impose a certain kind of taxation on one section while exempting another section.  A case cannot be made for exempting farmers or anybody else from taxation that applies to the community generally. I maintain that position and so do my party.  What we protested about then, and what we still protest about, is the imposition of double and treble taxation on the farming industry that is occurring at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of the facade of falsehood and deceit by the Government with regard to farm profitability, the situation is quite different.  However, it has given rise to the widespread belief that farmers are not taxed at all and, secondly, that they are getting away with murder in the matter of taxation. This belief has been taken up by people like Deputy Desmond from the Royal Borough of Kingstown and Senator Michael Mullen, the Taoiseach's personal Senator in the Upper House.  These people have been calling for a doubling and a trebling of taxation on farmers, partly to pander to what they think are the opinions of their constituents and perhaps in a sincerely mistaken belief that there is a situation that needs to be rectified. They are incapable of distinguishing <Col N="1093" /> between taxation of personal income and the taxation of a business project which may happen to be a farm.</P>
    <P>There are certain peculiarities surrounding the taxing of a farming business that do not apply to the taxation of people in other walks of life such as policemen, lawyers, dentists or doctors.  All lawyers need are a wig and a biro, and it is very doubtful if they need a wig, and they are in business. It is easy enough to get a degree. On the other hand, if a farmer wants to buy a tractor&mdash;he cannot operate his business without one&mdash;he will have to pay £1,000 tax and he will also have to pay tax on any other machinery he needs.  A farmer buys a good deal of machinery; a large part of his annual expenditure is on machinery and buildings and he must pay tax on them all. Policemen, dentists, doctors, school teachers and so on do not have to incur such expenditure and, therefore, they do not have to meet the same kind of taxation.</P>
    <P>A farmer's land is rated.  We have inherited the system of land taxation from the 1840s when the first rates were struck to build workhouses to help the starving people of those times. The system of raising funds for the grand juries of those days has survived up to the present.  Fianna Fáil have undertaken to the farming organisations that rates paid in this way can be claimed against income tax but the present Government have not seen it that way.</P>
    <P>Some peculiar anomalies have escaped the attention of Senator Mullen, the Taoiseach's personal Senator.  One of these is the exemption from all tax of some of the Taoiseach's personal friends&mdash;I am referring to the people in the blood-stock industry.  Because they happen to have the affection of Deputy Cosgrave, the Taoiseach, they do not pay tax and their projects are not taxed.  It is an outrage and an absolute disgrace.  People who are working hard to expand the real economy of the country are taxed, the people working in this House have to pay exorbitant tax, but the wealthiest class in the country are exempt because of <Col N="1094" /> their wealth.  The real reason, the most corrupt one of all, is because the Taoiseach has many personal friends in this area and he uses his position to see that they are exempt from paying tax.  A man trying to build up a herd of cattle or pigs or a flock of sheep will pay tax but the man running horses at Cheltenham or other places, the Taoiseach's friend, is exempt.  If these people are friendly enough with the Taoiseach he will put them into the Seanad also.</P>
    <P>This kind of disgraceful nepotism should be challenged even by a sincere man like Senator Mullen, when he is discussing taxation generally and the people from rural Ireland.  We all remember the posters on the walls during the 1973 election campaign: &ldquo;Cosgrave Puts the Nation First&rdquo; Where does he put the nation first? Who does he exempt?  Look where Cosgrave has put the nation.  I am quoting from the poster.</P>

      <P>I invite the representative of the Minister for Finance to tell us where the Taoiseach has put the nation.  His posters said: &ldquo;Cosgrave Puts the Nation First&rdquo;.  Where has he put us?  I submit he has reduced this nation to a state of beggary, where it now requires £1,200,000 per day to pay the debts raised by the Taoiseach and his colleagues in a cheap and shabby effort to purchase popularity.  We are spending vast sums of money.  Everybody knows that fraudulent practices in the payment of social welfare are widespread.  As far as my information goes in the city of Dublin there are only two civil servants to see that there are no fraudulent practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vast sums of money are being spent in the corrupt business of purchasing popularity.  There is no investment made in schools, hospitals or in the expansion of industry.  Work must be provided for our people.  Our young people want to work.  I believe if work is not provided that the day is coming when the people will take the law <Col N="1095" /> into their own hands.  I accuse the Government of flagrant dereliction of duty. I have not been unreasonable.  I have demonstrated, particularly in the field I know best, where statistics shout at one, that in the food industry, both primary production and processing afterwards, the situation certainly is not rosy.  We have seen the difficulties encountered by one of our biggest co-operative meat processing factories. We have seen the difficulties encountered by Clover Meats.  We have seen the passage of Golden Vale Meats in Rathdowney from co-operative ownership into multi-national ownership. It passed into the Guinness firm, who are multi-nationals.  While the huge Golden Vale complex are encountering very serious difficulties and other co-operatives are running into trouble the Government, as far as I know, have not lifted a finger or done anything to see that this vital organ of our future prosperity, the co-operative food processing industry, is put on a sensible basis.</P>
    <P>Last February my party published detailed proposals on how we would resuscitate the ailing co-operative industry and reorganise it.  We put those proposals before the farming organisations.  They have said that it is the first time that a serious and coherent effort has been made by any political party to put forward a workable plan for agriculture.  The decay of the food processing industry, particularly the co-operative ring of it, continues. The shareholders in the co-operatives have very little reason to be thankful to the co-operative industry as it is now constituted.  Some of the practices they engaged in during the 1975 crisis will be remembered for many a day.  I refer to the incapacity of co-operative members to get suitable cattle into their own factories while the management of those co-operatives made millions of pounds, in spite of their inefficiency in that particular year, by exploiting their members.  That kind of thing must stop as must also the general inefficiency which surrounds the co-operative industry.  I refer to the co-operative meat industry in particular.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1096" /> The Government have never given any evidence that they are aware of the seriousness of the situation.  One of the first things they did when they came into office was to load every Government board, in the agricultural sector and in other sectors, with political hacks.  I speak with full responsibility for boards set up during my period as Minister for Agriculture.  The political allegiance of the members was second to their competence as board members. All those people were swept aside and their places taken by hacks.  The most recent gesture of the Government is the setting up of the agricultural authority, for which a board will be established. I expect this will be managed by Fine Gael hacks.  That is treating our major industry with intolerable contempt.  I am confident when the voters of rural Ireland get their hands on the Government they will give them a salutary lesson and one they will never forget.  When they do those hacks I have been talking about will get short shift from the Fianna Fáil Government which will then come into power.</P>
    <P>We have a growing problem for the three million people in this part of Ireland of youth unemployment, declining industry and declining agriculture. We have certain resources which will help to arrest the decay of the economy.  We have the land, which is by far the biggest asset we have and the products from the land.  We have a large amount of first-class modern processing plant for processing those products.  We have the people on the land and the people in the food processing industries.  We have some minerals and possibly the prospect of some oil and marine gas.</P>
    <P>The use to which the Kinsale gas is being put by the Government is about as uneconomic as one could put it to. They are only getting a 30 per cent efficiency from bringing the gas from the sea to produce electricity.  That is the way they do it.  We have the fast buck here again.  We will have to organise those things, particularly the food production resources I have mentioned. We will have to be drastic in preventing the exploitation of land, which is the greatest resource we have, <Col N="1097" /> by speculators and chancers of every descripition.  These people have upped to more than £2,000 per acre the price of agricultural land.  The most dire effect of this exploitation is that it ensures the gradual but certain extinction of the small farmer.  We are on a course that will lead to the extinction of the rural population but Fianna Fáil will reverse that trend on their return to office shortly.  Regardless of whether the Taoiseach dissolves the Dáil this evening or waits until after the Ard-Fheis to dissolve it, we shall begin to reconstruct.  The task, though, is enormous and will require a great deal of courage not only on the part of politicians but on the part of the people themselves.  There will have to be the brutal facing up to the unsavoury facts.  It is in the area of moral courage that the Coalition have been most inadequate.  They have not the courage to tell the people what the real situation is.  Instead, we have had mumbo jumbo about bonanzas from Brussels. Admittedly, there is a good type of structure in Brussels but small thanks is due to the Labour Party for that. This country was led into the EEC by Fianna Fáil, not by the Coalition. However, there remains a decaying agriculture.  The processing industry, too, is in dire straits.  It is regrettable that not a member of the Government has seen fit to be present at any time today for this debate but, then, they are not interested in what the elected representatives have to say on these matters.  However, people more important than they&mdash;the electors&mdash; will have their day soon and I am convinced that they will give their answer in no uncertain manner to the National Coalition.</P>

      <P>This debate embraces a wide area.  In a sense, it is a second debate on the budget.  I wish to comment on the Bill from an administrative point of view but, first, I will make the point that, although I shall not be repeating the very valid points made so far in the debate from this <Col N="1098" /> side of the House, that does not mean, as the previous speaker said, that one is not impressed by the strength and the cogency of these various arguments.</P>
      <P>What strikes one first about the Finance Bill this year is that it is very different from the other Finance Bills that have been introduced by this Government.  If one makes comparisons at any level one finds a strong change in emphasis on the Minister's approach on this occasion compared with his approach in the budgets for the earlier years of this Government.</P>
      <P>I do not think that I am being cheap in any way when I say that there appears to be a peculiar coincidence that this should happen at this time. This change can be referred to as a deep-rooted change of heart but it is inefficient, incomplete and, may I say deliberately but in no way slightingly, incompetent.  It is a change that recognises the reality of the situation.</P>
      <P>During their early days the Coalition seemed to be dominated by a type of dectrinaire left-wing teaching.  Much out-dated dogma and action based thereon was played to what was considered to be the most populated gallery. We have seen the result of all that.  If we recall the budget of 1976 and the earlier budgets and if we analyse the situation what I am saying becomes very clear.  Those budgets were designed to hound what were referred to as the rich classes, particularly in the private sector.  In addition, there was a multiplication of public expenditure.  Deputy Gibbons has referred to the spending of public moneys for the sake of popularity without there being any proper controlling of such expenditure.  Also, there was the indiscriminate indulging in borrowing which leaves us with a massive national debt.  These policies were based on a point of view which was not practical and which was based on false theory.  Matters are so bad now that whichever government will be in office in the future will be faced with a critical situation on more than one front.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To revert to the change of heart that we are witnessing, in the past the <Col N="1099" /> Minister talked continually about the effects of inflation and found excuses in the generality of inflation in the world, particularly in Europe.  He now at last seems to recognise that one of the things stoking the fires of local inflation was his taxation policy, and this year he comes in to try to undo the damage done by a false concept which he apparently had in the beginning and the implementation of it in regard to the whole question of taxation. He said &ldquo;Government and private business are allies with different but complementary functions, sharing a common interest in the welfare of society&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach has harped on this theme outside the House as well.</P>
    <P>It is a terrible pity for this country that those thoughts were not more in evidence when the Coalition took office and embarked on their programme of running the country.  It is a terrible pity that that was not realised in time before many small private businesses had closed up, before the impact of taxation, personal and otherwise, was such as to stultify growth in that sector. It is a pity that those thoughts were not applied in the agricultural area which Deputy Gibbons has been dealing with in another way.  A little recognition of the true nature and basis of Irish farming might have left the State much more healthy than it is today.  I am not going to repeat in detail the reasons.  They have been given through the debate and anyone who wants to peruse the debate will find them.  There was a misconception here with regard to the real basis of the Irish farming industry and as a result precipitate and one-sided taxation policies were adopted, the cumulative result of which has been unfavourable to agricultural industry.  I leave it to those who know the details involved to speak of that.  I claim no such expert knowledge, but I can and will say that following on any mishandling in that area of our primary product, food for our people, there must be inevitably an adverse effect on consumer prices.  Nothing the Government have done in regard to agriculture has effectively improved that situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1100" /> There are things in the Bill and in the budget that it is right should be done and I am glad they are being done, but I am sorry that in many cases the measures for the beneficial provisions that we are enacting in this Bill are necessary because of mishandling by the Government and are nothing more than an attempt to redress or make amends for the mistakes of earlier years, particularly in the financial context.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that we find ourselves here with this situation.  If the policy that prompts this type of action here today had been generally adverted to when the Coalition came into office, then we might have a budget and a Bill that would not be, so to speak, a frantic, last-minute remedial effort but a constructive contribution to the development of the economy of the State and to the relief of all citizens who are naturally suffering from inflation and all the other things which are problems for all of us no less than for the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the phrase, &ldquo;Government and private business are allies with different but complementary functions&rdquo;.  What a pity that was not recognised earlier in the context of this doctrinaire socialism with its inefficiency, its expenditure and the payments that each and every one of us must make out of our pockets in the form of taxation as a tribute to the out-of-date as well as erroneous pet theories of certain groups.  This is what has happened.  It is playing politics at its very worst.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>It has become clear that traditional long established business catering in the main for the home market and not hitherto enjoying tax reliefs commensurate with those enjoyed by modern manufacturing industries producing for the export market ought to be helped by an improved tax climate.</P>
    <P>That was certainly not the situation, particularly when the Corporation Tax Act was being put through.  What was done there?  It was represented as a benefit, and in certain ways it was, but in the net it came out in Committee that there would be a little bonus rakeoff for the Exchequer.  This Bill in <Col N="1101" /> this respect and the Minister's speech give me much material for argument. In my younger days in the House I would have been only too glad to keep the House for hours with fact against fact and item against item.  That I do not intend to do today.  The point I make is that there is a change of thought here and it would not be right for me to pursue that to the point where it could be said, `Oh, well, the right thing has been done and you are complaining about that as well as the wrong thing&rdquo;.  Again I am glad to say that <i>pro tanto</i>&mdash;and it is only <i>pro tanto</i>&mdash;I am not to be taken in any way as considering that this Finance Bill and the budget are a marvellous contribution to the solution of our problems and a marvellous relief to taxpayers.  I fear it does not solve our problems and with regard to inflation and other problems such as the problems in labour negotiations that are and will be confronting all concerned in the years to come no matter who is on the Government benches it will be found that some very necessary reliefs have been given and I am glad they are there because they represent some evidence of rational thinking which, late and all as it is, is to be commended and encouraged.  Unfortunately that is not sufficiently sustained to convey any hope that it will continue and that more realistic views will prevail than in recent years.</P>
    <P>That is the first reaction one has to the Bill and the budget.  In regard to the actual situation in general terms, I cannot share the Minister's optimism, particularly in regard to unemployment. I sincerely hope he is right.  He informed us in his introductory statement:</P>
    <P>The EEC as a whole expects unemployment to rise this year.  There are only three exceptions to this discouraging picture&mdash;Ireland, Germany and Holland.  With the growing momentum of our economy we anticipate that our unemployment figures will over the next few months fall below the 100,000 mark for the first time in two and a half years.</P>
    <P>I should like some reassurance on a few points in that respect.  I should like to be sure that the figures he has <Col N="1102" /> taken are a realistic reflection of the true state of employment and unemployment here.  Obviously some convention has to be adopted when dealing with figures of this nature and I am not suggesting for a moment that any other procedure can be adopted, but I am asking whether the method of computation of the figures is realistic.</P>
    <P>Dr. Geary and his colleagues recently in a report, in a television interview and widely reported on radio and in the Press, appeared to show that the true figure is considerably higher.  Indeed, I have a figure of 150,000 echoing in my mind.  Unemployment, like a lot of things, is unfortunately a reality and I hope the Government realise that and that they will not mishandle this reality as they have others by relying on conventional measures.  Unemployment is still a menacing problem for us, quite apart from the general situation in the community.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a discrepancy between ministerial statements on employment and unemployment and the figures daily reported.  Again I ask the basis on which the Minister can make such a statement.  I ask is it realistic in real terms.  Many Deputies have spoken about this major social problem, and Deputy Gibbons a few moments ago only echoed what a lot of people are thinking when they point to what is happening to young people, to those whom Deputy Gibbons referred to as the educated unemployed. This is a frightening problem. It is a problem of a generation in its prime, the ruling generation of the day, considering that when it has passed its prime it will pay in another way for its failure in its prime.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Gibbons used the word &ldquo;revolution&rdquo;.  I have used that word in other debates.  One does not want to create scares, but I ask every Deputy to think of his responsibility and of what will be the likely consequences of the continuing output from our schools of people who have been equipped to think, who have the youth and the energy and the desire to make their way in life but who find themselves in an environment where they cannot exercise their intelligence <Col N="1103" /> and their abilities or fulfil their mission in life as human beings.  Traditional alternatives are denied to them.  The need for these alternatives were regretted by us in the past, but at least they were safety valves and it was our great hope in the past that we would no longer need these safety valves, that here there would be a great future for the younger generation, that there would be an opportunity to make Ireland an example of human progress, of what virile people could do in their own country when they had the room to do it.  Sadly, that ambition has not been realised.</P>
    <P>Instead we have the menace of these pressures on us.  There is not a Deputy among us who has not had young people coming to him almost pathetically pleading for some outlet, some job. It is no longer a question of looking for plums but for something that will keep them from being beggars.  With the realism of youth they realise that if they are living on subsidised social benefits, no matter how generous they are or how comfortable they may make their personal situation, dependence on them is degrading in status&mdash;they are reduced to the status of beggars.</P>
    <P>These are frightening things, yet here we are with the annual budget, with the millstone of debt around our necks, neglecting the fundamentals.  I mentioned the agricultural sector, for which I do not claim any competence to speak with any expertise.  There are other industrial areas also and the situation there has been largely contributed to by the concepts of this Government since their inception, by their false ideas.  One finds it very hard to see how adequate remedies for youth unemployment can be found and implemented in what I conceive to be the very short time left to the Government. Deputy Gibbons warned that, unless this Parliament and the people through their representatives can cope, our system will be found wanting.  We have a deep-rooted change in mentality which I welcome and hope will continue. I regret that this change has come at such a late hour.  The Minister for Finance said in his speech that a careful balance will have to be maintained <Col N="1104" /> to preserve a sensible level of public expenditure and a tolerant level of taxation.  That is another small indication of a return to reality.</P>
    <P>The Book of Estimates will show what is left in the area of public expenditure. Remembering the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's sensitivity to speakers drifting towards Estimates, I will anticipate his having to admonish me and I will not pursue it, except to refer to the source.  What about the efficiency of the public service, and the extra load of work that has been generated by what this Government have done?  What have this Government done to what was a very efficient and expeditious Department, the Revenue Department?  Tax law was changed indiscriminately and tax was loaded on to all sorts of people.  The Minister seemed to have a fix on what he called tax evasion.  In the end a lot of the tax evasion was created by the Minister, because he killed the goose that laid the golden egg.  Very serious problems have been created for the Revenue Commissioners by these changes in tax law, and delays have bedevilled them.  A Department which could so pride themselves on their efficiency in the past are having to swim very hard in an adverse current. A huge amount of unproductive energy is going into the administration of practically every business.  Many accountants are more than busy because of the Bills the Minister has brought forth and this Dáil has undiscerningly passed.</P>
    <P>The public service bill has gone up, but has public service efficiency gone up correspondingly?  If it has not, it is not all the fault of the public service itself.  Every Deputy who votes here is responsible.  Every Deputy on that side of the House is responsible for the legislation he voted through in support of this Minister for Finance.  There is a limit to making the Minister the scapegoat.  Everyone behind the Minister is as responsible, because without them these things would not have been done.  No Deputy can wash his hands of responsibility.  In the eyes of the public all Deputies, because of this performance, will be critically viewed by the public.  If changes come or are forced by the young unemployed or <Col N="1105" /> anybody else, it will be because of the way Parliament has been divided into two groups who have marched to the tune of a Minister and the Government of which he is a part.</P>
    <P>We have overdone the system where a Minister comes in and insists on his point of view and his cohorts, with the discipline of the Prussian Guards of old, will march behind him into the lobby.  That may be very admirable discipline, but is it good parliamentary practice?  The inevitability of a Government and an Executive taking an attitude towards the House&mdash;an attitude, which unfortunately, has been growing over a large number of years in democratic parliaments&mdash;that the minions are simply to be commanded has resulted in a reduction of the status and usefulness of the Members.  To all intents and purposes they are ignored and the Minister is thrown completely into the hands of the administration, the permanent service.</P>
    <P>Very often in cases like that it is an illusion for the Minister to think he is anything himself but a rubber stamp. There is a certain irony in this.  If Ministers and the Executive will insist on reducing Parliament to being a rubber stamp they, in turn, become rubber stamps for the permanent administration. I say that advisedly but, nevertheless, without the slightest adverse reflection on the administration. The reflection is on us, on Deputies in this House.  The administration have their job to do.  They have their sphere.  They cannot do our job.  In effect, we are asking them to do both.</P>
    <P>As I say, I am slipping imperceptibly from the substance to the administrative forms.  Now I come to them directly.  In the old days, in the original conception, a Finance Bill was meant to implement the budget.  The legitimate contents of a Finance Bill were the necessary amendments of rates of taxation reliefs, the type of things which were strictly budgetary, and also amendment of tax law but with discrimination.  There it stopped. I remember Deputies from the Parliamentary Secretary's party complaining with some of the rest of us, when they were on this side of the House, that <Col N="1106" /> too much was being slipped into Finance Bills; there was too much legislation by reference, too much loophole-plugging and too much slipped in for the mere convenience of the Administration.</P>
    <P>I fear that, in spite of those protests from parliamentarians on both sides of the House in the past&mdash;and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will remember some members of his own party who spoke very strongly on these lines &mdash;we have now come to the stage where we have a budget, a budget debate and then a Finance Bill which, in effect, is the financial legislation for the year which is a complicated document and difficult to handle in the form it is in because it is largely legislation by reference, and it covers a very wide field.  In turn, the debate on it becomes a second budget debate which, again, is wasteful of parliamentary time.</P>
    <P>I wonder will the Leas-Cheann Comhairle permit me to make this reference to Estimates.  I made it the other day in an aside.  While this is going on, while we are having the duplicate budget debate, to some extent ineffective&mdash;we have a mass of legislation in this Bill which needs disentangling&mdash;at the same time the House cannot find time to discuss the individual Estimates and to take the expenditure and the accounts of the State in any kind of ordered fashion. I want to point out to the House that our financial business has got into a chaotic state, a haphazard state.  Very often in panic we are bringing in and passing financial legislation at the expense of the homogeneity of the whole code.  This is something which must be looked at in a broader way.</P>
    <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle might be very much within his rights if he told me I cannot pursue that very far and perhaps I should take it up on the Appropriation Bill.  The Appropriation Bill usually goes through in ten minutes before we break up for a vacation so, again, I will ask your indulgence, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in making this reference.  Suffice to say&mdash; because I want to keep within the rules of order&mdash;that there is a very urgent need for a thorough look at the <Col N="1107" /> way this House does its financial business, not only from the public point of view and the point of view of the control of public expenditure and the point of view of the control of the Dáil in that area, but also from the point of view of the administration who need stability, who need certainty, who need to be in a position to have an estimate of when they can bring business to the House and when they cannot.  I have seen this matter from two points of view here in the House itself and in Committees.  In fairness to the civil service, they are suffering very much from the problems resulting from&mdash;and I am a Member of the House and I share the blame as well as everybody else&mdash;I can only say the inefficiency of Dáil Éireann in handling the financial business of the State.</P>
    <P>Strictly within the rules of order, this should be a rather difficult Bill to discuss on Second Stage.  The Second Stage should be short for two reasons. The substantive matters I have mentioned should have been disposed of in the budget debate.  The Finance Bill should have followed more quickly.  There has been an inordinate gap between the two for whatever reason I know not.  If we were doing our business efficiently, the Finance Bill should have followed more the budget in which case the substantive discussion would have taken place on the budget and a businesslike Bill would be before us and we could dispose of it in a businesslike manner. Instead, we had what I have called an inordinate delay.  We have had a second budget debate and now we have a complex Bill which cannot be disposed of in an orderly and businesslike fashion because of the way we are placed at the moment.</P>
    <P>In fact, it is very difficult to dissect it.  Instinctively anyone who has had some acquaintance with the method of operation of our finances says: &ldquo;There are things in this Bill which are proper to a Finance Bill and there are other things which are not.  Can we sort them?&rdquo; On looking into it, I find we have developed to a stage where a cleancut sorting is not very easy.  If <Col N="1108" /> we look at the contents we find that the first three sections are amendments of something else.  In these cases they are proper to a Finance Bill. Then we go on to corporation profits tax.  Part of the amendment is very proper to a Finance Bill in so far as it relates to the rates of incidence of tax. I question whether much of what is put in in regard to corporation profits tax is proper to this Bill.  We went to the trouble of trying to order our taxation legislation by having an income tax code as embodied in the Income Tax Act, 1967.  I think that is the date but I am not quite sure.  We have a Corporation Profits Tax Act.  We have a Wealth Tax Act.  We have a Capital Gains Tax Act and a Capital Acquisitions Tax Act.  All these Acts were nicely ordered and had the semblance of being what you might call a homogeneous code.  Here we are amending the lot of them, income tax, corporation profits tax and capital gains tax. There is reference to the Wealth Tax Act.  That could be quite legitimate in a Bill of this nature.</P>
    <P>This Bill has developed into a complex mixture of what should be in it and what should not in so far as it contains legislation which should more properly be separate.  It is confusing and mixing up existing codes that we have set up.  It seems to me to be not exactly orderly.  If one thinks of the Finance Bill as being narrowly a Bill to implement the budget, all of what I have said is sustainable.  I can, however, understand somebody taking issue with me in regarding a Finance Bill in that light.  That would bring me into a wider area.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a suggestion <i>en passant.</i> The way we are developing we may need two types of Bill, a Finance Bill immediately after the budget and something that I might call an administrative Bill that would deal with some of the complications, that would plug loopholes, deal with certain types of evasion and other adjustments of that nature.  Where there are specific statutes, conceived as consolidated measures, such as the Corporation Profits Tax Act or the Wealth Tax Act or the Capital Gains Tax Act, it would be preferable to <Col N="1109" /> amend them specifically.  It would not take very much more time and it would stop duplication in debate and make the job of the Chair, which incidentally has become much more difficult as a result of our approach to this kind of business, a much easier matter.</P>
    <P>These are general points.  Specific matters will and should arise on Committee Stage.  The Bill should be largely a Committee Bill.  As I said, I did not intend to make a long contribution to this debate.  I have commented essentially on two things: the change of attitude of the Minister and the Government at this time and the relative improvement that is evident in the measures before us and in the budget.  I have also commented on the House's responsibility in financial matters and the deficiencies which I conceive in that area.  I have commented on the adverse situation from the point of view of resources, and the national debt in particular, and the menacing problems of employment and unemployment, growth and output as against decline.  These problems must be faced by the Government.</P>
    <P>Finally, I must ask this question. Whoever brings it in, what does the next budget hold, particularly if it is to be brought in by the present Government? I must say that I would be disturbed at the attitude of a Government and a Minister who have had such a record over the past four years &mdash;misconceptions and severity resulting in serious financial load and embarrassment to the economy as a whole and specifically to the individual citizen, whether he is regarded as a taxpayer, a consumer, a worker or anything else.</P>
    <P>We find then such a budget on the eve of an election and it is conceded that in any event this year, or at the latest the early part of 1978, must see a reference to the people.  It is not unreasonable to express a fear and to wonder if when the next budget comes in it will be as favourable or whether the cup being brought home, so to speak, then the doors may be locked and the penal and damaging measures that we on this side of the House protested <Col N="1110" /> against two and three years ago will be enforced.</P>
    <P>With all that in mind, can something like that be expected if this Government are returned?  These are legitimate thoughts.  Anyone who asks this question is asking a reasonable question.  If he wants a reasonable answer let him study the facts and the record and assess them for himself. I would be very disturbed merely as a citizen&mdash;I am not talking about my present capacity&mdash;in the days before a budget to be introduced by the present Minister for Finance and his Government. I would be very much afraid.  I would hope that such fears would not be grounded but I fear the situation has got so bad that the problem confronting the next Government, no matter who they are, will be intimidating indeed.  It behoves us all to approach this election with our feet on the ground and with a cool assessment. As Deputy Gibbons said, where youth and the educated unemployed are concerned, this election may be one of the most critical in the history of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister for Finance introduced his budget this year he presented it with such a flourish that it seemed to everyone that he was distributing something of his own or something that he himself had created with his own hand and his own effort.  That was one of the illusions in a whole patchwork of deceit, the results of which may be an economic milestone tied around the necks of the taxpayers of this nation for many years to come.  This budget, labelled as the &ldquo;election give-away&rdquo;, was possible because the expected deficit did not materialise.  I should like to give what I think is a suitable title for the whole affair.  It should be known as the saga of revenue buoyancy inflated by mismanagement and deceit and designed to keep one afloat in a sea of inefficiency.  That should be the label of this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us ask one question&mdash;did the deficit really go away or is it that, convinced that the political strategy in an election year would require a give-away approach, we did not look very seriously <Col N="1111" /> perhaps at what there was to give away at the time of the budget? Any account that shows revenue and expenditure alone would not be accepted as evidence of the well being of any commercial concern.  Any first year student of accountancy could tell you that the balance sheet is the real basis for assessment.  The balance sheet gives the whole picture.  That is why there are legal obligations imposed on the people who sign and certify the balance sheet of any company or commercial concern.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in presenting his budget, has not complied with the standards legally required of the directors of any company in filing their annual accounts.  He has made no provision whatever in the form of a charge against revenue of a loss of more than £300 million incurred by State agencies and guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>What would anyone expect would happen to the director of any company being aware of a loss of more than £300 million, the said director making no mention of it in the accounts produced for the period in which the loss occurred, and furthermore making no provision for its recovery in the product pricing policy for the future trading period which would be under discussion? Such a situation exists in regard to the accounts of the nation.  I would like to draw your attention to pages 8 and 9 of the Central Bank Report for 1976 and to the notes relating to the need to provide for massive amounts to meet repayments of foreign borrowings, the true cost of which has escalated because of devaluation of sterling since the loans were first obtained. Most of this increase occurred in the year 1976.  In table 6, page 8, we see that the total of foreign borrowing on 31st December, 1976, is shown as £781.6 million, but the note on the right hand side of the page reads:</P>
    <P>Figures are the Irish £ equivalent of loans at the time each loan was contracted. Where repayments of capital have taken place, the remaining amount outstanding is expressed in <Col N="1112" /> the original Irish £ equivalent.  It is estimated that when exchange rate changes are taken into account, the amount outstanding is £1,028 million.</P>
    <P>Not £781 million.  Deducting £781.6 million from £1,028 million we get a figure of £246.4 million of a deficit which is not accounted for in the budget.  In page 9 of the same Central Bank Report it says that the total outstanding external debt of State-sponsored bodies is £299 million.  Again the note on the left hand side reads:</P>
    <P>Figures are the Irish £ equivalent of loans at the time each loan was contracted. Where repayments of capital have taken place, the remaining amount outstanding is expressed in the original Irish £ equivalent.  It is estimated that when exchange rate changes are taken into account the amount outstanding was of the order of £323 million.</P>
    <P>Not £229 million as shown on the right hand side of the page.  If we add £94 million, which is the difference between £229 million and £323 million, to the £246 million, the deficit on page 8, the total figure is £340 million of a deficit which is not accounted for or mentioned at all by the Minister.  Most of this increase occurred in 1976.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government over the past four years have given the impression that in assuming office they also assumed the ownership of this country. The personality projections engaged in by different Ministers during this time has confirmed this belief.  The Minister for Finance has been portrayed for the last four years as the taker of everything, and now in this budget he has been converted into the giver.  The last straw must surely have been the appearance, on the lines of a modern slave trader, of the Minister for Labour at every breakfast table lately with his offer of £20 per head to the people.</P>
    <P>The Coalition do not own this country. They are only the trustees for the time being, and it is on their conduct of the nation's affairs as the said trustees that they will be duly judged. The liability of future taxpayers is one <Col N="1113" /> of the consequences of their misrule and the millstone that is tied around the taxpayers from now on.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly exposed the Government's failure to deal with the effects of the energy crisis.  I argued time and again that the Coalition did not know what it was all about, and this has been proved to be correct.  I was fobbed off on these occasions and told that the stock profits ramp that I illustrated was incorrect.  I was supposed to be imagining these figures here in this House and pulling them out of the sky.</P>
    <P>The same energy crisis has now become an excuse for all our economic ills according to the Minister for Finance.  This Government, and particularly the Minister for Industry and Commerce through the Prices Commission, did not take into account these stock profits when granting huge price increases, not only for petrol but for all sorts of heavy fuel oil, indeed, all products of a barrel of oil that were necessary because of the OPEC oil increases starting with the oil crisis in 1973.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance to the Business Section of last Sunday's <i>Sunday Times</i> which indicates that the Shell Oil Company in their accounts for the first three months of 1977 made a stock profit of £80 million.  That can be read in the <i>Sunday Times</i> by anyone who disbelieves what I have been saying over the last three years about these stock profits.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce did not take this into account. At that time I proved conclusively how important it was to save petrol consumers the burden of paying for increases by first taking the stock profits into account.  We should not let the Government forget this.  The consumers have had to pay for this inefficiency. All this happened since the energy crisis, which is the reason for most of our economic ills, according to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The real truth is that the Minister for Finance is responsible for the greatest percentage increase on petrol <Col N="1114" /> prices&mdash;60p since 1973.  He has done more damage than the OPEC countries or the multinational oil companies by this extra taxation, not least of which was the increase of 15p per gallon introduced three years ago.  The excuses put forward for this increase in taxation were laughable.  It was said that petrol users from the Six Counties were coming into the Twenty-six Counties to buy petrol because it was cheaper.  The Minister had the audacity to tell us that this had an adverse effect on our balance of payments. The other reason put forward was that the people would use less.  Government policy at that time was: the more you tax them the less they use.  Neither of these reasons proved to be the correct one.  Because of this taxation a gallon of petrol here is 10 pence dearer than it is in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Has anything been done to ensure that this will not happen again or will not be allowed to continue?  No, nothing has been done.  We are in the same position as we were in October, 1973. We are, as the Minister for Transport and Power said then still at the mercy of the multinational oil companies.  At that time we were very quick to say that the first necessity for our economic good should be self-sufficiency in refining capacity.  But no, not one single step has been taken in this direction to gain control of supplies or costs of these vital products, which are so necessary, and will continue to be necessary for a considerable time to come.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and Transport and Power were in cahoots and seemed to be unable to understand my arguments not only on the stock profits but what should be done about them.</P>
    <P>The Shell Oil Company published stock profits of £80 million for the first three months of this year.  This has been happening here for the last three years.  The Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Transport and Power failed to take this into account when they were presented with a seven days' notice from this company for an increase in prices of their products&mdash; petrol, fuel oil and so on.  It is the business of any good accountant to present a true picture of the situation <Col N="1115" /> in any firm.  It is the business of the Minister for Finance to do the same when presenting the budget.  This company presented their stock profits and would have presented stock losses if that had been the case.</P>
    <P>It follows therefore that the Minister's action could at best be described as deceitful and at worst fraudulent. He presented a set of figures to this House which took no account of an accumulation of exchange deficits. The impression was created that suddenly on a given day in January, the day of the budget, by some miracle everything in the garden had suddenly become rosy.  Never in the history of this nation have losses of such a magnitude occurred.  I condemn the dishonesty of any Government acting as trustees of affairs of a State to resort to what is nothing but what could be described as bucket shop standards of practice.  Political expediency has pledged our future.  Now, at the eleventh hour, we find there has been the gravest abandonment of financial accountability.  People in ivory towers often believe their own deceptions, and this is the greatest danger of all.</P>
    <P>The Coalition have succeeded in fuelling the inflation which has brought the country to the brink of economic disaster in the last four years.  Instead of having a plan to get us out of the mess we are in, they are setting headlines believing that because they say so, the trouble of the past four years never happened and suddenly we are back to the same level of economic development as we were four years ago.</P>
    <P>The people of Ireland, the electorate, will not forget what has happened since this Government took office.  We all admit there was a world economic recession and that the oil crisis affected us, but we had opportunities to correct many of the ills which had befallen us.  We discovered natural gas off the south coast.  What has happened to the supply of natural gas?  We said what we thought should be done with it, but the Government did not listen.  We said a gas grid should be created to benefit people living in <Col N="1116" /> cities which had a gas system, such as Dublin.  We said that natural gas should be used to the maximum benefit for the economic good of the country. Again the Government did not listen to us.  What has happened to the Dublin Gas Company since the ESB were given 70 per cent of this natural gas to generate electricity?  By giving the ESB 70 per cent the Government were ensuring that this 70 per cent would be completely wasted in generating electricity.  We also pointed out that no country in the EEC is permitting natural gas to be used to generate electricity except countries that had permitted it up to ten years previously.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, but it is clear that the Deputy is straying very far from the Finance Bill, which deals primarily with taxation measures arising from the budget.  The budget debate is over.  I have allowed the Deputy a good deal of latitude and he is raising matters concerning energy which would be more appropriate on the appropriate Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I was merely emphasising the importance of using natural resources for the economic benefit of the country in order to avoid further taxation and make our industry more competitive for the overall good of the economy and particularly with a view to providing low cost energy.  Energy costs are proving a heavy burden on all our industries and are causing our products to be less competitive in world markets. Therefore, in the interests of all, it is the Government's duty to make the maximum use of any natural resources we have in order to lower the burden of taxation.  This is what I intended to point out and I think, with respect, it is very important that a resource such as natural gas should be used for the maximum benefit. Finally, on this subject I wish to refer to an article in the business page of last Sunday's <i>Sunday Independant</i> which agreed completely with what we have been putting forward for the last three or four years.  It made the same criticism as we made three years ago about giving access to 70 per cent of this natural gas to the ESB for a 70 <Col N="1117" /> per cent wastage.  I hope it is not too late to change that decision.</P>
      <P>Creation of employment is part of the duty of the Minister for Finance as well as of the other Ministers and of the Government as a whole.  I should like the position clarified regarding the smelter about which we hear so much and which could create much employment if it were built and put into use.  This is a very important matter for the country because again it would reduce the taxation burden for many people if we had maximum use of our natural resources.  Also, by creating self-sufficiency in refining capacity we would be creating a good deal of downstream industry, which in turn would generate more employment. The more employment we create the more people are earning money and are in a position to bear their share of the tax burden which must be borne by those in a position to pay tax.  More employment is vital for this economy and the only way to create it is by more investment.  We have certain opportunities to do this. One is to get the smelter on stream as quickly as possible and another is that downstream industries would arise from further refining capacity.</P>
      <P>If we are serious about creating more employment those are means by which it could be done.  It should be clear to any Government that it is urgently necessary to get this project under way.  It is important for all our people.  The more we have at work, the fewer will be dependent on social welfare, unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  These payments must be financed by taxation.  If we continue to have growing numbers dependent on unemployment benefit and assistance we will need greatly increased taxation to meet the bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After four years of Coalition Government it is only fair to say that they have failed the country.  They failed to take measures to correct the serious economic trends we have had.  More particularly, as was mentioned by two previous speakers, they failed to take any steps to provide employment for young school leavers, who are educated for jobs that are not available.  It is the Government's duty to ensure that employment <Col N="1118" /> opportunities are available for school leavers.  There is grave danger in continuous idleness forced on these people through no fault of their own.  The Government had the opportunity of doing something about this but instead they waited for things to right themselves.  That does not happen. Necessary action must be taken and this they have not done.  Now that we are facing an election the ordinary wage-earners and the plain people of the country must be under no illusion as to what has happened in the past three or four years.  This is their opportunity to judge those who have been in Government during those years and to cast their votes for their own good and the good of all the people.</P>
    <P>The budget and the Finance Bill which followed gave the appearance that everything in the garden had suddenly become rosy, but there is a total of £300 million which is not taken into account in the budget and to which no reference is made.  This is money borrowed by the State and State bodies and, because of the fall in the value of the £ sterling, deficiencies must be made good either by capital repayments or interest.  Neither the budget nor the Finance Bill refer to this and that represents improper accounting that would not be permitted by any commercial concern.  No accounting firm would put their name to this kind of balance sheet which shows only revenue and expenditure. Like the board of any commercial concern, the Government have a duty to put the financial situation properly before the Members of this House and the people instead of trying to create the illusion that everything was going so well.  That illusion was created on a day in January last while at the same time hidden at the back of the Bill and found in the Central Bank Report for 1976&mdash;the pages I refer to are pages 8 and 9&mdash;there is a deficit of £340 million of which there has been no mention.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that it has not been mentioned it will have to be produced by the Minister for Finance ultimately because of guarantees given when the moneys were borrowed.  The only way <Col N="1119" /> he can produce it is by taxing the people, if not this year, next year. Deputy de Valera referred to the mixed budget of next January.  It will be a very interesting budget when the true picture emerges after the general election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I endeavoured to ascertain information from various Government Departments in relation to the number of people living below the poverty line and found it disheartening that the Government themselves are unaware of the enormous problem in the community.  I did some rough calculations from a reply to a question to the Taoiseach yesterday in regard to the total number drawing unemployment assistance in April, 1977.  The reply was that on 6th May last the number of applicants was 50,607.  Multiply that by four&mdash;the average family&mdash;and we find there are 202,440 people affected by assistance. Therefore, the figure I was given yesterday does not give the global picture. In other words, we have 200,000 people living below the poverty line.</P>
      <P>One survey of the situation is recorded in the NPC report for January, 1977.  It relates to the economic aspects and the dietary intake of old people.  In the first page it is stated that those on fixed incomes are affected adversely by inflation and that between 10,000 and 20,000 old people require immediate help.  It states that in regard to old people of more than 65 years of age, the frequency of energy deficiency is 33 per cent.  This is high by any standards.  It means that one third of the people interviewed in the survey were suffering from under-nutrition. Yet the Government have failed to reveal these facts.</P>
      <P>In relation to protein intake the survey revealed that one-third of the people of more than 65 years of age were suffering from inadequate diet and that because of the deficiency they may be at serious risk of malnutrition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>Will the Deputy please relate his remarks to the Finance Bill which is essentially a taxation measure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks are <Col N="1120" /> properly related to it because it is a measure to raise taxation and I am speaking about the inadequate financing of services from taxation.  I am indicating that the Bill is ineffective from the point of view of dealing with our greatest underlying problem.  The survey tells us that more than 45 per cent of the subjects interviewed of more than 65 years suffered from iron deficiency, and in relation to vitamin C more than half the sample, 56.7 per cent, were suffering from deficiency. As many as 73 per cent of the people interviewed were suffering from dietary deficiencies of one kind or another.  We can add to that the 200,000 people I have mentioned who are living below the poverty line.  That figure of 73 per cent was subject to 24-hour recalls.</P>
      <P>Therefore, there are people starving in our cities and throughout the country and a large number of others are on the borders of starvation.  Here we have a Bill of enormous magnitude yet this very important section are not being catered for.  Perhaps the Government are unaware of this but I would ask the Minister to read this NPC report to make himself aware of the grave problems of the aged.  It is appalling that in 1977 the Minister has to be told that almost 200,000 people are starving.  In that background the Minister calls this a great budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The survey report I have been referring to was published by the NPC and I am sure it was compiled by responsible people.  Let the Minister relate these figures to the great budget of last spring and he will get his answer.  That budget and this Bill have assisted the wealthy and victimised the poor.  No corrective measures have been taken to ensure a reasonable standard of comfort for those old people in their dying days.  Do they not matter to the Government?  Are they only concerned with people who will vote for them? Perhaps these people are considered too ill, too infirm and do not matter any more. But they matter to us here and to the thinking public; they matter to the people who matter.  When the day of reckoning comes the Minister and the Government will get their answer <Col N="1121" /> from the people concerned about the downtrodden masses indicated in this report.</P>
    <P>So much for that report and the information which the Government either have not at their disposal or will not make available to the public. Every Government must and should have this information from surveys carried out.  If they have not, then they have callously neglected their responsibilities to our aged people.  I charge the Minister with callous neglect because he has said he has not the information.  It is about time he had and that he woke up to the fact that there are almost 200,000 people living below the poverty line.  That is the situation demonstrated in this report. It is a lengthy report and I shall not deal with it in any greater depth. I am certain that, if one of the people affected were to read that report, on coming to the last pages they would be horrified to see another 46 price increases allowed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and they would observe also substantial increases in every aspect of life affecting them.  It shows clearly that their lot must be worsened from the date of publication of that booklet.</P>
    <P>What has been done since to relieve the situation?  What have the Minister and the Government done?  What moneys have been made available since that date to meet the terrible situation recorded in this official publication? They have done nothing; they have a callous disregard for their duty.  Only when we are afforded an opportunity of presenting the true situation will justice be done, and it will be done quickly and effectively when that time arrives.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance no less than any other Minister&mdash;and I have tried to extract information from many Departments without success&mdash;is culpable in this respect.  Listening to the Minister for Finance yesterday, when he read out the long list of social welfare benefits he had increased since he took office, one would think he had done wonderful things.  Whatever he may have done for other sections of our society entitled to increased benefits to meet the ever spiralling <Col N="1122" /> cost of living, he did nothing for the group about whom I am speaking.  At this juncture there is no point in giving a man an increase of a shilling; one must move with the times, with price increases and with inflation.  At present large sections of our people on social welfare benefits are not getting their entitlement to meet ever increasing costs while others are receiving moneys to which they are not entitled. There must be carried out a realistic assessment of the situation to ensure that those in need get the assistance they deserve.  No amount of whitewashing by the Minister will cloud that fact, as he tried to do yesterday when in reply to a question he rattled off a load of statistics for which he was not asked, but failed to impart to the House the vital statistics Members had been seeking for so long: the number of people living below the poverty line.  I know the Government set up a commission some time ago. Indeed, they set up many other commissions and committees to examine various situations.  But here they are confronted in concrete terms with a terrible problem about which they have done nothing.  Even at this late stage is the Minister prepared to make concessions to the starving population of our city, as indicated in that report? If he does not, he will have fallen down completely on his responsibilities to the nation as a whole.  Or will he proceed on the basis that there will be selectivity in relation to the people who will receive the benefits, that they will get benefits on the basis that they will be bribed to support the Government in election campaigns, disregarding those who are starving?  Even those he has tried to bribe in the budget and since would take exception to the fact that their parents, relatives, or fellow Irish men and women are condemned to a living hell because they have not sufficient on which to exist.</P>
    <P>Let us take a look at those employed here.  The national wage agreement brought in recently was another &ldquo;con&rdquo; job, when members of the Labour Party ran to and fro with full information about the upward spiral in the cost of living, without any information in relation to the increases <Col N="1123" /> about to take place, advising their members that such increases could not be implemented.  Then, when the agreement was signed, we found that that upward spiral continued so that the benefits of the pay agreement were eroded, leaving people 5 per cent or 6 per cent worse off than they were beforehand.  That is the type of &ldquo;con&rdquo; job that has been done time and again by members of the Fine Gael and Labour parties.  That will have to cease at an early date.  Honesty must be injected into Irish politics.  We must take an honest approach to the problem, ensuring that our people are fully informed and are aware of trends and tendencies.  Of course, in many cases trends will not be available for many years to come.</P>
    <P>The question of a census which can indicate trends and guide people along certain avenues in relation to the variety of problems confronting the nation has been put in abeyance.  This has been put off for some reason unknown to Members of this House, or indeed the country at large, known only to an irresponsible Government. No responsible Government would endeavour to turn back the clock so that our people would not have statistics that were accurate, up to date, allowing an assessment of trends in our society and ensuring, in turn, that economic and other policies could be implemented correcting the ways in which we tend to go wrong.</P>
    <P>I am sure workers see clearly now that they are at a great disadvantage, having accepted the word of some of the people who participated in discussions before the wage agreement was finalised, having taken the word of Ministers and other Members of this House based on incorrect information. We cannot hope to establish sound industrial relations on the basis of deceit. It is on the basis of honesty we must tackle all our problems, economic or otherwise.  We must be honest with our workers, employers, the aged and ourselves.  Unless some sense of honesty is demonstrated then we shall be heading for an explosion within our society, with terrible consequences.</P>
    <P>We know what happened in other <Col N="1124" /> countries when people were mislead and callously neglected, as is being done here at present.  I would have hoped that the trade unions and trade unionists by now would have seen the folly of their ways in accepting the word of Members of this House and that of others who were a party to this agreement and who misled them. We cannot conceal the facts of the situation for all time; they will be discovered. When this Government go out of power in the very near future we will be able to present our people with the facts of the situation, having examined the files in depth to ascertain the real tragedy confronting the country.  In many deceptive ways the Government have been concealing from this House and the public, the real problem with which we are confronted, ensuring that no remedial measures can be taken because of lack of information.  The workers have been conned and there are 150,000 people in need of jobs.  Little has been done except to issue a photograph of Michael O'Leary to the newspapers. That is the sole contribution of the Government towards helping to reduce the number of unemployed.</P>

      <P>I am totally dissatisfied with the Government with regard to the matter that was questioned in this House recently.  I am sure the 150,000 people unemployed will not be too happy about it.  They have little to be happy about in looking at a picture of a Minister indicating that £20 will be available in certain circumstances. It is rather like the soldier who gets six ounces of bread per day, perhaps.</P>
      <P>I am quite sure that the FUI and industrialists generally are intelligent people.  They knew since last January that this scheme was in operation.  If it had any credibility or if the employers thought it was viable they would have made use of it.  Perhaps the Government neglected to inform them properly and now they have to tell us what happened in the budget.  The advertisements with the photograph cost £200,000 and that is the sole contribution of the Government.  However, it benefited the Minister to the extent of £200,000 worth of publicity but it says little for the Government that they have to publicise the scheme a considerable time after the initial announcement.  The Government's public relations officers seem to have erred.  I hope the Minister for Finance will indicate some reliefs even at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the additional problem of 51,000 school leavers who will be on the labour market in the next two or three months, young men and women who have no hope for the future.  Of that number 26,000 will not get any benefit; I am referring to the female school leavers who are being discriminated against by the Department of Social Welfare.  They will not get any benefits until they have 26 stamps but how can they get the stamps when there is no employment?  Even if the <Col N="1126" /> level were as low as one stamp many of them would be unable to obtain benefits because they cannot get jobs. Many of these young people have repeated the leaving certificate rather than be on the dole queue but this cannot continue.  They will answer advertisements for jobs that do not exist.</P>
    <P>The Department have produced wonderful booklets for school leavers about jobs that are not there.  It is another effort to hoodwink this important sector.  These young people should and must have a future.  They are the adults of tomorrow and if we are so callous that we do not ensure they have sufficient jobs we will be betraying them.  No wonder young people become cynical about politicians when they realise they are thrown on the scrap heap when they finish their education.  If the 150,000 people signing at the labour exchanges had four or five university degrees they would still be unemployed because there are no jobs for them.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will give an indication of something more positive than the £20 being promised in advertisements which cost £200,000.  In my constituency if one walks into a house one finds young people concerned about their parents who are unemployed; in many cases the fathers have been unemployed for two or three years.  The unfortunate children look across the table in sorrow at their parents while the parents look in sorrow at the children they have educated who have no jobs or job opportunities.  That situation obtains in many households in my constituency and throughout the country. No effort is being made by the Minister or by the Government to correct it.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister tell us what he will do to relieve this situation?  Surveys carried out in my constituency show that unemployment there is double the national average.  The Ballyfermot area has 23 per cent unemployed as against 12 per cent elsewhere. It also showed that 23 per cent of the 1969 school leavers are not yet employed. The Minister and the Government do not appear to be aware of those facts. <Col N="1127" /> We have spoken about this time and time again and there appears to be no response to this terrible tragedy other than that the unemployment figures will escalate every time more young people finish school.</P>
    <P>What policy have the Government to find jobs for the 150,000 people who are unemployed?  What policy have they to find jobs for the 50,000 school leavers?  Where are the females to get the 26 stamps to get their benefit? One could understand the situation if they were debarred for 26 weeks, 12 weeks or six weeks because at some stage they would get social welfare benefits.  Twenty-six stamps is a permanent barrier to social welfare benefits for those young people at a very impressionable age.  We know that the Government will do nothing, so there is no point in taking this problem further with them.</P>
    <P>The lives and security of individuals throughout the State are at risk. People are captives in their homes, towns and cities.  We have seen many people speak from platforms recently asking that something be done about the terrible tragedy which the Government have allowed to develop.  They use the excuse of the violence in the North for the lack of law and order in this part of the country.  They have a responsibility to ensure that the basic rights of the individual to live without fear are maintained.  This is a city of fear.  There were 108 armed robberies last year.  Robbery with violence is an everyday occurrence.</P>

I received a letter last week from a sick old lady who said she was unable to go out and afraid to stay in. That is the staggering situation we have.

We cannot brush aside the fact that there is no law and order by saying that we cannot discuss it under this Bill.  The protection of the institutions of the State and of the people is of fundamental importance. People should be able to go about their business, come to and from this House and be able to speak freely and effectively regarding the problems that confront us.

      <P>There are areas in the Finance Bill where adjustments can be made and where more money should be made available to meet different problems.  I believe that is covered in a very general way in what I am saying.  The question of vandalism and the cost to the State of the vandalism which takes place by explosion and otherwise which must <Col N="1129" /> be paid for out of public funds can surely be discussed on the Finance Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel I have beeen most reasonable in my assessment of the situation.  I, like many others, am very perturbed about the dreadful problems we have.  It is just as important to mention law and order as it is to mention the upward spiral in foodstuff prices or the other matters I have mentioned.  This Government of law and order either did not make enough money available or used the money for some other purpose.  Some money is now being made available for security but for the last few years the Government allowed a situation to develop which has put private and public property at risk and your security, my security and that of every individual in the State at risk.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal now with the question of social welfare benefits.  I trust that in this regard I will be allowed the same amount of latitude as has been allowed to others.  I have referred already to the discrimination that exists in respect of several sections of society.  For instance, the social welfare code discrimination against the school leaver and the widow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I shall <Col N="1130" /> wait until 7 p.m.  In a speech to the nation on November 8th, 1976, the Minister for Finance suggested possible cutbacks in public expenditure.  In this context he referred to the possible abolition of the free school service, of agricultural grants and of children's allowances.  Consequently, we know now that if returned to office, the Government will effect cutbacks in these areas.  Let the Labour Party Deputies take note of that.  In making these suggestions the Minister was endeavouring to get public opinion in this regard but he found that there was no support for such measures.  However, there will be no reluctance on his part in regard to their implementation in the event of the Coalition winning the election.</P>
      <P>The abolition of children's allowances would affect most the unfortunate housewife who fought for so long to have these allowances paid to her rather than to her husband.  The Minister may say that he will counteract the effect of any such move by increasing income tax reliefs but this is no consolation to the mother of a family. When the Minister made that suggestion he told us that there was no money available for additional social welfare benefits for the unemployed but we learned subsequently from his budget that he had settled away £120 million.  From where could he have got that amount of money between October and the date of the budget? However, this is another instance of the type of deception and dishonesty that we have come to expect from the entire Government.  The various Ministers make statements here that they know to be incorrect.  The sooner they leave office the better for the country.  The Minister for Finance was only indulging in the same type of &ldquo;con&rdquo; job as has been indulged in by the various other Ministers.  This is a situation that cannot be tolerated any longer. No doubt the people will make this very clear when they go to vote in the election.  To the extent that there is collective responsibility within the Government, each of them must accept the same share of responsibility as the Minister for Finance in regard to deceiving the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1131" /> Not only the female school leaver is discriminated against in the social welfare code; the widow is discriminated against also because if she is sick or out of work she is entitled only to half the normal social welfare benefit.  We see, then, how the most vulnerable sections are discriminated against.  Having regard to all the circumstances, the Taoiseach must rid himself at the earliest possible opportunity of this Minister for Finance and replace him by a man of honesty who will be prepared to inform the nation of the real situation.  Hopefully, when replying to the debate the Minister will be able to tell us who were deprived in order to make available the £120 million extra that we learned of on budget day.</P>
    <P>I have here the European day-to-day publication of April, 1977, in which details are given of the consumer price index for the various countries.  The Government have told us that the people are being compensated adequately from time to time for the upward spiral in prices but in this publication we find that in Ireland there was a variation in the consumer price index of 16.7 per cent between February, 1976, and February, 1977.  The increases for some of the other countries are as follows: Germany, 4 per cent, France, 9 per cent, The Netherlands, 7 per cent and Belgium, 8 per cent.  In other words, we have set a record.  Not so long ago I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the number of price increases that had been sanctioned between 21st January and 11th March this year, a period of 44 days.  I was informed that the relevant number was 77.  This must be another world record.  One would have expected at least a reasonable valley period after the budget.</P>
    <P>It did not end there.  The next booklet showed 45 further price increases. That came at the end of that month and nine days later we had another booklet from the National Prices Commission which showed another 45 increased prices and told us that another 65 increases were on the way.  This range represents more than two increases for every day including Sundays. This Government have a record <Col N="1132" /> of price increases that no other country can produce.  The Minister for Labour has told us that he has trained more people during his term of office than has any other Minister for Labour. He did train more people to stand in the dole queues than any other Minister ever trained in the history of this State.  The Government have a record that they cannot be very proud of. With the upward spiral of prices we see the terrible tragedy of the aged who are starving as indicated in a Government publication and nothing is being done about it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach told me some weeks ago at Question Time that £1.90 is required today to purchase what £1 would have purchased when the Coalition came to office.  It now takes £2 to purchase what £1 did when Fianna Fáil were in office.  Had we still been in office we would not have this terrible situation now.  We were told about the stabilisation of prices as one of the points in the famous 14-point plan and what have we?  We have a record number of price increases-77 in 44 days and in another 20 days there were a further 90 increases.  That is the record, 123 in 63 days and 46 in 19 days. That is what the aged, the housewife and the 200,000 people affected by unemployment have to face.  The statistics show an appalling picture: 16.7 per cent is the highest rate in Europe.  Must we be the best in Europe in inflation and highest in price increases?  We must tabulate the record and let the public see it in readable form so that they can assess the situation.</P>
    <P>On 30th March, not so long ago, I put down a question asking the Minister to indicate the price increases of the various commodities that affect the lives of every individual and that carry the calcium and vitamin C and so on that older people need.  We were told that in mid-February 1973 when we left office, potatoes were 48p per stone; in mid-February, 1977, they were 124.4p per stone.  Rib steak was 46.2 per lb in mid-February, 1973, and in mid-February, 1977 it was 77.5p and it has increased another 5p or 10p since. Sirloin steak in mid-February, 1973, <Col N="1133" /> was 72.5p per lb. and in mid-February, 1977, it was 120.4p and it has gone up a fair amount since.  Round steak in mid-February, 1973, was 60p per lb and in mid-February, 1977, it was 103p.  Milk has increased from 5p to 8p per pint in the same period and sugar from 5p to 12p per lb. Tea in the same period increased from 34p to 59p per lb.  Now it is £1 per lb or £1.10 per lb for medium quality.  The best quality was 41p and 67p per lb and it is well over £1 now. Butter has increased in the same time from 27.8p to 53p per lb.  Bread which was 13.1p is now 23.1p and the size of the loaf has been reduced since the Government came into office. These items are necessary for people's welfare.</P>
    <P>There is a substantial increase in subsidised foodstuffs, the area which we were told the Government would protect.  This is a clear indication of the Government's inability to carry out their promises.  The Minister who promised did not deliver the goods. Very few people are having those goods delivered today.  Meat is now a luxury as are potatoes and tea will be a luxury in a short time for very many.  How are the aged who are suffering from malnutrition going to exist?  What is the Minister going to do in the course of this debate to alleviate the problem?  We were told that the immediate economic aim was to stabilise prices, halt redundancy and reduce unemployment.  The unemployment figure is now 150,000; there are redundancies by the thousand and the price increases are so large that the people are starving.</P>
    <P>The 35,000 people on the Dublin labour exchanges want a solution to some of the problems I have posed here today.  Many of these people are in the Minister's own constituency. Can he give them any relief?  Can he indicate what the Government propose to do in order to normalise the situation and to bring the unemployment figures back to a realistic level? There will always be unemployment for one reason or another but the figure at the moment is appalling.  The Government and the Minister must do something to ensure that the workers who were conned into signing the <Col N="1134" /> national wage agreement, the aged who are starving, the young girls who are going on the labour exchange who will have no benefit, the widow whose social welfare benefits are cut in two, the 17,000 adults who are going to be unemployed in my constituency, the large number of young people who are unable to obtain jobs in Ballyfermot who represent double the national average will have some hope that something will be done before this Government leave office.</P>
    <P>Will the Government desert the nation as they did before?  Will they desert the nation in the middle of the night?  It is in the middle of the night that they had better get out because these people will be waiting when the time comes, which I hope will be very soon, to give their answer, an answer that will bring back confidence and self-respect and a Government of understanding who will do the job they set out to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be concerned mainly with the overall inadequacies of the Finance Bill in relation to the economy.  In recent times we have been treated to wild-sweeping statements by Government spokesmen to the effect that everything in the garden is rosy.  Deputy Dowling drew attention to the about-turn in their approach in relation to the financial situation.  It is remarkable that as we approach a general election things seem to be on the up and up&mdash;we are just awaiting the delivery of the crock of gold that is at the end of the rainbow.  This year we have had no budgetary Financial Resolutions to pass.  Apart from the first Finance Bill of the present Minister four-and-a-half years ago, it has been necessary to increase taxation each year.  Of course, in this election year that has not been found necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill and the first Finance Bill of the Coalition have some remarkable resemblances.  At the time of the first Finance Bill of the present Government the state of the country was so good that all the Minister had to do was to distribute the goodies.  The Government have been describing the interim period as having created one of the roughest economic crises that <Col N="1135" /> the world or this country has known. This is the third Coalition or inter-Party Government and it is odd that their periods of power have seen the greatest economic recessions that had occurred up to then.  My personal opinion is that when the general election comes the electorate will have to decide whether they want the country to go ahead at a reasonably progressive pace or to send back another Coalition with the attendant hard financial crises which seems automatically to follow them.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that it is at this time we get a Finance Bill which does not impose fresh taxation.  It has been lauded by the Minister for Finance as an instrument to dish out goodies because of the brilliant manner in which they have steered us through the economic crisis.  He said that this year's budget offered further incentives.</P>
    <P>To my mind this Bill is completely inadequate in relation to current demands.  All of the preceding Finance Bills, and this one to a lesser extent, were inflationary.  We have been told that this Bill contains increased tax allowance provisions but anybody who analyses the end-product must appreciate that the tax provisions do not in any way measure up in value to the allowances given in the last Finance Bill of the previous Government. Deputy Dowling spoke of the buying power of the £ and said that it now takes almost £2 to buy what £1 would have bought in 1973.</P>
    <P>The public might justifiably have expected in this Finance Bill, particularly with our high degree of unemployment, provisions conducive to job creation, particularly with the experience the Minister must have had or that he had the responsibility to discover, during his four-and-a-half years in office.  More than anything else at the moment the country needs employment development at industrial and agricultural levels.  What we have are 114,000 registered unemployed and many thousands more unregistered unemployed.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that due to the battle that has been going on in order to try to keep the compulsorily unemployed <Col N="1136" /> people happy by giving increases in social welfare allowances to enable them to buy the necessities of life, a stage has now been reached where it is becoming extremely difficult to get the necessary type of employment for a married man with four children.  The jobs are not there but even if they were available at the lowest level, there is no incentive for an unemployed man with four children to get back to work.  It is difficult to find a job with the necessary incentive. We have been worked into this situation over the last four years.  I am not suggesting that unemployment assistance or benefit should be reduced, but the people are being conditioned to be happy being idle.  This is a very bad development for which the Coalition Government must accept the full responsibility.</P>
    <P>What we needed in this Finance Bill was a bit of enlightened legislation following quite an amount of thinking by an intelligent and well-backed up Minister for Finance with colleagues who are interested in getting the people back to work.  I cannot say that not enough money has been spent by the Government over the past four years in their staggering efforts to try to get the economy on its feet.  The difficulty is that most of the massive four billion pounds which now constitutes the national debt has been borrowed in an effort just to keep the wheels turning.  This Government will be remembered and condemned for that.  One of the major promises in the Government's 14 points was to stabilise prices.  The second major promise that affected votes to a great extent was to reduce unemployment.  Both of those promises fell flat, but the annoying feature was that at no stage over the past four and a half years have the Government or any of their agencies appeared to have done anything serious about tackling either of the problems.</P>
    <P>Under the inflationary head not alone did they not tackle it but they were the greatest contributors to the inflation spiral.  Apart altogether from the various Finance Bills that were inflationary we had a despicable performance in relation to oil prices.  The Government blamed the Arabs for the <Col N="1137" /> inordinate increases.  My colleague, Deputy Colley, drew attention to the fact that the Minister for Finance outstripped the Arabs by three to one. When the Arabs increased petrol by 12p per gallon the Minister for Finance increased it by 35p.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have the opportunity of dealing with them in his reply.  It has been said over and over again that the Government jumped in on any occasion when there was any chance of further increased taxation. On each occasion they set off a further round of spiralling inflation. The Minister contradicts straightforward facts by the simple statement &ldquo;the Deputy is wrong&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Deputy Colley said that the Arabs put on 12p and the Minister for Finance or the Government put on 35p.  That was on Tuesday, 10th May. When any Fianna Fáil spokesman sat down, having contributed to this debate, the Government had an opportunity to contradict this.  The only major contribution we have had from the Government side was from Deputy Halligan who quite obviously is engaged, as a spokesman for Labour, in a private serious war situation or confrontation with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and his Fine Gael colleagues in relation to the State Development Corporation.  We have a situation where the Taoiseach goes down to Killarney and makes a statement reassuring entrepreneurs and private developers, upon whom we have relied to a considerable extent, that there would be no State Development Corporation.  The Minister for Health made speeches about it also and the Minister for Finance came in <Col N="1138" /> with this Bill and made no statement about it.  Following on that Deputy Halligan, the same as the Minister for Health, said that it is a condition of Labour participation in the next Coalition, that there will be a State Development Corporation as part of a planned programme of agreement between the two major parties in the Coalition.  The response to that came last weekend from the Taoiseach when he addressed the faithful in Dún Laoghaire.  He reassured them that he would not accept any State interference with private enterprise and that the State would not have a corporation to compete with it.  It is remarkable that the only contributions we have had from the Government side in this regard have been the sort of short, curt replies similar to the one I got from the Minister for Finance a few moments ago.</P>
      <P>Having done a little research I can truthfully say this is the first occasion on which a Finance Bill has been discussed in this House for two weeks and no other Minister has contributed to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying so far as I know.  We had a projection of a potential 16 per cent increase in the cost-of-living index for 1977.  That was the projection in December-January last.  There is an election in the offing and a number of people needed to be lulled into a false position and that projection was reduced by the Minister for Finance to somewhere in the region of 11 per cent or 12 per cent.  This was also challenged by Deputy Colley.  The sizeable increase in the cost of living in the first three months of the year is an indication that we are well on the way to meeting the Minister's target already after a period of three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is remarkable that the troubleshooter, the man who has proved he is able to lull the people into a false sense of security on the basis of upswings and downswings, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, has not spoken in this debate, to offer his words of conviction and his assurances <Col N="1139" /> from his study of the situation that we can rely on his promises.  I wonder why he has not contributed to the debate.  It is traditional for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to speak on the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside agriculture, we are hoping the IDA will be able to create jobs which are so necessary and which the Minister in his opening speech promised would be created, without going into any great detail as to the manner in which they are to be delivered.  We are very dependent on the IDA.  We are very dependent on Córas Tráchtála to find world markets for our produce.  We had the threats to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions prior to the introduction of the Finance Bill.  One of the reasons for the delay in its introduction was to make sure that the national pay agreement was signed, sealed and delivered. There was an undue delay in the presentation of the Bill to the House. There was an undue delay in taking Second Stage.  Part and parcel of that was the private commitment made by the Minister for Finance, which he has fallen down on although he went some of the way with it, on farming taxation.  In Chapter II of this Bill he went part of the way to meet farming requirements and demands.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said in January that the Finance Bill would be circulated within six weeks of the budget, but it then became clear that it would not be circulated until the national pay agreement was signed and the Minister and the Government had, if you like, slipped one across the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Eventually this Bill was not presented until 26th April and then we had a milk and water approach to the farming tax problem.</P>
    <P>Yesterday Deputy Haughey drew attention to the fact that what we need are incentives.  It is quite clear from the maladministration of the Government and the various threats by the Minister for Finance to farmers that the production incentive has been taken out of farming.  We have the benefit of EEC membership in that we have increased prices for farm <Col N="1140" /> products, but we have not had the benefit of the increased productivity which is so essential to our wellbeing. Deputy Haughey elaborated very eloquently on this yesterday.  The fact that we have not had increased productivity should force the Minister for Finance, in the remaining days available to him, to ask himself where he has gone wrong.  The difficulty is that he would have to look down so many roads that it would be difficult to expect him to find the answer.</P>
    <P>Instead of the four-and-a-half year old promise of price stability, prices have doubled over the past five years. The Taoiseach and his spokesmen go out of their way to blame external influences but the fact is that taxation and Government action conductive to inflation have been responsible for more than half the price increases we have had over the past four-and-a-half years.</P>
    <P>When we were in Government we were continually attacked about our prices and incomes policy.  An economic plan has been talked about over the past four years but we have not received it.  I remember being on the far side of the House and listening to the present Minister for Finance talking about the necessity to introduce a further programme for economic expansion.  At that time he was very conscious of the value of those programmes and plans and he pressed the Government for the preparation of another programme.  All pressures for the production of another plan and another programme evaporated four-and-a-half years ago.  We got a Green Paper which called for a plan about 12 months ago, but there is still no sign of it.  The difficulty the Coalition group have is that it is impossible for them to agree on a plan.  The only sign we had was the kite flying indulged in by the Minister towards the end of last year when he talked in terms of withdrawing school buses.</P>

      <P>Last night I was dealing with a number of very important aspects of discrimination within the social welfare code.  I pointed out that there were two areas where remedial measures were necessary and pressing.  Shortly we will have on the labour market some 26,000 females who will not get social welfare benefits. As I pointed out last night, these people are being victimised.  Because there are no job opportunities they cannot get the necessary 26 stamps. Perhaps the Minister could tell us where we will get the necessary 26 stamps for female school leavers for whom there are no job opportunities. This victimisation must be stopped. There must be equality between males and females.</P>
      <P>These young girls at the most impressionable age, having devoted their energies and time to their education, now find themselves on the labour market with the dole queues overflowing and no hope whatsoever of obtaining the benefits for those who are unemployed. These young people must get some recognition.  The job opportunities are not there.  We have 150,000 on the labour market and with the ever-swelling dole queues we find that there is large-scale discrimination.  In the Minister's reply I hope there will be some indication of relief for this section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A widow who becomes a breadwinner finds herself endeavouring to maintain a home and maintain a standard of living enjoyed by her family before her husband died. Through economic necessity she has to work for a living and if she has the misfortune to fall ill or become unemployed her social welfare benefits are halved.  One must look at the aspect of discrimination in this sector.  Deputy Andrews mentioned discrimination right through the whole code.  The anti-discrimination legislation which has been passed by this House has <Col N="1142" /> been mere whitewashing because it was not backed up by realistic involvement by the Government.</P>

      <P>I was surprised and amazed that this motion was put down by Fianna Fáil Deputies because of their record in this field in 16 years of Government.  As a matter of fact, I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw this motion on the Order Paper signed by a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies who had the Ministerial advantage during 16 years to implement some of the changes they now claim should be made.  They want everything to be done in four years while their record over 16 years does not bear scrutiny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Government came to power an employed girl who got married lost all her benefits and received a present of £10.  This situation has been changed by this Government and now such a girl can continue to pay her social welfare contributions and have the benefit of the contributions she has made over the years to the social welfare system.  That is one area of definite discrimination that has been removed by this Government. Single women in many cases left employment and went home to look after ageing parents.  They missed many of the opportunities that would have been available to them and in the time of Fianna Fáil they had to go on their knees as it were, to the home assistance officer for help.  These women are now entitled in their own right to social welfare benefits provided by this Government.  This is something of which we who have supported this Government are proud. In the case of a non-contributory <Col N="1143" /> pension, a man got a pension but no allowance for his unfortunate wife. That is the record of Fianna Fáil.  It could not be said that progress had been made when after 16 years of Fianna Fáil rule those discriminations remained in the social welfare code. Some of these inequities have been removed by this Government, though not all of them, but I am prepared to believe that a Government who have shown such commitment to the lower income groups and the less well-off in our society will continue to work in this direction until every vestige of discrimination is removed.  I made it quite clear in this House in the early days of this Government that I would continue to support them as long as they were committed to the underprivileged. The record shows without doubt that they have fulfilled this commitment. That is the reason I supported the Government and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>We had crocodile tears shed here last evening about the fact that if an unfortunate widow working for her living falls ill she can draw only half the usual benefit.  That was true in the time of Fianna Fáil and it is still true but under the Fianna Fáil Government such a widow had to pay full contributions to social welfare.  Now her employer has to do that.  There has been progress there, though not as much as I would like because all areas of discrimination should be removed. It is arrogant of Fianna Fáil to mention this subject when one looks at their record and considers the number of discriminatory elements which they removed during their period of office. They must admit&mdash;and they have done so through their speakers last evening &mdash;that many areas of discrimination have been removed by this Government and much progress has been made.  In fact, the progress made in the past four years compares more than favourably with the progress made in the 16 years of Fianna Fáil administration.</P>
    <P>In decisions concerning women generally, this Government have not neglected their duty.  I freely admit that they have not eliminated all the <Col N="1144" /> areas of discrimination but any reasonable or fair-minded person will agree that they have made more progress in this area than any other Government in the history of this State.  I believe that the present Administration will continue in that vein.  This is the principal reason why I will support them.  They have looked after the less well-off in our society and the underprivileged and that goes without saying.</P>
    <P>When old age pensions for men and women were introduced in the early 1900's, the qualifying age was 70 years, and when Fianna Fáil left office four short years ago the qualifying age was still 70 years.  Great progress there. Now after four years any woman reaching 67 years of age can get her old age pension, and it is far easier to get it now as far as the means test is concerned that it was when Fianna Fáil were in office.  I do not want to labour this point because I do not think there is any doubt about the Government's record in this area.  Fianna Fáil had many areas where they could criticise the Government, but discrimination in social welfare is definitely not one of them.</P>
    <P>These improvements that have been brought about by the Government&mdash; and it was admitted by the two Opposition speakers last night that there were improvements in the areas of discrimination which we are discussing&mdash;were introduced during a period of serious economic recession. The Government of the day continued on eliminating areas of discrimination. For that reason, I am prepared to accept the word of the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Social Welfare that it is his intention to proceed with the elimination of every in any legislation as well as in the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>However, I would make a constructive suggestion to the Parliamentary Secretary in all sincerity.  Married women who have lost their employment through redundancy and otherwise are finding it impossible to get unemployment benefit.  There is a person in the social welfare system called a deciding officer who has the full authority to decide unemployment <Col N="1145" /> benefit should not be given to a married woman with a child in respect of which she can produce proof of having someone to look after it, and evidence of refusals from reputable firms to give her employment.  I have asked the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that the policy of the continuance of benefits on marriage will be carried out by his officials in the Department as he meant it to be.  A married woman with one or two children, even though she is in benefit by having the necessary contributions, finds it impossible to get by this deciding officer who invariably says she is not available for work.  There is an appeal to another officer; that is the final stroke, and no one has the power to change that.  I do not want the Minister to take this power.  It should be exercised by some official, but I believe the spirit in which this rule is being administered is not the spirit which was intended by this House, by the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The evolution of social welfare in this as in every other country has been progressive down through the years.  In fact, not until after the last war did it begin to gain momentum in any country, even in the United States.  In that respect our record of progress over those years compares favourably with that of any country in the world. Successive Ministers have expanded the code, improved the benefits, and there is still a good way to go.</P>
      <P>We were pioneers in many fields.  In 1933 when the State accepted responsibility for unemployed people, we were the only country in the world providing benefits for uninsured persons who were unemployed.  When we introduced non-contributory widows' pensions I do not think there was any other country in the world paying such pensions at that time.  I think we were a year ahead of any other country in introducing children's allowances. Sweden introduced them in the following year, if my memory serves me correctly.  We are pioneers in many fields of social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social welfare has improved as attitudes changed and as the public conscience became more perceptive to the <Col N="1146" /> needs of the weaker section and were prepared to accept that the redistribution of the national wealth was part of what should be an improving civilisation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the resources available to us, we were well ahead of any other country in the expansion of our social welfare code down through the years.  As I say, the first major step was in 1933 when we passed the Unemployment Assistance Act.  Since then every Minister who has occupied the position of Minister for Social Welfare has to his credit some major improvement in social welfare and in spreading the net to bring in other necessitous people.  At times it also became an auction of bidding between political parties as to who would do the most.</P>
    <P>Coming up to the last election it was known that our membership of the EEC, to which we had just acceded, would place us in a position where we would not be required to provide in the budget £x million for agricultural subsidies.  Each political party vied with the other as to how best we should apply it to social welfare. We spelled out our scheme well in advance of the elections and as a result the other two parties decided to form a Coalition.</P>
    <P>At that time it was intended that that windfall would be a bonus for social welfare recipients.  It was accepted by all that the basic rates they were then receiving were not adequate to give them a standard of living comparable to that enjoyed by the more fortunate in the community. That has not turned out to be as it should.  The social welfare recipients got those extra benefits but, instead of them being a plus, they are merely helping them maintain the standard of living they enjoyed in 1973.  The records published by the Central Statistics Office have borne this out. That is the position.</P>
    <P>Spiralling increases have crippled the take home pay of every worker and social welfare recipient.  That is the sad but true story of social welfare. If this Government think they can make propaganda out of the increases in social welfare there are two things they should bear in mind.  Yesterday <Col N="1147" /> the Minister boasted about the increase in the amount now being paid in social welfare compared with what was paid in 1973 when we left office. The extended line of people drawing unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance has stretched social welfare payments and a very big increase is needed for these payments alone.  The Minister boasted about the increase in the total amount paid by the Department of Social Welfare. Most of this increase is absorbed by the extended figures of unemployed for which, under the 1933 Act, he is responsible.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the other point, that is, that the money most individual recipients are receiving purchases the same amount as the 1973 social welfare payments.  Inflation, unchecked, unbridled, with its consequential evils of unemployment and spiralling prices, has left us in that position.  Nothing has been done to stabilise those increasing costs so that the social welfare recipient will get value for his £.</P>
    <P>Take a pencil and paper and write down how much a widow gets every week.  She is getting considerably more than she got in February, 1973 but calculate how much she must spend to keep body and soul together without buying any luxuries.  She is fortunate if in any one week she does not have to buy a pair of shoes or an article of clothing which would take her entire pension.  She must pay for fuel, electricity, gas, and every article that goes on her table.  Why do we marvel at the increases we have given when we failed to stabilise the cost of living and give this money a purchasing value that would make this extra money a real bonanza for social welfare recipients?</P>
    <P>Through the years every Minister for Social Welfare brought about some benefits.  I had the pleasure of seeing some noted expansions to the social welfare code.  I was always proud of the fact that I was Minister for Social Welfare when we gave free travel, free television licences and free electricity in certain cases.  I challenge any Minister to match that record.  I brought in the deserted wives' allowance.  Listening to <Col N="1148" /> the Parliamentary Secretary yesterday, one would think that he had been responsible for it.  I introduced the Occupational Injuries Act.  I extended and amended the provision for widows. I extended for widows the dependants allowance to 21 years for the children who were still being educated or apprenticed. In our own way we all added to the social welfare code but, as the last speaker admitted, there are many gaps.</P>
    <P>The public social conscience has changed dramatically in modern times, particularly in the second half of the century.  We have seen fit to produce legislation covering sections of the people who, in the past, would not be worthy of assistance.  Fortunately we now have a different outlook but there are still some loopholes.  It is most surprising that this Government, who claim to have a social conscience, have resisted bringing in complete equality for women under the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance ratted on the implementation of equal pay in the public service.  Bearing this in mind, it is understandable that they have not brought social welfare payments completely into line.  I should like to stress particularly the matter of post-marriage employment for insured women. I do this with a sincere appeal.  In my time as Minister for Social Welfare it was necessary for a married woman to get at least 13 weeks, if not 26 weeks, work after marriage before she qualified&mdash;all other things being in order&mdash;for unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>The present Minister or Parliamentary Secretary changed that and it was a step in the right direction about which we have not heard a word said in praise on the opposite side of the House.  I am saying it but with this qualification: he has provided in one of the social welfare amendment Bills passed since he came into power&mdash;we have had one or two Social Welfare Bills every year, I think, over the last 20 or 30 years&mdash;that it was not necessary for a woman to get post-marriage employment to qualify for post-marriage benefits.  I have yet to find one woman qualifying under that scheme.  Time and again I am told by <Col N="1149" /> the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary that some do qualify but I must say in all honesty&mdash;I do not know the experience of Deputies on the opposite side of the House&mdash;that all the Deputies on these benches agree with me when I say that in hundreds of cases brought to our notice where a newly married woman applies for social welfare benefit she is turned down on every occasion by both the deciding officer and the appeals officer with absolute discrimination in most of the cases of which I am personally aware.</P>
    <P>A woman is working; she has a job in an office or she is a receptionist or waitress in a hotel and marries the partner of her choice.  She goes to live 40 miles from where she was working. She is ready and available for work. She applies for unemployment assistance when she cannot find work.  She does not get it.  If she has a baby she is immediately disqualified.  Obviously, the consideration activating the mind of the appeals officer and the deciding officer is that her duty is to stay at home and look after the child and that she is not available because the child must be looked after.  At the same time, we are told all sorts of provision must be made to allow married women to work.</P>
    <P>I could enumerate specific cases for hours if time permitted.  I saw young married women crying because they could not get the benefit of 15 years contributions which they had made before marriage.  I hope that Fianna Fáil in office will, as a first priority, adopt a more lenient approach in that regard. The operation of that practice I have described would alone justify the motion we have put down here.  I know a case of a girl who worked in an office in Donegal and married somebody near Fintown.  She went back to work where she got temporary work after being married and eight or ten weeks after her first baby was born, although her mother-in-law lives in the house actually taking care of the child when she applied for unemployment benefit she was told she could not get it on the grounds that she was not available for work.  She did not have a motor car to drive 30 miles every day to where she had previously <Col N="1150" /> worked and where they would be glad to have her.  That is only one of many examples.</P>
    <P>The 1933 Social Welfare Act provides that to qualify for unemployment assistance one must be capable of, available for and genuinely seeking work, having regard to age, physique, education, normal occupation and piace of residence.  These are certainly sufficient reasons to justify qualifying people because of the suitability of the work they might get having regard to their normal occupations and yet our appeals officers do not see fit to grant them assistance or benefit.  This is a disgrace and it is an area that should be examined immediately.  Abolishing the requirement for post-marital employment was a futile exercise if the benefits are not made operative.</P>
    <P>We must not blame appeals officers. I was long enough in Social Welfare to know, in relation to both doctors and appeals officers that they are the finest of men but it is the prevailing attitude in the Department that governs the decisions taken from time to time. Just now the claims of people and people already in receipt of benefit are being knocked by the hundred. Genuine cases of claimants and recipients are being knocked because there is a percentage of malingerers as there always has been.  I do not know what is the position of a woman&mdash;I have a question down about it&mdash;whose doctor warns her that she must not work.  She says she must live, that she can get no money and he says : &ldquo;You are endangering your life; you may drop dead if you work&rdquo;.  The social welfare doctor says she is fit to work and they cannot pay her.  This is a case where doctors differ.</P>
    <P>Let us not be too naïve and not admit that there are times when attitudes are different and the approach of officials is more lax than on other occasions.  These periods of strict supervision seem to coincide with periods of stringency and difficult financial positions.  That is not as it should be. I am sick talking about the attitude of social welfare investigation officers.  I met a woman five days ago whose husband lost his pension while she was working as assistant housekeeper in the county home, St. Joseph's.  When <Col N="1151" /> she became ill and had to go to hospital the pension was restored but the investigation officer called twice&mdash; once at 8.30 in the evening&mdash;to see if she had gone back to work.  I presume that had she returned to work her husband's pension would have been cut again.  The officer called in the evening because he suspected she was on the night shift.  That is going a little too far and is not in keeping with a Department whose function it is to give benefits to people who are entitled to them.  I am not attacking the individual who was carrying out his duty.</P>
    <P>The amount of money being spent on social welfare at present is very big but the Department are getting a greater percentage from the contributions of employers and employees.  The contribution rate was approximately one-third from the State, one-third from the employee and one-third from the employer.  It was weighted in favour of the employee in that the employer was made to pay a little more but often when the fund fell short of the annual requirement the State contribution was raised to 35 per cent.  That is being phased out now and much of the money the Government are boasting about is money that is being taken from the people in the form of insurance stamps.  Allowing for the increase in the contributions and the millions extra being taken from the employers and employees by way of contribution the extra amount given has been eroded by way of unchecked inflation and the amount extra that is being paid as a result of 116,000 being unemployed.  That is the position with regard to social welfare.  They are the bare facts of the situation.  There is very little left to boast about but I hope the spirit of the motion will not be lost on Members on the Government side and that they will see fit to support it particularly when there is such a clamour for equal rights. This is one area where there should be a complete elimination of any discrimination against one sex compared with another.  I hope the terms of the motion will not fall on deaf ears and <Col N="1152" /> that Government Deputies will support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be able to speak on this motion which calls on the Minister for Social Welfare to eliminate discrimination against women in the area of eligibility for social welfare entitlement. When considering such a motion one must examine the record of the Government since 1973 in the area of social welfare.  In my view that record is first class.  The Government have always been conscious of their responsibility to the people who have for one reason or another to claim social welfare.  The limits were raised twice in one year and other improvements were made.  This was done at a time when there was pressure for the money to be allocated to other areas.  There was no dereliction with regard to social welfare.  Discrimination may occur in some areas but the social welfare code is subject to scrutiny and change.  It was changed during the term of the Government. For instance, the Government introduced an allowance for unmarried mothers, an important step towards helping those people.  However, it has been the subject of criticism.  The allowance for single women, something that was talked about by Fianna Fáil when in Government, was implemented by the Government.  A person who, rather than go out to work looked after his or her aged parents, qualifies for an allowance.  The Government saw the social problem that existed in this regard.  When we are talking about social welfare we are talking about people in need and one must examine the areas of greatest need.  That is what was in the mind of the Parliamentary Secretary when he was making changes.  I have no doubt that had the Parliamentary Secretary more money he would have introduced greater changes.  Given the money he got he did an excellent job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a bit of a joke to talk about discrimination in this regard.  The whole area of social welfare has been well thought out.  A comprehensive policy has been introduced and there was no pulling back in spite of pressures from other areas and the fact <Col N="1153" /> that it might have been popular to pull back.  The Government pressed ahead with their programme on social welfare. For that reason I was surprised to see a motion relating to social welfare on the Order Paper.  The people who draw such benefits are well aware of the amount of the benefit in 1973 and what they qualify for under this Government.  When the National Coalition took office there was a lot of discrimination against women.  In this regard it should be remembered that it is not possible to eliminate discrimination overnight.  A woman can now go to our courts and get a separation order and an attachment order can be made against the husband with the result that money is paid into the court.  The legislation giving effect to that was badly needed.  Prior to 1973 a man could sell the family home without his wife's consent but because of legislation introduced by the National Coalition that cannot happen now.  That highlights the Government's sensitivity towards women and their rights.  Examine that record and that of the Opposition over 16 years and see how they compare.  The Opposition, in my view, did very little except perhaps create discrimination.</P>
    <P>Whenever the general election takes place I have no doubt that this work will continue.  Naturally there are areas in which we should like to see a little more done.  Nobody contends that the system is perfect but one has to undertake a job in a planned way. That is what the Parliamentary Secretary set out to do in his four years in office.  Indeed his record over the past four years, when examined, can be placed against any over the previous 16 years whether it be in the area of discrimination against women or general attitudes to social welfare. It is very important that a healthy attitude in this area should prevail. I should not like to be part of a Government that would encourage or want to have any hand in discriminating against women.  Given another four or five years we shall continue with that work to eliminate fully discrimination in all fields resulting in real equality across the board.</P>
    <P>The same comments can be made on the whole area of taxation.  While <Col N="1154" /> it is not a social welfare problem nevertheless it is one the Government have examined and in respect of which they have taken action.  Admittedly a lot of people would have liked them to have gone somewhat further.  In a speech not so long ago I made a suggestion that that area be examined and that the tax-free allowances at present set off against the husband's income in respect of his wife and children should be paid directly to the wife, as are the children's allowance. While it is not an area in which the Parliamentary Secretary is involved, I have no doubt but that he would be concerned with activities that would help housewives and women in general, whether they be in his or other Government Departments.</P>
    <P>Given the opportunity of another four years in office all these matters will be examined.  For instance, when we assumed office payment of children's allowances was somewhat haphazard, generally going to the husband but we introduced legislation ensuring that the housewife would receive it.  In addition, the amount of children's allowances was raised substantially, making it a meaningful income in the home each week.</P>
    <P>The appearance of these nebulous motions on the Order Paper week after week merely highlights how bereft of ideas are the Opposition.  I suppose one could say it is a tribute to the Government that they really have not any substantial criticism to offer of what we have been doing.  But, because they have the facility of Private Members' Time they must be seen to go through the motion in an endeavour to show up the Government's weakness. I would have thought this motion under discussion would have been the last they would have chosen given the moneys that have been allocated to and spent in this area over the four years.  Our record in the general area of social welfare will stand the test of time and the scrutiny of electors.  I am not saying that the system is perfect; far from it.  I am saying that the whole area of discrimination against women is being actively examined and pursued.  It is that with which the general public will concern themselves &mdash;that we have not been unaware of <Col N="1155" /> the real problem obtaining when we assumed office.  Rather have we ensured that the area of greatest need has been examined and moneys allocated, those of the unmarried mothers and single women's allowances. Mention should be made also of the very humane one, that of prisoners' dependents.  Heretofore wives and children were literally thrown to the wolves when their husbands were incarcerated for a crime.  Under this Government that no longer happens. Those are three positive areas of improvement.  There are others, such as law reform and family law areas. Therefore, one must repudiate this motion for what it is&mdash;a cheap political gimmick with no substance or back-up.</P>

      <P>At the outset may I say that there is no question in my mind but that unemployment assistance should be paid to girl school leavers on the same basis as it is paid to boys. I believe that intensely.  I look to the Government, with their record in the area of discrimination against women and in the area of social welfare generally, to bring about that situation.  I fully take the point that, but for the cost involved, this would have been implemented long ago.  But cost must not remain an impediment to the implementation of this recommendation. I do not see a solution to the problem in voting for this motion against the Government because their record in this area has been good.</P>
      <P>Last evening the mover of the motion made reference to the Commission on the Status of Women and in particular to the progress report on the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission in the report of the Commission on the Status of Women brought out by the Women's Representative Committee, of which I am chairman, in December, 1976.  The impression given was that very many of those recommendations were not implemented. It is well known that, of the 15 recommendations, nine were implemented, three partially and three still remain to be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the recommendations <Col N="1156" /> made and the steps taken by the Government to implement them. The first in the area of social welfare was recommendation No. 18 in the Report of the Commission on the Status of Women.  That referred to the rate of unemployment and disability benefit payable to widows in receipt of the widow's contributory pension.  They recommended that a widow should receive flat-rate unemployment and disability benefit at a rate not less than that payable to a married woman. As an interim measure they recommended that the social welfare contributions for a widow should be appropriately reduced while she is entitled to unemployment and disability benefit at half the ordinary rate.  Action was taken on that measure on 2nd July, 1973.  Women in employment were no longer liable for deductions from earnings in respect of social insurance.  That was a positive step taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 19 referred to married women in the social insurance scheme.  It made the point that a woman should retain any accumulated title to social insurance benefit after marriage.  Before this Government took office there was the situation that on marriage a woman lost her right to social welfare insurance and had to contribute 26 additional stamps to become eligible.  This recommendation has been implemented by the Government and is another positive step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 20 dealt with payment of unemployment insurance to women employed in agriculture or as private domestic servants.  A ten-year social welfare contribution condition applied at that time to the payment of unemployment benefit in the case of women employed in agriculture and private domestic service.  The case was made that this should be abolished.  This recommendation has been implemented.  Women employed as private domestic servants or in agriculture are eligible as from 2nd July, 1973, for unemployment benefit on the same conditions as apply to other female insured workers.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 21 referred to <Col N="1157" /> women applicants for unemployment assistance.  As an immediate measure women employed in agriculture or in private domestic service should be eligible to receive unemployment assistance when they have made 52 employment contributions irrespective of the rate at which the contributions are made.  The recommendation has been implemented.  In July, 1974, a further improvement was effected with the introduction of the single women's allowance for women over 58 years. Recommendation No. 22 referred to the payment of children's allowances to the mother rather than to the father. Again, the recommendation has been implemented.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 23 referred to a housekeeper allowance payable with unemployment or disability benefit or with unemployment assistance. It stated that the housekeeper allowance at present payable to single men and widowers with dependent children during periods when they are in receipt of unemployment or disability benefit or unemployment assistance should be extended to single women and widows in similar circumstances. This facility was extended to women in April, 1977, thus removing another blatant area of discrimination against women.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 24 referred to the grant of credited contributions to persons in respect of whom a prescribed female relative allowance is payable. This recommendation has been implemented.  Recommendation No. 25 referred to the non-contributory widow's pension.  It stated that consideration should be given to the introduction of a compulsory widows' and orphans' pension scheme for persons outside the present compulsory insurance category.  It also stated that in the meantime a scheme to be contributed to on a voluntary basis by such persons should be introduced and every effort should be made to keep the contributions for the scheme as low as possible.  This is one of the recommendations that has not been implemented so far.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 26 referred to special assistance for widows on widowhood.  This is a delicate area <Col N="1158" /> and it needed attention.  This recommendation was partially implemented with the extension of the husband's benefits in respect of either disability or unemployment benefit for six weeks after the death.  Recommendation No. 28 referred to deserted wives.  When this Government took office and when the commission were reporting there was no allowance for deserted wives. The recommendation has been implemented.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 29 dealt with wives of prisoners.  When the Government took office and when the commission reported there was no allowance for dependants of people committed to prison.  A new scheme of welfare assistance and an extension of the allowance has been another positive step in this area by the Government.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 30 dealt with unmarried mothers.  The commission recommended that an unmarried mother who keeps her child should be entitled to a social welfare allowance at the same rate and on the same conditions that apply to a deserted wife, for a period of not less than one year after the birth of the child.  Under the Social Welfare Act, 1973, an unmarried mother is entitled with effect from 2nd July, 1973, to a means tested allowance which is payable until the child is 18 years, or 21 years if the child remains in full-time education. This recommendation has been fully implemented.  Recommendation No. 31 referred to women retiring before 65 years of age.  A new social welfare allowance has been introduced providing for allowance to women at the age of 58 years.  This partially implements the recommendation made by the Commission on the Status of Women.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 32 dealt with adjustments in social welfare allowances on the introduction of equal pay and the payment of housekeeper allowances to wives who cannot go out to work because they are obliged to care for children under five years of age.  This recommendation has not been implemented and neither has recommendation No. 40.  That recommendation stated that steps should be <Col N="1159" /> taken and any necessary legislation enacted at the earliest opportunity to ensure that divorced wives should be treated for social welfare purposes not less favourably than if they had remained deserted wives.</P>
    <P>On the recommendations made in the area of social welfare this Government have a very good record and because of that record we may take it that the remaining three recommendations will be seriously considered by them.  They have taken positive steps to eliminate the discrimination that existed.  Undoubtedly discrimination still exists in the area of unemployment assistance and there is no defence.  Neither the Parliamentary Secretary nor anybody else will defend it.  However, on their record to date we can look to the Government to remove any discrimination that still exists.  The answer does not lie in voting against a Government that has such a good record in this area.</P>
    <P>There are many other improvements we could look for.  For instance, we could look for extension of free electricity and other facilities for widows and undoubtedly there are many other facilities that may be lacking. However, as it has been an issue in this debate, the record of the Government in implementing the recommendations in the Report of the Commission on the Status of Women has been good and we can depend on them to remove the few remaining areas of discrimination that still exist.</P>

      <P>I want to avail of the presentation of this motion to make what I hope are comments of a fundamental nature.  I feel sure, from what Deputy Desmond said, that there is no doubt that she will support the motion because it is very simple and straightforward.  It merely asks the Minister for Social Welfare to eliminate discriminations against women in the area of eligibility for social welfare entitlements.  I know, from what Deputy Desmond said, that she supports entirely the principles enshrined in the motion.  If the Parliamentary Secretary does not accept the motion at least Deputy Desmond will vote for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not expect her to vote against it.  I am quite clear, from what she has said so sincerely and so seriously, that she will vote for the motion.  Our motion is in line with our whole approach and philosophy in this area.  We did not come to this area of the rights of women today or yesterday.  We have a good history in relation to the rights of women.  It was a Fianna Fáil Government and I, as Minister for Finance, who set up the Commission on the Status of Women.  I selected Theckla Beere to be woman chairman of that commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy but it was Fianna Fáil who introduced every element of discrimination in the social welfare code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary does not want to interrupt me let him not do so.  Will he let me have my few minutes?  It is totally unacceptable in this modern age that there should be any discrimination against women in any areas.  Women <Col N="1161" /> are, traditionally and historically, militated against in the eyes of the law.  We began a process of eliminating discrimination against women in that area ten years ago.  If the Parliamentary Secretary wants to go back over the record he will see that we published a White Paper on law reform through the Department of Justice as far back as 1960, setting out a comprehensive programme of law reform aimed at eliminating from our legal system the many absurd, anachronistic and discriminatory things in the law against women.</P>
      <P>Our philosophy and outlook on this matter is straightforward.  We believe that every citizen, whether it be a man or woman, should be equal before the law and should be equal in every way in the implementation of the law&mdash; in other words, equal in every aspect of public administration.  It might take time to work towards perfection in every area, but Fianna Fáil began this process in modern Irish society.  In putting down this motion we are seeking to do nothing more than follow it through in an important and significant area.  In many areas of the law discriminatory aspects still remain.</P>
      <P>It will be our intention, when we have responsibility again for those matters, to eliminate the last of them. Here is one area in which we suggest there should be immediate action.  It is not a question of law reform and there are no great legislative difficulties involved.  It is simply a matter of administration.  It is a matter entirely within the competence and the jurisdiction of the Parliamentary Secretary in the administrative sphere to eliminate those unacceptable discriminations which still exist in the social welfare system and which have been dealt with very fairly by Deputy Desmond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The elimination of the remaining discriminatory elements in the social welfare code will cost money.  Perhaps, as far as the Parliamentary Secretary is concerned, that is the restraining factor.  I suggest to him that the argument &ldquo;We would like to do this, we are in favour of doing this but it will cost money and we have not got it available at present is no longer <Col N="1162" /> acceptable.  If the thing is right, if there is a scheme introduced, it should be universally applicable or not introduced at all.  I believe it is not justifiable to say that in principle this is discriminatory but as we have not got the money we will just carry on for the moment and rectify it as soon as we possibly can.</P>
    <P>The argument that elimination of discrimination would be expensive is not acceptable in a modern community. The cost involved in these things must be met because as long as any scheme has any discriminatory aspects to it, it should be unacceptable to us.  I believe this is a very limited area, it is entirely within the administrative conscience of the Parliamentary Secretary to do and I cannot see how he cannot accept our motion and not plead time, expense or any other excuse for not accepting it.  He should then proceed to get rid of those discriminatory elements in the social welfare code because in this modern age they should not be there.</P>

      <P>I was appalled and disappointed, too, to hear Deputy O'Brien describe this motion as nebulous and, by implication, unimportant. Such an attitude is an outrage against the women who are discriminated against by the Government. However, Deputy O'Brien's statement can be compared with a statement made by the Minister for Fisheries who said that one man in employment is worth six women.  That is the type of thinking that pervades the Fine Gael side of the Coalition. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare did not find it possible to utilise the full time to which he was entitled to reply to my 40-minute contribution at the outset.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary engaged in a diatribe and in a series of statements that were couched in vulgar abuse.  For instance, he took exception to my mentioning the Association of Irish Widows and he boasted that immediately after the <Col N="1163" /> budget he had had a letter of commendation from that respected association. I wonder whether he has received any letter from them in the recent past.  I must admit that I did not receive from them a letter on the lines of that which the Parliamentary Secretary indicated he had received.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I received a number of letters from Irish widows who may or may not be members of that association and the general trend of those letters is that widows are being treated badly in the present economic circumstances and that the value of their benefits have been totally eroded between the time of the announcement of the budget increases and their coming into operation on April 1.  I send some of the letters to the Department of Social Welfare and I always receive courteous replies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bermingham, in a sincere speech, supported my opening contribution when he enumerated example after example of discrimination against women and in particular against widows.  He mentioned discrimination against married women also.  The Parliamentary Secretary, while abusing me for referring to the Association of Widows, did not deal with the question of discrimination against widows in that association.  Indeed, he did not deal with the question of discrimination against women generally under the social welfare code and he studiously avoided any mention of the plight of the female school leaver.  However, Deputy Mrs. Desmond made a strong plea on their behalf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary held out no hope for these unfortunate people.  But can he, perhaps in a speech during the weekend, make up for his very serious error in not referring to the female school leaver by giving her some hope for the future? The Parliamentary Secretary accused me of being wrong in one instance. I pointed out in relation to the alleged error on my part that the scheme concerned is still riddled with anomalies. He made no mention of the much-vaunted abandonment of home assistance or of the introduction of social welfare supplementary allowances legislation which was intended to be put into effect in June, 1976.  At the time of the passing of the relevant Act, the Parliamentary Secretary indulged in such phrases as &ldquo;the stigma of home assistance must go&rdquo;, &ldquo;the smell of the workhouse must be abandoned&rdquo; and so on.  Can he say that at some future time, perhaps in the next couple of weeks, this Act will be brought into effect.  It was our intention in Government to introduce similar legislation.  Its immediate implementation is necessary in order to replace home assistance.</P>
      <P>The home assistance scheme served its purpose in the past but it no longer can provide the necessary money to ensure the survival of those who must have recourse to such help.  The smell of the workhouse is still about, but this is no reflection on those who operate the scheme.  On behalf of all those men and women in receipt of home assistance we make a special plea that the supplementary welfare allowances legislation be put into effect as a matter of urgency.  For our part we will give the Parliamentary Secretary every support in that regard.</P>
      <P>The last speaker mentioned the Commission on the Status of Women.  We admit that some of the recommendations of that commission have been implemented.</P>

De réir na mBuan-Orduithe caithfidh an Dáil dul ar atráth ar 9.00 a chlog p.m. ar a dhéanaí.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Go hiondúil labhraímse i nGaeilge, ach de bhrí go bhfuil an cheist seo chomh tábhachtach labhróidh mé as Béarla.  I propose addressing the House in the English language because I believe the matter which I am about to discuss is one of the most important matters affecting the Gaeltacht that has arisen during my membership of this House.  I accept the fact that it will get a greater audience and, I hope, better readership if I say what I am going to say in the English language.</P>
      <P>I accuse the Minister for the Gaeltacht of having killed an Irish paper which has been in existence for 35 years because the editor of that paper was not prepared to yield to a Minister or to a Government what he regarded as being the right of an editor of any paper, to comment on matters as he saw them and not in deference to the Government of the day.  The Minister for the Gaeltacht here some weeks ago, in answer to that charge which was made by Deputy O'Malley and myself, attempted to dismiss it by saying it was ráiméis. I note he did not say it was contrary to the truth, and if the Minister can convince me that the charge I make is contrary to the truth, I will accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing as vital to the life of the Gaeltacht than that the people should have appropriate media.  There should be communication in the Gaeltacht in the same fashion as it is available in the rest of the country.  If the <Col N="1168" /> Gaeltacht is to survive and if people are to believe that one can lead a normal life using the Irish language, we must make it manifest.  It can be done by listening to a radio which broadcasts programmes in the Irish language; Fianna Fáil set up Radio na Gaeltachta so that the people of the Gaeltacht would have this facility. It can be done by reading newspapers in the Irish language.  In short, one should be able to use the Irish language as a means of communication for every purpose; otherwise it is futile for us to be striving towards the day when it will be restored.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us, and we accept, that he is interested in the social and economic life of the Gaeltacht.  Here we have an industry giving employment not to Germans, Frenchmen or Americans but to Irishmen in the Gaeltacht, at the same time fulfilling a vital need.  The Minister indicates that because it is not a viable proposition, because it was losing money, he cannot continue to subsidise it.  What about the £40,000 that was given to a company in another part of the Gaeltacht, a company which in the course of a 12 months' period employed only 12 people and has since disappeared?  What about the many hundreds of thousands of pounds we have given to other industries that survived only for a short while?  Surely the Minister cannot expect that a newspaper in its infancy, struggling to establish itself, should be a viable economic proposition.</P>
    <P>That yardstick is not applied to Radio na Gaeltachta.  Radio na Gaeltachta is fully subsidised.  The people in the Gaeltacht are not asked to pay any special fee or to contribute to the salaries of the people who are employed in Radio na Gaeltachta. Why should we be so concerned about <i>Amárach</i>?  As was stated by the Minister directly and indirectly to the deputations which came to visit him looking for this subsidy which would keep them viable, this was an organ which was being critical of the Government in office, and how could they expect that that would strengthen his hand to get them the money.</P>
    <P>Thank Heaven for one thing, that the management board of <i>Amárach</i><Col N="1169" /> thought more of their honour and their principles than they did of money.  However sad the disappearance of that paper is for the people of the Gaeltacht, I personally am happy that they went out with colours flying, upholding the freedom of the Press to say what they think is the correct thing to say irrespective of whether some people associated with it visit the Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael Ard Fheis to criticise a Minister, or whether it carries news items which are not complimentary to a Minister. I would hope that if the Minister deserves compliments he will get them, that if he deserves criticism he will get it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has in his company other Ministers who may not be greatly concerned whether the Gaeltacht or a paper in it survives.  I regret very much that time does not allow me to develop this matter in the way I had hoped, because Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, who is closer to the scene than I am, has asked that she be given an opportunity of contributing for some few minutes on this matter.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to ask the Minister to restore the subsidy to <i>Amárach</i> unless he makes it quite clear to them that in so doing he will also restore their freedom.  If he is not prepared to do that then I say, and I am sure I say it on behalf of <i>Amárach</i>, let him keep his money.</P>

    <P>A headline in today's <i>Irish Press</i>, &ldquo;No Tomorrow <i>Amárach&rdquo;</i>, spells disaster not only for the Irish language newspaper <i>Amárach</i> but for Irish and <Col N="1170" /> Gaeltacht people and people who are interested in the Irish language generally throughout the country.  We know on this side of the House, regardless of what the Minister for the Gaelteacht has been saying in the past four years, that the aim of the National Coalition Government has been to discourage all efforts to revitalise our language and our national heritage, and this final message that has come from the Minister, from his Department and from the Government, is the final straw for a newspaper which has been in circulation since 1942.  To make a case for its revival and for a subsidy from Roinn na Gaeltachta towards revitalising the newspaper, we must state what has happened since the newspaper was taken over two years ago by Comharchumann Chois Fhairrge.</P>

      <P>Is mór an trua nach bhfuil níos mó ama agam chun freagra a thabhairt don Teachta Tunney.   an 31 Márta, 1977 thug mé freagra iomlán agus mhínigh mé an scéal faoi <i>Amárach</i> go soiléir.  Tá sé sa Tuairisc Oifigiúil. The position is that the grant to <i>Amárach</i> has been doubled since this Government took office&mdash;from £100 to £200.</P>

      <P>In July, 1976 there was a massive increase of 66? per cent given in the grant to <i>Amárach</i> which I made retrospective to 1st January of last year, and I told them at a meeting at that time that if they made an effort to increase the sales of <i>Amárach</i> and to get the support of the people of the Gaeltacht I would favourably consider a further increase.</P>

      <P>They wrote to 70 organisations, co-operatives and development associations throughout the Gaeltacht asking for support for <i>Amárach</i>, or advice, and in their own words that effort was a complete <Col N="1171" /> failure.  Only three replies were received by the board of directors of <i>Amárach.</i> A report I got from them at the end of last year indicated that their net income from sales from each issue was only £29.  It is clear to me that the board of directors failed completely to get the support of the people of the Gaeltacht for the newspaper or to promote sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They came to me in dire trouble last February and even though they had failed to promote sales or support and that they were not worthy of an additional grant, I was anxious to save the newspaper and to help them.  We agreed at that meeting that Bord na Gaeilge would be called in to help to examine the matter and to make recommendations.  Bord na Gaeilge subsequently undertook this.  They appointed consultants.  There has been a delay, part of which was caused by Comharchumann Chois Fhairrge themselves because when Bord na Gaeilge sent consultants down to meet them by prior arrangement, the people they were supposed to meet were not there and a whole fortnight was lost. The report is now being prepared and as soon as I receive it I will consider <Col N="1172" /> it, as I intended to do at all times. I will not yield to the gross misrepresentation perpetrated by certain spokesmen in Comharchumann Chois Fharraige who failed to sell the newspaper or to make any effort to get support for it.  Neither will I be pressured by the puny efforts of Fianna Fáil who are shedding crocodile tears&mdash;&mdash;</P>
