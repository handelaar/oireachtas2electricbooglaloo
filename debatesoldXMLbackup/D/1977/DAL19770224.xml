      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Before moving the adjournment yesterday I was developing the point that, while this Bill is a very comprehensive piece of legislation which consolidates and codifies all existing landlord and tenant laws since 1931, its principal feature concerns ground rent, and I wish to address myself to the sections dealing with ground rent.  I will deal with the position of existing ground rents and use, but not necessarily accept, the very dubious figures of the Minister for Local Government with regard to the Coalition's building programme over the last four years.  Because of delay by the Minister for Justice in introducing this measure we have seen the creation of approximately 75,000 new ground rents since this Coalition came into power.  This has happened despite the fact that we assured the Minister and the House that if they introduced a simple Bill of three or four sections banning the creation of ground rents, we would give it speedy passage through this House.  During his four years in office the Minister consistently refused to bring in such a Bill pending the introduction of the Landlord and Tenant Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was also making the point that the whole vexed question of existing ground rents is not properly tackled <Col N="316" /> in this Bill.  A legitimate campaign for the abolition of ground rents was waged for many years, particularly by ACRA, on the fundamental principle that when a man buys a house he should also buy the land on which it is built.  We have had a long history of campaigning against penal land legislation during our occupation by a foreign power, which unfortunately is still in one part of our country.  This legislation does not go far enough to assist the householder to remove the medieval yoke of ground rents from around the people's necks.</P>
    <P>It was announced that the Bill would reduce the considerable legal and other costs involved in buying ground rents, but section 15 imposes on householders the costs of arbitration, the landlord's costs, his expenses and the householder's own expenses. We have there four sets of expenses. Yet the Minister tells us that the purpose of this Bill is to minimise the lessee's expenses.  This whole question cries out for clarification and I hope the Minister will accept amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I will deal now with the right of a lessor to evict a lessee if the latter refuses to pay ground rent.  There can be the ludicrous situation of a man living in a £20,000 or £30,000 house on which there is a £1 a year ground rent.  If on a point of principle he refuses to pay the ground rent, the ground landlord can bring him to court and get an eviction order against him.  This means that the ground landlord could take possession of this house because the houseowner did not pay £1 ground rent.  This ludicrous situation cries out for action by the Minister.  Yet in this very detailed Bill, 56 pages long, with various Schedules, there is nothing to protect the lessee in a situation like this.</P>
    <P>The reasonable way to tackle this situation would be to give power to the ground landlord to take a civil action for recovery of a debt from the lessee rather than the threat and power of eviction as in the present legislation and as it will be in this proposed legislation.  I would like to see the Minister accepting the amendment Fianna Fáil will be submitting <Col N="317" /> on this question because it is a medieval barbarity to have this power of eviction for not paying ground rent.</P>
    <P>I was also developing the point that there is no section in this Bill which will rectify the present situation where local authorities are the developers of estates.  In my own constituency there are the estates of Donaghmede and Priorswood which was developed by Dublin Corporation.  The houses in Donaghmede were built by one builder but there were various builders involved in Priorswood.  The houses were purchased in the normal way, that is, by way of mortgages, SDA loans and so on.  The people who bought these houses are unable to buy the ground rents because their ground landlords are the local authority, in this case, Dublin Corporation.  I would like to see this position clarified on Committee Stage and hope the Minister will accept our amendment.</P>
    <P>The problem of local authority tenants should have been tackled in the Bill and I hope the Minister will accept our amendments on this at a later stage.  He has attempted to tackle the problem of ground rents but I think he has failed miserably in his approach.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will accept on Committee Stage the amendments which will be tabled by our spokesman, Deputy G. Collins, to tighten up the situation, particularly with regard to the power of eviction for nonpayment of ground rent.  This is a matter which should have been tackled without waiting for a Fianna Fáil amendment to be tabled.  Section 15 imposes on the tenants the costs of arbitration, the landlord's costs and expenses and their own expenses. These expenses will exacerbate an already difficult situation.  The whole question of the right of home-owners to buy out the ground rent from local authorities and the situation of local authority tenants should be tackled on Committee Stage.  I am sorry that the Minister having delayed legislation for so long has failed to grasp the nettle. He has met very few of the legitimate demands made throughout the campaign against ground rents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on making a serious effort in this Bill to tackle the problem of ground rents.  There has been widespread public interest and discussion on this matter and there is now a very strong demand for action.</P>
      <P>I intend to take an objective view of this Bill.  In general, it is an excellent Bill but there is one item in section 108 which worries me and I will deal with that towards the latter part of my speech.  There are items in that section which need serious study by the Minister even at this late stage and which, in my opinion, require some kind of amendment.</P>
      <P>For a great part of our history the ground rents system fulfilled the functions now covered by our planning laws.  In many of our cities and towns there are fine streets and squares and terraced houses.  The character of these places was preserved because the superior landlord imposed restrictions in the leases. People had to keep their houses in good repair.  They were also restricted in the use they could make of their houses and they were not free to use the buildings for shops or garages. The restrictions were such that many estates were well managed and maintained and this is one of the main reasons why a very good case could be made for the retention of ground rents before the introduction of Planning Acts.  This was shown very clearly in the report of the Ground Rents Commission in 1964.  Judge Conroy, the chairman of that commission, was misjudged.  It is obvious to anybody who has made a study of ground rents that they fulfilled a reasonably important function in the past.  Following the introduction of planning legislation, the planning authorities and local authorities are now in a better position to carry out these tasks.  These authorities can now ensure that estates and houses in our cities and towns are maintained in an orderly way.  Many people were worried in 1964 that the local authorities would not be able to enforce the restrictions necessary for good management but the Planning Acts have enabled them to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a most comprehensive Bill. <Col N="319" /> I do not wish to delay the debate so I will now deal with section 108.  This section is the key to the whole Bill because it restricts the right to create leases of dwellings.  It prohibits and prevents the creation of new ground rents.  I want to make the point that a person who has a title to property cannot convey to anybody else a better title to such land or property than he has himself.  I would ask the Minister to consider a situation in which a developer or builder does not have a fee simple title.  Because he has only a leasehold title, he is restricted by this Bill from creating further ground rents; he is not in a position to pass on a fee simple title.  The Bill can present difficulties for such a developer or builder.  I am putting this as a Government backbencher and as somebody who wholeheartedly supports the Bill to the Minister.  I would like him to investigate this.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of a builder in Dublin who has 70 acres of land to develop.  He can have that virgin land held under three or four different leasehold titles.  The developer would normally grant leases to house purchasers subject to £5, £10 or whatever it is for each house.  There was no problem there up to now.  He is now in the situation whereby he has only three or four different leasehold interests and because of that he cannot convey the fee simple.  If he builds houses on that land he may find that he cannot dispose of them.  If he tries to give the best title he has, that is a leasehold title, there is already a rent on the lands from his superior landlord. He has a lease for 800 years, his superior landlord has a lease for 900 years and the superior landlord again has a lease for 999 years.</P>
    <P>This man has built houses on this land.  He cannot create leases now.  He is not entitled to transfer subject to a rent but the solicitors for the purchasers of any of those houses would ask how the developer's superior landlord is indemnified.  The purchasers would have to be satisfied that the superior landlord is indemnified.  If he is not indemnified the solicitors for the purchasers would not agree to accept the titles.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="320" /> The houses must be indemnified against something.  If this builder builds 800 houses on this estate each of them must be indemnified against the rent.  He will not be able to do this under this Bill.  He could put the rent on the roads or the pathways but if the rent is not being paid by the original landlord to the superior landlord the immediate landlord can try to pursue his right against the roads.  It is of no benefit to him because he cannot get the money from anybody.</P>
    <P>The tenants may feel happy enough but the landlord can try to proceed against those paths or roads. This is a very difficult situation.  Section 108 refers back to section 66. This section gives a general right to acquire a fee simple but in this instance, because it is new land for building on, the developer of the property has not a right to acquire the fee simple.  Section 66 refers to section 37 which deals with the conditions to be applied in the case of a person who holds or has held land under a lease and who seeks a reversionary lease. This developer to whom I have referred is not covered at the moment in sections 108, 66 or 37.  I believe it is necessary to have some amendment here.</P>
    <P>The developer, if he was to give the best title he has, could assign the property but he would still be restricted. If there is a rent there somebody will have to be indemnified against it.  He cannot transfer his rent to a new purchaser of one of the houses.  Who will indemnify the immediate landlord for his rent?  This will be raised on acquisition of title by solicitors for house purchasers who will have to be satisfied on this issue.  I do not know if the Minister had this in mind when the Bill was being drafted.</P>
    <P>I suggest there are two alternatives out of this.  The first would be to grant leases at a very nominal rent such as 1p on each house.  That would run contrary to the Bill and would be the less favourable alternative.  I suggest that the developer of those lands would have a statutory right to acquire the fee simple by means of a statutory vesting certificate.  He could go to his county registrar and say to him &ldquo;I have 70 acres of land.  The rent is £10 <Col N="321" /> an acre, that is £700 and for eight years I am prepared to pay £5,600. Will you give me a statutory vesting certificate and let my immediate landlord come and prove his title?  He can claim this money from me which you can pay to him.  I want a statutory vesting certificate from you which will indemnify me&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If a developer builds four houses to an acre on a 70 acre estate that would be quite a considerable number of houses.  When the houses are built the immediate landlord, recognising that the builder had invested a considerable sum of money in the erection of the houses and the development of the estate, would call the tune and hold up the acquisition of the fee simple. This could result in long and protracted negotiations before the fee simple is acquired.  A solicitor for the purchaser of such a house would be unwise to close the sale because this point was not clarified.  That is why there must be some statutory right to acquire a fee simple by means of a statutory vesting certificate.  If such a certificate could be issued by a county registrar, the situation would be most satisfactory and the difficulties I have mentioned would be overcome.  To avoid having superior landlords being in a position to ask exorbitant prices for the fee simple county registrars must be given the authority to issue statutory vesting certificates.  There must be some safeguard in this matter. I hope the Minister will deal with this when replying.</P>
    <P>This legislation is most complex and it deals with a matter which was considered by the Ground Rents Commission in 1964.  That commission in relation to the restriction of further ground rents recommended that the creation of further ground rents in the case of residences and combined residences and businesses was undesirable but they were unable to recommend machinery for prohibiting the creation of such rents.  While that commission was not in a position to recommend machinery for prohibiting the creation of new ground rents the Minister has done a great deal further in this regard.  The provisions in this regard contained in the Bill are most <Col N="322" /> desirable.  The purchasing of all ground rents outright would be most comprehensive and entail Government assistance.  However, such a scheme could be operated through a body like the Land Commission.  It would help to simplify the titles to properties throughout the country.  My suggestion is that the Government issue bonds to the superior landlords and the ground rent tenants pay the Government off over a fixed period, similar to the land annuities paid to the Land Commission by farmers.  I hope the Minister will consider that suggestion.</P>
    <P>Now that the Planning Act is in operation and that covenants and restrictions on leases and leaseholds are better looked after by local authorities, a scheme such as I have suggested to deal with ground rents should be prepared.  The amount of money involved would not be considerable but such a scheme would be of great benefit to householders who pay ground rent.  This section in the Land Commission which dealt with annuities would be in a position to deal with such a scheme because they have machinery to process it.  They also have the expertise to look after it.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill county registrars will have the power to arbitrate and look after the purchase of ground rents in the future.  That is a good thing and it will mean that it will be cheaper for people to purchase ground rents.  However, in some instances it will place a great deal of extra work on county registrars and I do not know if they have sufficient personnel to cope with this extra work.  This measure will mean a lot of extra work and I can visualise this happening particularly in Laois-Offaly where the county registrar's office will have a lot more to do.  I would have preferred to see this work fall on the Land Commission who have expertise in these matters.  Of course so have county registrars because they are all experienced solicitors and are aware of all the problems in relation to title.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with local authority residences and I can see some problems arising there.  People who have council houses vested in them subject to an annuity payable in <Col N="323" /> quaterly instalments may not sell or dispose otherwise of their houses without the written consent of the local authority and they are not allowed to sell to anybody who is not qualified under the Labourers Acts. In fairness to county councils, they have used a great deal of discretion to extend the scope of those Acts in a fair manner but I have seen problems in cases of fathers transferring to their sons.  Some of these houses which fathers may wish to have transferred to their sons are in a dilapidated condition and need considerable reconstruction. Councils give grants and loans for that work but the father may be an elderly man and not be able to pay off the loan.  I cannot see why councils do not consent readily to such transfers.  People living in council houses are as entitled to transfer within the family as are house owners in Dún Laoghaire, Cabinteely or anywhere else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat my point in regard to section 108 on the creation of new leases and would ask the Minister to consider amending that section to prevent clogging up.  This is an excellent measure because it provides the machinery which the Government in 1964 did not provide in their Bill.  It is highly desirable to eliminate obstacles because most people are anxious to have clear title to the property they own.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnan" hpid="Mr. Brosnan Mr. Brosnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues on this side I welcome the Bill, but I do so with reservations.  I welcome the Bill because I regard it as a serious if belated effort to consolidate landlord and tenant law, an effort to clear up what has been a veritable jungle.  It will be a boon not only to students but to practitioners.  I welcome some of the amendments provided in this Bill to existing law and some of the new provisions introduced in it.  This must of necessity create new problems and new difficulties.  Unfortunately some <Col N="324" /> of the most glaring and major difficulties in the 1931 Landlord and Tenant Act have been left untouched and, therefore, unresolved.  I shall deal with these on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I should like to remind the Minister now and the House of the genesis of this Bill.  It was mooted three or four years ago and the Minister and his colleagues now introduce this Bill, after a long period of gestation, on the eve of a general election.  It was presented with a great flourish, hailed and accepted by the Press and the other media as something wonderful, the <i>Magna Carta</i> of the tenants, the final remedy for all their ills.  It is, of course, nothing of the kind.  Unless the Minister, as was pointed out by Deputy Collins, accepts substantial amendments and changes in the Bill he will miss the opportunity he had of catering for tenants with long standing, genuine grievances, tenants who deserve to have their vexatious relationships between them and their landlords resolved.  The great hopes these people have had for years are going to be dashed by the Minister.  Initially the Press seemed to get the impression that this Bill would do away completely with ground rents.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  There is, in fact, a provision in this Bill for the creation of more and more ground rents.  The Bill makes a provision for the State and local authorities to continue as landlords, in the worst sense of the word.  The State and local authorities are the biggest landlords, if not actual speculators, and this Bill provides that they can continue to reserve the right to collect ground rents.  I shall come back to that later.</P>
      <P>My main criticism of this Bill is the fact that it transfers the whole of the administration of landlord and tenant law, in so far as councils are concerned with ground rents and the creation of new tenancies, from the Circuit Court to the county registrar.  I believe this will create enormous problems.  I believe it will make this Bill unworkable. The role of the county registrar will be enlarged.  Indeed, his powers and functions have increased to such an extent that I believe he will not be able to deal with the new workload.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="325" /> There is some doubt&mdash;it is a doubt I have and it is shared by many others &mdash;that the transfer of these judicial powers from a judge, who is duly appointed and sworn in in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution &mdash;Article 34, if I remember correctly &mdash;to a county registrar is unconstitutional. I do not want to embark on a constitutional debate with the Minister but I should like him to give us an assurance that this is not so.  I would like him to assure us there is no constitutional objection to making the county registrar the arbiter in these matters.  I believe, of course, that the difficulties the county registrar will encounter in this proposed new role will be so numerous and so complex as to make them almost insuperable. The powers proposed in section 12 are vast.  The Minister is a legal practitioner and he knows well that the county registrar will have to deal at length with complex matters of both law and fact.  I need not remind the Minister of how difficult these questions of law can be.  Take, for example, tracing title.  Very often it is a matter for experts who specialise in that branch of law.  I find it difficult to visualise an unfortunate county registrar, with all the other burdens of his office, having the time and the opportunity to deal with complex matters of law and fact.  Complex matters of fact will require the examination of witnesses and documents.</P>
    <P>With all due respect to county registrars, and I am not one to reflect upon them, they have not got the experience, the training, the expertise or the disciplines that judges have in dealing with complex difficulties and involved matters of both law and fact.  They are not trained for that.  The county registrar is a <i>quasi</i> civil servant.  He is not in touch with what one might describe as judicial functions.  He does not even practise in the courts.  He is out of touch with the rules of evidence, procedure and privilege, all of which require expertise to enable one to adjudicate correctly in these complex matters of law and fact, matters which could involve very important properties.</P>
    <P>I am not casting any reflection on <Col N="326" /> the ability or integrity of county registrars but it is too much to expect them to perform difficult duties for which they are not trained and which are properly the province of judges.  I do not believe that the kind of adjudication which it is proposed to give to county registrars will be conducive to the standardisation and harmonisation of the law and of the provisions of this Bill. According to the Minister's proposals here, one county registrar will make up his mind on one matter while another may come to a different opinion on the same matter.  The law will not be properly settled and fixed as is the case when a decision is made in the Circuit Court or in the High Court.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, this adjudication of law behind closed doors is not proper in justice.  In the matter of ground rents and leases with which this Bill is concerned not only should justice be done but it should be seen to be done in an open court adjudicated on by judges who are sworn in in accordance with the Constitution. They take a solemn oath to administer justice without fear or favour but county registrars do not give such a solemn undertaking.  This slipshod method of dealing with the serious and sensitive problem of ground rents is not good enough.  The people deserve better.</P>
    <P>Apart from his own personal or professional limitations, the county registrar has not the staff to deal with the enormously increased workload which he will have to undertake if this Bill becomes law.  This will be particularly the case if this Bill is as popular as the Minister thinks it will be and if it is availed of by as many people as we are led to believe will be the case.  The county registrar has not the staff, accommodation or facilities to administer the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright said that this would not present any difficulties in Laois-Offaly but I can assure the Minister it will present enormous difficulties in the county and city of Cork and I speak with some experience and authority on the situation there.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the greatly increased burden of work put on county registrars under the Juries Act of <Col N="327" /> last year.  In the county registrar's area of Cork city and county juries have to be called for four criminal sittings each year and usually they last for three weeks apiece.  During that time a jury panel of about 600 has to be called every day.  The High Court also sits in Cork city three times yearly usually for a period of two weeks.  Each sitting lasts a fortnight and the same number of jurors have to be called.  That means there are at least seven sittings a year and on each occasion the panel numbers between 600 to 700 jurors.  That works out at something in the region of 6,000 jurors per annum all of whom have to be notified by the county registrar.  Those who want to be excused have to be dealt with and this involves lengthy correspondence with them and with others.  This happens to such an extent that county registrars in busy areas such as Cork, Dublin and Limerick are inundated with work of this kind.</P>
    <P>In addition to catering for juries, the county registrar has to deal with a revision court once a year.  In the Cork area such a court dealing with electoral lists lasts for four to six weeks. Now that persons of 18 years can vote the workload of the county registrars is increased further.  In view of this I doubt if county registrars could deal seriously with the difficult judicial matter of arbitrating on the issues dealt with in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has claimed that the transfer of administration of this legislation to the county registrars will be an economy but I do not think that will be the case.  It means that a county registrar in Cork will have to leave the city and travel to Glengarriff and Bere Island, which is 90 miles from Cork city, and he will have to take his staff with him.  Parties may have to travel from Cork city to a place 60 or 70 miles away with their witnesses and legal representatives. Apart from the inconvenience of making these journeys it would involve them in enormous expense.  Alternatively the parties may have to travel from Glengarriff or Bere Island to Cork city.  Then there is the matter of adjournments for one reason or another when the parties may have to <Col N="328" /> return to the venue of the first sitting. Either way it would involve trouble and expense.</P>
    <P>Instead of making the county registrars the arbitrators in these matters the Minister should consider using circuit judges who sit in most large towns and who are trained and have experience of all these matters.  Alternatively the Minister could consider transferring this jurisdiction to District Courts, making each district justice responsible for the administration of this kind of law in his own area.  The district justice has the premises, the staff and the experience.  He is <i>au fait</i> with all the developments, has experience in rent restrictions and would be in a better position to deal with this matter than the county registrar.  I should like the Minister to give us a good reason why the administration of the proposals in the Bill could not be carried out effectively by a district justice.</P>
    <P>My second objection to the Bill is that it does not remove the defects contained in the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931.  In particular I refer to the mechanism which is used by landlords to prevent tenants from acquiring rights to which they are entitled under the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931.  The Minister must know of many cases of unscrupulous landlords employing these devices to evade the provisions of the Act and who will continue to do so under the provisions of this Bill.  Instead of leasing a premises landlords use the device of leasing equipment in premises such as machinery and counters.  Deputy Enright spoke about the renting or hiring of equipment in a fish and chip shop.  The landlord uses the device of making a hiring agreement instead of a letting, of not giving a lease but giving a licence to the occupier for the use of the equipment on the premises or for the use of waste space at the back of the premises for an exorbitant rent and giving the premises itself free of rent.  The written agreement is binding upon the occupier of the premises.</P>
    <P>The occupier has free premises but has to pay an exorbitant rent for some convenience such as a counter or some other piece of equipment. <Col N="329" /> The conditions remain good during the period of the hiring.  By that means the occupier could never acquire any rights under the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931.  That device is still used by unscrupulous landlords who will continue to use it under this Bill. The device prevents tenants from acquiring the rights to which they are entitled, such as the right to a new tenancy, to compensation for disturbance and so on.  When one hiring agreement is terminated the landlord may make a more onerous one.</P>
    <P>The people being deprived of their rights are an essential part of the community.  They are the self-employed&mdash;fitters, carpenters, electricians and others who enter into hiring agreements with unscrupulous landlords.  They build up a trade and at the end of the hiring or licensing period must surrender the premises to the landlord.  These are usually people of initiative and courage who build up goodwill in their business during the currency of the letting. They get married and build a house in the neighbourhood and are paying ground rent as well.  At the end of this agreement they are faced with either destitution or a substitute agreement with more onerous terms, with a higher rent, or else they get out.  In the meantime the landlord has the benefit of the goodwill which has been built up in respect of his premises, also the enhanced value of the premises and perhaps fittings that have been put in by the occupant.  All that can still go on under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The most typical example of this is the case where the petrol companies hire the petrol pump and perhaps some other equipment to the occupier for a rent of £30, £40, £60, £70 a week or maybe more depending on the situation of the petrol station.  They let him go into occupation of the petrol station or the garage free of rent and of course he is debarred from gaining any rights under the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, and under this Bill as well.</P>
    <P>Another mean device which is used by unscrupulous landlords and which will prevent a tenant, in this case a real tenant, not an occupier, from acquiring any rights under the Landlord <Col N="330" /> and Tenant Act, 1931 or under this Bill, is that whereby the landlord refuses to give the tenant a lease for three years or more, three years being the statutory period under the 1931 Act to entitle a tenant to certain rights. He can let the premises for a period of three years less one day, or one month, and after the termination of that period the landlord takes a formal surrender of the premises.  He usually demands the key, which terminates completely the tenancy of two years and nine months or whatever period less than three years it happens to be. During that period no benefits or rights have accrued to the tenant.  On the following day the landlord can make a similar agreement, and so it can go on <i>ad infinitum</i>.  The period of the second, third or fourth lease can never count along with the period of the first lease.  There must be a full three-year period before he is entitled to any rights and a large number of periods of less than three years are useless.</P>
    <P>Another variation on that theme is used by others in that at the end of the tenancy they compel the tenants to convert themselves into a company. They give them a lease for less than three years as individuals.  Then they are turned into a company, and then perhaps on the next occasion they become another company under a different name and so on again <i>ad infinitum</i>.  The tenancy of the company is different from that of the individual. At no time will the individual be the predecessor in title, as the legal phrase goes, of the company; nor will the company be the predecessor in title of the individual.  The combined leases or tenancies can never benefit the tenant.  There are various tunes which can be played on that instrument.</P>
    <P>The same social ills and hardships follow from these arrangements.  A man sets up a home and a family and has to face destitution or unemployment or else submit again to the landlord's demands for a new tenancy on new and more onerous terms.  Again the section of the community which is affected are those people of some consequence and significance, people with courage and initiative.  They are the people who suffer most under this <Col N="331" /> insidious system.  Nothing has been done by the Minister to rectify that situation.  I am not suggesting this is done wholesale but it is done too often.</P>
    <P>If a person is entitled to own his home he should not be debarred from owning his working premises where very often he spends a lifetime.  The Minister tries to distinguish between premises which constitute the family home and premises connected with the person's occupation.  He tries to justify the fact that he is doing nothing for those by saying that people are not so sensitive about occupation tenancies as they are about their homes.  In other words, they are entitled to have their homes without any snags like ground rent, but the Minister would appear to think that they are not sensitive to the situation in regard to their working premises and that they do not need to be in full, freehold possession of premises in which they make their living.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that thesis at all. The individual has a moral right and should be given a statutory right to purchase outright the premises in which he makes a living, be those premises a chip shop, a garage or anything else.  These licences are only a subterfuge to enable the landlord to prevent people from having those rights.  The courts are not allowed look behind the words in a written agreement to see what is the real meaning intended. There should be some provision in this Bill to deal with this situation.</P>
    <P>The sort of people who are denied these rights are carpenters, fitters and so on.  These are the people who, more than any others, help to keep the economy going.  They should be catered for in this Bill.  The legislation in this regard is so farcical as to bring into disrepute the whole law of the land. This Bill affects everybody, either directly or indirectly, but I suggest that it will be administered inadequately by county registrars through no fault of their own but because this new additional burden is being foisted on them.  The Minister should consider seriously transferring the administration of this legislation either to <Col N="332" /> the District Court or to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in this Bill which renders the State and local authorities immune in respect of the purchase of freeholds.  This is understandable in so far as certain types of local authority housing are concerned &mdash;for example, where a local authority would retain their hold on these dwellings so as to be able to cater for certain groups of people or for an <i>ad hoc</i> situation.  However that is not so in the average case.  What happens is that the local authority sell sites fully serviced to people such as civil servants, gardaí, and solicitors.</P>
    <P>These people would not qualify now for local authority loans, but at a time when they did so qualify, provision was made in the mortgage for repayment during a period of 20 or 25 years.  On the expiration of the term of the loan the mortgagee should have been entitled to full ownership of the property.  People like to own their properties in full and without snags but in these cases the local authority insist on retaining ground rent rights for the further period of the lease which was either 74 or 79 years.</P>
    <P>That situation is unjustified.  Why should local authorities be above the law?  Much emphasis is being placed on the provision in this Bill to prevent further ground rents being created and for the purchase of those that exist but why is there specific provision for the perpetuation of ground rent in some cases?  Deputy Enright mentioned the necessity for a continuance of the situation in parts of the country.  In some areas such covenants are necessary and desirable in order to prevent the despoiling of the countryside or of premises, but there is ample provision for local authorities under the planning laws to enable them to interfere in order to prevent any such despoliation.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware that there is much dissatisfaction in relation to this provision.  I trust that when he is replying he will be able to indicate a change of mind or at least to be able to assure us that there is justification for it.</P>
    <P>There are some other matters in the <Col N="333" /> Minister's brief to which I had intended to refer but I shall leave them for the moment as they may be more appropriate to the next Stage.  Deputy Collins reminded us that in recent times there have been very few demands for ground rents in cases where the rents had been paid down through the years.</P>
    <P>It was well known that many so-called agents have been collecting ground rents for years for landlords who do not exist and who have not existed for many years and they are pocketing the ground rents.  The Minister should make a provision for the prohibition of that malpractice.  Some onus should be placed on the agent or landlord to show his entitlement to a ground rent before making the demand.</P>
    <P>This is a consolidating Bill but there are no reforms at all.  The big snags which are seen in the 1931 Act are still there.  The law can be abused and exploited by unscrupulous landlords. Unless the Bill is substantially amended it will not serve the purpose for which it was intended. Good legislation, especially legislation such as this which is social legislation, should reflect the spirit of the times, should reflect the problems, the desires and the consensus of the citizens.  This Bill does not do that. The philosophy of the Just Society which we heard so much about some years ago is not reflected in this Bill. Unless the Minister makes substantial changes in this Bill he will fail to deliver the new deal which he and the Government promised to the tenants of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House has been widely welcomed not only by the House in general but by people who reflect public opinion.  The Minister is to be congratulated for bringing in this Bill.  It is a consolidating Bill and also a reforming Bill.  It substantially simplifies the code of law in relation to landlords and tenants.  I do not agree with the last speaker's concluding remarks.  The Bill is substantially reforming and reflects the social need of our time. It is a progressive piece of legislation. The last Government could have brought in a socially desirable Bill <Col N="334" /> such as this but failed to do so.  This Bill is one of a number of socially desirable Bills which the Minister has introduced in the short time of his Ministry.  It is a reflection of the social conscience of this Government.  This Bill is another contribution to the evolving of the Just Society to which the last speaker referred.  We will be seen as a socially just society where exploitation is not tolerated by the Government.  Our Government have a better record in relation to countering exploitation than the previous Government can boast of.</P>
      <P>I am not a legal person and I will not deal with the legal intricacies of the Bill but instead with the social improvements the Bill will bring about.  The prohibition of the creation of new ground rents on dwellinghouses is a major step forward.  There has been much wild agitation in relation to the question of ground rents in the past few years which have not been justified in the context of the Constitution of our country.  This emotional issue was used by a number of bodies such as Sinn Féin, who are very prone to get on every and any bandwagon in order to be destructive and vocal against any Government but more particularly against the present Government.  The Minister in his speech was quite right when he said he believed that one of the fundamental aspects of this agitation in respect of the abolition of ground rent could be described as an emotional rejection of a system which allows the landlord an unreasonable degree of control over the tenant's family home.  The Minister considered the question of ground rents in the context of our Constitution.  I agree with him also when he says that it would be wrong to have any element of confiscation in this legislation.  That is a proper interpretation of the Constitution as it should apply to this question.  It relates to the protection of one's personal rights under the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Landlords perhaps are looked on as mostly of the rack-rent or exploitation type but they are not necessarily so. Many poor people are landlords and many charities depend on revenue <Col N="335" /> from rents to exist and to carry out their charitable functions.  The local authorities are landlords in relation to council houses particularly, which are provided for people who either do not want or cannot afford to buy houses of their own.  One must maintain a balance to ensure&mdash;and this Bill does &mdash;that the local authority carry out their functions in this sphere.  I will digress if the Ceann Comhairle will allow me, and say in passing that the purchasing schemes of local authorities in relation to council houses do ensure that those people who want to buy out their houses are allowed to do so on very advantageous terms.  That is as it should be, not only because tenants of council houses who want to buy out their houses should be allowed to do so but they should be encouraged to do so at special rates, not so much to give them a capital gain, which happens anyway, but to relieve the local authority of their subvention in respect of housing subsidies.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it must be pointed out that the prohibition of the creation of new ground rents on dwellinghouses is a major step forward which could have been taken many years ago.  It is perfectly within the Constitution.  The Minister went rather deeply into this in his speech.  There is a general body of feeling, which is reflected in this House, in favour of restricting the creation of new ground rents and this measure will be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The second major achievement of the Bill is the simplification of the buying out of existing ground rents. The county registrars are now the arbiters of any dispute that arises in this matter.  This arbitration procedure which was originally introduced under the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967, has been extended to all matters with which this Bill deals, with certain minor exceptions. The procedure which allows the county registrars to deal with this matter will have two effects.  One will be to eliminate unnecessary delays if one has to wait for a court sitting thus allowing the matter to be dealt with more speedily.  The second advantage will be the reduction in expenses in relation to the purchasing of the fee <Col N="336" /> simple of a property.  One is always slow to go before the courts if this can be avoided, and the existence of a permanent person, so to speak, who is readily approachable and accessible is a constructive step forward in this field of legislation.</P>
    <P>The last speaker, Deputy Brosnan, expressed reservations about the correctness of using the county registrars for this purpose and about the county registrars' ability to deal with the complex questions which can arise in relation to such arbitration.  I take the point.  Deputy Brosnan has wide experience in this field, and perhaps two things should be done in this respect. The first and most important is that the offices of the county registrars should be properly staffed to deal with this question of arbitration and the complementary question of the keeping of a register in respect of such arbitration. I do not think that the county registrars' offices as presently staffed would be capable of dealing with what must be a fairly serious widening of their functions and there is not the necessary expertise which will be required to back up the county registrars as arbiters.  Also the county registrars in carrying out this function, in the course of arbitration should be empowered to call in assessors on any cases before them or about to be brought before them.  There will arise many complicated cases, not only of law but of commercial importance, which will require that assessors be called in.</P>
    <P>Commercial dealing, not only in relation to dwellinghouses but more particularly in relation to business leases and so on, can be very complicated and can involve a frightening amount of money.  These suggested measures would be welcomed by the county registrar.</P>
    <P>The question of landlord and tenant rights has always been historically a matter for debate and critical concern. In my constituency there is a case which is perhaps typical of the history of landlords and tenants in Ireland. I am speaking of the Cappoquin Estate Co. Ltd., the landlord with a substantial tract of property including the town of Cappoquin, County Waterford.  Historically it has given rise to much <Col N="337" /> public concern.  Down through the years the tenants have felt very aggrieved at the attitude of the landlord to their right either to renew their leases or their tenancies, or their right to purchase as ground tenants the houses in which they live.  On occasion there has been an outcry, and quite properly so, about this situation.  The tenants have not been dealt with fairly.  They made submissions to the Landlord and Tenant Commission.  The Minister is fully aware of their concern.  He met a deputation some time ago and they put their case to him directly.</P>
    <P>I take it this Bill will ensure that the rights of tenants in dwelling houses in Cappoquin will be protected.  I hope the tenants in Cappoquin will now find it easier either to renew their leases or buy out their ground rents. I trust the Minister has taken the necessary steps to ensure that.  As I said, there has been an unfortunate history of landlord and tenant aggravation, so to speak, down through the years.</P>
    <P>The rights of landlords should also be fairly protected.  One always feels it is the tenant who is being exploited, but one must also acknowledge that, on occasion, the landlord has lost certain rights relating to property which he owns.  It is essential in any legislation to protect the landlord and the tenant fairly and equitably.  I admit the balance is often complicated and it is difficult to ensure that both sides are equitably protected.  The Minister has made a good effort to do that in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 57 dealing with sporting leases provides:</P>
    <P>A club or organisation ... carrying on some outdoor sport, game or recreation ...</P>
    <P>I wonder why the word &ldquo;outdoor&rdquo; is used.  Many sports are played indoors such as squash, badminton, and so on, which should have equal rights with outdoor sports in this Bill.  I raise this point because it struck me on reading the Bill.  I am sure the Minister will clarify his attitude on this matter.  I am quite pleased with the provision about sporting leases.  Anything the Government can do to make life easier for <Col N="338" /> sporting clubs is to the benefit of the community as a whole and deserves the support of this House.</P>
    <P>All in all I welcome the Bill.  It is a significant step forward socially and legislatively on the whole question of landlords and tenants.  It is another reflection of this Government's concern to ensure that we all live in a fair, just and equitable society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House.  I have been in the House for some hours and I found the discussion most interesting.  I wish to record my disappointment that the Bill does not go far enough in that it does not seek the complete abolition of ground rents.  As other speakers have pointed out, ground rent has been a source of friction and, in many cases, has poisoned relationships between communities and between landlords and tenants in the city and country.</P>
      <P>I also wish to express my disappointment that local authorities have been excluded from the provisions of this Bill.  In the constituency I represent many local authority houses are almost 45 to 50 years old and the lease has only about 40 years to run.  Some owners are finding it difficult to dispose of their houses because of the short leases.  I appeal to the Minister before the Bill goes through to make some provision to deal with this injustice and, in some cases, discrimination against local authority owner-occupiers.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Leas-Cheann Comhairle ruled out the question of flat-dwellers. I fail to see why they should not be provided for in the Bill.  There are glaring injustices in that area. Most city public representatives have experience of the difficulties of flat-dwellers. Many of them have been exploited, particularly newly married couples and single people seeking accommodation.  In many instances, landlords have acquired property and developed it without planning permission and rented accommodation at exorbitant rents.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that.  I have been present in the courts on many occasions and it is my experience that landlords can get eviction orders very readily.  The local authority have to make a rescue operation by providing accommodation.  Landlords who acquired property for redevelopment purposes developed the premises and made handsome profits but the local authority have to provide accommodation after an eviction. There is no means by which they can be recouped for providing that accommodation. In many cases there are other people on the list who cannot get accommodation.</P>

      <P>I just wish to record my disappointment that this Bill does not go the whole hog to the complete abolition of ground rents.  I have attended very many meetings of residents' associations.  One point in their programme is the complete abolition of ground rents.  In the discussion so far I note that the only contributors on the Government side were Fine Gael Party Members and I wondered if there was any degree of conflict there when no Labour Party Member supporting the Government had made any contribution.  Recently the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs made a public statement urging the abolition of ground rents without compensation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was implied if it was not said.  Our spokesman, Deputy G. Collins, adverted to it and I thought I would follow up that point.  I believe the Bill does not go far enough.  It has some good features in that machinery, <Col N="340" /> although very cumbersome and expensive, will be provided to remedy some aspects of the ground rents situation, but the Bill certainly does not meet all the wishes of the vast majority of urban dwellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise with some trepidation and reluctance to speak on this Bill.  Because of its legal complexity it is obviously territory for the lawyers but it was suggested to me that there are one or two matters to which I should draw the Minister's attention.  Unfortunately, from the landlord's viewpoint, I think that socially and legally it is correct to say that they carry some odium because of the history of landlords in this country.  That is one of the difficulties landlords have in dealing with problems which arise.</P>
      <P>One of the main reasons the Bill got so much publicity was because it proposes to prevent the creation of further ground rents and to continue the extinguishing of present ground rents and to make this operation somewhat easier for those concerned.  I also gather that there is this tendency in legislation to reduce as far as possible the strictures and circumscriptions on tenants of houses so that tenants would have as few such restrictions as possible.  In this context I have been asked to make these two points which I hope are relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I am informed that tenants in taking out agreements now are compelled to agree to accept certain services from certain people particularly television and fuel oil.  I understand this applies in some housing estates and perhaps not in others.  I suggest the Minister should investigate the matter and, if my information is found to be true, that he should take steps to see that this situation does not continue.  The object of this legislation is to leave people free as far as possible in relation to their houses, to give those who wish to own their houses the opportunity of doing so as cheaply as possible and, having got the houses, they should become the complete owners and these niggling circumscriptions should not be allowed to develop and be written into law.  If this situation is allowed <Col N="341" /> to continue no doubt some successor of the Minister will find himself having to legislate for it in the future.  I understand that in sections 81 to 88 covenants are dealt with and I believe that what I am referring to is a covenant in those agreements.  I suggest the Minister should see if at this point he is in a position to do anything about the matter.  Those landlord and tenant problems are mostly problems of the larger urban areas.  We do not have to deal with them so much in rural constituencies particularly in view of the fact that this Bill does not refer to local authorities and I think that probably the local authority is the only landlord there.</P>
    <P>My second point is that it is surprising, in view of the fact that the legislation proposes to make things easier for the tenants, that the situation is retained whereby a tenant who does not pay his ground rent can be taken to court and evicted.  I think such a procedure would be very punitive at the present time.  I understand there are some other legal ways of dealing with it and I suggest that the Minister should ensure that those other ways are adopted rather than that we should continue to evict people under circumstances like this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The term &ldquo;ground rent&rdquo; tends to be emotive, probably because of our history.  I shall not say that I welcome the Bill conditionally because the fact that it is introduced is a step forward but it is a Bill which must be examined very carefully.  Some of its flaws are very obvious.  The power of ground landlords, especially in cities like Dublin, is enormous and very often the ground landlord is effectively the planning authority&mdash;not the local authority as people might think.  In the centre city area we have rather large business elements which buy ground rents and they can then determine what type of development will take place in that area.  Suppose we need office blocks there or houses, they can decide whether they will give permission and that is why I say that very often the ground landlord is in effect the planning authority.  I say this to show how important it is to <Col N="342" /> have the most enlightened legislation possible on this matter.</P>
      <P>The Bill surprises some of us because of what is not in it.  For instance why should the State and local authorities be excluded?  Why do we persist in giving ground landlords the right to evict?  Eviction is a very emotive word in Ireland and we know that a ground landlord can threaten eviction for arrears of rent.  I should like to know where the Labour Party stand particularly on the abolition of ground rents.  Are they in favour of compensating or not?  I should like to know the answer to that even though some people may think it is a small point.</P>
      <P>Prohibiting the creation of new ground rents is to be commended but there are other matters which we hope to discuss by amendment on the next Stage.  I do not know how long it took to prepare the Bill but it was certainly a long time; it might well be said of it that the mountain went into labour and produced a mouse.  We have to have a much wider debate on the next Stage so that we can fashion here an instrument of legislation which will end many of the problems of ground rents.  Unfortunately, many problems that already exist will still remain. Those who represent urban areas are familiar with what is known as &ldquo;Flatland&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Flatdwellers' Association have protested against the inadequacies of this Bill.  We want to discuss their problems with them and see if we can help.  I represent the heart of &ldquo;Flatland&rdquo;. This is brought home to me very often when a ground landlord does nothing but collect his rent.  He can hold the threat of eviction over the heads of the unfortunate flat-dwellers, many of whom are young boys and girls who have come to live and work in the city.  They do not have the resources needed to fight legal battles.  Therefore we, the national Parliament, must ensure that their interests are protected in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Gibbons I hesitated to speak on this Bill because it is such a complex legal matter.  Many defects are very apparent in this Bill but I am sure if one examines it closely one <Col N="343" /> will find merit in it.  I look forward to Committee Stage, but in the meantime I ask the Minister to reconsider the exclusion of local authorities and the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their welcome of this Bill which was received with varying shades of warmth, ranging from a very commendable warmth from this side to a lukewarm warmth from the other.</P>
      <P>I take Deputy Moore's point.  Much of this Bill will have to be teased out in Committee.  It is a very technical, complex, legal measure more suitable for full debate on individual sections in Committee.</P>
      <P>Some points were made on Second Stage.  As they presently stand I would not be very impressed with the points seeking drastic amendments to what is in the Bill.  I emphasise the phrase &ldquo;as the points stand&rdquo; because the points were necessarily made in an abbreviated fashion at this stage.  I would not be swayed or impressed by the arguments I have heard but I do not want to prejudge the merit of the case the Opposition may make on individual sections.  They may have a fuller and more deeply analysed case to make with regard to some of these points.  Certainly I will be prepared to listen, because that is the stuff of debate.  In discussion points of view are expressed and can be fitted into the general scheme of the Bill.  As I said, as far as the points made to date are concerned I will have to hear a much deeper and more convincing analysis than I have so far heard.</P>
      <P>The matters which come under discussion fell under a couple of main heads and were repeated by speakers from both sides.  The position of county registrars was raised by practically every speaker, and by Deputy Brosnan in most detail.  This question was raised under two headings, first, the costs of the arbitration proceedings in regard to the compulsory acquisition of existing ground rents and, second, the capacity of the county registrar personally and of his office to deal with the arbitration role he is being given in a widened fashion under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> I have endeavoured to simplify the acquisition of ground rents by tenants interested in purchasing but I have been constrained by the need to ensure that in any method proposed there is no element of confiscation.  After a lot of thought and consultation with the legal profession&mdash;I had hoped to involve them in this procedure so that they might have been able to become formally involved and to simplify the matter but it was not possible to devise a scheme whereby individual members of the legal profession could be involved in particular cases&mdash;I was forced to the system described in the Bill whereby the county registrar on application from a tenant and finding that certain conditions are satisfied can issue a certificate of title.  The purchase money will be lodged to credit and the claims on it decided by the county registrar.</P>
    <P>It was important all the time to ensure that, when the purchase money reached the parties entitled to it, it would not have been diminished in any way by any factor related to the compulsory purchase.  This is important because if there was any confiscatory element in it in that regard then the procedure could be held to be unconstitutional, a property right was being confiscated without compensation and it was necessary to avoid this.  That has to be avoided; it is common case that it must be avoided.  It is impossible to devise a procedure that will be entirely free unless the Exchequer picks up the bill.  It is my belief that the Exchequer have greater priorities than picking up the bill for the number of ground tenants who wish to buy their rents. I am sure Deputies would not have to spend very long thinking about the needs that have to be met and drawing up a list of greater priorities.  For example, the provision of money for legal aid would be a greater priority than the Exchequer paying for totally free conveyance of ground rents to tenants.</P>
    <P>Therefore there will be an element of cost on the tenant in using the county registrar procedure.  What the amount of costs eventually will come out at is something we cannot decide in advance because we have to see how <Col N="345" /> complicated the procedure will work out in practice, how much demand there will be on it and what extra staff will be required in county registrars' offices.  There will have to be an element of contribution from purchasing tenants towards these costs.</P>
    <P>If that contribution should be unattractive to a tenant he can still return to the present system of buying his ground rent privately through his own solicitor who will deal with the landlord's solicitor.  It must be remembered that in many instances ground rents have been offered by owners to their tenants at very reasonable figures.  I gave an example, when opening this debate, of a large ground rent company which offered ground rents at a small number of years' purchase plus £25 to include legal costs and they had very few takers.  That makes me wonder how much real interest there is in this.</P>
    <P>I imagine from the consideration I have given to the fees that may have to be assessed in regard to county registrars that it will hardly be possible to have a system where the fees asked from the member of the public using the county registrar system will be any less, but I would not be in favour of providing a free service in this area.  If the tenant is not to be involved in costs the State has to foot the bill because the landlord cannot be asked to do it.</P>
    <P>On the question of the county registrar's personal capacity and the capacity of his office to deal with the expanded arbitration role given to him I am quite satisfied that the persons involved are well capable of filling this role.  At the moment they carry out a wide range of quasi-judicial and judicial/administrative procedures in discharging their roles and the new functions intended for them under this Bill fit very aptly and neatly into the general role of county registrar.  Deputy Brosnan was worried that they might be overcome by an avalanche of applications and not be able to cope.  We will have to wait and see if that will happen.  I am pretty confident that it will not because experience to date has been that there is no great interest in <Col N="346" /> purchasing ground rents when costs of purchase were offered at reasonable terms.  There is a fair amount of emotive thinking on this subject.  I agree there is an inherently distasteful system which has to be changed, but many people are quite happy to continue paying ground rents and not do anything about it. I want to provide in this legislation the opportunity for people to purchase ground rents as simply and as cheaply as possible if they so wish.  I do not think there will be a huge rush of applications to county registrars or that the office of the county registrars will be overwhelmed. Should anything like that begin to appear then we will certainly have to take steps to ensure that the mechanism provided in the Bill can work in practice.</P>
    <P>County registrars have a varied range of duties.  As presented by Deputy Brosnan, one would imagine that these unfortunate men do not have a minute free from 9 a.m. on Monday to 6 p.m. on Friday. This does not take account of the fact that they have the assistance of very skilled staff and many functions are delegated to the skilled and experienced staff available.  I am sure that I am not letting out any secret in saying that it is common knowledge within the legal profession that the job of county registrar is not in the legal scene a job that requires slaving attention from 9 a.m. on Monday to 6 p.m. on Friday.  I do not anticipate that there will be any difficulty in implementing the provisions in this Bill and seeing that the new arbitration functions will be properly and completely discharged. The county registrars, because of their professional experience, will be well fitted to discharge the arbitration role given to them.  I have no doubt about that.  Deputy Brosnan was worried that they would be able adequately to do this.  Of course they will.  Apart from their own knowledge and experience, the parties coming before them will bring with them expert advisers.  They will have available lawyers, architects and auctioneers and other people who can assist the county registrar in discharging <Col N="347" /> his role.  I do not foresee any difficulty.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy raised the question of assessors to sit with the registrars.  The role of the assessors will be provided by the evidence that the parties coming before the registrars will adduce.  Expert evidence will be adduced to enable the county registrar to make up his mind. Of course, every decision at arbitration by the county registrar is subject to appeal so if any party is not satisfied he is quite entitled to go to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>In my view on this I am echoing the view of my predecessor, Senator Lenihan, when he was introducing the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967.  Certainly his view and my view would be seriously at odds with the view held by Deputy Brosnan.  I take it that Deputy Brosnan's view is a personal one and this is something which he genuinely feels, but his worries are misplaced.  He talked about the possibility of the arbitration role being given to the District Court where it would be a matter of clear judicial process.  District justices and District Courts are not geared in the same way as the county registrars to deal with this matter because the county registrars' offices are already dealing with a large number of quasi-judicial matters. The county registrar is often involved in the administration of the State's preparation of accounts; he has to examine witnesses in such matters and make reports for the courts and make findings himself which can be appealed to the court.  The District Court, on the other hand, is mainly engaged in the enforcement of the criminal law in a summary fashion and in a certain amount of civil jurisdiction. The general scene of the District Court would not be as suitable for arbitration matters of the type proposed in the Bill as would the county registrar's office, nor would the facilities available to the district justice be comparable to those available to the county registrar.  I do not think this would be suitable work for the District Court.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the county registrars both personally and in regard to <Col N="348" /> their offices will have the capacity to cope with whatever work comes to them.  This is a new type of machinery, a new type of proposal, and we will have to see it operating in practice before we can be positive that it will be the solution.  No doubt certain problems will arise.  If there are problems relating to too much work then we will have to take steps to cure that; if the method of dealing with the work is not satisfactory that will require a different solution.  Likewise too, as began the proposed new system of ground rent purchase, we will have to wait and see the operation of the proposed system before deciding on its costing because I am quite satisfied that this is not a system which should be provided by the State free of charge to the purchasing tenant.  I feel that there has to be an input by this tenant.</P>
    <P>Another matter which arose during the debate on a fairly wide scale was the exclusion from the Bill of the State and local authorities.  It was felt that it was unfair and that the State was putting itself in a privileged position. Undoubtedly it is putting itself in a separate position but for very good reason.  The State, which is the people, is not comparable to a private landlord. The State must always be deemed to act on behalf of the people and to act for the common good.  To assume that the State would act otherwise is equating the interests of the State with the interests of a private landlord and this is not a fair and proper equation. The State should be entitled to retain control over State property in a different way from that permitted to the landlord.  The State will not be acting in a commercial manner in relation to the use of property.  Regarding any property which the State has let, I do not think there has ever been a case where a tenant has been dealt with unconscionably or inequitably. The State can be subjected to pressures which would have no effect or influence on a private landlord and there has been nothing to suggest any harsh conduct by the State.  There are avenues of approach available to tenants of the State which might not be appropriate or needed in the case of private landlords.</P>
    <P>Likewise in the case of the houses <Col N="349" /> which local authorities have built with public money there should be an element of control retained.  Deputy Enright said that if there was complete absence of control one could find a situation where local authority tenants would be totally free to dispose of their property as they will and when they will, and that this could lead to the accumulation of such property by speculators.  I am not suggesting that the tenants would be speculators&mdash;this was the misinterpretation that Deputy Burke deliberately took from what Deputy Enright said&mdash;but there could be a danger of people accumulating that type of property.  It is important that the local authorities are there to retain control on behalf of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there is a clear distinction between property in the hands of the State, whether central government or local government, and property in the hands of private landlords and that the dangers to tenants or the unfavourable position of tenants which is sought to be remedied in this Bill does not arise where the landlord is either the central or local government. It is important also that the State ultimately would have control over its own property so that it can dispose and use its own property in the common good.  Should there be a conflict between the position of the tenant and the occupation of State property and the common good, the State has an obligation to act for the common good. Unless the State is excluded it would not be able to so act.</P>
    <P>The arguments in favour of excluding the State are good but we can deal with this in more detail when we come to the Committee Stage.  This is an example of a point made on the Second Stage without any argument behind it.  The point was made that the State and local authority should be included.  I am interested to hear the reasons why they should be included taking into account the considerations I have now put forward.  The matter can be debated in more detail on the Committee Stage should there be an amendment to that effect.</P>
    <P>Deputies also referred to the right of a landlord to seek eviction for nonpayment <Col N="350" /> of a ground rent.  Deputy Burke raised the unlikely example of a person with a property worth £20,000 and a ground rent of 5p or even £1 who could find himself evicted because of his failure for reasons of principle to pay his ground rent of £1.  One might describe the situation of this man as being very high principled but common sense demands that one should also describe a person who puts himself in that position as being a most highly obstinate and stubborn man, somebody who was prepared to cut off not just his nose but his whole head in order to spite his face.</P>
    <P>It is well known that the courts will not enforce an order for possession for non-payment of rent unless they are satisfied that there has been a deliberate withholding of the rent and that there has been a clear and deliberate breach of the covenant to pay the rent.  The courts will always grant relief in such cases where the failure to pay has been due to financial stringency or a good reason other than a deliberate withholding. That is well known and well settled law.  In any event the remedy of the landlord is a question of the enforcement of his covenants; and it would be very difficult, if we were to try and remove that particular right, to distinguish between ground rents and ordinary rents.  It may well be that it is actually a property right, that the consequences that flow from having covenants in a leasehold are property rights and to attempt to curtail them might perhaps lead us into difficult legal and constitutional territory.</P>
    <P>I agree that an emotive argument can be made that it is an unduly harsh power for a landlord to have that he can obtain possession for the non-payment of even a comparatively insignificant sum.  I adverted to this point when I spoke at the beginning of this Stage. It is not just a right to evict.  This is a question of a breach of covenant and that gives a right to terminate the contract. A lease is a contract for the use of a particular dwelling subject to certain conditions.  Like any other contract if the conditions are not observed certain consequences flow, one of them being setting aside the contract.  That is what is involved in this instance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright was worried about <Col N="351" /> the position of a builder who might buy a tract of property the title to which would be a long lease and that he would now, by virtue of section 108, be precluded from making subleases. Section 108 says that such a person can only grant a fee simple. Deputy Enright made the valid point that a person who had a leasehold interest could not grant a fee simple. Of course, he could not.  This is something I will certainly have to examine between now and the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that there will be any difficulty in the type of example given by Deputy Enright.  He spoke of a builder who might have enough ground for 500 or 600 houses and held that ground under a lease for 800 years from somebody who held it for 900 years, who in turn might have had it from the owner of the fee simple for 999 years.  That is an unlikely hierarchy of holdings of that type of property.  I quite agree that one could have a situation where the owner of the fee simple had leased it for 900 years and that person wanted to sell to a builder.  If the law is changed as proposed in this Bill there will be no commercial value for the owner of the fee simple making a lease which precludes any further development having regard to the proposals in section 108.</P>
    <P>I believe the commercial pressures that will follow by virtue of this change in the law will ensure that the sales among the superior parties will be sales of the freehold and not sales of leasehold interests.  No builder will buy a leasehold interest unless he can pass that on to the house owners.  He will not be able to do that under the law as it is now proposed to change it. He must pass on a fee simple and he cannot do this if he only has a leasehold. The reality of the situation is that the commercial pressures, behind the scene will ensure that what the builder buys will be freehold.  He will not any longer buy a leasehold.  There will be no point in the owner of the land insisting that he will only give him a leasehold because he will not get any purchasers to take leasehold.  I do not think the type of situation envisaged by Deputy Enright will arise by reason of those commercial pressures. <Col N="352" /> There could however be the odd situation, the individual plot of land up and down the country where a leasehold title might have been granted a long time ago in respect of that area.  That type of case might be prejudiced by the proposals in section 108 and I will certainly have a look at that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Gibbons, on the question of covenants, mentioned the practice of developers requiring their purchasers to deal with specified TV or oil companies.  That is not a desirable practice because it is interfering with the freedom of choice of those citizens and their vulnerability in the sense that they are vulnerable because they want a particular house because it is the one they can afford and it is located in the area they wish to live in.  The developer at the instance of the TV companies or the oil companies, with whom he, no doubt, has a lucrative arrangement, is taking advantage of that vulnerability to enforce this restrictive practice and that is what it is.  I am not aware of how widespread it is but I accept it is happening if Deputy Dr. Gibbons says it is.  It is something we could deal with and I will look into the matter.  The 1967 Act abolished the old practice of the lessor specifying and nominating an insurance company. That practice was analagous to what Deputy Dr. Gibbons referred to and, certainly, we will have a look at it.</P>
    <P>An important matter dealt with in the debate was the question of ground rents.  This was the one matter which introduced a political note into what was otherwise a technical debate.  As the political note was mentioned I feel I have an obligation to echo it and make sure that when the politics of this debate come to be assessed they will be seen in the wrong and that the full picture will emerge, not just some points made from the Opposition benches.</P>
    <P>There was criticism by Deputy Ray Burke about the delay in bringing this Bill to the Dáil.  Deputy G. Collins spoke of the constant urging that he had been engaged in from the Opposition to ensure progress in this regard. All this immediately raises one question, what did the party to which <Col N="353" /> Deputy Collins and Deputy Burke belong do when they had the ball at their feet for so long in this area.  I do not think it was lack of time or ability to make the changes that led us to the position that nothing happened in this area.  The signs are that there was an unwillingness on the part of the Opposition for policy reasons to grasp the nettle and prevent the creation of future ground rents.  I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that in 1946, and again in 1960, motions were moved here asking the Government to introduce legislation to enable owners of dwellings and business premises in cities, towns and villages to purchase the ground rents on equitable terms. Those motions were defeated by the Government of the day; they were voted down.  In 1961 the late Deputy Dunne moved for leave to introduce a Bill providing that from the passing of the Bill it would be illegal to create new ground rents, but leave to introduce that Bill was refused.  There was an unwillingness on the part of Fianna Fáil to move to prevent the creation of future ground rents.  Any criticism of the delay in bringing forward this Bill comes badly from a party which had the opportunity for so long to do something but not merely did nothing but when other parties wanted to do something voted them down.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins mentioned that a Private Members' motion to the effect that Dáil Éireann deplores the Government's inaction in relation to ground rents was introduced by him.  In the light of what I have said that verged on the impertinent&mdash;I hesitate to use that word in relation to anything put forward by Deputy Collins&mdash;having regard to the lack of action and the positive opposition to this change of policy in previous years.  Nevertheless, Deputy Collins had this motion put down.  I amended that motion to take proper account of the political reality, as it then was, so that the motion which went before the House asked Dáil Éireann to approve the Government's decision to prevent the creation of further ground rents.  I am sure the House will be surprised to recall that the Opposition voted against that <Col N="354" /> motion.  There is a tremendous inconsistency.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether it is in coming or going but there has not been consistency in this regard.  It is a rather cynical exercise in political opportunism for the Opposition to be pretending they always wanted the prevention of the creation of further ground rents when their history is completely to the contrary.</P>
      <P>A number of Opposition speakers raised the question of the abolition of existing ground rents.  Deputy Timmons held that the Bill was unsatisfactory in that it did not deal with existing ground rents.  Every Deputy knows that existing ground rents can only be abolished if the parties entitled to them are paid full compensation for them and in no other way.  It was suggested by ACRA that the Constitution should be amended to allow these ground rents to be confiscated without compensation.  That would be totally unwarranted and I have so told that organisation.  In my opening speech I adverted to the dangers of making such constitutional changes by removing property rights.  What property right would go next if we were to open that door?  There will be no question of amending the Constitution to allow the confiscation of anybody's property here.  If the Opposition are in favour of abolishing existing ground rents let them say how they are going to do it; they should not criticise this Bill for being silent on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ground rents can be abolished in two ways&mdash;the property of those people can be confiscated or they can be compensated for it.  If they are to be compensated one must decide where the money will come from.  It is important that priorities be decided on.  I do not consider that the abolition of ground rents by compensation, with the immense cost that would be on the Exchequer, would be justified either in terms of good it would do to tenants or in the national interest.  It smacks of some hypocrisy for this Bill to be criticised by the Opposition on the grounds that it does nothing to existing ground rents.  It does not and <Col N="355" /> the decision not to do anything about existing ground rents was deliberate because it would either mean confiscation or compensation and I am not prepared to advocate that the Government do either.</P>
    <P>The Bill will make many changes in the area of landlord and tenant law. Some Deputies, like Deputy Brosnan, think it does not go far enough.  Deputy Brosnan thought it did not deal with the type of situation where a person with property instead of making a letting of that property merely gives a licence to the tenant to use the equipment on the property thereby avoiding the incidence of a lease. That is a ploy open to any person who wants to avoid creating a landlord and tenant relationship with another person.  If commercial pressures are there, some party will participate in such an arrangement, but if the pressures are not there the landlord will not be able to do it in that way and there will have to be an orthodox procedure.  I would be interested to hear that point developed by Deputy Brosnan on Committee Stage, to which I look forward.  This is a technical complex measure which will more properly fall to be debated in Committee.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the Bill will make far-reaching desirable changes in the landlord and tenant code generally.  I am pleased to be able to introduce it because it expands the right to purchase the ground rent, first given in 1967.  I hope it will provide the mechanism to make that purchase simpler and less expensive.  I am pleased to be the sponsor of this Bill on behalf of the National Coalition Government.  For the first time since we became an independent State this Parliament is being asked to enact a law which will prevent the creation of new ground rents.  Fianna Fáil should have welcomed that decision instead of trying to diminish it by saying that it is late. One has only to look at their own inaction for so long and at their positive action in thwarting measures of this kind in the past to realise how unbecoming it is of them to take their present line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>

      <P>There could not be a non-existent landlord.  If a rent is created, albeit a long time ago, title to receive that rent would have descended in some way or another to some person or trust.  The identification of that title after a lapse of 100 years or maybe 150 years might be difficult, but there is somebody present.  If nobody is present, if there is no party entitled in succession to that ground rent, one has to assume that a situation of escheatal arises and that the State would become entitled to that property.  There is either somebody present or if there is not, the State is entitled to the property. It is a question of identifying that title.  That is a question of law involving the tenant who disputes the right of the agent to collect and to pay over to a certain party.  It would be phrasing it wrongly to say that agents are collecting for non-existent landlords.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke earlier on the Bill I said we on this side were opposing it for many reasons.  Since then there has been no indication from the general public, particularly from the farming organisations and those involved in the advisory services, that they are in favour of the Bill.  Indeed, many of them have come out against it.  For instance, <i>The Farmers' Journal</i> for 19th February referred to it in its editorial.  It is a paper in which I place great credence because it has the ears of the farmers.  The editorial stated:</P>
      <P>The Agricultural Institute has served the Irish farming industry well for the past 18 years.  Committed research workers have operated with considerable academic freedom. They have identified themselves with farming and with the problems of farming.  They have worked early and late with very little regard for civil service hours.  Individual members of the staff have become household names in speaking for their specialised branch of agriculture.</P>
      <P>The article goes on:</P>
      <P>There is now strong feeling among the Institute staff that this sense of identity and commitment will be lost under the new Bill.  They feel that the civil service intrusion into a body that is at present working satisfactorily will produce a mongrel new authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> That, coming from <i>The Farmers' Journal,</i> is something the Minister should take note of.  The article continues:</P>
    <P>It is very much in the interests of farming that the Minister for Agriculture should give reassurance to the Institute and allay any fears that may exist.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give this assurance when he is replying and I hope that, on Committee Stage, he will make the necessary amendments to ensure this new authority will be free of Civil Service control and the institute and the advisory service will have the necessary freedom to work and act on behalf of the farmers in the same way as they have done in the past.  With the help of this side of the House I hope we will have a Bill which will serve the farming community and also those involved in research and advice in the interests of farming in the years ahead in the same way as the Agricultural Advisory Service of the Department and the Agricultural Institute have served the farming community in the past.</P>
    <P>I say this because the Minister will have sufficient strength and support from this side of the House to push his Bill through.  As a party, we are against this Bill for many reasons. There is, in fact, no need for the proposed authority.  The Minister gave as the basic reasons for restructuring this service divided control, lack of overall leadership and direction, unsatisfactory career structure, excessive movement of staff and the absence of specialist and support services among other things.  I want to examine these reasons and point out to the Minister that there is no need to change the system in order to resolve whatever problems may exist.</P>
    <P>Being a member of the Limerick County Committee of Agriculture and its chairman for a number of years I would be the first to admit the present system is not without its faults but these faults can be remedied without the suggested structure proposed here by the Minister.  The system is not perfect.  One has to admire the way in which some of the faults in the system have been singled out by the Department. <Col N="359" /> The question is how can these faults be remedied.  There are faults but they are not of such a character as to justify a radical rearrangement of the advisory services.  I believe the proposed reorganisation will have adverse effects on the people operating the advisory service and, more important, on the farmers themselves.  The present system enables a very free flow of information between the county committee staffs and the advisory service at local level and the free exchange of information with the Agricultural Institute.  Furthermore, and this is important, the system enables the institute to be autonomous.  They will not have autonomy under the new authority.</P>
    <P>The institute has never been tied up in red tape from the point of view of contact and liaison.  It has worked extremely well.  There is considerable unease amongst the members and the staff because of the proposed changes. In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 7th February a representative of the Agricultural Institute stated, among other things:</P>
    <P>With regard to the research programme to be carried out by the Authority, this would have to be approved by the Minister and it could be amended by him as he considers necessary.  This paves the way for Civil Service interference and control at every level of research.  Up to now the Institute decided the openings for its research work.  Now it can be someone in Kildare Street who would decide when, how and what research would be done and by whom.</P>
    <P>This has been spelled out by the editorial in <i>The Farmers' Journal</i> last week and in that article.  The proposed new authority will become more and more of a bureaucracy and, therefore, more and more under the control of the civil service.  The result will be that the advisory and research sections will lose out in a big way. This unease has been expressed in two papers.  The people concerned quite rightly consider they will be subject to delay because of bureaucracy and red tape and, as a result, it will adversely affect their <Col N="360" /> work.  At the moment the contact between the Agricultural Institute and the local committees is excellent and it should not be changed drastically. The independence of the research section should be maintained.  The local advisers are nervous of a system that reduces the efficiency of the liaison with the Agricultural Institute and, secondly, which causes a lack of trust on the part of the farmers with whom they deal.</P>
    <P>The local advisers have built up a strong feeling of trust with the farmers but this confidence and trust may be lost because of the setting up of the new authority and, in particular, because it is becoming more and more under the control of the civil service. The Minister should realise the dangers of disturbing this deep confidence because this would attack the foundation and efficiency of the advisory service.  The new system would do away with the informal contact between the local advisers and the farmers, whether by telephone, by visits to farms or to the Agricultural Institute centres throughout the country.  In future the approach will be much more formal.</P>
    <P>There is close contact between the Agricultural Institute and the Department's advisory service and there are several publications issued which outline clearly the developments taking place in all aspects of farming.  All this information is provided in the bulletins issued by the Agricultural Institute.  Perhaps the new authority may rule out this easy flow of information from the research officer to the adviser.  The farmers will have far less confidence in the advisory service if it is totally under the control of the civil service.  It has been stated by the Minister, and it is provided for in the Bill, that any information required by other Departments will be available to them from this new service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I get an opportunity of checking the Bill I will do so.  The farming community have great confidence in the agricultural advisers.  There are files, that are strictly confidential, on each farmer.  For instance, with regard to the farm modernisation scheme, information was collected on the understanding that it would be kept confidential and would not be available to anyone outside the immediate advisory service.  According to this Bill it will be available to anyone in the other branches of the civil service.  Naturally a farmer will be very slow to give detailed information if he considers that it may be used against him in the future in an entirely different context.  The Minister should be very careful before he attacks the close working relationship between the local advisers and the farmers.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given several reasons for the changes proposed. First, he considers the advisory service should have a single central head, one person to supervise all the operations. Secondly, he wishes to avoid dual control over the advisory service. His third point was that the specialist services may not be a practical proposition for one county alone, and may be too expensive for one county. His fourth point was that there was excessive instructor movement, particularly from one county to another. His fifth point concerned career structure which he states does not exist in a defined way within the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To scrap the old system because of its faults and to replace it with an unknown system is like using an elephant to stamp on a fly.  The faults in the system can be corrected without scrapping it.  Let us consider the question of the central head.  I doubt that it is necessary to lump together an advisory body and a scientific body in order to <Col N="362" /> supply such a head.  The Jones/Davies Report, which was published in 1967, advised against linking the Agriculcultural Institute with the Agricultural Advisory Service.  The Deputy Secretary of the Department of Agriculture could take the existing services under his direction without involving the other aspects of this enormous mess of a Bill.  Bearing in mind the dangers involved in the system, the Minister should consider putting a senior officer of his Department in charge of the entire service.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the danger of dual control.  In my opinion the proposed system will not solve the problem. Under the system which the Minister proposes control could be quadrupled. It involves the county committees of agriculture, the sanction of the Department of Agriculture, the dual sanction of the Departments of Finance and the Public Service and the proposed board.  The real danger is the mixing of all the services.  This danger has been spoken of by people of all political persuasions in the farming community&mdash;the danger of swamping the system by bureaucracy.  It would not be such a great danger if one senior officer of the Department, such as the deputy secretary, had overall control.  It would be a better system than the one proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The work done by local advisers in conjunction with the Departments of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Agricultural Institute is excellent.  I do not object to the deputy secretary or assistant secretary of the Department of Agriculture having more control but I object to the proposal of immediate quadrupled control.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about specialist services.  It is true that the county committees of agriculture cannot afford the specialist services which they need. Nevertheless, under existing law it is possible for a number of counties to share the services of a specialist.  Two or three counties could share the services of one expert with not enough work in one county.  It would benefit each county to share the services of a specialist.  This system, which is already operating in a limited fashion, would solve the problem of specialist services.</P>
    <P>The next point refers to instructors <Col N="363" /> and the problem of keeping them permanently in western counties.  I realise that there is the difficulty in all counties of keeping instructors within the county.  However, this is not the answer to such a problem.  If an instructor were to be placed in the west but wished to move to another county and he was told &ldquo;You cannot do this for five years after your appointment&rdquo; he could go to the High Court or to the Supreme Court on a constitutional issue.  I believe he has the right to work where he wishes.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk in recent years about equal rights for workers, particularly in relation to the concept of freedom of movement within the system.  It would be extremely dangerous and possibly a great waste of legislative time to pass a law which denied a man the right to improve himself at his work.  It has been suggested that under this new system, as under the old system, if he wishes to do advisory work without being tied to a company and therefore with an independent mind, there is only one place to find such work, that is, in a State or semi-State advisory service.  It would be extremely dangerous to try to deny him this opportunity.  I cannot provide a solution to this question of instructor movement, but what the Minister has suggested certainly is not the solution.  This is a problem and one which will exist under the new service.</P>
    <P>The fifth and final point the Minister makes is that he wishes to create a career structure for advisors.  I share the Minister's view here, because this is something that is badly needed.  It operates in other Departments, particularly in the Department of Lands and in regard to the inspectors in the Land Commission.  While a career structure is very desirable, to say that we need an entirely new structure to bring this about is, in my opinion, false.  As I stated, there is within the Department of Lands at present, and in several other Departments, a structure which enables the employee to have his grading effected at the most immediate point, that of his supervisor.  I cannot see why that system cannot be applied to <Col N="364" /> agricultural advisers.  Under this system workers can move up along the grades, and it does not need a new law to implement this for agricultural advisers.</P>
    <P>To go on a little further on this point, if a man decides that rather than take a supervisory appointment such as the position of chief agricultural officer he wishes to specialise in advising farmers on tillage, dairying, horticulture, beef and so on, then he should be able to rise within that section without necessarily going on to supervisory work.  A grading system properly introduced will ensure that he will get promotion and increases in his income without having to supervise staff and give up his own advisory duties.  The answer therefore is a career structure based on grading and promotion, the grading to be done by an independent body, an independent body which would have the advice of the worker's local supervisor.</P>
    <P>I have taken these points separately and I have endeavoured to show a far more easily-worked solution and, I believe, a far more effective solution than that suggested by the Minister. We must be careful not to disturb the farmer's confidence in our advisory service or create unease among staff in the local advisory service, in the Agricultural Institute or at the various levels of the farm advisory service.  We must find alternatives in this Bill.  It is not a question of opposing it for the sake of opposing it.  It is a question of ensuring the wellbeing of the farming community, and that must be paramount in any legislation of this type.  It is certainly not paramount in this Bill when it is stated in many of its provisions that the work of this new authority will be subject to the control of the Minister for Agriculture and in some cases subject to the control of the Minister for Finance and the Public Service. It will be seen therefore that the wellbeing of the farming community is not a consideration in so far as this Bill is concerned.  Consequently we must look again at what is proposed.  I agree that the faults to which the Minister pointed exist but I could urge him to have a rethink about the whole situation and to ask himself whether the <Col N="365" /> Bill is necessary at all.  Perhaps the present structure needs modification rather than replacement.</P>
    <P>Many individuals and farming organisations have been critical of the Bill.  Their criticisms stems from many reasons, one of which is the question of confidence which farmers have in the advisory service.  They fear that local autonomy will be lost to them and that there will be a curtailment of the flow of information that is available freely now from the Agricultural Institute to the advisory service.  Another fear being expressed is that power and control is being removed, slowly but surely, at local level from the elected representatives and from those nominated to local committees.  The grounds for this fear are that the Minister will in future determine which organisations are to have nominations on the local committees. This is an undesirable and a dangerous provision.  It will mean that nominated representatives, although having an interest in the welfare of the agricultural community, particularly in the areas of the advisory services and of research, will be representing not those who are providing the finance by way of rates and taxes but sectional interests.  I have spoken here before and also outside of the need for representation at local level of farming and rural organisations but I disagree with the level of representation in the Bill, that is, up to 50 per cent of the entire membership of the committee.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the representation suggested by the Minister, the General Council of Committees of Agriculture, <Col N="366" /> who are the representatives of the county committees, are to be given reduced powers under this legislation. They will be represented on the national body by only one member&mdash; one member for the 27 committees throughout the country.  This is a matter to which the Minister should give his attention before the next Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred by way of interjection to provision being made for making available information to other Departments.  By way of reply to him I would read paragraphs (e) and (f) of subsection (l) of section 30 which provides that the board shall:</P>
    <P>furnish to the Minister such information regarding the activities of the Authority and the progress thereof as he may from time to time require, and afford free access, at all reasonable times, to its lands and premises to any duly authorised officer of the Minister, give him such information as he may reasonably require for the satisfactory discharge of his duties and allow him to examine such documents and records as he may consider necessary.</P>
    <P>Who is the Minister trying to cod?  I would ask him to consider an amendment to this section for Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Outbreaks of sheep scab have, unfortunately, been a regular occurrence in County Galway.  There were, to the knowledge of my Department, 13 in 1974, 16 in 1975 and to date at least 17 have been reported in the current season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Investigations are a matter for the <Col N="367" /> Galway County Council but because six of the 17 flocks reported to have been infected in the county, included rams supplied by my Department under the special term ram scheme for the congested districts these six cases were especially investigated by the Department in co-operation with the Galway County Council.  The investigation failed to establish conclusively the original source of the infection in these six cases.  The Department's investigations were also extended to cover the flocks to which 16 other rams were supplied by the Department under the scheme in County Galway but in these 16 cases no evidence of sheep scab was discovered.</P>
    <P>The investigations involved the examination of all flocks concerned by veterinary inspectors and the submission of skin scrapings and wool samples to the regional veterinary laboratories for microscopic and other tests in any case in which suspicious symptoms were observed.  All necessary steps have now been taken by Galway County Council, assisted by my Department's veterinary officers, to deal with the outbreaks by special dipping of the infected and in-contact animals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows that Galway County Council complied with the sheep dipping regulations to the last letter.  What efforts are being made by the Department to establish whether the rams supplied through the Minister's Department are dipped? This is a crucial point.  We in Galway believe that scab has been imported into Galway this year because every precaution was taken by Galway County Council to ensure that rams in the county were dipped properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of my reply I indicated that in only six out of 17 cases were the rams supplied by the Department.  There was scab in Galway already, not only this year but last year and the year before.  It is quite possible that the rams supplied by the Department got scab in Galway. Apparently the veterinary people have not been able to establish for certain if this is so.  It is quite open to suspicion. <Col N="368" /> I was surprised to find out that the safeguard of dipping all rams before distribution was not done, because there is always a doubt as to whether it had been done previously.  Dipping would put it beyond all doubt, so I have arranged for the years ahead that any rams supplied by the Department will be dipped.  This has not been done in the past.</P>

      <P>The Minister is admitting that this has not been done by the Department in the past.  I welcome the fact that it will be done in the future.  Is it not inconsistent for the Department to issue regulations that all sheep in every county should be dipped and still to distribute rams without ensuring that they were dipped?  The Minister is only assuring us that from now on they will be dipped.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>On numerous occasions farmers have been strongly advised by me and by the advisory services that notwithstanding the higher prices for fertilisers they should avoid the false economy of reducing fertiliser use, and thus jeopardising production.  The effects of this advise are clearly shown in the increased fertiliser sales in 1975-76 as compared with the preceding year.  The increases were of the order of 15 per cent for nitrogen, 16 per cent for phosphate and 29 per cent for potash.  The upward trend has continued in the current 1976-77 fertiliser year.</P>

As compared with 1975 the areas under potatoes and vegetables in 1976 were, in fact, up by 19 per cent and 15 per cent respectively, but weather conditions had an adverse effect on the yield of the potato crop. Market prices for these products have been quite buoyant for some time and provide an incentive for increasing production in 1977.</P>

      <P>The primary aim of land settlement policy is to enlarge and improve the many thousands of existing holdings which are too small and too poor to provide a tolerable standard of living for their owners.  The Land Commission find it impossible&mdash; and especially in those areas where the problem is most acute&mdash;to secure enough land to reach even their primary objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general situation is therefore that they cannot normally afford to set <Col N="380" /> aside land for allotment in plots to people such as the Deputy has in mind.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, landless applicants&mdash; while in general they must remain low in priority&mdash;are not excluded from consideration; their claims are always carefully examined in the disposal of lands which are not required for the structural reform of uneconomic holdings. As a general rule it would seem to be realistic to ensure that those already on the land in an uneconomic way are first catered for before introducing any new group of competitors for a very scarce commodity.</P>

      <P>The training of the big majority of first-year apprentices is financed, primarily, by their employers but the cost of training about 500 apprentices who are not sponsored by employers is financed by The Training Authority. So far as these non-sponsored apprentices and any others who may become redundant are concerned every effort is made by The Training Authority and the National Manpower Service to place them with employers at the end of their off-the-job training or when they become redundant.</P>

      <P>The protection of the environment is a matter primarily for the Minister for Local Government and, in this regard, I would draw the attention of the Deputy to the Local Government (Water Pollution) Bill, 1976, currently before the Oireachtas.  The Minister for Local Government has also set up an inter-departmental environment committee which is studying existing arrangements for protection of the environment, in which work my Department takes part.</P>

In most counties I suppose you could spend, perhaps, £20,000 or £30,000 which would be the cost probably of one major development of a bog.  There can be no major development of bog roads without some sort of special grant.

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power, whether in view of traffic surveys revealing the large proportion of city motor cars which carry but one passenger, he will, in the interest of energy conservation, seek to encourage the use of mopeds and light motor cycles by reducing or waiving duties payable thereon and/or investigate the feasibility of their subsidisation.</P>

      <P>The question of duties payable on mopeds and motor cycles is a matter mainly for the Minister for Finance.  The Deputy may, however, be interested to know that the protective duty on the importation of mopeds and motor cycles from other EEC member states will be fully eliminated on 1st July, 1977.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the reduction of duties on mopeds and motor cycles would have any significant effect in reducing overall energy consumption. The general question of energy conservation in the transport sector is however being examined by the Advisory Committee on Energy Conservation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Deputy is referring to the agreement arrived at in the Council of Ministers regarding the special position of Ireland.  Agreement was reached at a meeting of the Foreign Ministers in The Hague on 30th October, 1976, on a resolution which includes the following provisions:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> Having regard to the economic relationships which characterise fishing activity in Ireland, it (that is the Council) declares its intention so to apply the provisions of the Common Fisheries Policy, as further determined by the Act of Accession and adapted to take account of the extension of waters to 200 miles as to ensure the continued and progressive development of the Irish fishing industry on the basis of the Irish Government's Fisheries Development Programme for the development of coastal fisheries.</P>
    <P>The same resolution also contained a provision in regard to fishery protection in the following terms:</P>
    <P>The Council recognises that the protection and the control of the fishing zone off Ireland must not result, because of the size of this zone, in a charge, for that member State, which is disproportionate to the volume of the Community fish resources which can be exploited in that zone by the fishermen of that member State.  It agrees that the implementation of available means of surveillance or those to be foreseen must be accompanied by appropriate measures to ensure that the charges which ensue will be shared equitably.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary satisfied that a development programme, in keeping with the suggestions made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs after The Hague agreement, has been prepared by the Government and that sufficient moneys are made available in this year's budget to make a start on this programme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>My question related to an answer given by the Minister when he mentioned a development programme the Government would be asked to prepare in conjunction with <Col N="392" /> the promises given at The Hague.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary accept that from the original territorial waters, 12 miles, to the extent of the new economic zone, 200 miles, the only State competent in international law to patrol that band against any third country is the coastal state, in this case, Ireland?  That being so, surely by definition the Minister should not come back presenting as an achievement the fact that we are being given extra finance which he negotiated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but sometimes one needs to clarify facts.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary accept it is misleading to suggest that because finance will be made available from the Community to enable the waters in question to be patrolled that that is a a significant negotiating result?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  It stands to reason.  If the 200-mile zone were to be exclusively ours, for our exploitation and from which we could exclude all others, whether inside or outside the EEC, then it would be up to us to find the money to patrol it effectively. Even if we achieved our demand for a 50-mile exclusive band, that would still leave 150 miles of ocean which we have to share with at least eight other <Col N="393" /> States, apart altogether from States we might be obligated to under other instruments.  We must share them with the fishery fleets of our EEC partners. Because of the contractual obligations to which we are parties, and since the Community are deriving benefit from it, it is not unreasonable that they should share the cost which will fall on us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good to have this clarified because some people had the impression that this was an achievement in negotiations, when there could be only one outcome.  I take it that the Minister and the Government will continue to press for adequate financing to support the patrolling and policing of this zone by the only nation competent in international law to do it, namely, Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot allow the Deputy to get away with the implication that it is not an achievement.  I think it is an achievement, but very often it is an achievement to get other people to see reason.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an achievement that the Council of Ministers recognised the special situation resulting here from the enormous contribution to the extended waters which the Community will now enjoy, given to them by reason of Ireland's membership, and that they recognised our relative incapacity to patrol effectively this enormous band of water, from which they will derive a great deal of benefit, out of our own resources.  To get people to see that much reason is an achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary calls that an achievement then the European Community must be even more confused than I thought they were.  Does he accept that it can never be within the competence of, say, a German, French or Dutch boat to arrest, say, a Russian boat within that 200-mile band and that, therefore, the only nation competent to do it is Ireland?  Accordingly there is no achievement in getting the Community to recognise what is a fact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right.  It is my understanding that the only State in law which can enforce its laws about our fishery zones is ourselves. The amount has not been decided but we are going to get, on the basis of this resolution, substantial financial assistance to go some way towards covering the cost of defending that zone.  These are two separate things and I cannot see how the Deputy cannot see that.</P>

      <P>1.  the children are living in isolated areas where the nearest national school is a considerable distance away;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>When I asked a question of this nature before, as far as I recollect, the Parliamentary Secretary told me that something like 80 applications a day were being considered. Has the Parliamentary Secretary any indication of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got a breakdown of the 80, the figure quoted by the Deputy.  I can tell him however that since January, 1976, a total of 116 applications were received.  Of these only 13 came from children attending primary schools who were basically eligible for free transport under the terms of the scheme.  The others came from people who could not be considered at all under the terms of the scheme, such as children attending post-primary schools or children who were basically ineligible for transport to primary schools.  Of the 13 in question replies have issued in the case of ten.  In those cases it was found that in most cases they did not meet the criterion of living in isolated areas where the nearest school was a considerable distance away.  They were probably just over the distance necessary to be eligible but were not of a sufficient degree of remoteness to be considered eligible for this scheme. There are a further three cases of the 13 I mentioned in respect of whom a reply is outstanding.  I expect to be able to issue replies in those three cases soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary will have to agree with me that there is something seriously lacking in communication from the Department of Education if <Col N="402" /> only three applications might be considered and some others were vaguely considered out of a total number of 116?  Earlier on I asked if the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister would publicise this scheme.  I was given the reply: &ldquo;I am sure, as a result of those Dáil questions, that the scheme will become well known.&rdquo;  Are the terms of this scheme circulated to the local people who look after the school transport scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was made quite clear at the time in the reply that it did not apply to post-primary applications or to children who were basically ineligible for free transport in the normal way.  There is nothing the Department can do if people who are ineligible for this write in seeking it.  The question of publicising its terms still further is one which would need to be considered in the context of the issue of the annual circular in relation to school transport. I will bear in mind bringing to general notice the specific criteria which were outlined in my original reply.</P>

This is a dangerous section and I would like to see it removed for the reasons I outlined earlier, that is if we want to maintain the confidence of farmers.  On several occasions in the Bill we find mentioned &ldquo;with the authority of the Minister&rdquo;, &ldquo;with the authority of the Minister for Finance&rdquo; and &ldquo;with the authority of the Minister for the Public Service&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt it, with due respect to the Minister, because when the White Paper was published in April, 1975, he stated in an article published by <i>The Irish Farmers' Journal</i> that the function of the new service would be to provide independent impartial and unbiased advice on ascertained facts.  Furthermore he stated that it would be an education service operating on the philosophy of helping farmers to help themselves.  If the Minister says that this section is to help farmers to help themselves, then that is that.</P>
      <P>With reference to section 14 I should like to know if in future a county committee can still put forward their own ideas without getting direction from the Minister or any direction from the top. Regarding the operation of the farm modernisation scheme will the overall operation of this scheme be in the hands of this new authority?  Section 16 gives the impression that this is the case.  I should also like to know why there is reference in section 19 to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a question here regarding the contribution to be provided by the local authority which heretofore contributed 50 per cent of the expenditure in the county, the remaining 50 per cent being provided by the Department of Agriculture. Under the terms of the Bill the county committee will now have to get a certificate from the Minister to demand the amount required from the local authority.  Is there a possibility that the amount demanded by the Department from the local authority could be reduced and when the amount is ultimately paid will there be a guarantee <Col N="408" /> that the money will actually be spent within the county?</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to reply to these questions and to take account of the serious consequences of this Bill with regard to the farming community, which I think will be shattered. He should also consider the problems which exist for the people involved in providing the service, the staff of the Agricultural Institute, the institute itself now losing its autonomy and also the agricultural advisory service. I hope that the Minister will consider very seriously the implications of this Bill.</P>

      <P>This Bill is entitled:</P>
      <P>An Act to make further and better provision for agricultural advice. education, training and research and for that purpose to establish a body to be known as the National Agricultural Advisory, Education and Research Authority and to define its powers and duties and to provide for other matters connected with the matters aforesaid.</P>
      <P>We all know of the Minister's interest and expertise in the development of our agricultural industry.  Indeed, even when we were in opposition we worked together on a blueprint for agricultural development.  Having read the Bill and having regard to the widespread acceptance of the Minister's position in the country, you will appreciate my great disappointment at the negative views and approach of the Opposition to this entire problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to underline the importance of agricultural education and of continued agricultural research and experimentation.  I have been a member of a county committee for some 20 years and I am also a member of the general council.  I have seen our county services increased.  When I first joined the committee there were two advisers; now there are 16 or 17 advisers.  More and more farmers each year are seeking the advice and guidance of these advisers.  This is very necessary because agriculture is becoming increasingly technical.  The infrastructure of investment in agriculture is so very high that if farmers wish to <Col N="409" /> stay in business they must utilise resources to the fullest possible extent. Therefore I welcome this Bill which seeks to modernise and improve the services that are already at the disposal of the farming community.  I must comment on the tremendous job done by the 27 county committees of agriculture. They have provided consistently improved services for the farming community since the beginning of this State.  This is no mean achievement and I look forward to the expansion of this system and to seeing it operate in the most dynamic way.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that farmers and the farming industry in general have never experienced a more prosperous state.  Never before has there been such confidence in the farming industry. Since the introduction and implementation of the three development directives there has been a tremendous amount of long-term planning in the industry.  This will ensure that its position in the national economy will continue to go from strength to strength and will easily compete with the other branches of the economy. Agriculture will keep its place as our main source of income from external sources.</P>
    <P>Looking at the EEC agriculture directives and at the common agricultural policy generally, and looking at the desirability for Irish farmers of successfully milking the funds that are there for their development, as never before we need to have an advisory and research service second to none.  It is not much good looking at what is available in other countries and I hope the Minister will not spare any effort to provide here a service specially tailored to suit the particular situation and conditions in which Irish farmers have to work.</P>
    <P>The advancement in our services has been facilitated by development programmes. Earlier on, farmers had difficulties but now they can obtain loans and advances for development, and in the past two years the ACC have embarked on a new programme which bears very little resemblance to that which so many people feared and hated in the past.  However, the banks are able to offer better terms than the <Col N="410" /> ACC and we should have a very serious look at this.  The ACC are a statutory body set up to do a specific job and I do not accept that they should allow a situation to develop whereby they are not the leaders in their field&mdash;why anybody can offer more beneficial terms to the industry which the ACC were specifically founded and equipped to service.  I hope we will have a future opportunity to look specifically at this question.</P>
    <P>There has not been a survey of agricultural financing since 1959.  The pitch has changed completely since then and I hope it is within our competence to update the Gilmore Report, the last effort that was made to assess the value and the credit rating of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Bill covers a very wide and important area and it is difficult to know where to start on it.  I am afraid its importance has been underestimated in some sectors.  It gives us an opportunity to look at what is now available to agriculture.  There are an extraordinary number of agencies, semi-State and others, serving Irish agriculture and the amount of costly duplication to the taxpayers is amazing.  Inherent in the multiplicity of the systems is the cost the taxpayers are called on to bear.</P>
    <P>If I have some criticism to offer on the Bill, it is that in section 2 the Minister has not provided for the rationalisation of the research facilities available.  The universities have a significant acreage of farmland on which they do a lot of good work on seed and soil testing.  The Department have no mean outfit; An Foras Talúntais since 1958 have been working; Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann have dabbled in the same work; and Bord na Móna have tried their hand.  I suggest it is time for the Minister to look seriously at this in an endeavour to provide a comprehensive service to cover all these agencies. I am not asking for a national saving, but the moneys which are being spent in duplication of services could be more prudently spent in developing areas which it has not been possible to cover to date.  The Bill gives us an opportunity to look at these problems and to try to provide at least co-ordination <Col N="411" /> between these agencies.  Somebody told me not long ago that not only was there lack of co-ordination between these agencies but that some of the personnel involved were not even exchanging civilities.  This is regrettable, seeing that the taxpayers foot the Bill for the lot.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the success of the expansion of the farm centres.  In recent years&mdash;credit is due to whichever Minister started it&mdash;the winter farm schools have been very beneficial and very popular in the farming community.  The amount of work the advisory services and the divisional inspectors have been putting into these services sometimes goes unnoticed. The winter farm schools are an important part of adult education and have been made much more attractive not just for the students but from the point of view of benefit to the entire agricultural industry.  I would hope it would be possible to expand this system in the not too distant future.  In my own county, even in co-operation with County Kildare, in the school in Athy, which is on the border of County Laois, we are not able to accommodate more than 35 or 40 students in any one year.  That is a small number when one considers there are between 4,000 and 5,000 farms in the county.  The advisers try to pick people who find it impossible to go away for residential courses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan referred to the Jones Davies report and to a certain extent I agree with what he said but that report is somewhat out of date when compared with 1977 standards.  That is of some significance because the service it dealt with has almost turned a complete circle.  It is not really important what other countries do.  We must plan our services so that they will serve our people adequately and fully.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with the incorporation of An Foras Talúntais into the new authority.  It seems unfair, remembering the establishment of this body, to see it disappear in four or five words.  The cost of agricultural research and development is out of proportion to resources and possibly to the size of the industry.  Much of what <Col N="412" /> passes for research is of little value because it lacks originality.  It is carried out by people who are not adequately trained.  It is not directed towards the solution of real problems. Research that is not original should not be classified as research.</P>
    <P>There has been an overemphasis on fulfilling EEC regulations in, for example, variety testing.  A cost benefit analysis might show that the country would not be appreciably worse off if the farmers used the varieties in the NIAB list.  If that were done we could reduce drastically the volume of work incurred in variety testing.  We should consider leaving plant breeding to private enterprise.  In my own experience Midas barley and Atle wheat have served us well in past years.  Atle is not as popular as it was but the experience there shows that the private sector has a role.</P>
    <P>We should insist that researchers are better trained and it is important that they should be engaged in research <i>qua</i> research as distinct from development. Many countries like New Zealand, for example, do not train their own research workers.  They send them to the United Kingdom or to America. Large staffs are supported in universities in the dual roles of researchers and teachers.  It is argued the two should be linked.  The correct situation is where the professor does the research and directs the students under him. This is not a case of training higher degree students on a part-time basis.  I think these services could be obtained on a less costly basis elsewhere.  Research must be properly directed and those directing it must be qualified and reasonably close to practical problems. There are people who are out of touch with the practical problems of rural Ireland.  That may be a little too strong, but there is some element of truth in it.</P>
    <P>Funds for research in agriculture must be spent on research proper and not on diversions such as how to do research, on research on personnel, management, computer methods of retrieving information and various forms of pseudo-science.  Researchers must be continually exposed to practical problems at farmer and EEC level.  It is important that researchers should serve <Col N="413" /> on EEC Committees and pull their weight <i>vis-à-vis</i> their counterparts. This is very important in the present situation and the relationship we must maintain <i>vis-à-vis</i> the common agricultural policy.  I hope that the new authority will select representatives at the various meetings not only of the EEC but also of the OECD, bodies on which we should be strongly represented in the future.</P>
    <P>It is an opportune time before the new authority is set up to look at the activities of An Foras Talúntais to see where improvements and economies can be made.  It is also an opportune time to prevent any further concentration of the staff of An Foras Talúntais in Dublin city.  We have the chance to phase out activities which have been in operation for many years but which have shown little results.  We could look at the work of the soil survey.  A considerable amount of work has been done on rare diseases and on pests and it should be possible to transfer the greater proportion of headquarters staff to the new authority.  I am sure they would form the basis of an excellent administrative nucleus.</P>
    <P>It is opportune for the Minister and the Government to examine the activities of semi-State bodies as An Bord Bainne and the Potato Marketing Board to see if they are not in an arrangement of mutual self-perpetuation with An Foras Talúntais and other research institutes.  We should not have a situation where research is being carried out on how to do research. This is something we can do without.  Above all we need a competent co-ordinator of research who would be able to keep in touch with field work in areas throughout the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to the various farms of An Foras Talúntais, it would be helpful if separate accounts were kept for cattle and cereals so that the farmers who will benefit from the research being carried out can identify a little more closely with what is being done. It is also desirable to phase out staff who reach the age of 65 years.  This country has not been very active in this matter.  Much more emphasis should be placed on engineering.  Possibly <Col N="414" /> it could be divided into an advisory component and a research component.  There should be room for agricultural engineers to play a greater role in the development of agricultural services.</P>
    <P>Some years ago on the General Council of Committees of Agriculture I served on a sub-committee with Deputy Callanan and we produced a report which we presented to the then Minister, possibly in 1969.  It was entitled &ldquo;Agriculture in the Seventies&rdquo;. In that report the general council, which represents all the committees, recognised the problems of the advisory service, the greatest of which was that there were no promotional opportunities for the advisers. I admit that progress has been made in the last few years in this matter and some of the imbalances may have been corrected.  In that report we advocated a structure for promotional opportunities for the advisers and since then the grades of senior adviser and deputy chief agricultural officer have been introduced.  Unfortunately there are too many temporary posts in the advisory service and this cannot lead to an overall improvement of the service and it cannot help the people whom it was designed to serve.</P>
    <P>The document of the general council laid out very clearly what was required and I am sure the Minister referred to it before he drew up the White Paper on which presumably this Bill is based.  I admit that the situation has changed somewhat in that we now have to contend with directives and regulations under the CAP and we have to consider our position and the European influence which is brought to bear on many of our decisions.  The Bill takes into account the new environment in which we find ourselves but there are one or two points which the Minister might clarify.</P>
    <P>Section 70 deals with county agricultural officers.  They are described as secretaries or accountants&mdash;this may be for the sake of convenience&mdash; and I hope the Minister will give me an assurance that these officers will always be agricultural graduates.  Similarly, deputy CAOs should have a degree either in agricultural science or <Col N="415" /> horticultural science.  Such degrees would be my priorities for the posts in question.  These people are specialists in agriculture or horticulture and if people who did not have this training were appointed to direct county services there would be a danger that they might put more emphasis on one of the lesser lines of agriculture husbandry. I hope the Minister will be able to clarify this.  The section itself is quite clear but it caused me some concern when I read that a CAO would be a secretary or an accountant to the committee.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will forgive me if I make a few suggestions with regard to section 31.</P>
    <P>Section 31 (1) reads: &ldquo;There shall be a Director of the Authority.&rdquo;  Section 31 (3) provides for the appointment of the first director by the Minister. The entire section gives prominence to the first director and I wonder why it does so.  All the directors should be appointed by the Minister and given equal prominence.  There is great scope in the section for the Minister to take a modern approach. If the proposed authority is to remain modern and to exude vitality, which our industry needs, then all the directors should be appointed for a term of not more than four years.  The system should be structured to provide fresh minds for directing the work of an organisation such as this.  We could start to use new ideas in an organisation such as this.  We should start by appointing a person for four years and then make it mandatory for him to become an assistant director.  If we took this course we would be assured of a vital team of directors.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous difference between Departments in regard to the top officials.  For instance, in the Department of Foreign Affairs the secretaries seem to change frequently, mainly because there are outlets at ambassadorial level.  The senior civil servants in Foreign Affairs appear to be a different breed and sparkle more than their colleagues in other Departments. It is not a good idea to leave people in jobs too long.  If a person knows that he will be moved after four years <Col N="416" /> he will do his best during his term of office.  It also means that he will be able to move aside with less pressure. It would also avoid the probability that we would appoint an empire builder.  If the Minister tried to merge the existing organisations he would be up against three or four empire builders who cannot be budged, by peaceful means at any rate.  It opens the way for the introduction of a new type of top-class stewardship.  The system is accepted in other countries and there is no reason why it should not work here.  I should like to see the same type of rota operating among the directors and regional directors.  It is also important to retain experienced people within the authority.  I should like to see the retiring directors moving aside after four years.</P>
    <P>The desirability of transferring staff from all levels of the advisory service is also important.  The Minister has an opportunity of overcoming this problem at present.  For example, church leaders remain in their positions until they are in their eighties or nineties and it is very difficult to shift them. They are open to the charge of being ultra-conservative.  The same situation does not apply in the various Orders where Priors are appointed for definite &ldquo;Terms.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have read section 36 time and time again in conjunction with sections 11 and 15.  I am still not sure whether the new county committees will have the same power as the old ones which had the power to borrow and to acquire and sell property with the sanction of the Minister.  In my 20 years' experience I do not remember sanction being refused by the Minister for Agriculture.  The only refusal I remember was in connection with a subsidised tour of farming centres in Europe.  Under the new authority will they be masters of their own destinies within their counties?  County Laois was the first county to co-opt members of voluntary organisations to its committee. The people co-opted have made a significant contribution to the advisory service.  As a result the farming organisations identify more closely with the advisory service.</P>
    <P>While I would prefer to see the present <Col N="417" /> system of authority continued whereby the county committee would retain all their powers, from reading the Bill, even though the sections are very comprehensive, I am not too clear on that point.  It is not that I have any great doubts on the matter, but I would hope the Minister would be able to give me an assurance that the county committees will retain their present functions and indeed that their functions will be increased.</P>
    <P>On the question of the composition of the committee, in our county, where there is a committee of 16, we have had the experience of having two representatives of Macra and two representatives of the IFA in the last two committees.  This has given our committee a new dimension and has been an excellent experiment.  However there is one point I would make in regard to the Minister's proposal that there should be 50 per cent from the voluntary bodies and 50 per cent from the local authority.  Take the case of the health boards, who do not have to answer for their estimates.  They statutorily requisition the amount of money it takes to run their service, and the administrative costs have escalated to an extraordinarily high livel. Whether I am right or wrong, I think some of this may be due to the fact that the people involved have not the responsibility of levying the rate or the tax on the people and therefore have no direct answerability to them. Therefore, I would prefer if the Minister could introduce a different ratio. I do not say that the ratio of 50 per cent from the voluntary bodies is too high but, in my considered opinion, 50 per cent from the duly elected public representatives is too low.  We must retain our support for democracy and for the electoral process, and it is important to have the right ratio there.</P>
    <P>As regards section 36, if the powers of the committee are not as strong as we have been used to and they are too centralised, will the public themselves lose a certain amount of respect for or confidence in the system?  This certainly would not have any great bearing in normal times, but if the situation should arise where there would be <Col N="418" /> a sharp clash between the farming community and the Minister, as happened in the sixties, would it react on the credibility of the staff of the committee? Would there be a danger that people would lose faith?  I have already heard speakers from the other side say that there might be a lack of confidence. I hope the Minister will be able to tell us clearly that there is no danger of this happening.</P>

      <P>No, but I can see a real danger.  Regrettably, I was not here for the Minister's Second Reading speech and therefore I would hope he would be able to take a few minutes off to strengthen my faith in this regard. From reading the Bill I think the civil service might appear to have more control and more power than they had under the old Agricultural Acts.  The working relations between committees and Departments have been and I believe will always remain very good, but this new authority is an unknown quantity.</P>
      <P>I would like to go back to section 2, the definition section, and deal with the question of the co-ordination of the research services.  I was rather saddened over the past few weeks to find that, after we had succeeded in securing a six-figure sum from the Energy Commission in Europe to do a research project on alternative sources of energy, it has not been possible to date to get a piece of marginal land from a State agency suitable to carry out experiments and spend the money received.  There are many State bodies with land, the Department of Lands, the Forestry Division, Bord na Móna, Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann and goodness knows how many others. There ought to be co-ordination here, and under the new Act passed last year I thought all those new authorities or boards with land were vested in the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there are tests to be carried out there should be some kind of priority given to such work, and I would hope to see better co-ordination in this <Col N="419" /> respect.  In the midlands, in my own constituency, there are 200,000 acres of marginal land, a great deal of it in the ownership of Bord na Móna.  The experiments and research going into that type of soil have been proceeding at too slow a pace.  I would have expected to see a more dynamic policy on this project.  I would ask the Minister to consider whether under this new authority, or even without the new authority, he could, within his own Department take on a dynamic co-ordinating role not only to ensure that the best possible service and value for money are obtained from the public money spent but also that there will not be unnecessary and costly duplication.</P>
    <P>In situations where services were discontinued in the past and new bodies took over there has been the practice of officers or servants of such bodies who had reached the age of 60 being given the option of retiring on full pension or transferring their contract of service to the new body.  While that is not written into the Bill the Minister might tell us whether the position will remain as it has been and that it will be possible for people who may not wish to move into the new body, to retire at full pension on the termination of their present position, even if they should be, say, a few months short of retiring age.  This would be desirable from the point of view of any such persons concerned as well as in terms of the present circumstances of job shortages.  I am wondering why there is no reference in the Bill to this aspect of the situation.</P>
    <P>Regarding the composition of the board I am disappointed that there appears to be provision only for one member of the council of committees of agriculture.  This is not sufficient especially when one has regard to the different types of husbandry that apply in different parts of the country. I would suggest that at least four, but perhaps six members, be appointed to the board from the general council. The committees are entitled to representation of this order.  The situation would be even better if, when <Col N="420" /> asking voluntary organisations to nominate persons for appointment to the board, the Minister would tell them to nominate one or two, or whatever number would be considered correct, who are serving presently on county committees of agriculture.  This would ensure fair representation for the committee and would allow for the service being as effective as possible.</P>
    <P>There would be little point in having a number of people on the board who would not have first-hand information of the various difficulties and problems that can hinder the progress of the work of any organisation.</P>
    <P>I would suggest, too, that the board be appointed for a particular term and, then, that the members could be either replaced or reappointed.  It would be very important to have a flow of fresh minds to the authority so that there would be an input of new ideas.  If the kind of organisation we are talking about were to be allowed to develop into a type of club I do not think the maximum benefit would be derived by the people for whom the legislation is designed.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I welcome the Bill and I trust that the Minister will not take objection to my raising a few questions on it.  I hope that on Committee Stage he will, should he consider it necessary, introduce some amendments so as to ensure that the Bill has the goodwill and the support of the widest possible section of the community.  We have been waiting a long time for this legislation.  I compliment the Minister on its introduction and I trust that it will result in a vast improvement in the services concerned. We all recognise the dedication of the Minister to the industry he is serving.  His ability is recognised not only here but in Europe, too.  It is my hope that we can embark on this new and dynamic step by so structuring it as to give dynamic leadership to the people who will be working in the new authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues on this side of the House in opposing this Bill.  I oppose it for a number of reasons, the main one being that it appears to be designed in a way that <Col N="421" /> will take away the power of local bodies and give complete authority to the Minister and the Department in so far as the future of agriculture is concerned.  Indeed, at a time when we are talking about decentralisation the Bill is the worst example possible of centralisation.</P>
      <P>As Deputy McDonald said, we were all looking forward to a Bill on the future of research and education in agriculture but so far as this side of the House is concerned the measure before us was not what we expected.  I suspect, from some of the contributions from the other side, that they are not pleased with it either.  Deputy McDonald, for instance, had quite a few questions to pose in respect of it. I note his agreement with much of the criticism we have offered in regard to the representation on the authority of committees of agriculture.</P>
      <P>Deputy Finn referred to the politics involved in committees of agriculture. He condemned this situation.  However, when the majority of members of committees of agriculture are elected representatives, the committees generally work quite well.  As the Minister pointed out, there are some weaknesses in the present set-up but I would suggest that there is a greater element of politics in what is proposed here in that there can be a situation of the Minister of the day giving jobs to the boys.  If Deputy McDonald's suggestion were to be adopted jobs for the boys would be available every two years or so.</P>
      <P>Leaving aside whatever faults may be inherent in the present situation we all know of the many organisations, such as Macra na Tuaithe, Macra na Feirme and Muintir na Tíre, who have got tremendous help from the advisory services.  It appears now as if the Minister is pulling the stool from under them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first weakness that comes to mind in relation to the Bill before us is that it contains no provision for an extension of the services.  Some Government speakers have referred to this omission.  I am particularly worried by the method of financing.  In the past there was agreement between the committee <Col N="422" /> of agriculture and the council as to the amount of finance that would be given and this was levied on the rates.  I am afraid that this might come to an end because the amount asked for by the committee of agriculture might not be sanctioned, and even if it is sanctioned there is a danger that it might not be spent in the county area.  I ask for the Minister's comment on the fact that the Minister seems to be telling the councils what to do under this Bill.  The main problem is that the committees of agriculture need more money and staff.  This has become a very acute problem since the implementation of the farm modernisation scheme.  There is a quota of advisers for every county area and many of them are temporary.  There are not enough advisers to deal with the large number of applications under the farm modernisation scheme.  Much of their time is taken up with paper work when they should be out and about meeting the farmers, advising them and making recommendations. On many occasions at committee meetings we have asked that more clerical staff be made available to our committee.  This would relieve a lot of the paper work involved for the graduates. We have not got sanction for that extra staff, and even when the existing clerical staff are on sick or maternity leave we are not allowed to bring in a replacement.</P>
    <P>When talking about our entry into the Common Market, before I came into this House, the impression was that there would be a great future for agricultural graduates and at that time there was a shortage of graduates. Now we have a different situation. Only last Friday in County Galway for one job we had 16 graduates from County Galway alone, not counting applications from other parts of the country.  The future looks bleak for those graduates, some of whom graduated in 1973.  I would be grateful if the Minister would refer to this in his reply.  In every county there seems to be need for more graduates and the Minister should get the committee of agriculture to sanction the appointment of temporary advisers.  There are many graduates unemployed and <Col N="423" /> graduates are urgently needed to cope with the amount of work involved in the farm modernisation scheme.  At the moment there is no prospect of jobs in the advisory services or in semi-State bodies for any of those graduates.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with section 10 which deals with the dissolution of An Foras Talúntais.  Much research was done by the institute particularly in my own county where research was carried out on the flocks of sheep.  The institute could continue to work particularly in relation to the eradication of diseases in animals.  The Minister will recall that only today Deputy Callanan put down a question in relation to the outbreak of sheep scab in Galway.  That is just one problem that could be tackled by the institute.  Galway County Council have done everything in their power to ensure that the regulations laid down by the Department are carried out.  On one occasion I approached the county manager on behalf of a farmer who had his sheep dipped in <Col N="424" /> late September and it was only a matter of weeks before the dipping season was to start, but the manager stuck rigidly to the rules and the farmer had to dip his sheep again.  That is an example of how rigidly the rules are adhered to.  The institute have done great work and I am disappointed that they are to be abolished.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons referred to some EEC directives.  When these directives were first introduced farmers asked a lot of questions about their implications. They were puzzled by many of the directives and they got a lot of information from the advisory services. At the time we understood that socioeconomic advisers were to be appointed particularly in relation to directives 160 and 161.  These were not appointed and there is no reference to them in this Bill.  It was a great pity that they were not appointed.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the position is as follows.  The taxpayer has not proved his title to repayment.  When his emploment ceased he had had the benefit of just over half of his income tax allowances for the current year and duly lodged a claim to repayment of tax on the grounds of unemployment. The inspector of taxes then sent him a return form for completion and made the usual inquiries regarding his unemployment. The completed return form contained information suggesting that there might be income to be taken into account other than that from the terminated employment.  Until the taxpayer satisfies the inspector's inquiries in this regard the claim to repayment cannot be dealt with.</P>

      <P>The allegation referred to in the question is one which was made last weekend at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis by Mr. A. Browne, Senior Counsel, and widely publicised.</P>
      <P>Mr. Browne has since been interviewed by the Garda and has given the name of the person to whom he was referring.  The person in question is awaiting trial on serious criminal charges and it is clear that an allegation of ill-treatment may become an issue in the trial.  I am therefore precluded from making any statement concerning the allegation.</P>
      <P>It is however possible, and I think appropriate, to give the House certain facts that are relevant to the statements made by Mr. Browne at the weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>habeas corpus</i> action to which Mr. Browne publicly referred related to the detention of the man concerned under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act, 1939 and it was Mr. Browne himself who represented the Garda in that case.  Acting on behalf of the Garda, Mr. Browne informed the High Court that the Garda were not objecting to a grant of <i>habeas corpus</i> but that the man concerned, who at that stage had not been charged, would be rearrested as soon as he had left the precincts of <Col N="406" /> the court and charged with a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>It is apparent therefore that Mr. Browne was in a special position to know, when making his public remarks at the weekend, that there was in fact pending a criminal trial in which the issue of the alleged ill-treatment was liable to arise.  Added point is given to this by the fact that his reference to <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings and to the area from which the man came was tantamount to identifying the case publicly&mdash;even though, as I say, the Garda subsequently, as a precaution, verified the identification from him. Moreover, although a period of some ten months has elapsed since the matter complained of arose, Mr. Browne at no stage made any complaint to me or, according to my information, to the Garda authorities.  I would have thought he might have done so if only because of his own participation on behalf of the Garda in the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings and his knowledge that the man was about to be taken into Garda custody again.</P>
