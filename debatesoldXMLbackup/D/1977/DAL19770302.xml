    <Title>National Agricultural Advisory, Education and Research Authority Bill, 1976: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Thursday I was dealing with directives and their relevance to this Bill.  Farmers are anxious to get information and advice about the directives and it was envisaged that socio-economic advisers would be appointed for that purpose.  However, that has not been the evolution and it is being left to the agricultural services <Col N="556" /> and the staffs of county committees to deal with these directives.  It is very disappointing to discover it is apparently not proposed to appoint any socio-economic advisers.  It seems somewhat ironic that these should be omitted from a Bill of this nature.  I should like the Minister to comment on that situation.</P>
      <P>Section 15 transfers to the proposed authority the advisory functions at present operated by the Minister's Department and the county committees of agriculture.  The authority will be obliged to orientate its advisory services in accordance with the provisions in section 15.  Under clause (g) the authority may:</P>
      <P>Adopt measures to ensure that those engaged in agriculture&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) are fully informed as expeditiously as possible of schemes and facilities for the development of agriculture operated by the Minister and by other agencies.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in this section about expanding the advisory services and there is no prospect of better advisory services.  The Minister and his Department seem to be attempting to take complete control.  They are taking away power from local bodies instead of giving more power to them.  The method of financing is being changed. That is a very disturbing feature of this Bill.  With regard to representation, a board will be established consisting of a chairman and not more than 23 ordinary members.  With certain exceptions the members will be nominated by the Minister.  With regard to the exceptions, at least one member will be appointed by the Minister for Education and one on the nomination of the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture. This is very shabby treatment of public representatives.  Only one member out of 24 will be a public representative nominated by the General Council.  I believe elected representatives should have a majority because they have to answer to the people.  Giving only 50 per cent representation to public representatives is, as I say, very shabby treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" /> The main problem for the agricultural committees is that they need more money and more staff.  That is the sort of problem that should be dealt with in this Bill.  The number of agricultural and horticultural instructors in each county should be increased. The number is ridiculously low at the moment.  I would ask the Minister to consider the plight of the agricultural graduate.  He cannot get employment because of the quota system.  He cannot get employment in State or semi-State bodies because experience is required in the majority of cases.  Employment as a temporary instructor is a stepping stone to other employment, particularly in State and semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>Under section 53 certain properties will be transferred to the authority. Those properties will include the Agricultural College at Athenry, Clonakilty Agricultural College, Ballyhaise Agricultural College and Kildalton Agricultural and Horticultural College plus the Cereal Station at Ballinacurra.  I would like to know the method of financing these colleges.  I am concerned about Mellowes College in Athenry which is in my constituency. I would like the Minister to let us know how it is proposed to finance the workings of such colleges.  In addition, I should like to repeat a call that has been made for a faculty of agriculture in UCG.  It should be obvious to the Minister that we have the back-up facilities in the county; we have the agricultural colleges, the research station at Belclare near Tuam and we have all that is necessary for the practical work required of a student studying agriculture.  At the moment such a student from the Galway area does two years at UCG and completes his degree at UCD.  We have the facilities for students to do the full course in Galway University.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the statements of some Government speakers in the debate last Thursday who said that this Bill will give confidence to the farming community.  I think the opposite will be the case.  This Bill comes after severe taxation measures have been imposed on the farming community and at a time when the <Col N="558" /> co-operative movement is trying to cope with taxation imposed on it in the 1976 budget.  The Bill does not deal with the many problems that exist in agriculture.  I agree with the Minister that there may be weaknesses in the present system but this measure will not improve the situation. I hope the Minister will accept amendments at a later stage.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to have to say that I have often been more impressed with contributions from the Opposition than I have been on this occasion.  I should like to reply to a few points raised by Deputy Kitt.  He complains of what he calls the shabby treatment given to the county committees of agriculture and he is not impressed that they will have a representation of one out of the 24 members.  The point is they will have at least one and they are the only organisation to have such a guarantee.  It is the first time that the General Council of Committees of Agriculture have been given statutory recognition and this has not been acknowledged by any of the speakers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kitt says that the only thing wrong with county committees is that they need more staff and he points out that agricultural graduates cannot get jobs.  They may need more staff but when we are reorganising the whole service it is not the right time to put people all over the place.  We have more agricultural graduates in Ireland per 1,000 holdings than any other country in Europe.  I know that the services are organised in a different way in other countries but it is a fact that we have more agricultural graduates than European countries.</P>

      <P>There are 3,000 farmers in Luxembourg.  The Minister should not play with figures.  We are talking about a rural nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is quite correct; we have more agricultural graduates per number of holdings employed in Ireland than any other country in Europe.  The White Paper outlining the proposals contained in the Bill was published in April, 1975 and, on the whole, it was <Col N="559" /> very well received and the public comment was generally favourable.  I know that there was a small number of minor criticisms that amounted to very little.  As the then Chairman of the County Committees of Agriculture, Deputy Callanan thought he had to complain that in the course of reorganisation the services were reducing the powers of the committees. However, he omitted to acknowledge that for the first time the county committees were getting statutory recognition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about the head body of the county committees. It is not possible individually to represent 27 county committees on any board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is statutory recognition with no powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are represented on the board that will organise and run the services they will have powers through their own representatives.  They are being given a guarantee and they are the only organisation who have been given this.  It was as a result of representations made by people such as Deputy Callanan and it was also recognition of the fact that they have been so involved in these services during the years.  I found it very difficult to understand the points put by Deputy Gibbons because before he left office he had proposals before his Government.  The committees were to be treated in exactly the same way as they are being treated in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The memorandum was there and I had to look at it.  There was pressure to do something about the reorganisation of the advisory services. There were numerous reports on the matter.  I am giving the Deputy credit for the fact that he did a lot of work on this and he had these proposals ready for submission to the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to deal with this matter when I am being interrupted constantly by Deputy Gibbons.  The fact is that these proposals had reached the advanced stage of being submitted to the Government with the approval of Deputy Gibbons. He did not include the Agricultural Institute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of old scores.  It is a question of what <Col N="561" /> was on the record.  Only Deputy Gibbons would come into the House and say that I was stripping county committees of every vestige of responsibility when the powers being left with the county committees are the same as he proposed when I took office.  He cannot deny this because I have the documents.  Recently he said he would abolish committees altogether. The Opposition should make up their minds in regard to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil are split on this issue.  The Bill proposes that 50 per cent are to be elected to the committee and the other 50 per cent not.  Numerous Opposition speakers criticised me for this proposal.  There seems to be confusion in relation to the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>My party are not unanimous in regard to the composition of county committees.  There are several views on the matter and I have to listen to these views.  It is fair to have half of the members elected and half of them not elected.  Two Galway Deputies spoke about the terrible thing that I was proposing in providing that only 50 per cent would be elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that only ten out of the 20 already there are elected, that Galway are doing what we are proposing.  The only difference between what I am proposing and what has been done in <Col N="562" /> Galway is that I propose to ask the rural organisations to nominate the non-elected half of the committee. This is what Deputy Gibbons proposed. I proposed that the rural organisations should be represented on county committees of agriculture because I though it would benefit their work.  At the time my proposal was seconded by a well-known Member of this House, Deputy P. J. Burke, and it was unanimously accepted.  The proposal worked well because they were not party politicians.  They were close to the work of the committee and made a great contribution.  For the same reason I am proposing that that balance should be followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are concerned about the percentage of public representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We could argue about percentages.  There is no doubt that there are a number of views on this matter and they are not confined to the Opposition.  If we leave it to be done otherwise than through the nomination of the rural bodies it will be done on a party-political basis and we will have a similar set up to the one we already have.</P>
      <P>During the discussion Deputy Finn described the way in which Fianna Fáil have misused their political strength in County Mayo.  He said that the people who were appointed in County Mayo have no connection whatsoever with agriculture.  I am prepared to admit that a number of such people on a committee could be of benefit to that committee.  I have no fixation about the composition of committees. The people who depend for a livelihood on farming are the people we should be concerned with because they must run the show in a sensible way.  The effect of their experience on how a service will affect them should be the main consideration.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by the rural organisations and by the various people we have mentioned in the White Paper and in the explanatory memorandum. What Deputy Gibbons is doing is accusing all these organisations of being nominated by Fine Gael.  I would love to think that that was the position, but I strongly suspect that it is not.  The Deputy is telling these organisations that the only result of their nominations and recommendations is Fine Gael.  It does not make sense.</P>
      <P>What I am trying to do is to improve the quality of the committees and to have a good board to run the new organisation.  If I were not concerned about the welfare of farming and of farmers I could sit back and do nothing about all this.  I am trying to do this because I believe it will improve the service.  I am trying to bring in as many agencies as possible who are at present providing a service in one way or another to Irish agriculture and for no other reason.  I want all the centres that were previously used by An Foras Talúntais, by our own schools, by the State-aided schools that do not belong to the Department of Agriculture, to be power houses of education and knowledge of farming and show their effects in a wide area around them.</P>

Somebody has to appoint them, but they are nominated by the various bodies throughout the country of whom the members of the Opposition are so critical and say they can only be hacks if they are nominated by these people.  I cannot accept this and, as I say, the staff are public servants not civil servants.  I am not afraid of civil servants, but I will say this much, that there are civil servants in that Department that the people could never repay for the service they have given to Irish agriculture and Deputy Gibbons knows that as well as I do.</P>

I was quite surprised to find that while the reorganisation he proposed dealt with the education and advisory services, it did not include the Agricultural Institute; of course the Deputy is right in that.  I think it is vitally important to include the Agricultural Institute.  There is nothing that gives the same amount of stimulation as research, and I want that stimulation to get closer to the advisory service. I want it to be an overall service.</P>

      <P>I am convinced that the Agricultural Institute must be part <Col N="567" /> of any reorganisation of these services. The institute are concerned with applied research and development, and obviously they should be very closely associated with training and advisory work.  Deputy Callanan told us that at one time he was in favour of putting these services together into one organisation.  Again, that indicates that there are two schools of thought in this regard on the Opposition benches.  He would favour that and so would any practical farmer.  But I cannot accept the claim that in putting the Agricultural Institute in the same organisation as the education, training and advisory services, I am taking away the institute's autonomy and freedom.  This claim is an utter and total misrepresentation of the situation.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will allow me to proceed I think I can show that there will be complete and absolute freedom for research workers in the reorganised services.  The Minister for Agriculture has responsibility for the development of all aspects of the industry.  He must satisfy himself that the necessary resources are applied to whatever sector or activity needs support at any time.  It is provided in sections 32 and 44 that the board shall submit their programme annually to the Minister for approval together with an estimate of the cost. When the Minister has satisfied himself that the programme is adequate for the needs of the industry he will give the authority to go ahead.  Indeed, subsection (3) of section 32 provides that the board shall come back to the Minister for approval for any change in the programme which, subsequently, is considered necessary or desirable. The researchers, under the new authority, will be every bit as free as are the institute in carrying out whatever research is agreed by the board and by the Minister.</P>

      <P>It would be wrong and even silly for a Minister for Agriculture to interfere in the day-to-day conduct of research or in the publication of the results of research.  Last year grants from my Department amounted to 65 per cent of the total cost of providing services that are to be integrated under this Bill.  I have neither the desire nor the intention of insisting that he who pays the piper shall call the tune.  A Minister for Agriculture could be charged justifiably with evasion of responsibility if, apart from the preponderant contribution towards the expenses of the new authority which the State grants will represent, he were not concerned always with the setting of priorities in regard to what projects ought to be undertaken at any time.  The Minister has the responsibility for discussing what should be priorities in a national programme for development in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="569" /> As spokesman for Agriculture for his party, Deputy Gibbons, in October last, published a pamphlet entitled <i>What is Wrong with Irish Farming?</i> Although this document dealt in detail with everything the Deputy considered necessary, for example, a common livestock breeding policy, the expansion of herds and flocks, the promotion of pasture development, the use of better animal nutritional techniques, a shortening of the beef production cycle, an extension of the milking season, the completion of a comprehensive soil survey and so on, the Agricultural Institute are not mentioned once in the pamphlet although that body would have a big contribution to make in attaining many of the desirable objectives set out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Opposition speakers refer to the ease with which farmers get advice from institute staff and to the part played by the staff in development work.  I am aware that many institute staff like to be involved in development work.  Consequently, I am amazed that Opposition Deputies have allowed themselves to be persuaded by biased arguments that the institute should not be part of the new authority.  The motive behind this escapes me.  However, let me restate the true position.  The organisation that is being established will provide the present institute staff with a new and more effective means of contributing to the development of the agricultural industry than exists at present.  The staff will be as free to get on with their work as they have been in the past.  If I thought otherwise, I would not include it because I wish them to continue to have the same independence as they have always enjoyed. The fact that once each year they must discuss with the Minister for Agriculture their programmes and priorities is a normal and proper requirement.</P>
      <P>I trust that I have reassured the Opposition Deputies on this question of freedom in regard to the carrying out of research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been referring to the farming organisations but he has not been able to assure them on this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Farming organisations, like any of us, can be right or can be wrong, and they can be fed prejudices the same as anybody else.  I honestly believe that most people did not read this Bill sufficiently.  If they did they could see all the safeguards being provided, the fact that these are <Col N="571" /> all public servants and that the board is composed of people who are nominated, with the exception of the first director and the first chairman.</P>
      <P>Another matter relating to freedom is the function of the board.  Listening to speakers opposite, particularly Deputy Gibbons, one would get the impression that the board will be a collection of &ldquo;yes&rdquo; men.  Section 26 provides for the appointment of the chairman and the members of the board.  How this section could be construed as resulting in a board of &ldquo;yes&rdquo; men is something I cannot understand.  Will the nominations from the General Council of Committees of Agriculture, the staff of the authority, the different agricultural and rural organisations, universities and so on be all &ldquo;yes&rdquo; men and party hacks?  I would like the Opposition at some stage to tell me how this could happen.  All these bodies will see this charge for what it is.  In relation to the question of the appointment of political supporters to boards such as this, I challenge the Opposition to give me an instance of a Fianna Fáil Government appointing a Fine Gael Deputy to a semi-State board.  I have appointed one of their Deputies to a semi-State body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy keep to the Bill?  I am giving all the material I can to prove that the Deputy's allegations are entirely without foundation.  Deputy Callanan said he was worried that farmers will not have much say on the board and went so far as to imply that because section 26 says that at least one member will be on the nomination of the general council that will mean only one member. All the people who spoke from the Opposition benches made the same reference.  I would not have put in &ldquo;at least one member&rdquo; if I meant that only one member could possibly be appointed.  The Deputy would not like me to accept that implication when determining the representation of the different nominating bodies.  I do not accept that farmers will have as little say on the board as the Opposition have suggested, unless all the organisations that we propose to have represented are gone to blazes and do not speak for farmers at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find the Deputies opposite disagreeing among themselves as to the place committees of agriculture will have in the new organisation.  Deputy Callanan and others complained that committees are being stripped of their powers and their elected representatives will have very little say.  On the other hand in the pamphlet I have referred to, Deputy Gibbons stated that the advisory services need to be reorganised, that ideally they should be controlled by co-operatives, that control of the advisory services by committees of agriculture had become an absurdity because most committees are made up in part at least, by people from outside the industry.  He said <Col N="573" /> that this anachronism should be ended, that he had believed for a long time that the committees of agriculture system was not suitable for the employment and direction of the large advisory staff we have now and that many of the problems of the advisory service stemmed from it.</P>
    <P>I am arranging under the Bill for staff to be employed and directed centrally within the authority, with committees having the right to monitor the service provided in their counties. Committees will also have the right to monitor the other services of the Department of Agriculture.  In view of their changed role it is appropriate that farm and rural organisations should be represented on these committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>What does &ldquo;monitor&rdquo; mean in that context?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It means keeping a tag at local level on the services.  This can only be done at local level.  Deputy Hussey seems to be in favour of having a majority of elected representatives on the committee of agriculture. As the Deputy was not then a Member of this House he may be unaware that subsection (1) of section 42 of this Bill is taken directly from the corresponding section of the Agricultural (Amendment) Act, 1964, a measure introduced by the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Paddy Smith, expressly for the purpose of providing for the nomination to the committees of representatives of voluntary rural organisations who would not be county councillors.  That Bill received the unanimous support of all the parties in the House.  Subsequently, as I am aware most of us can recall, another Fianna Fáil Minister introduced a Bill in 1967 to repeal the 1964 Act.  Because local elections were not held in the meantime that Act never came into force, but no compelling reasons were put forward in 1967 for the repeal of the 1964 Act, as no cogent arguments had been advanced in the course of this debate for the retention of the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I leave it to Deputies to speculate as to why the present Opposition voted in 1967 for the repeal of a statute they <Col N="574" /> enthusiastically supported three years before.  That measure was sponsored by their own Minister and introduced expressly to give an opportunity to the voluntary rural organisations to be represented on committees of agriculture. Their persistence in their attitude is all the more surprising having regard to the increasing strength and influence of these bodies in the meantime.  The present Bill not only revives the 1964 Act but it specifically provides for the appointment from the voluntary bodies of members who are not county councillors. This feature did not appear in the previous legislation.  I am not downgrading county councillors because in the main they are responsible people, but I worked with the other blend for years and it worked extremely well.  It is only for the purpose of improving the quality of these committees that I am making the present proposals.  There could be a lot of discussion and argument on all sides of the house, this side as well as the opposite, as to whether the balance is correct or not. It depends on the people who come on either from the county council side or the farming side.</P>

      <P>Many Deputies referred to the important part the instructors have played in the development of our agriculture.  The reason for the great increase in the size of the service in the last 15 to 20 years, is the fact that they did good work, but this growth has brought many problems of organisation, direction, career structure and so on.  Nobody would say that any organisation should stand still or should not be looked at from the point of view of trying to improve it.  I would like to remind Deputy Noonan that these problems have been known for a long time but they were not tackled.  It is not good enough for Deputy Gibbons to say that proposals for reorganisation have been hanging around for years.  Of course they have, but the fact is that very little was done to introduce a new structure.  This Bill provides an organisation through which it will be possible to get rid of the weaknesses and problems of the existing system and in which the advisory staffs will be able to make a greater contribution than in the past.  That is my hope and expectation.</P>
      <P>Deputy J. Gibbons objects to the use of the title &ldquo;instructor&rdquo; for those who give advice, claiming that retaining this title shows the absence of any new ideas in the Bill.  Is this a very sound argument, seeing that practically every English-speaking country uses a different title? Incidentially, the word &ldquo;instructor&rdquo; is not mentioned anywhere in the Bill.  The term &ldquo;education&rdquo; would also appear to be causing Deputy Gibbons some misgivings.</P>

      <P>He thinks the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; would be preferable. I would like in this connection to direct his attention to section 2 where education is stated to include training and cognate words are to be construed accordingly.  Deputy Gibbons and one or two other Deputies complain that the Bill reminds them of the parish plan and suggest that it is out-of-date.  I am not at all worried if this Bill reminds people of the parish plan because in that plan Deputy J. Gibbons, who occupied this position previously, was introducing a system in which the instructor, or parish agent as he was called, would work closely with the local people to help them improve their farming and their general situation.  Twenty-five parish agents were appointed and assigned to parishes which asked for them.  I remember well the attack which was mounted against the parish plan, but in spite of this not a single parish asked Deputy Dillon at the time to withdraw the parish agent even though the plan was criticised up and down the country.</P>

      <P>Immediately Fianna Fáil took office again the parish plan was allowed to lapse.  I am convinced that the parish plan philosophy was the basis for the pilot area programme introduced later in the 12 western counties by the Fianna Fáil Government. The parish plan was the forerunner of that and it was that plan that gave the Fianna Fáil Government that followed the inspiration to do what was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Deputies complained that the Bill does not concern itself with the development of the advisory service or with the employment of agricultural <Col N="577" /> graduates.  While I greatly regret the current unemployment among graduates, the development of the education advisory and research branches of the new authority will be a matter for the board.</P>

      <P>This is so if they decide not to employ any more graduates but I am satisfied that that will not be their decision.  I do not know of any faculty in the country that is not over-producing graduates because of the enormous increase in demand for third level education.  I would expect that this will be one of the first matters that the board will attend to.  Section 33 gives the board a power to appoint whatever staff they consider necessary for the authority to carry out their functions and they will employ the staff, not I.  It is very wrong, if not mischievous&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is wrong, if not mischievous, for Deputies opposite to say that the staff of the authority will be civil servants, thus implying that in some way this will make the staff less interested in responding to the needs of the farming community.  The staff will be employed by the authority and will be public servants, not civil servants. That is a change from the proposals made by my predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan's contribution seemed to be very confused.  For example, he was at pains to show how damaging what he calls civil service control would be to the freedom of the advisory service and to farmer confidence <Col N="578" /> in that service.  He went on to say that the advisory service should be under the control of a deputy secretary. This is the confusion that I cannot understand, that it should be under the control of a deputy secretary or assistant secretary of the Department.  This surely would be civil service control according to his own definition.</P>

      <P>Since the board will include representatives of the farming and rural organisations, it is difficult to see how Deputies opposite can suggest the staff will be less available to farmers or to bodies such as Macra na Feirme in the future than they were in the past.  How would the board allow that to happen, a board so composed and so concerned with and so close to farmers?  Why would they deny access to the research services which have provided us with so much valuable material?  The thing is crazy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Opposition Deputies claimed that section 30 (1) (f) would make confidential information available to the Minister.  The research staff's union are also making a similar claim. Indeed, Deputy Noonan went further and said this information would be available to every other Minister as well.  If Deputies and other interested parties read the Bill they will see I propose to transfer certain functions <Col N="579" /> to the authority which have a bearing on State and EEC expenditure.  After their years in Government, Deputies opposite should know this expenditure has to be accounted for to the Committee of Public Accounts and to the EEC Commission.</P>
    <P>As Chairman of the Limerick County Committee of Agriculture, Deputy Noonan should know that at present officers from the Department can examine all farm modernisation scheme documents in the CAO offices. They have to have this freedom. Nothing new in this regard is proposed in this Bill.  He also knows that as civil servants these officers are required to respect the confidentiality of the information contained in them. He further knows civil servants do not disclose information.  That is why farmers have the full confidence in the officers of my Department which I believe they have.</P>
    <P>This section is necessary to enable those who have statutory accounting responsibility for the expenditure of State and EEC moneys to carry out their responsibility.  That is all that is being sought, and it is all I would wish to have sought.  I am also proposing to hand over several State properties to the authority.  This section is also relevant to them.  It is grossly misleading, if not dishonest, for anybody to claim this section will interfere in any way with the conduct of research work, or that it will be used to obtain for wrong purposes any information in the hands of the authority. The existence of the board, with the membership as provided for in the Bill, will reassure anybody that this cannot happen.  Why would I want all these dreadful things to happen to farmers?  Why should any Minister want that?  Why should anybody deliberately set out to get this type of treatment for farmers in relation to what is confidential to them?</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the most important points made during the debate.  I want to stress again that, in the arrangements which this Bill provides for, the Minister and the board will settle annually the policy to be followed on agricultural education and training, <Col N="580" /> advisory and research work and, when this policy is settled, the authority will be free to implement it.  This is the kind of arrangement the relevant interests have been seeking to have introduced for several years.  It is also the arrangement the majority of the Deputies in this House, including many on the opposite side, wish to see brought into being.</P>
    <P>The question was also raised as to how the money would be got from the county committees of agriculture. People objected to the type of demand being made on the county committees for this money.  There is nothing new in this either.  The vocational education committees have been doing exactly that for as long as I remember. I was a member of a vocational education committee and chairman of a vocational education committee for quite a long time.  They made their demands in the same way and the members of the county council had no option but to give them exactly what they asked for.  We have the same thing in the case of the health boards. That was not Fine Gael legislation. That was not Coalition legislation.  It was Fianna Fáil legislation.  They provided that the health boards would simply make their demands and the elected representatives on the county councils had no say whatever and had no function except to sanction them. They could talk about the matter for a month and if they reduced it in the slightest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is similar to one I moved on Committee Stage and the reason for it is to protect the employees' interests.  The Minister undertook to look at the matter and he may have had good reason for not bringing in an amendment but I suspect there is a weakness here.  The necessity is there to insert the words in the amendment. There may be a weakness in subsection (1) (a) where business change hands.  A man who takes over a business after six or nine months may try to carry out an unfair dismissal.  I believe there is a weakness in this section which would enable him to get away with this through the courts or by proving that the wording of the section did not apply to him because it could be said that the employee had less than one year's continuous service with the employer who dismissed him, that the employee had been with that <Col N="586" /> man for only six months or nine months.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will say that there are sections in other Acts to protect the employee but I submit that there is a glaring weakness here.  The Minister undertook to have a look at the amendment on similar lines which I submitted on Committee Stage.  I believe this is essential to close a possible gap.  There is no point in passing legislation through which legal people can drive the proverbial coach and four.  This is probably one of the most important pieces of legislation we have discussed in the House.  It is very important for the employee in the event of an unfair dismissal.  There should be no such thing as an unfair dismissal but, human nature being what it is, we have them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has many times referred to the ruthless employer.  I am glad to say that we have very few of those.  The vast majority of employers are people with social consciences and with the interests of their employees at at heart.  I fear there is a loophole in this section that I cannot see closed anywhere else in the Bill.  I will be satisfied if the Minister can point out specifically to me in the Bill where it has been closed.  We are talking about unfair dismissals and about people who take over businesses, whether it be an employer who employs a few people or a multi-national company.  If an employee is unfairly dismissed six or nine months after that person has taken over that business that employee should be safeguarded.  At the moment this Bill applies to all employees.  I believe the employer can read into this section that the employee he is dismissing has not had one year's continuous service with the employer who dismisses him.  Admittedly he has had 12 months' or maybe 20 years' service in the business or the company where he is working.  As the section reads, however, it does not refer to that; it refers to the employer who dismisses him.  I believe my amendment is a far better safeguard.</P>
    <P>I fully understand what the Minister wants to do.  This Bill must be able to stand on its own.  We hear people say that it is a bad time for the introduction of such legislation, that it may <Col N="587" /> deter employment or may encourage people to dismiss employees before the 12 months have expired.  I referred to this earlier as a conacre system.  I do not want to see such a system being introduced into employment.  I am sure everybody in the House knows what an 11-month conacre letting means.  If the Minister accepts this amendment the section would then read:</P>
    <P>An employee (other than a person referred to in section 4 of this Act) who is dismissed whose contract of employment commenced less than one year prior to the date of his dismissal.</P>
    <P>It does not matter then if it is the new owner of the company, the new multi-national who has moved in or whoever it is, if the employee's contract of employment has been with that company or business for 12 months he cannot be dismissed.  I appeal to the Minister to accept what I believe to be a very necessary amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald and I are both concerned about the same thing.  We want to ensure that in the event of takeovers and mergers the employee's rights to fair procedures should not be threatened.  I would point out to the Deputy that the change he suggests might disimprove the employee's situation considerably.  This section is based on continuity of service as contained in the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act.  If we substitute for &ldquo;service&rdquo; this question of &ldquo;contract&rdquo;, which has a very specific meaning in our law, it could be maintained that in the case of change of employer the employment contract has ceased in those circumstances.  The Deputy might appreciate that in his amendment the employee's position might be very seriously endangered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have looked at this matter very carefully and we have borne in mind what Deputy Fitzgerald on Committee Stage had to say about this matter.  We have had other representations from other interests on the same topic.  We have borne all those points in mind and have looked very closely at a suggested weakness in the section.  The factual position is that the subsection <Col N="588" /> as drafted is based on the concept of continuous service with the employer. Section 2 (4), to support the concept of continuous service, stipulates that the rules of continuity of service contained in the First Schedule to the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, which we passed in 1973, shall apply.  Rule 7 of that Schedule provides that where there is a transfer of business of the kind mentioned in the House, then the continuity of service of the employee cannot be broken by that transfer and his previous period of service will count.  We have looked at this matter very closely.  As we see it, the provisions of section 2 (1) (a) should be quite adequate to meet the situation and the danger of mergers, takeovers and so on, whereas we think that substitution to the contract formula would be far less advantageous to the employee.  We share the same concern but we believe that as drafted the section gives greater security to the employee in those situations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's assurance.  We are both concerned to make sure that there is no loophole through which an employee could be exploited.  I believe the number of people who would even contemplate exploiting their employees are few and far between, and may they even get more scarce.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point about the First Schedule to the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, which is referred to in subsection (4).  I have been constantly making the point on Bills pertaining to workers that there is a very big problem here.  On many occasions since I came into this House, and even before I became spokesman for my party, I said that I found it very difficult to understand legislation as it is prepared.  There is a legal interpretation involved and many different interpretations could be put on many sections of any Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation dealing with working conditions and persons in employment generally should be very clear and concise.  As I said previously, recent legislation coming from the Department of Labour is moving in that <Col N="589" /> direction.  Despite that, however, I am not satisfied with the Minister's reply. I take his point about the dangers of a contract and how the interpretation of a contract might be construed by legal people.  Obviously the Minister has looked at this and I thank him. We had a very worthwhile discussion on Committee Stage which obviously informed the Minister's amendments on this Stage.  Because he has obviously looked very seriously at our amendments I do not wish to divide the House on this issue.</P>
    <P>We are both concerned about closing the same door.  I ask him to encourage his officials between now and when this Bill goes through the Seanad, where it will be seriously considered by genuinely concerned people on both sides of the industrial scene, to ensure that each section and each amendment discussed here will be thoroughly researched and looked at. The draftsman might look at this subsection with a view to ensuring that it achieves what I believe it should achieve.  It is very distracting for a Member when reading a Bill to discover he has to get another Bill to check references.  Basically that is no problem for the Members because the other Bills referred to are easily available. But for anybody else&mdash;a trade union official, a worker, a member of that person's family or a small employer&mdash;who wants to look at a Bill, such as the Anti-Discrimination (Unfair Dismissals) Bill, he will be happy if all the regulations are contained in that Bill.</P>
    <P>As I said, I am not entirely happy with that subsection.  It needs to be spelled out clearly that under this Bill the present employer cannot do something that may appear to be possible, but possibly may not be possible, under that subsection.</P>
    <P>I withdraw my amendment and ask the Minister to have another look at it between now and when it comes to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1b:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="590" /> In page 4, subsection (1), lines 15 to 31, to delete paragraph (c) and insert the following new paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(c) An employee in employment which employs less than five persons&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is identical to that submitted on Committee Stage.  Since then, we have had the Protection of Employment Bill, which governs redundancies. In that Bill a minimum number of employees is mentioned. Section 6 of that Bill does not apply until the first group of employees who come under it is at least five in an establishment normally employing more than 20 and fewer than 50 employees. We have yet to come to the Committee Stage of that Bill, although we may be coming to it after this.  I assume that if there are fewer than 20 employees in a firm they are not covered by that Bill.  For that reason I believe there must be a threshold level in this Bill too.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of a small town, city or rural business where there are one or two employees.  If it is established that there has been an unfair dismissal this can cause a very difficult problem both from the employer's and the employee's points of view.  Of course there are two options open&mdash; first, reinstatement and, second, compensation. In the case of an employer with two employees reinstatement could lead to a very difficult working life for both employer and employee, because if a personality clash had led to the unfair dismissal then that would continue.  Then there is the alternative of compensation, but the small em-employer might not be in a position financially to meet the compensation recommended in this legislation. Therefore the employee and the employer have Hobson's choice.  In those circumstances, I am sure the employee would prefer to get compensation and not be compelled to spend his working life in the personality clash situation I referred to.  The employer would probably prefer the same.</P>
    <P>In small firms, small employments, where there are one, two or three <Col N="591" /> employees, whether it be on a farm, in a shop or perhaps in a blacksmith's forge, employees and employers constitute a combined effort, there is friendship and good relations between them and they are probably friends socially as well.  The effect of this legislation might well be to discourage an employer from taking on one or more workers.  All this deserves serious consideration in the interests particularly of employments in rural villages and small towns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There is disagreement between us on this matter. Deputy Fitzgerald is anxious to see that the legislation will not apply in the context of small firms in which the relations are generally good.  There is nothing in the Bill to disrupt friendly relations.  Indeed I hope the provisions of the Bill will enhance good relations as well as guaranteeing fair treatment for employees in the minority of cases.  The Protection of Employment Bill concerns collective employment; this Bill deals with rights of the individual.  The rights of one individual are as important as the collective rights of five or 20.  It would be inconsistent of us to have a law which would lay down certain procedures and that these procedures would not apply in a firm where an individual who may need the law's protection happens to have the ill-luck to be in a small firm of three or fewer workers. Surely such an employee should be able to invoke the law equally with the employee in a larger firm.</P>
      <P>I agree that this law will not be invoked except in few employments, but in the minority of employments where it may be invoked the accident of the size of a worker's firm should not prevent that worker from invoking it.  I have looked at the matter closely but I cannot see that if relations are good in the smaller firms, and the general opinion is that they are, this Bill will not disimprove that already good relationship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that this Bill will not disimprove the relationship.  There is no danger there.  But in my opinion the <Col N="592" /> Bill may cause the employer to be less inclined or to be more reluctant to employ.  I have believed for a long time that there is an over-emphasis in this country on big employment.  State agencies should always encourage the little country furniture factory or the small welding shop which may formerly have been the blacksmith's shop.  Such enterprises should be encouraged and helped to give employment to some of the local people.  I am concerned about the small workshops or sweetshops in Dublin, Cork or in any of our cities and towns.</P>
      <P>I believe that self-employed people form one of the weakest and least protected groups in our society.  They are subject to changes of fortune to a greater extent than many others and they have no organised people to fight for them.  The self-employed person who shows some initiative and enterprise will make progress and take on one or two employees.  This is the ideal situation.  I am fearful that this Bill, while it will not disimprove the relationships that exist, may possibly discourage that self-employed person from employing even one other person.  Many of our big companies started as one-man outfits.  As the enterprise grew, more and more people were employed.  Some of the major Irish companies started in that way, and this is something to be encouraged.  Let us ensure that anything we do here by way of legislation for individual rights will not deter the employer from offering two, three or four jobs which could mean so much to several homes.  This is why I am concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and I are obviously in disagreement on this.  I see and understand his point, but I am not sure that he is right.  We are making good progress on this necessary legislation.  We will have to see how it operates.  I believe we will never see a case such as we are talking about here arising in the type of employment I am concerned with in this amendment.  This is the type of employment where there is loyalty and interest on both sides, an interest in the welfare of the employee and an interest in bringing him or her along as the business grows.  I am worried that this Bill would discourage <Col N="593" /> the entrepreneur from expanding his business.  These people can do much to cure our unemployment ills. I think there is a very good case to be made for the exemption of two or three people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We had lengthy discussion on Committee Stage on the question of secondary <Col N="594" /> school teachers particularly in relation to the length of the probationary periods that could obtain.  I have had consultations with the representative interests concerned and this amendment reduces from two years to one year the duration of probation during which the Bill will not apply. This represents an equitable compromise which, in the circumstances of the consultations I have had, I would ask the House to accept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite what the Minister might say about consultations with anybody, our discussion on Committee Stage contributed largely to another improvement.  In fact our attitude on Committee Stage was one of complete opposition to this section.  The changing of the two years to one year is, in my opinion, a very desirable improvement. One could say that it may not solve the problem for some of the people who have been pressing for shorter periods in certain situations, but I think that the Minister is right. There has to be consistency about this Bill, and the point I made on Committee Stage was that the one-year base should run throughout this Bill as the period of service for everybody.  In this particular case the one year is certainly an improvement but there is unfortunately as yet no positive indication of stipulating one year throughout the entire Bill.  However the improvements so far are welcome, being in line with what we suggested on this side of the House.</P>

      <P>In page 5, line 35, to delete &ldquo;not&rdquo; and in line 41 to add &ldquo;if the dismissal takes place within 12 months of the commencement of such employment or training or within 6 months of the completion of such training&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here I appeal to the Minister to continue  <Col N="595" /> the improvement.  We are totally opposed to section 3 (2) of the Bill.  Subsection (1) has been improved by the amendments we have just passed&mdash;the section is headed: &ldquo;Dismissal during probation or training&rdquo;&mdash;but I simply cannot understand the Minister's attitude on subsection (2) which provides:</P>
    <P>This Act shall not apply in relation to the dismissal of an employee during a period starting with the commencement of the employment when he is undergoing training for the purpose of becoming qualified or registered, as the case may be, as a nurse, pharmacist, health inspector, medical laboratory technician, occupational therapist, physiotherapist, speech therapist, radiographer or social worker.</P>
    <P>The next section deals with apprenticeship and in that section there appears exactly what I am looking for in this amendment.  I do not believe subsection (2) in its present form should constitute any part of this Bill. The Minister must accept this amendment. The wording is taken from section 4 which deals, as I have said, with apprentices.  These people are just as entitled to safeguards as are other apprentices.  In a later section the Minister has specific power to extend the list if necessary.</P>
    <P>Now the nursing profession is a noble and dedicated profession.  We have all had experience either personally or through relatives and friends of the dedication of this profession. That is why I single out the profession, but the other professions listed are equally important and equally entitled to safeguards.  There is a three-year course for nurses with a possible further year in maternity and psychiatry before becoming qualified. The people listed&mdash;nurses, pharmacists, health inspectors, medical laboratory technicians, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, speech therapists, radiographer and social worker&mdash;are becoming more and more important in our society because of the extension of our health services. In the case of nurses I fully appreciate a problem arises at the end of training, <Col N="596" /> because 80 nurses may be trained and there may be vacancies for only 30.  I am seeking to have the position of all those listed safeguarded by bringing them within the provision dealing with 12 months' continuous service and within six months of the completion of such training.  In other words, once they have completed 12 months of their training they cannot be unfairly dismissed and when they are trained and taken on in hospital employment they cannot be dismissed unfairly after six months.  The reason I am suggesting six months is that perhaps a hospital may have a temporary post for a nurse while she is seeking alternative employment and they may give that nurse the position for three, four or five months while she is seeking work elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the Minister to accept this amendment.  If we are to have fair play in this Bill it must be included.  When the Minister spoke against another amendment I put down he referred to the fact that the rights of the individual must be maintained. That remains the case whether the individual is in training or is trained.  We must be consistent in this.  Subsection (1) has been amended already and we are morally bound to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to look at this subsection closely.  As I explained on Committee Stage, it relates to the responsibility of another Department, the Department of Health. We are not talking so much about the normal employment; we are talking about the training of personnel.  The Department of Health are basing their opinion on that of the relevant hospital training authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case I understand that the training of the personnel involved requires specific examinations and tests which must be passed if they are to progress further.  These examinations are set to standards set by professional bodies and an element in the training of these people includes standards of professional conduct in the course of their training and their performance throughout their entire working hours in the training centres <Col N="597" /> of the hospitals.  Therefore bringing these trainees within the Bill would be to substitute the judgement of an industrial tribunal in relation to what are considered to be necessary professional standards.</P>
    <P>In this matter I must accept the advice of bodies specifically charged with these responsibilities and for this reason the section is drafted as it is. The authorities and the people concerned with training are not prepared to change their requirements in the training of paramedical personnel and, quite honestly, that is why we cannot extend the section as suggested by the Deputy.  He will appreciate that here we are dealing with training in a particularly delicate area and we must have regard to what the professional bodies consider necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is a little confused about the Bill.  It is an unfair dismissals Bill; in other words, if there are grounds for a fair dismissal the terms of the Bill will not apply.  The Minister referred to the examinations of nurses and other paramedical people.  Assuming that the individual concerned fails to reach the required standard in the examination, there is no way he or she can come under the terms of this Bill. The Minister also referred to a code of conduct.  Again, if there is something wrong there it does not come under this Bill.</P>
      <P>We have a later section which specifies what may be regarded as a fair dismissal, and the conduct of the employee is included.  If there is a serious misdemeanour on the part of an employee or serious misconduct, the Bill will not apply.  However, it is absolutely unfair to say that people in training cannot come under the terms of a Bill dealing with unfair dismissal, particularly in view of the fact that an apprentice after six months is covered by the Bill, and this is quite right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is a vital one.  The section as drafted originally excluded and discriminated against the teaching profession and probationary teachers. At least we have improved that position substantially and in all fairness <Col N="598" /> we must do the same with regard to this subsection.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the reality of the situation.  Take the case of a nurse. She can be the subject of an unfair dismissal after two years and ten months of her training and she has no redress under this Bill.  There is a glaring omission in this measure if we exclude these people.  I am not talking about studies or courses.  In the Bill there is reference to the dismissal of an employee during a period starting with the commencement of employment when the person concerned is undergoing training.  We are talking about training on the job, whether in the nursing profession, in the laboratory or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>This amendment must be accepted and I urge the Minister to do so.  The section will be greatly improved as a result.  We had a very good debate on Committee Stage, and we see the result of that debate in many of the amendments introduced by the Minister. I congratulate him on that because it is important that we have cooperation in this House.  It will be unpardonable of him not to accept the amendment.  A period of 12 months must be inserted for the nurse, the laboratory technician and the other paramedical personnel.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4b:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 45, to delete &ldquo;1 month&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;6 months&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a matter that I hoped the Minister might look at from a humane point of view since Committee Stage. This amendment to section 4 proposes that the period for apprenticeship after the completion of training should be six months instead of one month. When I was making my case on the last section I referred to section 4 and to the necessity for there being a specific time or period before an apprentice, during or after training, came within the jurisdiction of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The reason for the amendment is a very good, humane one, that is, not to harm the apprentice in any way.  I do not think it will apply in the major companies, unfortunately, where there are more impersonal relations.  In a major State or public company what normally happens is that once an apprentice completes his final year's apprenticeship he is a number in the book or on the card and that ends his training.  If there is a vacancy for him in the company he is kept on but if not his employment is terminated.</P>
      <P>This is not the case in smaller industry or business, and happily so. Let us in this legislation encourage that situation.  Take the case of John Murphy who has an engineering works and takes on two apprentices.  When they have finished their time and qualified he has a job for one but not for the other.  Being a humane employer and having a good relationship with his staff and apprentices, John Murphy calls the second apprentice and says &ldquo;Unfortunately I have no employment for you.  Now that you are qualified you will have to seek a job elsewhere.&rdquo; However, having a social conscience, John Murphy could suggest to that apprentice that he continue in employment for three or four months while he is seeking employment, but he will not do it because if the apprentice is kept longer than one month then he comes within the terms of the Unfair Dismissals Bill.  A longer period should be provided in the Bill.  This would give humane employers like John Murphy&mdash;and thank God we have quite a number of them &mdash;the opportunity of being fair and helpful to an apprentice who has given the company good service.</P>

        <i>Cavan</i>): I understand from Bord Fáilte that the delay in the publication of the report for 1975 was due to the fact that the accounts, which are published jointly <Col N="603" /> with the report, were for the first time processed by computer.  Some unexpected initial difficulties were encountered and these delayed the completion of the accounts.

They are probably slightly higher this year than in other <Col N="609" /> years.  Some of the reasons for that is that there was a new contractor and a computerised system was used.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs have offered to communicate with any subscribers who have been omitted and to facilitate them, by informing their regular callers of the omission.</P>

      <P>There are 199 courses of this type being conducted in the current session.  A science technician <Col N="614" /> course at Kevin Street College of Technology is included in the total indicated.  This course aims at providing the skills necessary so that the trainees on completion can seek jobs as laboratory technicians.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be a little bit of confusion about the intention of these courses.  They are not necessarily part of the structures of formal education in the narrow sense but it is intended, in the indication by the EEC, that the money should be used to provide retraining for people who have become redundant in other spheres. There is a recommendation that there should be a gap between leaving school and taking up one of these courses, but they are not courses with a certain end object in view.  They are retraining. There is, of course, an end object in view of laboratory technicians but most of those receiving these courses are free to go on and pursue normal courses with certification at the end. These are not in themselves certification courses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept that the raising of the general level of technician knowledge is desirable, would the Minister not be concerned if there was a general belief among people, particularly students concerned in these courses, that they are purely stop-gap courses, ways for using up this money without any proper educational objective and without any future?</P>

      <P>The community school in Gweedore, County Donegal, has been in operation since September, 1973, in the two existing school buildings which are adequate to cater for present enrolments.  Planning for a new building was completed on the basis of the building being provided on the Ard Scoil Mhuire site.

The Donegal County Council and the board of management said that this was not satisfactory because the site was too restricted and they wanted to establish this school on a new site which had <Col N="616" /> not been acquired.

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the present situation on the islands where employment is unobtainable and where families may be quite large?  Will recipients of unemployment assistance with eight children or more be debarred from receiving any grant in respect of any of their children even under the extended, or enlarged, or improved income limits?

      <P>In all sanity how can it possibly be regarded as a fair and equitable approach that a person with eight or more children who is dependent solely on social welfare payments should find he is entitled to no grant whatsoever for his children because he has so many children?

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The charges preferred in the case referred to by the Deputy did not include rape or attempted rape.  To answer the question, the position is that generally mandatory minimum penalties are not prescribed and, indeed, I do not consider that it would be beneficial to do so.  I have no reason to think there would be any advantage to be gained in providing a mandatory minimum penalty in relation to the offence of rape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that there is great disquiet in Kildare and in the entire country at the extreme clemency being shown by the courts to people who are convicted of rape?  Does he not feel there is a need for a direction to those people whose duty it is to make the punishment fit the crime?  Would he further agree that in this case justice was seen to be undone and the decision is likely to bring the structures of justice into disrepute?  Does he not feel he has a duty to take action in cases like this to restore the confidence of the public in the framework of justice?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand it would be improper for me to comment on any particular case.  It would be equally improper for me to do what the Deputy suggests, that is, give a direction to the courts.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy was disallowed on his disability benefit claim from 19th July, 1976 following an examination by a medical referee on 7th July, 1976 who stated that he was capable of work.  The person appealed against the disallowance and on 17th August, 1976 he was again examined by a different medical referee who also stated that he was capable of work.  An oral hearing of the appeal at which the appellant attended took place on 8th December, 1976.  The appeals officer upheld the decision disallowing the claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As medical certificates continued to be submitted following the issue of the appeals officer's decision a further medical referee examination took place on 17th February and the opinion <Col N="624" /> again was that the claimant was capable of work.</P>
    <P>Where, in the opinion of the medical adviser to my Department, or at the request of an appeals officer, specialist medical opinion is required in relation to a particular claimant, arrangements are made for such opinion by appropriate independent specialists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that this man is awaiting attention by a specialist and that this case is typical of many other cases in which an ordinary physician is not in a position to diagnose his problem really and that it is actually a case where the man wishes to go back to work in a factory where he has worked all his life but his doctor, under no circumstances will permit him to go back owing to the nature of his disease? Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the last physician to examine him would be in a position to know that he was awaiting attention by a specialist?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the position is that there were three separate examinations by medically qualified officers of the Department and they claimed that in their professional opinion this man was capable of work.  There is no way in which this man can be paid in the face of that evidence and on the acceptance of that evidence by an appeals officer.  Where considered appropriate by the medical adviser, or by the appeals officer, specialist opinion can be made available.  The Deputy said the man is awaiting specialist <Col N="625" /> treatment.  There is no evidence of that before the Department.

      <P>In view of the fact that this information is not available to the Minister or to the Department of Defence how is it proposed to have arrests of EEC boats carried out?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrest of a boat is based on observation and identification of a boat.  Each boat, according to international marine law, carries a number and carries identification not only of its name but of its home port.  I would think that the Naval Service would make the arrest in that manner.  I have some further information that might be of use to the Deputy.  The data required is not available at present but it is likely that it will become so in due course through sightings and boardings by the Naval Service in the 200-mile zone when the proposed strengthening of the Naval Service and the Air Corps takes place. If a licensing system is adopted for EEC vessels, as envisaged by the Commission, in the long term this would make the information readily available. We have some details of the number and size of French vessels operating in our waters as given to us by the French authorities: under 85 feet, 213; 85-125 feet, 146; over 125 feet, 97; total, 456. It is not clear at present whether these are registered or overall lengths.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">

      <P>Is the Minister now telling the House that if our naval boats go out to arrest any of these EEC boats they will be just using guess work, that they have no positive information to indicate the size of the EEC boats fishing our waters?</P>

      <P>In view of his original proposal on conservation can the Minister say how he intended or if he still intends to implement this proposal when obviously it would depend on the making available of the necessary information by those he was proposing to arrest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not so accept. The Naval Service go out as they did last year and the year before.  They identify a boat and board it.  They ask to see its papers.  They see them and if they wish they can measure the boat. There is no reason at all why the Naval Service cannot do their job.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister trying to bluff the House?  Is he not aware that there was no question of the size at that time?  Is he not aware that it was just a question of a foreign boat fishing within the 12-mile limit? Irrespective of length it could then be arrested and taken in by the patrol boat.  Is the Minister now trying to bluff the House with this kind of shilly-shallying information?</P>

      <P>A total of 58 licences have been issued by the EEC in respect of vessels from the USSR, Poland and the German Democratic Republic authorising them to fish for limited quantities of fish within the 200-mile zones of member states generally up to 31st March, 1977.  The quotas are related to specified areas as designated by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, parts of which come within the Irish fishery limits but not closer than 50 miles from our coasts.</P>
      <P>As the information requested by the Deputy in relation to the licensed vessels is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate it with the Official Report. Following is the statement:</P>
      <P Just="Center">Vessels licensed to fish in the waters of the Member States of the EEC until 31 March, 1977</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Gallagher</b> asked the Minister for Fisheries the reply, if any, the Government have given to the request of the Commission of the European Communities to postpone unilateral conservation measures until 15th March; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>The Government have agreed to postpone until the 15th of this month the measures set out in the orders made by me on 16th February last pending consideration of new proposals for the conservation and management of fishery resources in Irish waters to be put forward by the EEC Commission.  Details of these proposals are awaited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it from the Minister's reply that no new EEC <Col N="631" /> proposals are available to the Government at this time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>At this time that is so.  The meeting in Brussels on Monday was between the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, myself and officials and Mr. Gundelach and officials.  Mr. Gundelach indicated to us that he would endeavour to get proposals from the Commission which he would send to us as agreed proposals which we could consider.  At that time, last Monday, there were no such proposals available to us.  I was permitted by the Government to indicate to Mr. Gundelach that we would give him the 14 days postponement and await the production of his proposals.  We are still waiting for these proposals at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that no positive proposals were available from the EEC, and in the light of our experience in dealing with the EEC on fisheries, would the Minister accept that it was unwise of him to change his original decision in relation to unilateral action on the fishing industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not so admit.  The business of this Government and of the nation with the EEC is extremely large and important. When somebody of the stature and responsibility of Mr. Gundelach indicates to a Government, as he did by letter, that he is endeavouring to get the Commission to agree proposals to put to us and is asking for a short postponement of 14 days, the Government are wise to agree to that postponement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister has now disclosed that all Mr. Gundelach said was that he would endeavour to get proposals from the Commission, is it not quite clear that the Minister has gone back on his original position?  Was the Minister aware when he made his original proposals in regard to unilateral action on conservation that there were matters of major interest concerning Ireland's involvement in <Col N="632" /> the Community?  Since he made those proposals, what has happened to make him climb down now when the Commissioner has only told him he will endeavour to have proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that there was any climb down.  This is merely a matter of wise business dealing.  The situation is that Mr. Gundelach, having received protests from member states such as France, Germany and Holland in respect of our unilateral proposals, is endeavouring to get agreement with the Commission which will mean that he can put proposals to us which at least would be as good as or better than the result of the unilateral decision.  We do not know if they will be or not.  We have not that knowledge until we get the proposals, and we are still awaiting those proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs did not communicate with Mr. Gundelach on Monday and Mr. Gundelach did not communicate with him.  What happened was that when we left the meeting in Brussels the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs telephoned his Minister&mdash;Mr. Dillon the Ambassador also rang him&mdash;to indicate what had transpired.  Mr. Gundelach did not correspond with the Minister for Foreign Affairs nor did the Minister correspond with Mr. Gundelach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister comment on the statement attributed <Col N="633" /> to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that what the Commission would be likely to propose would probably be better in the nation's interest than what the Minister was proposing in this House some weeks ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>All that happened was that a newsman asked a question of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Minister indicated that a postponement was justified&mdash;I have his letter here which says so&mdash;as long as there was a possibility of a solution emerging.  From that there grew up all kinds of press speculation for which the Minister for Foreign Affairs, nor the Government nor I are responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister for Foreign Affairs gave any view to any pressman or anybody else, is it true that he was not in communication with the Minister who is present in this House and that any views offered to a pressman were his own spontaneous views, which were a very adverse comment on the Minister for Fisheries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not, nor will I accept that my colleague created any embarrassment for me.  All that happened was that my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, received telephone calls from his Parliamentary Secretary and his Ambassador indicating the result of the meeting.  Somebody in the Press asked him a question and in the most natural way he indicated that a postponement was justified so long as there was a possibility of a solution.  From that we have all the press speculation imaginable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We will return to that but the other one is a matter of serious national importance.  Anybody who decides otherwise is not acting in the best interests of the country or the people.  I repeat again for the benefit of the House the reasons why I believe the Minister should accept this amendment in the case of the apprentice.  Many of us have had the opportunity of dealing with apprentices, helping them and encouraging them during their period of training and qualification.  We know that it has been a practice in many small businesses, industries and commercial firms over the years that when an apprentice qualifies and if he or she has not immediate employment, assuming that person has not a job in the company where the apprenticeship was served, in many cases the owner or the manager of that concern will say to that apprentice &ldquo;You work on for a few months until you get alternative employment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 4 specifically states that this Act shall not apply in relation to the dismissal of a person who is or was employed under a statutory apprenticeship if the dismissal takes place within six months after the commencement of the apprenticeship or within one month after the completion of the apprenticeship.  What advantage is it to any apprentice or to any company to have this one month in the Bill? If the Minister can point out to me what the advantages are in having such a qualification in a section I will try to understand the case he makes.  Until he does I submit there is no way in which that period should be set at one month.  That company or firm may decide that that young person can have three, four or five months until he succeeds in getting alternative employment.  This will be to the benefit of the person concerned and also to the benefit of the State because he will not have to claim State help.  The morale of the person concerned will not be damaged and he will not have to experience an unnecessary period of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning I referred to the fact that in larger companies the <Col N="644" /> apprentice is often just a number and unless he is absorbed into the permanent work force when he is qualified the termination of his apprenticeship automatically spells the end of his employment.  This may not happen with the smaller employer and we should remember that the majority of employers are in that category.  In undertakings employing less than 200 persons there is a much closer human contact and the apprentice has the opportunity of becoming known to the staff and management.  I have seen on occasions where young apprentices were given the opportunity of continuing in employment until they got alternative jobs elsewhere.  Why should we introduce legislation that will alter that position, that will not benefit the person concerned, the employer or the State from the social and material point of view?</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand why the Minister has insisted on retaining the period of one month when the obvious thing to do is extend it.  I appreciate the good intentions on both sides of this House to have a Bill that is as beneficial as possible but I think we should take advantage of the experience gained in other countries in this kind of legislation.  I have always said that we should not follow rigidly on legislation introduced in Britain; we should not accept that they have all the knowledge but neither should we disregard the experience gained by them.  There have been unfair decisions made in certain cases simply because there were weaknesses in the legislation.  I submit that in this case there is a glaring weakness that should be remedied.</P>
    <P>The Minister may argue that if we allow for six months an apprentice will not come under the terms of this Bill for the first six months after his training period if he continues in the same employment.  That may be so but there should not be any fear about this.  If an apprentice has qualified over a number of years and if he is found satisfactory to the extent that he is taken into permanent employment, both he and the employer will be quite happy.  The chances are that there will not be an unfair dismissal in such a <Col N="645" /> case but, on the other hand, another person may suffer because of the provisions in this Bill.  An employer will not be able to retain an apprentice at his discretion, perhaps to keep him in employment while he is looking for alternative work elsewhere, unless he is satisfied he has permanent employment for him.  He will not be able to dismiss the apprentice after that month and the fear that he may be caught by the provisions of this Bill will prevent him from keeping the apprentice in employment.</P>
    <P>This amendment is important.  It will improve the Bill considerably and I would ask the Minister to accept it. It will benefit the apprentice, the employer and the State.  It will prevent the young person from having to apply for social welfare or other State assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister and many other Deputies have a deep interest in this matter.  I would ask the Minister to listen to the plea of Deputy Fitzgerald on this matter. There are sufficient irritants in industrial and human relations on the factory floor without adding to them. A well-intentioned employer may wish to continue the employment of an apprentice but may not be able to offer him long-term employment.  I will instance the case where a contract has to be finished but where the employer is not quite sure how long he can afford to retain the apprentice. In these days of economic anxiety the employer may not want to risk keeping on the apprentice.  This may solve his problems but it does not solve the problems of the young person concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald mentioned the fact that in comparison with British firms most of our businesses are small. Therefore, there is more of a community feeling in a factory here than in the more industrialised countries. There is an interest in apprentices and we do not want to see any more young people on the unemployment list.  The Minister should accept this amendment in the interest of apprentices, employers and industrial relations.  It could be said that the cost would be greater if the amendment was accepted. <Col N="646" /> I understand Deputy Fitzgerald's anxiety to have the amendment accepted.  The acceptance of the amendment would be appreciated by the trade unions because an apprentice is bound to be a member of some trade union.  The awful thing about the factory floor is that an apprentice may become a mere number on a time clock card.  This small amendment would add dignity to apprenticeships. By accepting the amendment the Minister would add to the value of the Bill and show that the Government are concerned with the future of apprentices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to ensure that employers train as many apprentices as possible.  The one month exclusion period is in line with policy in other forms of protective legislation whereby we give employers an incentive to take on more apprentices than their essential interests would require. After my discussions with them on this aspect, the employers and unions represented on the council of the training authority, AnCO, may raise this question within the council.  If agreement is reached at that level on any change in the exclusion period set down in the section, I will take that into consideration in reviewing the future progress of the Bill.  At present the Deputy can take it that the reason for the one-month exclusion period is to assist in ensuring that we have a larger number of apprentices in training than the individual interests of the concerns might require.  It is in the best interests of apprentices that the section should stand.  This amendment is not necessarily in the interests of apprentices because it extends the period when a claim under the Bill would not be allowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The acceptance of the amendment would not necessarily be in the interests of apprentices because it extends the period when a claim would not be allowed.  One version of the amendment is that it would favour employers in extending the exclusion period when unfair dismissals claims cannot be made.  The main problem <Col N="647" /> is that the amendment would act as a disincentive to employers to train more apprentices.  If both employers and unions decide that there should be revision of the exclusion periods I will act on their advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot follow the Minister's argument.  The Minister is convinced that my argument is correct. I do not agree with the Minister that extending the period of exclusion would be of advantage to employers. As the Bill stands, the employer will keep the apprentice for only one month.  In the cases to which I am referring it is probably a knowledge of the apprentice and of his family that influences the employer to retain him while he is seeking alternative employment. On the other hand, the argument that it is unfair in regard to the intake of apprentices is not correct.  Young apprentices will still be employed. What does happen is that a qualified person continues in employment for a period at the pleasure of the employer. Apprentices are the only people who will gain by acceptance of the amendment. The Minister made another point in regard to the council of AnCO deciding that the exclusion period should be changed.  It would be wrong to concede our rights as legislators.  We should use our experience and knowledge to recommend what we believe to be the best type of legislation.  By all means consult these people, particularly on certain aspects of the Bill, but we must remember that the apprentice who will suffer is the apprentice whose employer is not represented by organisations. He is the employer who values his employees.  Why should we introduce exclusions that would be harmful to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to reconsider this amendment.  We have had a very reasonable debate on this Bill. This is important and unique legislation which has aroused considerable interest among all sectors of industrial society.  The proof of this is that it is difficult to get copies of the debate on some of the dates on which this Bill took place in the House.  I would prefer if we decided here rather than in the Seanad or anywhere else what <Col N="648" /> improvements should be made to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I submit there is no valid argument that can be made against my amendment. From long experience of this type of situation I can say it can only be of advantage to one group of people and that is the qualified apprentices who are not being retained in their employment.  It will not in any way hinder or harm the intake of apprentices on the other side, as the Minister said.  The outgoing apprentices would not be doing the type of work that would normally be done by the one or more apprentices coming into the firm. It is fine for the Minister to say he would change the provision if necessary. I believe the change is necessary even before the Bill becomes law.  No employer will gain from this.  The gain will be made by the apprentice and also by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the Minister's point that the amendment would be extending the period of exclusion, but I want to come back to it.  It is true that the apprentices kept on could be excluded for a period of six months rather than one.  However under section 3 of the Bill, with which we dealt this morning, a nurse has no protection whatever under this Bill during her four years of training and, having completed her four years' training, she then has to do a further year before she comes under the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister reconcile that situation with his argument?  The only apprentice about whom the Minister is concerned is the one who will be retained in employment after qualifying. I agree that there is a weakness in regard to that person's situation, but I believe there is no reason for concern in that regard.  If an apprentice has served a term of four or five years' apprenticeship satisfactorily in a firm and if he is being retained, it is obvious that his employer is satisfied with him and that he is satisfied with his employer.  Even if he continues for six months outside the terms of this Bill there is no problem there, because it is most unlikely that, if a company agree that the person is suitable to be retained in employment, he would lose the benefit of this Bill during that period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> Even if I did concede there was a problem there, the problem on the other side is much more serious.  Take the case of a town garage that takes on one, two or three apprentices.  The employer concerned is most unlikely to retain two or three per year in permanent employment.  Nevertheless, in how many of those town garages in our constituencies do we see apprentices being kept on for three, four or five months because these young men and their families are known to the local proprietor and because he wants to give them an opportunity of working while they are seeking employment elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Once this Bill becomes law that practice will stop.  When the month expires the employment of the apprentice who is not being kept on will be terminated.  Not alone would this amendment help apprentices but it would also help the revenue in that for four or five months these apprentices would be employed and making a contribution by way of stamp and <Col N="650" /> tax rather than drawing social welfare benefit while they are seeking a job. Even at this stage I would ask the Minister, in the interest of apprentices, in the interest of the people generally and in the interest of the Bill, to accept the amendment.  The benefits to be derived far outweigh any drawbacks on the other side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that the provision here is similar to that in the Redundancy Payments Act. We have no proposals or representations that that should be altered.  It would introduce unnecessary confusion if there were to be different periods here from those in the Redundancy Payments Act.  I believe that in the one-month period the employer has sufficient time to make up his mind whether to retain the person or not and that therefore there is no need to lengthen the exemption period.</P>

      <P>I welcome these amendments.  They are in line with the amendments suggested to the Minister on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I thank the Minister for accepting the submissions made from this side of the House at that time. I read the debate on the Equal Pay Bill, 1974, and I noted that the Minister refused to accept the word &ldquo;re-instatement&rdquo; in that Bill.  That surprised me because I thought in that Bill that was the word that should have been used.  Reinstatement gives a far different interpretation.  It means a person returning to the job with the same status under the same conditions.  &ldquo;Re-engagement&rdquo; seems to imply a new contract.  In relation to the amendment No. 9 we must claim credit for this side of the House.  I had an amendment on the Committee Stage which may not have met all the requirements that were obviously needed to improve the section.  The section is now clarified more satisfactorily.  I support amendments Nos. 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.</P>

      <P>I am not 100 per cent satisfied.  The individual rights of a person are catered for and deservedly so.  For that reason I have no objection to the amendment.  I was anxious to know specifically from the Minister why he decided to change. I and my party had an open mind on the position and we considered possible amendments.  I still am not 100 per cent sure.  However, possibly the right of the individual is underlying and because of that it is possibly necessary to have the amendment.  I am not going to oppose the amendment. It can be agreed.  I understand there is a doubt in the Minister's mind. If he has any reservations as the Bill goes through the Seanad we can have a further look at it from both sides of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13 (a):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 8, subsection (4) (a), line 5, after &ldquo;or qualifications&rdquo; to insert <Col N="656" />&ldquo;required by the employer at the commencement of the employment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We now come to a section on which we had quite a bit of debate on Committee Stage in regard to type of conduct and so on.  This amendment refers to the qualifications.  It is an effort to direct the Minister's attention to the possibility of tying qualifications to those that existed at the commencement of the employment.  Right through this Bill we are concerned about encouraging good relations between employer and employee.  The vast majority of our employers will never be involved in this legislation and it will rarely have to be used against them.  There may be a few people who will try to get around any legislation that might be introduced by this or&mdash;in the not-too-distant future &mdash;by the next Minister from this side of the House.  For that reason I ask the Minister if he has considered the necessity of tying down the competence or qualifications on the basis of assuming an employer does try to play around with the qualifications of the person from the time of initial recruitment to when the dismissal takes place &mdash;in other words, exploiting certain changes in the qualifications necessary to do a job.  This is not beyond the bounds of possibility.  If you take a company who are not doing so well or are short-staffed and not financially equipped to increase their staff, greater burdens may fall on a person, different responsibilities or different chores may be allotted to him from what he was originally employed to do.  It should be spelled out clearly that there should be no interference with qualifications from the time of the original employment to the time of dismissal&mdash;for example, to say that a man who had been with a company ten or 15 years was not qualified to do a new job allotted to him maybe six or eight months before.  That is the only reason for this amendment.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We did, both now and previously, consider this question. The main problem is, as I have said on Committee Stage, that the addition of the suggested qualification recommended in this amendment to the concepts <Col N="657" /> of capability, competence and qualification could give rise to a considerable degree of confusion about the meaning of the provision.  Accepting that in this provision we cannot be excessively specific because we rely a great deal on the good sense of the tribunal, I would ask the Deputy to consider whether his case is assisted by the amendment suggested by him. It is hard to see how the amendment will give greater relevance to the section when you consider the existing reference in the paragraph to the capability, and so on, of the employee for performing work of the kind which he was employed by the employer to do.  There is no great division between us here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not make a big issue of this if the Minister is absolutely happy with it.  I accept the point he made about the employee's capability for performing work which he was employed by the employer to do.  There may be people who would like to stretch the interpretation of that.  If the Minister is satisfied with the paragraph I am prepared to withdraw the amendment,</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13b:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (4) (b), line 8, after &ldquo;conduct of employee&rdquo; to add &ldquo;which results in damage to the business or is detrimental to the business of the employer or to the performance of the employee in the execution of his duties&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This paragraph refers to the conduct of the employee.  I did not press the Minister hard on the previous amendment but I want to impress on him that in this paragraph the words &ldquo;the conduct of the employee&rdquo; appear to me to be very wide and vague.  I appreciate that the phrase is qualified in many ways in this Bill.  Subsection (4) provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of this section, the dismissal of an employee shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Act, not to be an unfair dismissal, if it results wholly <Col N="658" /> or mainly from one or more of the following...</P>
    <P>(b) the conduct of the employee...</P>
    <P>I suggest that should be modified to read &ldquo;the conduct of the employee which results in damage to the business or is detrimental to the business of the employer or to the performance of the employee in the execution of his duties.&rdquo; The phrase &ldquo;the conduct of the employee&rdquo; could refer to his conduct on a Sunday afternoon.  He may be playing a game of football or a hurling match, or he may be attending a game, and he may have a few drinks and become involved in a brawl with no effect on his work the following day.  We have indications of people participating in affairs outside their normal work being suspended indefinitely.  Perhaps this refers to subversive activities at times.  If people pay the penalty and are then not reinstated in their jobs that is unfair.  For that reason the conduct should be related to conduct harmful to the employer or the employee in the execution of his duties.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment and relate the conduct directly to the employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The tribunal which will be adjudicating will be forming their opinion and judgment in the employment context.  The unfair dismissal, if it is proved, will have taken place in the course of duties connected with the employment.  The Deputy made the point that the phrase &ldquo;the conduct of the employee&rdquo; is too broad, but we must remember it is limited by the exercise of the powers given to the tribunal. We are talking in an industrial relations context and the conduct of the employee has a relatively narrow application in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is our business here to make amendments and to change legislation but a good deal of the legislation which comes before us has been scrutinised in consultation with employers and unions.  Part of the difficulty in dealing with legislation of this character is that both sides may have conflicting viewpoints on what is advisable.  In those <Col N="659" /> circumstances one must make a judgment which is a compromise between two conflicting points of view.  It is noteworthy that the union side and the employer side sought no further changes in this definition.  Both sides were relatively satisfied with the words &ldquo;the conduct of the employee&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In a legal sense it could be capable of many interpretations but not in the context of industrial relation and, with the safety valve of the tribunal, I do not think it is susceptible to wild interpretations. Neither of the social partners was unhappy with the provision as drafted.  While I take the Deputy's point, I think it is covered substantially by the &ldquo;the conduct of the employee&rdquo; formula in the context of the tribunal operating and taking into account that all of this obviously relates to the employment nexus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems a broad phrase and I would prefer to see it related specifically to employment.  We in this House know what it means.  The trade unions and the employers' organisations know what it means.  For the purposes of the Bill I feel it should be qualified but, if the Minister says it is not necessary, I am prepared to accept that and ask him to keep an eye on it as it goes through the House and the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13c:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (4), between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following new paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) the employee being absent from work without explanation for 12 consecutive weeks&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister investigated this situation? When I first heard this referred to I regarded it as a very unusual occurrence, but it was drawn to my attention that, in two instances, I think, when some coal mines were closing down, people who were farming in the hills or the mountains were still on the companies' books.  They had not communicated with the companies, or turned up for work for a long period, or sent in a certificate of illness, or had any other <Col N="660" /> contact with the company, but turned up for redundancy payments.  I raised this matter on Committee Stage to prevent a similar situation arising.</P>
    <P>It has been said that you could have an employer who would exploit an employee and you could also have the reverse situation.  I should not like to see any employee exploit an employer in that situation.  I merely want to ask the Minister if he did investigate the points I made, and if he felt that because of the experience at that time it was necessary to close any possible loophole that may have been opened in a similar way under this Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be possible, obviously, as regards the matter I spoke about on the previous amendment, to get agreement with the two sides of industry on a formula that both would accept there.  The Deputy will agree that there would be a definite conflict of opinion on what should be there under that section. I cannot honestly say to the Deputy that there is unanimity between the two sides that one would consult in legislation of this kind; it is one of those cases where one must make a judgment.  I believe that in all circumstances the conduct of an employee could be taken to cover this eventuality and I stress &ldquo;could&rdquo; because it will be the tribunal that will be examining the matter and we must allow them some flexibility.  By putting this section in here we would be ruling off an area of discretion to the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be particular circumstances that would excuse what otherwise appears to be an unpardonable breach.  We may not be able to conceive them now, but I think the conduct of an employee could be taken into account in such circumstances where there were no adequate reasons forthcoming and action could be taken by the tribunal under that heading, where the blame or the culpability lay on the employee.  It is an area in which I think we should avoid being over specific.  There are many headings or criteria of unfair dismissals, many more than are set down here but they would all suffer the disadvantage of being over specific and I suggest that <Col N="661" /> the Deputy's case is best met by the rather more general headings set down here when, after all, depending on each case, the tribunal can exercise discretion within the headings set out.</P>

      <P>This matter has been previously discussed in the House and it has also been raised by other representative interests.  My intention in these amendments is to provide for reinstatement as a form of redress which may be awarded by the adjudicating body under the Bill in addition to re-engagement or financial compensation.  As we noted on Committee Stage there is a slight difference between the terms; one is more legally exact than the other.  I made the point in Committee that the term we used here in drafting before this amendment, was one that would cover both eventualities.  This was the advice available to me.  But if there was any doubt there is nothing to be lost by including the two.</P>

      <P>19.  &mdash;Where an employee is reinstated or re-engaged by an employer in pursuance of a determination or order under this Act in relation to the dismissal of the employee by the employer, any payments made under the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 and 1973, in relation to the dismissal shall be repaid by the person to whom they were made to the person by whom they were made and may be recovered by the latter from the former as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction and any moneys due and owing to any person under those Acts in relation to the dismissal shall cease to be due or owing.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had an extensive discussion on this point on Committee Stage.  We had some consequential amendments already discussed which we have accepted.  This amendment also arises from the strengthening of the situation in the Bill in regard to the re-instatement and re-engagement and the clarification of both already referred to.  Section 16 provides that unfair selection for redundancy will constitute unfair dismissal under the Bill.  It is conceivable that an employee who has already been paid redundancy money could later be awarded reinstatement or re-engagement <Col N="663" /> on an unfair dismissal claim based on unfair selection for redundancy.  I, and both the unions and employers that I consulted on this matter, agree that it is reasonable in these circumstances that the redundancy payments should be refunded and that is the point behind the amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;20.  &mdash;The First Schedule to the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, is hereby amended by the substitution of the following paragraphs for paragraphs 5 and 7:</P>

      <P>Yes, precisely. Again, this was a matter discussed on Committee Stage, the position of the individual in merger and take-over situations, and in order to make it absolutely clear that in all such circumstances continuity of employment is preserved I felt we should take the opportunity of this amendment to <Col N="664" /> further amend the continuity rules in addition to the changes already incorporated in section 19.  The effect of this amendment is to ensure that continuity is preserved even if only part of a business is transferred from one employer to another.  This is a change that reflects a previous change of a similar sort in dealing with like situations in the redundancy legislation some years ago to cater for this situation where there may not be a total take-over but in which one particular section moves between one employment and another.  This amendment covers that position.</P>

      <P>We discussed this matter on Committee Stage.  Deputy Fitzgerald and others referred to the actual title and I indicated that I had been thinking along similar lines&mdash;if it is not heresy to say that Deputy Fitzgerald and I occasionally think along similar lines. What was involved here was the title of the Bill. We have had a series of Bills in which the general description of &ldquo;anti-discrimination&rdquo; was used. In practice this Bill has become known as the Unfair Dismissals Bill and there does not seem to be any point in logic why we should continue the general title when the specific purpose of the legislation is to deal with unfair dismissals. I therefore suggest that this be called the Unfair Dismissals Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is expected of an Opposition spokesman to make comments on a Bill that has created widespread interest.  Since I became spokesman for my party I have never had so many submissions from so many interested groups.  This is good because it shows an interest in a much-needed Bill, a Bill which we hope will contribute to better human and industrial relations between the employer and the employee.</P>
      <P>Fears were expressed about the harmful effects so many anti-discrimination Bills might have at a time of high unemployment.  Bills of this nature should and must be introduced.  Because of worth-while discussions from both sides on Committee Stage there have been a number of changes since this Bill was introduced and I am satisfied this is a much better Bill, although there is still room for improvement.</P>
      <P>I am sure Senators will go through the sections in detail to see where there is room for improvement.  I should like to bring section 2 (3) (a) to the Minister's attention.  In the January edition of the Dock and Harbour Authority magazine Mr. F. Thomas Poole in the &ldquo;Legal Notes&rdquo;, referring to the residence of a person or a person being domiciled in this State, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law on Unfair Dismissal as it affects employees who work partly in Great Britain and partly abroad should be amended to take account of the difficulties likely to arise from <Col N="666" /> the development of the EEC, the growth of international companies and the expansion of motor transport.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say that because more and more time is being spent by people working either on international haulage or with multi-national companies in European countries, in the opinion of the writer decisions were made by the tribunal that could be regarded as unfair to the individuals involved.  For that reason I ask the Minister to look at that section again.  As I said on Committee Stage, &ldquo;domiciled&rdquo; can have a wide usage, can be used in many different ways from a legal point of view and could leave open an avenue that would not be desirable. Since we became members of the EEC we have become more involved with Europe and there is the possibility of more companies working in this country and of our people working abroad. For that reason this section should be looked at very closely.</P>
    <P>I must again express my disappointment that the amendment dealing with paramedical people was not accepted, because I consider that there is a certain amount of discrimination here. I strongly urge the Minister, even at this stage and despite the decision taken here today, to look at this again between now and when the Bill is introduced in the Seanad.  It must be remembered that this is an Unfair Dismissals Bill.  I do not think a case can be made for an unfair dismissal to take place in this area which involves people who are so useful.</P>
    <P>This Bill has the support of this Party.  I am satisfied the amendments improved it.  As I said, I would have preferred to see more amendments accepted, but no doubt the Seanad will do something about that.  I wish the Bill a speedy passage through the Seanad.  Were it not for the fact that we have to take another Bill this afternoon, I would make a more lengthy speech on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned a fear expressed by some managements in certain sections of industry that the Bill might be seen to be biased against management. That is not the case.  On Committee <Col N="667" /> Stage it was the feeling on both sides that this Bill was necessary.  For the majority of managements it presents no problems.  I hope its passing will give further encouragement to the development of agreed disciplinary and dismissal procedures within firms and to their establishment in firms where such agreed procedures do not exist.</P>
      <P>In addition to the need for such procedures to exist at firm level throughout the country it is my belief that we should have a national code of agreed disciplinary procedures relating to dismissals.  Once the Bill goes through the Seanad it is my intention to initiate discussions with representatives of trade unions and employers with a view to agreeing such a national code.</P>
      <P>This national code should suggest alternatives to dismissal.  It is possible that we might agree on a graduated scale of sanctions in this very important area.  The code could also give guidance on appropriate appeals machinery within firms.  The main purpose of this code would be the achievement of agreement on both sides in industry on the steps necessary in a grievance procedure.  If the inspiration for this Bill is the conviction that we must limit the area of arbitrary behaviour in industrial relations, from whatever side it emanates, whether from unions or employers then the need for such a procedure is evident.  If we accept that the adoption of such an approach does not endanger the efficiency of any business or concern, if those are our convictions, then they should be strengthened by the realisation that the incidence of disputes relating to dismissals has involved our economy in enormous social and economic costs up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the disputes recorded in the Labour Court reports for the years 1972-1975, 187 were classified as disputes relating to engagement or dismissal, in which 26,299 people were involved and accounting for over a quarter of a million man days lost in industry.  During last year alone over one-third of all man days lost, 116,000 man days, was due to those reasons. I do not suggest that all such disputes will be eliminated by the passage of <Col N="668" /> this Bill but it should underline the importance of the problems sought to be dealt with by this kind of legislation. I will, as soon as this Bill is enacted, institute with both sides of industry the kind of discussions I have indicated here.  I want to thank Deputy Fitzgerald and all the other Deputies who took part in the Committee and Report Stages of this Bill.</P>

I will come to this again on section 4, which refers to the laying of orders and regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas. <Col N="669" /> I know that the Minister will say that this has been the procedure in drafting such legislation over the years and that this has been taken from other Bills. I believe the time has come for us to adopt as simple a form of Bill as we can.  Bills dealing with worker legislation should be very simple so that the ordinary people on the factory or shop floor or in an industry anywhere can interpret those bills, be able to read them satisfactorily and to decide for themselves their entitlements under those Bills.</P>

      <P>The two amendments to this section are related to amendment No. 4.  In framing a definition of &ldquo;establishment&rdquo; for the purposes of section 6, I was aware that certain problems could arise having regard to the different trading patterns of different business firms. These problems relate mainly to firms in the services sector or to some local authorities where the general nature of employment is highly mobile, with employees moving from job to job.  I consider that the definition of &ldquo;establishment&rdquo; in section 6 takes account of those exceptional cases as far as we can reasonably do that.  In the course of consultations following publication of the Bill it was suggested to me that it would nevertheless be desirable to have some degree of flexibility concerning this definition to provide for as many of the eventualities I have mentioned as possible.  I consider that the suggestion has merits and amendment No. 4 will give effect to it.  It will be noted from the related amendments, Nos. 2 and 3, that any change in this definition would require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may tell me that it is normal practice in legislation of this kind but I should like to draw his attention to section 4 which relates to the laying of orders and regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The section states:</P>
      <P>(1) Every order and regulation under this Act (other than an order under section 3 or section 7 (3)) shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as possible after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the order or regulation is passed by either House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the order or regulation is laid before it, the order or regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I object to the last phrase in the section. It appears to me that if an order is laid before the House and if a resolution annulling the order or regulation is passed by either House within the next 21 days the regulation is null and void.  What I am querying is the wording &ldquo;...but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under it&rdquo;.  The wording appears to suggest that if an order which is placed before the House is rejected by the House within the 21 days as null and void then, according to the section, <Col N="671" /> anything done from the time it was placed before the House will appear to be valid.  There appears to be some contradiction there.  Nothing should be valid under any order until that order is clear and final and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>If the last phrase was not included there could be no certainty of the legal status as set out in the regulations.  It is a provision that must be included in any legislation which has to take international obligations into account.  That is the main purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there is a contradiction here?  Surely nothing can be done under the order until it has been before the Houses of the Oireachtas for 21 days?  That must be the right way to do it rather than using a qualifying phrase to which I object.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not taking away from the powers of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  If the regulations under this section are to have the force of law this provision is essential.  I think I am correct in saying that in relation to Bills containing the need to pass regulations this is the standard formulation of the legal status of such regulations.  This is the way the status of regulations is put, certainly in relation to any Bills I have been dealing with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so it has escaped my notice.  I do not think it is the right procedure.  Irrespective of whatever party are in power, Ministers must be subject to the rules of this House.  If a Minister lays an order before the House it is only carrying out an exercise if that order is not absolutely clear.  The House has power within 21 sitting days to disapprove of the order but this section apparently states that anything done between the time the Minister makes the order and until the House decides otherwise is valid.</P>

Of course the House has the right to countermand an order after <Col N="672" /> 21 days but they have legal validity during that period.  For example, in the Bill we have just dealt with there is a regulation there which has a similar provision to that contained in section 4 (1).  It is true the House can annul the order after 21 days but during that time the regulation has the force of law.</P>

      <P>It is important that public and local authorities are included.  It was announced on the radio today that the number of people employed in hospital building has doubled during the last few weeks, from 350 to 700.  I do not want to see 700 people employed prior to an election and 550 of them made redundant immediately afterwards.  I doubt if they will be kept in employment long enough to be held under the terms of this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that this Bill was not introduced sooner. Hopefully, we have passed the worst of our redundancies in industry.  Two years ago the European Directive was signed by the Minister for Finance in his capacity as President of the Council of Ministers.  It has taken until now for this Bill to reach the Committee Stage.  We now have certain controls over collective redundancies. If five people in an establishment employing between 20 and 50 are being made redundant, notice must be served 30 days in advance.  Section 6 deserves the support of the House. The Minister should ensure that the section is not abused by any section of the community.  We hear of takeovers and possible redundancies in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the section that defines the number of employees that make for <Col N="675" /> mass redundancy notices.  We must of course be observant as well.  One is always thinking of ways around legislation and if there is an establishment employing, say, 50 people and nine people are made redundant within that period, this is a loophole.  I would ask the Minister, through the inspectorate and through the Redundancy Section of his Department, to keep an eye on such evasion of the terms of the Bill, because there is a possibility that 12 months later that same procedure would be repeated with nine more.  As I said earlier, the vast majority of employers would not consider doing this but we must be wary of anyone who would exploit the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague has dealt with this matter very comprehensively. I would like to express regret at the European orientation of the Bill, which is mainly weighted towards larger industries as such legislation is in European countries. There is a provision in relation to &ldquo;at least five in an establishment normally employing 20 and less than 50 employees&rdquo;.  Our whole system here is geared to small industries.  The IDA try to direct attention to small industries.  Why does the Minister move away from the thousands of people employed in small industries, industries with less than 20 workers? Surely industries which are State-aided and for which the State has a special scheme should not be ignored by any legislation.  Why should one worker not have the same protection as another?  It is regrettable that the Minister did not attune this legislation to Irish conditions and Irish problems rather than accept legislation weighted towards a European situation. Probably a small industry in the highly industrialised countries would be one of 20 employees, but that is not so here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the attitude indicated by this legislation mean that in future the IDA in attracting industries will not give support to small industries?  The Minister should consider amending the legislation on Report Stage to ensure that the workers to whom I refer are <Col N="676" /> not forgotten.  They play the same role in the development of our economy as do the workers in the larger industries. Some of them play an even more important role because they operate in difficult circumstances.  Are we to take it that the Government have now written off all small industries? Is it the policy of the Government under this Bill that small industries will not get the aid and support that is provided for industry in legislation?</P>
    <P>Any legislation going through this House that disregards the rights of the few, however few they may be, is legislation that is not worthy of this House.  The Minister should ensure that no workers are put at a disadvantage because they are in a workshop that employs less than 20 people.  Employers in small industries can be just as ruthless as employers in large industries.  Again I would ask the Minister to give an undertaking that these people will not be forgotten and that we will not desert any section of workers in any legislation that is brought in for the benefit of those in employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is very important in that we have all come to recognise that the only sound buffer against unemployment is the number of small industries and small businesses throughout the country.  I would agree with Deputy Dowling that we must take a very positive view about our whole dependence on the establishment of multi-nationals in regard to the creation of employment. We know very well that when a cold economic wind blows the people running small industries will not desert the ship and get out, as many of the multi-nationals will do.  Therefore we must protect these small companies, recognising that only in the direst circumstances would their employees become redundant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation affords us an opportunity of stressing again the importance of the small businessman with ten, 20 or 30 employees.  The workers in our small industries are probably the best, most dedicated and the most loyal of all the groups.  It is our duty to look after those people <Col N="677" /> who in many cases have given the best years of their lives in the service of small industries.  I would encourage as far as possible the granting of more and more concessions to the type of businesses we are talking about and ensure that local Irish people can avail of such grants and loan facilities as seem to be afforded to the big multi-national company.  If we protect not alone the employee but the type of industry in which he is employed we shall be doing a good service to the whole country.</P>

      <P>Here, again, I wish to reserve the right to submit amendments on Report Stage if necessary.  This area of a specified period of contract is one that I should like to consider very carefully.  It might create difficulties in some types of employment that would be different from the normal types of employment and redundancies covered by the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am thinking particularly of a building contractor.  The building industry fluctuates to a certain extent, seasonally and otherwise.  Let us take the case of a building contract which is completed earlier than anticipated. Normally the experience is to the contrary but let us take a situation in which 100 people are working on a building contract for a specified period of two-and-a-half years but if the contract is completed in two years would the 100 people who would be laid off come within the rules of this Bill and within the control of this section?  The exclusion of employment under the Merchant Shipping Act is understandable because of certain difficulties.  Presumably the people in question in so far as that Act is concerned would be working at sea and away from our country.  But if a shipping line lay off 30 people, why should these people not come within the terms of the Bill?  I had a difficult case recently of a person who was employed by such a company.  The company did not honour their commitments <Col N="680" /> to their employees, either by way of social welfare contributions or anything else.  I am reserving the right here, too, to submit amendments on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is something the Minister must look at again. The point I am making is that in relation to building contractors generally there has to be a certain amount of uncertainty regarding a forecast of the time when the contract will be completed This section needs a certain amount of tidying up.  If a builder makes a contract for two-and-a-half years but completes the work unexpectedly within two years and he does not have other work for the workers, does he come within the terms of the Act?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is getting into big money.  It states:</P>
      <P>Where collective redundancies are effected by an employer before the expiry of the 30-day period mentioned in subsection (1) the employer shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £3,000.</P>
      <P>I would have thought that that fine would have been related to the numbers involved.  In section 6 different levels and different numbers of employees are mentioned.  Twenty people must be employed on an average over the previous 12 months before the company are involved under this Bill by way of collective redundancies. There are four different categories and it is not fair that there should be just a fine of £3,000.  It is a matter for the Minister to say whether it should be smaller or greater.  If a small firm laying off five in an establishment employing 20 people offends under section 14 they would be fined £3,000. On the other hand, an establishment employing 300 people could lay off 30 people, six times as many, and he will be fined the same £3,000.  That fine in justice should be tabled either upwards or downwards.  I appreciate what the Minister wants to prevent, but it is not fair that the employer of 300 people should be classed in the same category as the employer of 20 people.  For that reason I would ask the Minister to look at this between now and Report Stage and I reserve my right to submit motions on Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation will not be an imposition on many employers.  As I said earlier, it is only in a minority of cases where redundancies are impending that there are not discussions held between employers and employees, although there have been a minority of unfortunate cases where redundancies did occur without notification to those concerned.  It must not be forgotten that this fine is the maximum which can be imposed on <Col N="684" /> indictment.  In the number of cases where it goes to the point where employees do not accept or ignore the provisions of this legislation and are subject to fine, it can be realistically anticipated that the fines will not in most cases be anywhere near the maximum set down here.  It is as light an obligation for the employer in a small firm to consult with employees beforehand as it is for employers in larger firms.  Good human relations with one's employees are as important in small firms as in large ones.</P>
      <P>The burden this legislation places on the employer's shoulders is light to the extent that all it seeks from the employer is that he should enter into consultations with those who would be affected by a decision on his part to close a section of the firm or to close the firm down.  He should consult with them beforehand, tell them it is happening and see if it can be avoided. It can have the beneficial side effect that the National Manpower Service would know that a redundancy was impending so that if redundancy finally was unavoidable we might be in a position to obtain alternative employment for those affected.  Therefore no employer is asked to accept very onerous obligations under this legislation. These provisions are made to improve good relations in industry and are in employers' better interest in the long term.  I am convinced that for the minority of employers who might be affected by this legislation the fine mentioned here is not excessive when you recall that it is the maximum figure that could be imposed on an employer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a tough section complying with some sections in other Bills.  It gives very strong rights to persons to go very far with individuals and private persons in people's homes.  I quote:</P>
      <P>(1)  An authorised officer may&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  enter at all reasonable times any premises or place where he has reasonable grounds for supposing that any employee is employed,</P>
      <P>(b)  there make any examination or inquiry necessary for ascertaining whether this Act has been or is being complied with,</P>
      <P>(c)  require an employer or his representative to produce any records which the employer is required by this Act to keep, and inspect and take copies of entries in the records.</P>
      <P>Overall the powers conferred here are too strong, too dangerous to allow to any Minister.  I appreciate what the Minister will say: that this is only for people who may be trying to evade the terms of the Bill.  However it should be remembered that there may be times when an inspector's suspicions may be entirely unfounded. For that reason I would be very fearful of giving any Minister in any Government the powers that appear to be in this section.  He or his officer has full powers such as are issued only under warrant to the Garda in certain cases.  Subsection (2) says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers conferred on an authorised officer by subsection (1) (a) shall not be exercisable in respect of a private dwelling-house unless the Minister (or an officer of the Minister appointed by the Minister for the purpose) certifies that he has reasonable grounds for <Col N="686" /> believing that an offence under this section in relation to an employee in the house has been committed by the employer,...</P>
    <P>Who decides those reasonable grounds?  One person's reasonable grounds may not be another person's reasonable grounds.  The Minister has a duty to revise this section and to amend it to reduce the strength of it. We are in the habit of giving very strong powers in much of our legislation. To give an officer acting on the Minister's behalf power on &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; of suspicion is too wide open to abuse.  For that reason I do not agree with this section as it stands.  While I do not intend opposing it on Committee Stage, unless the Minister is prepared to amend it between now and Report Stage I intend submitting amendments then.</P>

      <P>The Deputy anticipates, since we have come up against this section in other legislation, what I will be saying.  It is a standard provision in legislation of this kind that the officers must have sufficient authority where that is required.  We have similar provisions, in the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973, and also in an Act of long before that, the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1961.  It must be remembered that the manner of exercising powers conferred here is subject to scrutiny by the courts when prosecutions are brought before them. In effect nothing sinister is being sought by way of powers under section 17.  They are routine powers conferred by legislation of this kind on officers carrying out these duties.  They are present in legislation of this kind at least back to 1961 whereas, as I say, the Holidays (Employees) Act has a similar section.</P>

      <P>I anticipated the Minister's answer.  We have made a lot of progress with these Bills.  The phraseology being used is simple and easy to follow.  I believe measures like this are Draconian.  In fairness to the officials of the Department and other Departments, they have not been abused.  In fact, I would say the opposite for the most part.  As legislators <Col N="687" /> we should not allow the opportunity to be given to the rare person who may well abuse them.  In regulations affecting employers and employees and encouraging good relations between employers and employees, we should not take the old-fashioned view that everyone is suspect until he is proved otherwise.  The vast majority of employers and employees are fine upright respectable people.  They are good employers and good employees and they have good relations.  Let us legislate for the majority and not for the minority who may try to evade legislation.  I suggest the Minister should recommend to his people that some amendments should be introduced to this section before Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I want to make the same comments on this section which is headed, &ldquo;Proceedings under Act&rdquo;.  It relates very closely to section 17.  I call for another look at this section. The Minister may say this is the format in which such sections have been introduced over the years.  We are trying to provide for good industrial relations.  If labour legislation is to help towards them, we should have belief and confidence in the goodness of people.  We should believe they do not go out deliberately to outwit the State or its officers, but that the vast majority of people want to co-operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is desirable that we should change this type of section in all our legislation.  It may have been traditional. We inherited our law-drafting procedures from another nation and it may be understandable that this type of thing should continue for a certain time.  The time has come to break with that tradition and to present a more open and friendly image of the State. I am not saying the officers do not. In fact, they present a friendly image but when you read some legislation, you wonder what kind of so-and-sos <Col N="688" /> they are, what kind of tough men they are who have all these wide powers. We are talking about industrial relations and human relations.  Let us set the headline from our Department of Labour.  This is a comparatively new Department.  It was set up 11 or 12 years ago.  It has made a good deal of progress.  Now we are moving forward and we want to see new sections and not the tough old-fashioned.  Victorian type of section.  Let us put in an original section.</P>
    <P>I reserve the right to submit amendments to this section.  Subsection (3) provides:</P>
    <P>Where an offence under this Act committed by a body corporate is proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of, or to be attributable to any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or other officer of the body corporate or any person who was purporting to act in any such capacity, he as well as the body corporate shall be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.</P>
    <P>The poor devil who was purporting to act in any such capacity could be the office boy and he could be proceeded against.  The time has come to redraft this type of section and give it a more humane and reasonable approach.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> The following motion was moved by Deputy Barrett on Tuesday, 1st March, 1977:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the exorbitant increases in CIE fares which were recently announced.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;notes that CIE's application for an increase in fares has been accepted by the National Prices Commission and recognises that taxpayers in general will subsidise CIE to the extent of £30m. this year&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Transport and Power).</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In making a contribution on this motion and amendment one has to ask how the cost increases incurred by CIE can be offset. Productivity is one area within the existing operation, or a further Government subsidy, or an increase in fares. We could indulge in the exercise of reducing these services but we would all agree that would not be a very desirable policy to adopt.  The public must get a service.  The point is, who pays?</P>
      <P>Last evening the Minister mentioned a subsidy of £30 million.  In actual fact, the total subsidy to CIE is possibly of the order of £46 million when you take into account the school transport service subsidy and other subsidies which are available to CIE.  In my view £46 million from the Exchequer is a very high subsidy.  We must ask: do we want to increase that subsidy?  If we do, that means further taxation.  Are the Opposition prepared to say that is the way to do it, that we should give further subsidies and increase taxation?  I do not think that is the best way to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to look at the whole aspect of transportation in a very positive way. With the congestion in the city area it is nearly impossible to run any type of transport service.  If we had been alive to this problem over the years CIE would not be accruing vast arrears year after year.  The lack of a policy <Col N="690" /> in the past is very evident today.  One sees lines of buses in a state of disorder because of tremendous traffic bottlenecks because the private commuters have a big impact on traffic. What has been done about providing proper bus lanes and what are the policies for the future in this respect? We must apply our minds to this.  It is easy to come in with motions deploring this or that, but we must attempt to find solutions.  Nobody wants increases but when costs are rising, where do we levy the debt?  That is what we must ask.  While it is not easy, I think it is better to pass on the deficit and formulate a proper transport policy.  If any subsidy must be paid in future I think it should be paid for the development of bus lanes.</P>
    <P>We also had neglect of the rail service in the past by the former Government. We have seen them clipping off hundreds of miles of track hoping that would solve the problem.  As we see, that solved nothing; in Dublin city it has created major problems.  The Harcourt Street line was closed and vandalised very quickly.  I never understood why, but the stations were closed and sold and bridges taken down and now we are reaping the ill results.  The Opposition should take cognisance of this when replying.</P>
    <P>CIE have endeavoured to increase productivity in the past number of years.  Between 1974 and 1976 they reduced the wage bill by about £6 million.  In other words, they saved £6 million.  This was done without forcing any redundancy.  Obviously, there was a slowing-up in recruitment and there was encouragement of retirement and other methods were used. CIE have endeavoured to meet the situation but the chaotic situation allowed to develop in the past is basically responsible for the very high cost of the service for which we now have to pay in Dublin.  Dublin should be a profitable area but it is no longer so.</P>
    <P>We must consider the whole question of people commuting to work and the staggering of hours of employment.  The Government have a say in the Public Service and might decide that staff would start work 30 <Col N="691" /> minutes or 15 minutes earlier in the morning and finish earlier in the afternoon.  This would make it easier for the bus company to plan some sort of rational service.  They should give the facilities to which people are entitled considering the kind of subsidy they as taxpayers are paying towards the transport system.</P>
    <P>The quality of service provided by CIE must be considered as well as the fares charged.  It is easy to &ldquo;knock&rdquo; CIE but not so easy to suggest workable improvements.  Public transport cannot be considered in isolation from transport generally.  The whole transport system will have to be examined.  I believe that the Committee of this House which will be looking into the operation of State bodies can play a very effective and meaningful role in this area.  When the House votes large sums of money to any company it behoves Deputies to have some say in the affairs of these companies.  In fairness to CIE in the last number of years they have made serious efforts to improve the standard of service.  They have engaged in comprehensive advertising; they have gone in for package tours and holiday tours and have tried to encourage the commuters to travel in off-peak periods.  That highlights their concern with the situation.  When one examines the position in England or on the Continent where there are vast populations and what we might describe as a very large reservoir of customers we find their railway systems are losing money.  Therefore, it is easy to understand why CIE should be in a major loss situation. We have not the same size of population or the same commuting public.</P>
    <P>One sometimes sees large buses moving through the country with two, three or four people on board.  I have always thought that CIE should have many types of buses to cater for different needs.  Obviously, they could plan a programme knowing exactly when larger or small buses are required.  Even in summer, which is the high tourist season, one can see buses coming half empty to the country.  I believe CIE should examine this situation where they could make <Col N="692" /> substantial savings both in capital investment and in the running of their buses.</P>
    <P>I also regard it as important that CIE should diversify.  It has been suggested that they should develop their railway terminal lines for commercial purposes.  This is a first-class idea, although this might not be the time because of the office glut.  They have the space and capacity to develop commercially. It is a failing of semi-State bodies that they do not seem to see themselves in the real commercial world.  They should go out to meet the challenge in an effective way.  If they went into the property business this would offset some of their losses.</P>
    <P>The future of CIE will not be easy, particularly when motions are put down in a simplistic way and without any real concern for a solution.  If this debate does anything, it will give us an opportunity to put forward our own views because it is the concern of everybody that we should have an efficient and effective transport system. Some people say the transport system should be handed back to private enterprise, others say it should be handed to the local authorities.  I do not subscribe to either view.  CIE have the machinery and the expertise.  What they require now is liaison with Dublin Corporation and other county councils to treat our roads as a matter of priority.  I am thinking particularly of the bus-ways from our new towns around Dublin&mdash;Tallaght, Blanchardstown and Clondalkin, which are very large satellite towns.  Now is the time to plan for commuting between the city and these towns.  This must be done in conjunction with the local authorities.</P>
    <P>If an organisation is to be successful they must plan well ahead and put these plans into action.  Even at this late stage I would like to see a review of the Harcourt Street rail line to see how it can be adapted, even as a busway, to meet an area of expanding population&mdash;through Dundrum, Foxrock and even further into Tallaght&mdash; to meet the needs of the people in these areas.  There is a ready-made line in Clondalkin.  It is just a matter of adapting it to meet the growing population.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="693" /> The overall question of losses on railways is a big problem with which we shall have to live because there is great competition between road hauliers and railways.  The international mode of transport is the containerised traffic, a drive-on drive-off situation.  This is a pity because it is putting a lot of heavy traffic on the roads.  If we had depots where these containers could be loaded or unloaded&mdash;this could be done on the docks because the railways run to our docks&mdash;this could help win back business which had been lost.</P>
    <P>What is required now from all sides is proper planning of a future transport system.  People talk about rapid rail systems, bus-ways, improved railway systems, better types of stations and increased productivity which will help to reduce the deficit.  We all have our role to play in central government. Our commitment of £46 million gives us a stake to ensure that we have this streamlining and development.</P>
    <P>We have to live with loss situations on the railways particularly.  Bus services in the urban areas should pay their way.  We have the population to ensure that these services will pay but because of strangulation in our city centre and because of the lack of foresight in the past to develop our roads and railways we are now paying the supreme penalty of stagnation in the city.  In future CIE must come up with positive plans which the Government must support.  It is advisable to give a subsidy to develop our roads and a rapid rail system because ultimately we will be saving money.  Let us adopt a positive role for the future.</P>
    <P>The future development of any country must depend on the type of communication it provides.  When I hear of closures it is a sign we are not progressing.  If we are to progress where possible we must keep all lines of communication open.  There have been too many closures.  We could have streamlined and used a type of productivity that would have ensured savings without the harsh reality of closures affecting many towns and the employment of many people.</P>
    <P>It gives us no pleasure to stand up here and deplore price increases.  We should institute and initiate comprehensive <Col N="694" /> transport policies and developments in our rail system and examine all aspects of this.  Can we do it another way?  Can we do it through another agency?  Are CIE doing it the right way?  Have they got the right commercial approach?  We should ask ourselves those questions and we should look for answers to them.  If we do that we will give the public what they want and what they are entitled to, that is a fast and efficient bus service and train service.  We will then take the cars off the road because people will find it easier and more comfortable to travel by CIE bus or train.  If we can bring that about the capital cost will be far lower.  If we had a fast bus system CIE could operate with half the buses they are using at the moment because the turnaround would be very fast.</P>
    <P>There is an effort in Dublin to try to cut costs by the introduction of one-man buses.  CIE are trying to iron out the difficulties with their staff.  The trade unions are there to protect their members and to see that they get them the best deal and that their members will not suffer.  I believe the introduction of one-man buses will bring about some savings.  I wonder, now that there is so much vandalism, if the passengers will have the same protection in one-man buses as they have in the present situation?  This is a social rather than a financial problem.</P>
    <P>When the committee on semi-state bodies is set up Members of the House can play an effective role having a look at the operations of CIE and bringing back to the House the suggestions which are offered.  CIE should liaise with local authorities to try to have better roads provided.  I shall listen for words of wisdom in the contributions from the Opposition to see how they will solve this problem of developing an effective transport system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask that there be some control of prices and that inflation of prices should cease.  The wording of the Minister's amendment is very ambiguous.  The amendment states:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes that CIE's application for an increase in fares has been accepted by the National Prices Commission...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Could the commission reject the application after they have examined it? If they have accepted the CIE application for an examination I believe the price increases will be introduced.  If that is not the case the motion would have read that &ldquo;the commission were examining the matter&rdquo;.  Even though we believe that the price increases will take place it does not give the Opposition any excuse for not examining the role of CIE and the Government in regard to the latest decision to increase prices to the detriment of the people in the country as well as in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was ambiguous when he said that practically every household has a motor car and some have two.  That is not true of this city. Many thousands of families have no motor cars.  They cannot even afford the bus fares.  There are thousands of families living in the outer suburbs who have not even got bicycles.  The Minister must be brought down to earth on this point to show how serious the matter is.  The Government have a duty to protect the weaker sections of the community in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Waterford and all over the country.  We have to realise that not alone will the proposed CIE increases be a penal imposition on <Col N="696" /> those people but will lead to a further loss of revenue by CIE.</P>
    <P>We have had the same position for many years where CIE get into more financial trouble&mdash;I am not saying it is of their making&mdash;and they apply for an increase in fares.  When this is given they lose more business because people will not use their services.  This is the classic example of the law of diminishing returns operating.  Fares have become so high that people cannot afford to pay them.  CIE will have to get money somewhere next year to keep the remaining branches of their activities going until eventually in a few years time the people will not avail of public transport.  That would be a very serious situation for the public and the people employed in CIE.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to try to bring about a different thinking by the Government and CIE management as well as the trade unions.  We cannot always go on having a fire brigade rescue effort for CIE.  We should try to make CIE into a concern which will give a good service to the public at a reasonable cost. CIE are not full masters of their own house.  We know that there are aspects of travel in the city and the country over which CIE have no control.  Traffic in general in the city affects the bus service.  The bus service should be made satisfactory to the public.  If not, anybody who has a car or who can get a lift in one will use it and CIE will lose the revenue.</P>
    <P>CIE over the years have asked for extra revenue.  I do not believe we are tackling their problems.  Now, with the demand for a 25 per cent increase in fares, we have to decide if CIE do not get this what will happen?  Will the Government further subsidise the activities of CIE?  This side of the House are very sensitive to this problem.  I believe if the Government, CIE and the trade unions get together they can work out a pattern which will insulate CIE against the colossal losses which will ensure that we have a public transport system which will be well run and which will give to the people the service they want.  I am convinced that the Government's attitude is one of taking the line of least resistance.  They will <Col N="697" /> not give CIE any more money.  The people will look to the national Parliament to give a lead in this matter and I can see the day when the attitude of the Government towards CIE will have to change.  Transport is vital to a family living in an outer suburb of Dublin.  I can see the time when we will have to regard CIE as a public service paid for by taxation.  Nobody would ever think of denying a water supply to someone in this or any other city because of the cost; we regard water supply as an essential public service which is paid for by local or national taxation or by a combination of both.  We must face the fact that thousands of families must have a public transport service.  An increase of 25 per cent will mean that many people will not be able to afford transport. If the National Prices Commission sanction the increase, and I feel they will, I wish to bring home to the Minister that the Government cannot wash their hands of it and blame the NPC.</P>
    <P>I am putting the emphasis on transport in this city because about one-third of the population live in the greater Dublin area and a bigger proportion of the people will be affected in this city.  I propose that CIE should not increase their fares by 25 per cent to people who have to work in the city.  They should develop and expand their present scheme of cheaper fares which operate in certain places and include any man, woman, child or young person who must travel from one of the outer suburbs into the city.  There should also be a worker's ticket.  A man going to and from his place of employment should be given special consideration.  The Fianna Fáil Government some years ago introduced a scheme of free travel for pensioners and they made the lives of pensioners very happy by this scheme.  At the time it was said that this was novel; I think it was a great scheme.  It showed original thinking by the Fianna Fáil Government.  They recognised that the pensioner was in special need of this type of scheme.</P>
    <P>People who live in the suburbs and must travel to the city to work may <Col N="698" /> be tempted to stay at home because they cannot afford the fares.  It is too much to ask a man who has to work hard to walk five or six miles every morning or evening on his way to and from work.  The Government must show some original thinking by introducing a scheme of this kind. Some people who live in the city have to travel to places like the Naas Road to their employment and they also need assistance.  A scheme of cheaper fares would attract more business to CIE.  The economists of the Government and of CIE should get together and work out such a scheme.  It is essential that more passengers should be attracted to CIE trains and buses. If this does not happen then next year or the year after, if present inflationary trends continue, CIE will be looking for more money or higher fares.  If they look for higher fares they will get more money from the people who travel but they will lose overall.  People will lose faith in the capability of a public concern to provide a cheap and efficient transport system.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Brien mentioned, perhaps the answer lies in private enterprise.  I believe in general in private enterprise but we must regard transport as a social service.  That is not to say that the taxpayer must carry the full burden but I am convinced that there are many people who just cannot afford these increases and there is an onus on the Government, together with the management of CIE, to ensure that we have an efficient transport service at a reasonable cost to both the passenger and the taxpayer who does not use CIE transport services. I am sure we could attract more business from the affluent section of our society who own motor cars if CIE could provide a proper service which people could depend on and which could take a person from an outer suburb to the city centre at a fairly reasonable rate in regard to speed and to cost.  We have to try to woo the motorist as well as the man who has no motor car and show that the public transport service can take him from the local depot into town. We should encourage motorists to <Col N="699" /> drive to bus depots, leave their cars there and travel into the city by public transport.  That would reduce traffic density in the city and make it easier for buses to operate as well as bringing in more revenue to CIE.  It is not good enough to come along and say CIE are losing £30 million and fares will have to be increased.  That is the easy way out and it shows that people, and here I accuse the Government, have not given sufficient thought to the problem.  Last night the Minister taunted Deputy Barrett and asked would he support more taxation.  The increases had actually gone through last night.  Now it is no good binding up the wounds of CIE without getting at the cause of the economic ailment from which it is suffering.  Until a proper examination is carried out there will be no cure for CIE's ills.  There will have to be some really serious thinking done by the Government. In a few years the population of Dublin will be close to 1,000,000 people and the transport problem, unless something is done, will become still more acute.  There are railway stations which could be utilised, such as Liffey Junction and Inchicore.  I know that CIE opened one suburban station but it was not a great success. Some of the regular passengers were critical of the stop because there was more delay and very few passengers were taken on.</P>
    <P>The public transport system is a very vital part of our economy and it is very important that CIE should provide the best possible service.  I know there is no easy solution.  People are aghast at the proposed increase of 25 per cent in fares in the Dublin area.  The Fianna Fáil group in the Dublin Corporation wrote to the Minister and to his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and to the National Prices Commission. They have agreed to receive a deputation from the Fianna Fáil group in the city council to discuss the matter.  I am somewhat sceptical but nevertheless one must not stop trying.  I suggest the Minister should get together with the unions, with CIE, with the employer organisations and consumer organisations and put the <Col N="700" /> whole position to them.  It is no solution to go ahead injecting more money into the company.  If fares go on increasing and business continues to fall off there will have to be a further heavy imposition of taxation.</P>
    <P>A transport service may not be all that luxurious but for many people it is a luxury they cannot afford.  I am sure there are competent people in CIE and in the public service who could examine and find some solution to the problem.  There was a time, as Deputy Barrett said, when people took pride in working for a transport company.  The Minister referred to this and he gave us a short history of transport in Ireland. It was very interesting but I do not know that it was very helpful.  The Minister made comparisons with cities like Liverpool, Manchester and so on where transport concerns have been in trouble.  That is no help to us.  We have a problem and it is our problem and it is we who must try to resolve it.  For any comparison to be valid, one would need to know the whole background.  Too little has been done by the Government so far in examining this whole matter.  Sanctioning the recommendation of the National Prices Commission is the easy way out.  It is no answer to say that if fares are not increased then the subsidy must be increased. Perhaps there is another answer.  The burden must be spread so that it rests on the shoulders of those best capable of shouldering it.  We cannot abandon the thousands living outside the urban areas.  We just cannot say to the people that they must pay the 20 per cent extra because a lot of them cannot pay it.  The result will be that a lot of them will stop using the service.  It is possible that some of them may have to sacrifice their employment because they cannot afford to travel each day to their place of employment and home.</P>
    <P>There is not much point in saying to a person who lives in Finglas or Clondalkin that they have been given an increase in pay under the national pay agreement unless we tell them that their travelling costs will mean a reduction in that increase.  We must <Col N="701" /> also tell them that the other increases announced this morning will mean a cut-back also.  In my view this will not only affect CIE but also the attitude towards future national pay agreements. We must be able to assure the people living outside the cities who accepted the national pay agreement that their standard of living will not be reduced.  The Government have not given sufficient thought to the problem of the national transport service.  The Government must come up with suggestions as to how CIE can lighten the burden on those people who do not have motor cars and live outside the cities.  There is a duty on everyone of us to be interested in this problem and to give the matter consideration.  If we do not do that the Minister next year, in spite of the change of Government which will take place in the meantime, must face the problem again.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barrett's motion asks Dáil Éireann to condemn the exorbitant increases in CIE fares which were recently announced.  It is significant that this motion is purely and simply a motion of nothing but condemnation.  There is no element of constructive suggestion in it.  There is no suggestion of alternative policy. It is one of condemnation in the most negative and destructive sense but it is typical of the Opposition's approach to the use of Private Members' Time.  They are not using it for the purpose it was intended.  They are using it for the purpose of discussing political motions of a condemnatory nature.  They have not made any effort, as they should have done in the spirit of Private Members' Time, to bring forth proposals in relation to legislation or constructive suggestions of any sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>They have used Private Members' Time for the purpose of negative destructive criticism of the sort epitomised by this motion. The price increase sought from the National Prices Commission by CIE is less in size than the allowable costs which have been incurred by CIE in the intervening period, to the extent of £3 million.  In other words, if CIE were a commercial concern looking for a price increase and producing the increases in allowable costs which have occurred for them they would have been able under National Prices Commission criteria to have been granted an increase of substantially more within the terms of their increased allowable cost.  The second point I should like to make is in relation to where CIE's costs come from.  I should like to tell the House that 60 per cent of CIE's costs at present are represented by labour costs and any attempt to cut those costs can only be achieved at the expense of either the income of the workers in CIE or, alternatively, the the number of workers employed by the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> We must also realise the difficult transport environment against which CIE have been operating in recent years.  In 1966 there was only one motor car for every ten persons in the community and this has now been reduced to one motor car for every six persons.  This means that substantially more people now have their own means of transport and do not have to rely on CIE.  Therefore CIE have fewer customers but still must maintain the same network of services with the result that its costs are bound to rise.</P>
    <P>The cost of transport services, whether they are borne by the general taxpayer through subsidies or by the user through fares, is rising in every country in Europe.  The phenomenon is not limited to Ireland.  I can illustrate this clearly by saying that in relation to the bus service in the United Kingdom in the period between 1972 and 1975 subsidies had to be increased by 1,300 per cent to enable the buses continue at the level at which they are now operating and the fares remain as they are.  The same has occurred here.</P>
    <P>The Government have substantially increased the amount of money made available in subsidy to CIE to help the company to keep fares down.  It needs to be repeated that when we came into office the level of subsidy then being made available by the Government to CIE to keep fares down was only £8.3 million and last year the Government made available a subsidy of £31 million to CIE for that purpose.  No matter what allowance is made for inflation that represents a real increase in the amount of resources made available by the Government to subsidise CIE and reduce the cost of transport on CIE services to the user.  That is a very substantial increase, even taking account of intervening inflation.</P>
    <P>This motion of pure condemnation suggests that these increases should not be allowed to be imposed.  As the Minister said yesterday, it can be achieved by drastic economies with resultant substantial redundancies or by a further increase in the subsidy to CIE.  The Minister pointed out that to maintain fares at their present level in the coming <Col N="705" /> year would involve an extra subsidy of between £14 million and £15 million on top of the £30 million already provided. That would represent the approximate equivalent in revenue terms of 1p in the £ on all rates of income tax.</P>
    <P>Would it be fair to ask the income tax payers to bear that extra amount solely to prevent these increases taking place?  Alternatively, should we allow the people who are using CIE services to meet the extra cost by way of increased fares?  It is a difficult political decision but the Government have done well already in the substantially increased subsidies being given and they are right in holding the line at the present level and in allowing the increased costs to be borne by the fares paid by users of the services.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which can be discussed in more detail by public representatives in the all-party Committee which the Government have appointed and which had been refused by the previous Government.  There they can go into the operations of semi-State companies.  Any Deputies who have constructive suggestions to make on CIE operations, on how CIE can be run more economically, will have an opportunity to do so in that committee.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett said that the liability of maintaining the properties and other fixed assets of CIE should be examined with a view to creating income earning assets with these properties.  I would point out to him that the present policy of CIE, as adumbrated by their chairman, has been one of running a transport company.  They are not anxious to get into the property business.  If Deputy Barrett's suggestions were adopted they would be getting into the property business as well as running a transport system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barrett's suggestion would be a confusion of management objectives which would be undesirable.  That suggestion can be considered by the all-party committee. Deputy Tunney said that any economies <Col N="706" /> that can be devised &ldquo;will contribute to the position which we all want, one in which the service will be cheaper&rdquo;.  He went on to say that the commuter is not terribly pushed as to the luxury or comforts of his journey. He would be happy to have a lift in a van or a lorry.  Deputy Tunney said he could be accused of saying that anything at all is good enough for the Dublin commuter, but when we cannot have the ideal situation to which we would all aspire, we would have to satisfy the immediate need of the commuter even if that means using a vehicle of lesser quality or of poorer upholstery.  He was suggesting a reduction in the standard of the buses by CIE.  He went on to say that he had heard a conductor say that they are not allowed to have more than three people standing in a bus.  He said that was a situation which needs to be examined in relation to accidents, if any, which occurred as a result of that.</P>
      <P>They are two suggestions made by Deputy Tunney which should be considered by the all-party committee, but it is only fair to recall to Deputies, and particularly to the Cork Deputies present, the fracas that occurred in Cork in relation to similar policies in relation to CIE services for ordinary workers.  There are limits to what can be done along the lines suggested by Deputy Tunney.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore suggested that CIE in Dublin should be a public service paid for by local or national taxation. He was not clear as to whether there should be any fares at all in buses or whether it should be entirely a public service.  It is significant that he referred to local taxation because I understood it was the policy of Fianna Fáil to get rid of rates.  Yet, apparently, they are proposing here that fares should be paid for out of local taxation. If they want to abolish rates on houses what form of local taxation do they suggest would pay for public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to go along Deputy Moore's line and have a public service of that sort in Dublin, the extra cost to either the Dublin taxpayers or the national taxpayers would be £25.6 million annually.  We have had suggestions <Col N="707" /> for workers' buses in the Dublin city area.  I would point out that already the taxpayers are subsidising the Dublin city bus service to the extent of £6 million.  Some people may think the Dublin city buses are being run at a profit and that the taxpayers are not paying anything towards them.  It is very important when dealing with suggestions of that nature that we would realise where the money is coming from.  It comes from either extra subsidisation or increasing the charges on other services.  If, as Deputy Moore suggested, we provide a more liberal form of worker's ticket would it be done through providing dearer services for housewives and school children so that the worker who has a job and a pay packet will have a cheaper means of getting to work?  I do not think the people would be prepared to accept that.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies suggested greater private involvement in the operation of road transport services.  It is a constructive suggestion that should be borne in mind, but I would quote something which the Minister for Transport and Power said in his speech to the Institute of Transport on 10th February last:</P>
    <P>I am of course prepared to licence road passenger services where there are no existing services.  It seems to me that there is scope for less conventional services in the rural areas. A minibus service might be the answer where passenger demand would not warrant the use of a large vehicle and I would like to see operators coming forward to provide such services.</P>
    <P>People who have ideas in regard to private transport have in that statement an offer which they can consider taking up.</P>
    <P>There have been calls for a long time from various bodies for a more comprehensive and more carefully worked out transport policy, particularly in regard to subsidisation of CIE.  In the past the subsidy to CIE was given in a general block fashion and it was so indicated in the book of estimates. Deputy P. Barry when he was Minister for Transport and Power changed this <Col N="708" /> substantially and the subsidy is now broken down as between rail passenger services, rail freight, the normalisation of accounts to deal with the pension facilities for workers, to the Dublin city bus services and to the provincial bus services.</P>
    <P>There is now a way to see exactly where the money is going.  It is possible to assess the relative value of subsidising the Dublin services as against railway freight services or to compare the provincial bus services as against subsidies towards the CIE pension scheme or towards the safety of workers.  As a result of the action of the previous Minister for Transport and Power in this matter we have in large measure answered those who said we had not a clear transport policy.  There is such a policy.  The policy adopted by the present Minister in following his predecessor is the only one that can be pursued.  It will be seen to be the correct one despite the occasional motions of condemnation put down by the Opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government continues to inflict hardship on those who are least able to pay and this was evident this morning with the announcement of further increases on essential goods and services.  It is time for the Government and the CIE management to have a comprehensive survey of the structure of this important service. Until this is done there is little prospect of any improvement.</P>
      <P>It is obvious to everyone that there is discontent among CIE workers and this was borne out a few hours ago where we heard about another threatened strike.  This discontent may be attributed to the lack of security of employment there and to the lack of proper dialogue between management and workers.  CIE's problems will not be solved by continually paying substantial sums by way of subsidy.  The time has come to say stop; it is time to bring more efficiency into the running of CIE services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a deplorable decision by CIE to withdraw stewardesses from the trains.  These girls provided an essential service in helping the old people, children and the physically handicapped <Col N="709" /> and this was not the area in which to effect economies.  I want to lodge the strongest protest against the proposed 25 per cent increase in bus rates. I represent Cork city and I am fulfilling my duty as a public representative in making known to the Minister the condemnation of the workers and the people generally who must use the bus and rail services in Cork.  If a man, his wife and two children over 16 years have to travel from Cork to Dublin it will cost him more than a week's wages.  That is the kind of incentive we are offering to people to use rail services.  I would like to point out that personally I use rail and bus services as much as possible.</P>
    <P>I condemn the methods used by the Government to secure the national wage agreement.  Certain promises were made to the workers to get the agreement but as soon as it was signed, sealed and delivered there were increases in bus fares.  Now today increases have been announced for car insurance and for other items.  The Government have been totally dishonest in their dealings with the people and it will be very difficult for future administrations to achieve co-operation with the workers.  If the Minister intends to advise the Minister for Industry and Commerce to approve the 25 per cent increase I am afraid of what will happen in the trade unions and among the workers generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>For Deputy Bruton's information, I did not say that CIE should go into the property market or that they should rush in and buy property all around the place as he suggested.  I said clearly that CIE should utilise the properties they have throughout the country, most of which are lying idle and derelict.  They should try to create more revenue by leasing them for office accommodation or for warehouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the contributions by the Minister and by Deputy O'Brien, mention was made of a figure of £46 million being paid by the Government to CIE this year as though it were a complete subsidy.  Last year the subsidy was £32 million.  They paid £11 <Col N="710" /> million for school transport and £6 million for social welfare beneficiaries who are entitled to free transport.  This £17 million was revenue for CIE, not a subsidy.  It was in respect of bringing children to school and it was for transport for old age pensioners, a scheme initiated by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Last evening the Minister devoted a substantial amount of time in stating I said certain things which I did not.  We do not want to be continually looking backwards, talking about what happened to CIE in the 1940s even though the Minister dwelt a long time on that period.  We are in 1977 and we are facing the problems of today.  We will be looking for the answers for the 1980s not about what should or should not have been done in the 1940s.  We look forward to a period of major industrial expansion under Fianna Fáil after the next election.  If we are to have this expansion we will need to provide for transport for goods and for people. The Minister for Local Government outside this House said there was no money for road improvements or for building new roads.  However, we appreciate that with increased industrial expansion it will be necessary to have the facilities to transport goods.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat in simple terms what we are suggesting.  CIE must have the necessary know-how and investment to cope with future industrial expansion.  We are not advocating redundancies, cutbacks or increased taxation as the Minister said.  CIE should increase their revenue opportunities. By increasing fares as in this instance there will be a reduction in the utilisation of CIE services and this will injure the whole structure of CIE.  We should maximise the use of all the assets of CIE; for instance, CIE should lease much of the ground space that is not in use.</P>
    <P>The country requires the facility of CIE's existing services for future expansion. The Government should apply themselves to the necessary development of the national economy in order to help this expansion.  They should see the CIE problem for what it is.  It reflects the depressed state of the economy because the Government have <Col N="711" /> not reacted to the needs of the seventies and are not looking forward to the eighties.  We have no intention of being dragged back to the forties.  CIE are in the business of moving people and goods.  If they are given the people and the goods to move they will be revitalised.  If the charges are increased, the demand for their services will be reduced by competition and the residual costs will escalate.  CIE should be given an injection of vitality to increase their revenue.  It is probably too late to be asking the Government to adopt this type of action but they might make a start at this belated hour instead of raising fares by 25 per cent and reducing the utilisation of the company, thereby reducing their revenue.</P>

Other areas in the city, such as the Ballinteer/Poolbeg route, are also entitled to a worker ticket. The Minister should ensure that justice is done to the workers of Ballyfermot.

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy claimed disability benefit from 22nd November, 1976.  At the date of his claim he was not qualified for benefit as according to the records of my Department he had only one Irish contribution paid since his entry into insurance.  As a result of inquiries which were made it was ascertained that the person had been insured under the United Kingdom national insurance scheme and his record of contributions under that scheme may be taken into account for the purposes of his claim.</P>
      <P>As a result, he qualified for disability benefit and payment of benefit due on the medical certificates lodged has been made to him.</P>
