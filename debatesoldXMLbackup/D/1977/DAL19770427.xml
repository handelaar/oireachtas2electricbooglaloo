    <P>
      <Col N="1530" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Cavan) Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan</i>): Before the adjournment of the Second Stage debate I had dealt with a number of matters raised by Deputies including questions of pollution and progress and the idea of establishing a Ministry for the Environment.  Before proceeding any further in my reply I should like, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to remind Deputies that the present Bill is basically designed to extend and strengthen the powers of the State in dealing with pollution of the sea by oil, where such pollution arises from ships.  The Bill does not deal with such matters as pollution arising from offshore exploration work, which is a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Continental Shelf Act, 1968, and the question of maritime jurisdiction, which is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Arising out of pollution from offshore exploration activities, it might be proper to explain at this time that, while we could have a very interesting debate and probably a very useful debate on the blow out in the North Sea recently, which is causing so much anxiety and possible damage, such a debate would not be in order, with all due respect, a Cheann Comhairle, or relevant on this Bill.  The blow out in the North Sea is a matter for an entirely separate convention and it is a matter for consideration by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I thought it better to explain that, lest it might not be understood why I did not refer to the blow out at length.  As I say, it is a matter for an entirely different convention and an entirely different Minister. Clearly this Bill deals only with pollution caused by spillages from ships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other matters raised which do not come directly within the scope of the Bill included the pollution of the sea by toxic substances other than oil and the practical arrangements for dealing with oil pollution, both onshore and <Col N="1531" /> offshore.  I hope that Deputies will bear this in mind during the Committee and subsequent Stages.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the outstanding points raised during the debate, I should like to deal firstly with the suggestion for the establishment of a coastguard service to enforce the provisions of the Bill.  I presume Deputies would have in mind the setting up of a body on the lines of the United States Coastguard Service.  This is admitted to be an extremely effective service, but it should be pointed out that it covers many aspects dealt with in other countries by different agencies.  In so far as fishery patrols are concerned, this is discharged in Ireland by the fishery service.  The enforcement of merchant shipping laws and safety regulations is effected by the Marine Survey Service of my Department.  The saving of life at sea is principally carried out by the lifeboat service, and lights and buoys are provided by the Commissioners of Irish Lights.</P>
    <P>Not surprisingly, the cost of the US service is very high.  It has, for instance, the seventh biggest naval fleet in the world.  Very many other factors would need to be carefully weighed before taking such a radical decision as to introduce a counterpart service here. May I give my impression that Deputies have only considered the matter from the point of view of pollution law enforcement?  I am reasonably satisfied with existing arrangements for enforcement of the law in relation to oil pollution.  For instance within harbours, either the harbour authority or myself may initiate a prosecution.  Offences outside harbours are normally detected by reports received from ships' masters or pilots of aircraft who report the sighting of an oil spillage.  Where the spillage can be traced to a particular ship, proceedings can be taken when and if she enters a port within the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The question of obtaining financial assistance towards safety measures from an international fund or from oil companies was raised by several Deputies.  The Inter-Governmental <Col N="1532" /> Maritime Consultative Organisation, known as IMCO, has adopted two international conventions to provide for the payment of compensation for oil pollution damage.  I referred briefly to these during my Second Stage opening speech.  The first convention&mdash;the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969&mdash;places liability for pollution damage on the owner of the ship from which the oil escaped and provides for ships carrying oil as cargo in bulk to be covered by appropriate insurance or other financial security.  It came into force on 19th June, 1975, but because of a number of shortcomings in regard to the limits of liability it became necessary to adopt a supplementary convention.  The supplementary convention is entitled the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1971.  This convention provides for the setting up of an international fund made up of contributions from the oil industry for compensation for oil pollution damage. The main effect of the convention is to ensure that the oil industry will share the cost of pollution damage.  The fund will be administered by the IMCO secretariat on a repayment basis.  Legislation which would enable this country to ratify both conventions is being prepared and will be introduced in the near future.</P>
    <P>Many references were made by Deputies to the state of preparedness or otherwise of both the Naval Service and harbour authorities to deal with an oil spillage.  For clarity, I would point out that while clearance of oil pollution at sea is a matter for the Department of Defence acting through the Naval Service, clearance of oil pollution on shore or immediately offshore is a matter for maritime local authorities and harbour authorities with technical back-up and assistance from the Department of Local Government. These authorities have prepared plans for oil pollution clearance and development of these plans continues.</P>
    <P>There is a Liaison Committee on Oil Pollution which meets regularly <Col N="1533" /> under the chairmanship of an officer from the Department of Local Government and is composed of representatives from my Department and the Departments of Defence, Justice, Fisheries, Industry and Commerce, Posts and Telegraphs, as well as from the Office of Public Works, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, the County and City Managers' Association and the County and City Surveyors' Association. Briefly, the role of this committee includes ensuring that plans for clearance of oil pollution are made and kept under review, that action is taken in the event of a spillage and that the plans of the various bodies involved are co-ordinated.</P>
    <P>Guidelines have been established on the minimum stocks of materials and equipment which should be available in each area having regard to the risk of pollution from the main types of oil spillage which may affect the coastline. These guidelines have been prepared on the basis that stocks held in any area can be shared by all the interests concerned and also made available, as necessary, to any other area where they may be required so as to avoid duplication and to obtain the most comprehensive coverage.  In regard to the specific question of stockpiles of neoprene blocks used in booms for containing oil spillages, I understand that this material, a form of rubber, is now dated and that stocks of newer and more effective types of boom are held in a number of our major ports.</P>
    <P>I have dealt at some length with the state of readiness of all concerned in the event of oil pollution and the degree of awareness and commitment to anti-pollution measures so much in evidence in the respective bodies.  It is essential that in combating the oil pollution we do not further pollute the sea with chemical dispersants which could themselves destroy life. The guidelines to which I have referred stress the necessity for the identification, in conjunction with the Department of Fisheries, of areas of fishery interest where dispersants should not be used, having regard to tidal and other factors for part of, or all, the year round.  While no final <Col N="1534" /> solution to the safe and clean dispersal or recovery of oil pollutant is as yet available, it should be put on record that already the types of detergent recommended for use in specified areas under controlled conditions are very many times less toxic than their counterparts of some years ago.</P>
    <P>During the debate much discussion centered on the concept of an economic zone of 200 miles as discussed at the Law of the Sea Conference.  The extent of the powers under the Bill to deal with spillages outside the territorial limit of three miles but within the 200-mile economic zone area was questioned. This Bill is designed to give effect to two conventions&mdash;one which ensures more effective control of the discharge of oil into the sea by ships including restriction on all discharges, including ballast, in areas within 50 miles of land&mdash;the other convention relates to intervention on the high seas. This second convention authorises a coastal state to intervene and take measures to protect its coastal and other related interests in the event of oil pollution on the high seas.  Because of the ramifications of international law, however, this intervention may only take place with the consent of the offending ship's country of registration. This arises from the internationally accepted view that a ship proceeding on the high seas represents effectively an extension of the territory of her State of registration.  The necessary consent is implicit in the adherence by a country to the convention.  In short therefore, intervention by this country is permissible within our territorial waters, that is, three miles, to any ship; outside this limit we may intervene with any Irish registered ship or ship whose country of registration adheres to the convention.</P>
    <P>Finally, the matter of what Deputies considered to be low penalties for offences under the Bill remains to be explained.  There was an impression during the previous debate and immediately afterwards that we were only increasing the fine to £500.  In fact, what we were talking about then was increasing the fine to £500 from £200 in the case of a summary conviction, a conviction in the District Court.  Even <Col N="1535" /> at the increased rate of £500, the fine might appear small but I repeat that it dealt only with summary conviction, namely, conviction in the District Court.  The position is that it was not and is not possible to increase fines on summary conviction beyond £500 because of the provisions of the Constitution. We are advised that an Act that sought to impose fines on summary conviction higher than £500 would be held to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>However, there are very heavy penalties provided in the Bill for a conviction on indictment, that is, conviction in the Circuit Court.  The Bill proposes to increase those fines from £5,000 to £100,000, plus £10,000 per day.  According to any standard that is a substantial increase and a very substantial penalty.  In addition, where a ship is guilty of polluting the sea with a discharge of oil the owners are open to claims at civil law, claims for damages which could be very substantial. They would be measured by the amount of damage done by the ship.</P>
    <P>I should like to make the position clear with regard to penalties because after the debate on Second Stage had concluded I think there was an idea that we had power only to impose fines of £500 which, I concede, would not be a real deterrent.  I repeat that the fines on indictment are £100,000, plus £10,000 per day, in addition to the civil rights of the offended country or individual.</P>
    <P>That deals with all the points raised on Second Stage.  I should like to thank the House for the general reception given to the Bill.  The usual point was made that it did not go far enough but I do not think the Deputies who made that complaint realised that this Bill deals only with pollution caused by oil escaping or being discharged by ships.  The general range of the debate was due to the fact that this point was not appreciated.  There are other conventions to deal with other matters and we will bring legislation before the House to enable us to ratify them.</P>

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This section covers descrimination by employers and its prohibition.  This is a very desirable and fundamental part of this legislation.  However, we must be careful to the extent that when we are introducing anti-discriminatory legislation, we must be absolutely sure that under its terms we do not create further problems.</P>
      <P>Subsection (4) refers to discrimination against employees or prospective employees in relation to conditions of employment.  Is it the intention to amend the legislation which bans women from shift work?  If we are eliminating discrimination, and I am assuming from reading subsection (4) that this is the Minister's intention, what is the position with regard to the ILO Convention? Does the reference to shift work conform with the ILO Convention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point deals with subsection (6).  As it stands, I believe this subsection to be impractical, unrealistic <Col N="1538" /> and will present massive problems in employment.  At present industrial relations in this country are at the worst stage ever.  In fact, they could be referred to as industrial chaos.  We do not seem to have any form of industrial relations.  In every field we have threatened strikes, rumours of strikes, strikes in progress and so on and the Government are standing back allowing all this to develop at a time when our unemployment figures are so high and jobs are so scarce.  Any legislation that might create further industrial problems or issues of dispute must be handled very carefully indeed.</P>
    <P>In my opinion this fundamental section has not been adequately researched. I have referred to this legislation many times as being a fire brigade introduction of a Bill prior to the West Mayo by-election to present an image of a Government that has since proved to be false and was seen to be false.  At that time the Government were trying to pledge a commitment to women, equality for women, equal pay for women and equal opportunities for women.  I would prefer to see a branch of the Labour Court in this Bill rather than the agency mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Bill was introduced merely for political expediency rather than providing equal opportunity, to create an image of a Minister and a Government. Legislation so introduced, and for the wrong reason, can only be very bad.</P>
    <P>I support entirely the equal opportunity entitlement of women.  My party support it and have been committed to it for many years.  But let us, in introducing sections such as this one, realise that they must be introduced for good, peaceful, harmonious industrial relations as well and not merely create further issues that can cause more unrest. I submit that subsection (6) of this section will do just that unless it is substantially amended.  In this section equal opportunity is safeguarded but creates the problem that people equally entitled and similarly qualified must all be promoted.  Furthermore, it creates the anomaly that if there are not available sufficient vacancies or opportunities for promotion a person who is unsuccessful&mdash;despite the fact <Col N="1539" /> that there may have been only one or two vacancies and three or more suitable and equally qualified people for them&mdash;has a complaint or grievance to take to the equality agency.  This is absurd and just not practical at all. How any Minister could have allowed such a section to appear without having it amended already amazes me.</P>
    <P>I have queried the question of shift work.  The amendments we have discussed in relation to remuneration and superannuation present a more realistic situation in particular No. 8 where it is said: &ldquo;(other than remuneration or any condition relating to an occupational pension scheme)&rdquo;.  That is understandable and the reasons for it are fully appreciated.  Might I ask the Minister also what is the position in regard to service pay?  I presume that, in circumstances where one sex is entitled to service pay, the second sex is equally entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 is a very important section.  Its purpose is to lay down the general principle that it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee, or prospective employee, on grounds of sex.  The section goes on to list all the areas in which that is applicable.  As I said in a previous discussion on this section, we have looked at figures in relation to the number of senior decision-making positions held by women in industry.  We know that it is a bad situation.  We know that women, in proportion to their numbers in industry, do not hold the same number of senior positions their numbers would seem to deserve. Surveys carried out by the Irish Management Institute some years ago suggest that a good deal of prejudice exists in very influential circles throughout industry.  That goes some of the way to explain the fact that women, apparently, are not promoted even when their qualifications seem to deserve such promotion, that they are relegated to a particular grading throughout industry.  I believe this Bill must have something to say on equalising opportunity at promotion level for women in industry.  That is <Col N="1540" /> why we have the section.  Deputy Fitzgerald has felt that, to some extent, the drafting here was impractical.  In drawing the lines of the section we have had in mind similar legislation in the United States, in Britain and other European countries.  We are convinced that if there is not a section seeking to equalise opportunity between the sexes at the point of promotion then our legislation in relation to equality between the sexes will not alter for the better the dismal picture revealed in the figures of women holding senior positions in industry.</P>
      <P>The Bill is not intended to assist a situation where people, because of their sex, are lofted into senior positions merely to correct an imbalance obtaining already in favour of one sex.  We are suggesting that where women of equal competence seek promotion we must ensure that prejudice does not bar their promotion.  That is the intent of the section.  In response to a detailed question posed by the Deputy, service pay is covered by the Equal Pay Act.</P>

    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald asked me also about shift work.  We do not intend to repeal that legislation at present.  I think the employers' organisation suggested earlier this week that it should be repealed.  We have not proceeded to such repeals as yet and it is not covered in this Bill.  It is a matter that can be considered on a later occasion.  However, I would point out that any legislation that would open up night work to women would necessitate consultation before hand with employers and unions.  This week we are clear on what is the attitude of the employers in relation to this matter.  At present what the attitude of the trade unions is, is very unclear.  But, from what I have seen of public reports of the union position, <Col N="1542" /> their attitudes are far from being unanimous in this respect.  Some say that such night work should be opened up to women.  Others say that the present protective legislation should continue in full force.  If we do proceed to changes in this area&mdash;from what I can see of the lack of agreement between the social partners and the union group itself&mdash;we will require further consultation with them.</P>

      <P>There should be consultation with the social partners and particularly with the people most deeply concerned.  To my mind an anomalous situation will arise.  The thing to have done was to have had these discussions before the legislation was introduced.  I am not telling the Minister he should revoke the ILO convention on shift work.  If he decides to do it I understand that still another anomaly would be created and the more anomalies we create the more difficult it will be to administer the legislation.  I should like to emphasise again the importance of this Bill.  I was reading a Press correspondent's report on the debate and he referred to it as a Bill making its laborious, uninteresting way through the House.</P>

      <P>The fact that it does not inspire such a person does not detract from its importance.  The Bill affects the working lives of many people and it may well cause further difficulties in our already chaotic industrial relations.  It is therefore important that we should eliminate or refuse to create anomalies and I suggest that before Report Stage the Minister would examine section 3 very carefully.  It is a fundamental section from the point of view of eliminating discrimination. <Col N="1543" /> If we allow contradictory legislation to get into the Statute Book there will always be further controversy.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about the practical effects of subsection (6). Am I right in assuming that if there were not differences in sex, that if it were all female or all male, this subsection would apply in the same way? We are talking about anti-discrimination, about eliminating discrimination against women.  Let us assume that a promotional opportunity arises within a job and that the only people qualified are all of the one sex.  Is it not true to say that whether such persons were male or female, or all male or all female, subsection (6) would apply in regard to equal opportunity?  If it does, it creates a completely ridiculous situation.</P>

      <P>That is so.  The paragraph now refers to a situation where because of his married status a person is treated less favourably than a person of the same sex.  Let us say there are four females or four males applying for promotion where there is only one opportunity or vacancy.  It can be argued that because one was single and the other was married the married person got the promotion, that the employer was inclined to lean towards the married person because, for instance, the person had a large family and heavy domestic responsibilities. If it were between a married woman and a single woman, the married woman may have had longer service.  If the married person <Col N="1544" /> got that promotion could it not be alleged against the employer that it was because of the marital status?</P>

We do not want to provide here a bonanza for lawyers.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that section 3 does not need thorough research and substantial amending in order to introduce what we both support and prevent further anomalies or difficulties being created.  This is a fundamental section and we all want to prevent discrimination by employers but I do not want to see a situation created whereby trivial cases, charges or allegations are made to an equality agency thereby overburdening the agency and costing the State, the employee and the employer money.  We want to eliminate that and simplify the governing legislation and the processing system afterwards.</P>

      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 4 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>4.&mdash;(1) If the terms of a contract under which a person is employed do not include (whether directly or by reference to a collective agreement within the meaning of the Act of 1974 or otherwise) an equality clause, they shall be deemed to include one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) An equality clause is a provision which relates to terms of a contract (other than a term relating to remuneration or an occupational pension scheme) under which a person <Col N="1545" /> is employed and has the effect that where the person is employed in circumstances where the work done by that person is not materially different from that being done by a person of the other sex (in this section referred to as `the other person') in the same employment&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) if (apart from the equality clause) any term of the contract is or becomes less favourable to the person than a term of a similar kind in the contract under which the other person is employed, that term of the person's contract shall be treated as so modified as not to be less favourable, and</P>
    <P>(b) if (apart from the equality clause) at any time the person's contract does not include a term corresponding to a term benefiting the other person included in the contract under which the other person is employed, the person's contract shall be treated as including such a term.</P>
    <P>(3) An equality clause shall not operate in relation to a variation between a person's contract of employment and the contract of employment of the other person if the employer proves that the variation is genuinely a consequence of a material difference (other than the difference of sex) between the two cases.</P>
    <P>(4) Where a person offers a person employment on certain terms, and if on his acceptance of the offer any of those terms would fall to be modified or any individual term would fall to be included by virtue of this section, the offer shall be taken to contravene sections 3 (1) and 3 (4)&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is consistent with a similar provision in the Act dealing with equal pay.  It provides that if the terms of a woman's contract of employment do not include an equality clause they should be considered to include them.  This is to provide against the position whereby a woman in her initial contract of employment might have accepted at that stage a contract which was inferior in <Col N="1546" /> many respects to her male counterpart. It is to prevent the anomaly occurring when this becomes law and where its provisions could not apply automatically across the board to women in employment because of the existence of prior individual contracts of employment which would include inbuilt disadvantages.  It is to ensure that this Bill has priority over any such contracts that this new section is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The reasons for this new section are understandable. If under existing contracts a woman accepted conditions that could prevent equal opportunity to the woman it is important that the Bill eliminate any such conditions.  We have come a certain distance in accepting the role of women in society and their ability to take their rightful place in business life, political life and their ability to establish themselves equally in any area to which they have the ambition to aspire.  There still exists in some areas a situation where this is frowned upon.  I have often made the point that women, by their attitudes, can often be their own greatest enemy in this respect but it is generally established now that all public representatives and women engaged in business can succeed.  Women have succeeded in establishing their own capabilities and proved how adequately equipped they are to do almost any job.  It is important that the commitment of Members in this regard be established and that nothing is done to prevent any woman heading a section in the public service or in the private sector if she so wishes.</P>
      <P>There are many excellent girls in the civil service and employed by local authorities and health boards and they are gradually establishing themselves. I accept the necessity for the new section and the message should now go to employers to ensure that any old fashioned or out-dated conditions that may exist in any agreements are eliminated.</P>

I welcome the amendment.  The phrase &ldquo;organisation of workers&rdquo; has a wider interpretation than that propounded by the Minister, but I know the Minister's concern.  He is widening the scope to include staff associations and, in doing so, he is also including possibly organisations of workers in small rural industries who are not really affiliated to any particular body but may have good spokesmen to act for them and a good relationship with employers.

      <P>I move amendment No. 17a:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1550" /> In page 4, line 52, to delete paragraph (b).</P>
    <P>First of all, this is a section which has given me a great deal of concern.  As it stands, I believe it could be detrimental to the future of employment agencies.  The Minister has an amendment also to this section, amendment No. 18.  We cannot discuss that amendment at the moment but I believe it will worsen the situation for employment agencies.  What is an employment agency?  What are its functions?  Whom does it serve?  There are different types. There are the numerous small employment agencies and there is the national manpower service.  The latter will be affected by this section.  I was critical of the substantial increase in January in the licence fees of these agencies. The increase was almost 2,000 per cent.</P>
    <P>Now these private agencies perform a useful service.  Some are specialists in a particular field.  All undoubtedly help employment.  They provide a valuable service to industry generally. One very important aspect of these private agencies and the national manpower service is that of confidentiality. For instance, a senior executive may be needed by a company.  The company approaches an agency and that agency issues an advertisement.  Replies are received and a short list is made and submitted to the employer.  I submit that that function can no longer be carried out in the same efficient way for the reasons to which I referred when we were dealing with section 3. Under the provisions of section 2 relating to sex and marital status, when those advertisements appear and when the full list is received by the agency difficulties will arise.  The agency will have been instructed by their employer to produce a short list of three, six or whatever the figure might be. Among the vast majority of applicants for any vacancy there will be a certain degree of competency and suitability and I have no doubt that very often the employment agency will have difficulty in deciding between a number of people.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill a person may allege discrimination against an agency.  The allegation may be correct or it may <Col N="1551" /> not be, but there will be a queue of cases being taken to the Employment Equality Agency set up under the Bill.  That agency's heart will be broken and the time of the employment agencies themselves will be absorbed because of cases being continually taken before this body.  It will be alleged against the agency that discrimination was made within the terms of this Bill.  Instead of shortlisting for the employer from 40 down to ten, the agency may short-list from 40 down to 20 in order to ensure that no charge can be laid against them. This will make them an inefficient and useless organisation providing no worth-while service for the employer, and that employer will in future do his own recruitment and the employment agency will close their doors.</P>
    <P>The point I am making about the private agency could equally be applied to the National Manpower Service.  In many cases they will be put in a very invidious position.  I fully accept that the Minister must include employment agencies within the terms of the Bill, but I am afraid they will become a target where they are used. There is the old situation under subsection (6) that I referred to earlier in regard to marital status, that perhaps one of those short-listed was selected because she was married or because she was not married, and another person not selected may allege discrimination on either of those grounds.</P>
    <P>By the deletion of paragraph (b) of section 2 I want to ensure an easing of the situation, because it would appear to me that under paragraph (b) as it stands, if an employment agency operate as such they cannot refuse or omit to provide a service. I trust I am in order in referring to career guidance, since it is mentioned in the Minister's amendment.  I am satisfied that it is the Minister's intention to encourage the introduction of career guidance within an employment agency.  That in itself may be very desirable.  Career guidance is probably one of the most important aspects of youth training.  Our own State guidance has improved but it is as yet entirely inadequate.  It needs to <Col N="1552" /> be extended and introduced at a far lower level of education.  However, paragraph (b) can be interpreted as meaning that an agency must provide career guidance.  I would consider that as very dangerous because I would seriously question the capability or the experience of persons involved in these agencies to do that.  They can do a certain amount of guidance within the employment opportunities available.  If they are selective about the type of employment or job they recruit for&mdash; and surely in a free society they are so entitled if they wish&mdash;then under this paragraph they must provide an employment service in all fields and at all levels of employment, and I would think that only the National Manpower Service would be as comprehensive as that.</P>
    <P>I believe the deletion of paragraph (b) would improve the section.  I fully understand the necessity for covering the employment agency but difficulty will certainly be created as to who will say what is selection and what is discrimination.  I have no doubt that, whether it be the Minister or his successor in this House from either side, he will fully appreciate in years to come the point I am making now, that that provision will introduce more alleged cases of discrimination than any other part of this Bill.  Many of them may be trivial; many of them may be justified, but they will put a great burden in regard to time, duty and finance on the agency who will be set up by the Bill and who will be hearing the cases brought before them.</P>
    <P>I have often referred to the £50 settlement that exists in England at present and which I regard as a crazy arrangement.  When a trivial offence is brought before one of the tribunals, because it is trivial and because the investigation of it and the research and so on would be costly for both sides agreement was reached on what is called the £50 settlement.  This is haphazard social justice which can be abused.  I would encourage the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>
    <P>If one were to carry that subsection to its logical end one could draw all sorts of conclusions on it.  One could ask an employment agency to do <Col N="1553" /> almost anything within the terms of the law.  Surely in a free society an agency are entitled to decide what services they will provide.  I would impress on the Minister that there is a grave necessity for deleting paragraph (b) and for examination of that section for the reasons I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>There are alternatives.  I have referred to what a future Minister would see in practice after this Act has been in operation for a few years.  One is that there may be many cases brought under this Act because of the difficulty of deciding between selection and discrimination.  A second alternative is that the employment agencies may become inefficient in their service to industry because they will be afraid of short-listing, and because of that and of their inefficient service to the needs of industry they will eventually be dispensed with.  So the alternative in a huge number of cases is that we will see a closure of employment agencies. It is desirable, particularly in the situation of employment in Ireland at present, that any agency or any way in which people are encouraged and assisted back to work should be helped and assisted rather than hindered.  The section is necessary.  Control must be exercised, but paragraph (b) is so allembracing and far-reaching as to have serious and harmful effects on employment agencies and how they work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear on the section, and the Deputy agrees, that we must include reference to the employment agencies because they have an important function in this area.  I want to make it clear that nothing in this section binds the employment agency to do otherwise than select the best person available.  The agency will not be prevented from selecting on grounds of competence.  The criteria of the agency, as before, must be that the job goes to the best qualified. What we want to ensure is that the agencies should not discriminate in lists supplied to employers, that lists should be in conformity with this Bill and should give fair reference to candidates of either sex.  Women equally competent with male counterparts and suitably qualified must be included in lists supplied to employers. <Col N="1554" /> We want to ensure that employers for their part cannot utilise agencies' services by asking for candidate lists to be drawn up of one sex only.  That is the intent of this section.  I do not think the Deputy is in disagreement with the necessity for the inclusion of such a section, but I understand he is worried about the drafting of paragraph (b), that it is too comprehensive and extends in too many vague, undisclosed, undefined directions.</P>
      <P>We have looked closely at the comparable section in the British Sex Discrimination Act, and all I can say to the Deputy is that I feel there is not any great difference between us. He and I are both agreed that we must have a section on these lines. He is concerned lest there be too wide an interpretation of paragraph (b) in the terms of services offered.  We are clear in our intent that we want to see the agencies act in fair fashion between candidates whatever their sex. Agencies should not be debarred from deciding and advising as before on grounds of competence.  We have a later amendment in section 18 which adds substance to this intent of ours as expressed in the section.</P>
      <P>I can undertake to the Deputy to have a look at this again on Report Stage and see whether I can be convinced that some of his fears as expressed here have any grounding in fact.  If I am so convinced I will certainly wish to alter the drafting as put down here.  For example, I want to be absolutely convinced by Report Stage that the employment agency has clear protection from liability where an employment agency may have been misled by a false statement from an employer.  It is important that an agency should not find themselves at the wrong end of the law because of a misleading statement from an employer who seeks the services of that agency.  I will look at that point again before Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's comments.  I detect his concern also that he is not entirely satisfied with the section as drafted.  I am not entirely satisfied with the amendment I have submitted as being the <Col N="1555" /> desirable improvement.  I have endeavoured to point out to the Minister the pitfalls and dangers for an employment agency.  To substantiate what the Minister said, I see the dangers of the employment agency being used as the fall guy for the less scrupulous employer, but fortunately there are not many of them in our society.  However, there is a danger that an employer may wish to hide behind the employment agency who may suffer the charge of alleged breach of this legislation. For example, an employer could phone an employment agency and say, when the staff member of the employment agency asks what is needed to fill this position &ldquo;Well, it is heavy work, it is this and it is that and because of that I do not want a woman.&rdquo;  In other words, the employment agency being employed by the employer could be used also as a shield.  I fully realise and appreciate the necessity for the section, but that section should not be open to any wider interpretation than is intended under this Bill.  At present the life of employment agencies is difficult enough without anyone making it completely unbearable.  The provisions of section 6 will make it more difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recommened the deletion of paragraph (b).  The Minister has said the section has followed more or less the lines of the Sex Discrimination Act in Britain.  That may well be so.  However I believe that, as a nation of thinkers and probably with legislators nearer to the people concerned and nearer to the roots of business, we know the real problems perhaps more thoroughly than our English counterparts. I feel there are no kudos to be gained by diligently following legislation they may introduce.  I can appreciate the Minister mentioning it; he must have a guideline and it understandable that he should be familiar with legislation being introduced there.  The entire section 6 should be looked at.  I am not sure my amendment even solves the problem in relation to the section, although it will improve it.  When the Minister is looking at paragraph (b) before Report Stage he could tighten that up so as not to give it the wide <Col N="1556" /> interpretation it has at present.  On that basis I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I have already stated the fears and concerns that arise under section 6.  I am sure the Minister when taking a look at my amendment on Report Stage will look at section 6 as a whole, and I would encourage him to define the intention of the section more clearly.  Nobody wants trivial cases being presented or allegations being made confronting everybody with more difficult problems, and leading to more bad industrial relations.  Legislation at present should not include or encourage trivial claims that would upset the balance of industrial harmony between employer and employees.  In any social legislation we must guard against the problem of disputes and industrial unrest being created.  If common sense had prevailed in the past a lot of man days would not have been lost and the resultant benefit to both sides, the increased productivity <Col N="1557" /> and the overall saving to our economy, would have been a substantial bonus. The loopholes in any legislation passed here should be closed up as tight as possible in the interests of the service provided by the employment agencies, whether by the National Manpower Service or a private agency. That service must be controlled but not unduly interfered with.  As a result of my plea I am confident that the Minister will re-examine this section so that it will be of greater service in eliminating discriminations without creating more problems.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) For the purpose of subsection (1), where in an advertisement a word or phrase is used defining or describing a post and the word or phrase is one which connotes a particular sex, or which, although not necessarily connoting a particular sex, is descriptive of or refers to a post or occupation of a kind previously held or carried on by members of one sex only, the advertisement shall be taken to indicate an intention to discriminate unless the advertisement contains a contrary indication.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The section makes it unlawful to advertise jobs in such a way that the advertisement could reasonably be interpreted as intending to discriminate. The amendment clarifies what is meant by unlawful discriminatory advertise&mdash; ments.  For instance if a job for a manager or a typist was advertised&mdash; occupations that would normally convey the impression that members of only one sex could apply&mdash;the amendment seeks that the advertisement should be further clarified by including a statement that men or women could apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy with that approach.  One of the problems against women in our society has been based on a frame of mind. Introducing a &ldquo;men or women can apply&rdquo; situation to an advertisement is continuing this attitude.  I would prefer to see it as an advertisement accepted by society generally as equally applying to men or women. Surely enough publicity has been given, through campaigns conducted by women's rights organisations, to maintaining equal rights for women. That is also a commitment of all sides of the House.  Admittedly attitudes may have to be broken down still in some fields of industry but generally I believe that opportunities are now being afforded to women.  I will not oppose the Minister's amendment, I am merely stressing a point of view. Pressure may have been put on the Minister by some women's organisations for this amendment.  I would like the impression to be created for our general public that an advertisement for a manager could be advertised inviting men or women to apply without the necessity of adding &ldquo;women may apply&rdquo; to the advertisement. The vast majority of society have accepted that and would be prepared to accept that when an advertisement appears for a managerial or any other such position, the application of a woman would be acceptable equally with the application of a man.  However, the use of the phrase &ldquo;men and women may apply&rdquo; seems to be continuing a differential between the sexes, a differential which in this Bill we are endeavouring to eliminate.  Consequently, I would urge the Minister to reconsider the amendment. Regarding the publicity given to the Bill, one correspondent has referred to it as an uninspiring piece of legislation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, for instance, in regard to an advertisement for a typist, a man would be reluctant to apply because he would consider the job to be intended for a woman.  Our aim here is to convey that a job may be applied for by either a man or a woman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not object to that.  There are some men who undertake typing duties in the course of their work but I expect there will always be some men who would not apply for the position of typist. What I am seeking is an explanation for the introduction of the amendment. Its inclusion in the Bill is not a step forward but continuing a sort of male-female difference.  I should prefer that the legislation would be sold generally on the basis that no man or woman would be prevented from applying for any job for which they were qualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's view is valid in that in an effort to prevent discrimination there would be no reference to sex in job advertisements. On the other hand there is a kind of constructive discrimination in a situation in which an occupation has long been identified with members of one sex.  This gives the impression that unless a potential applicant is of the sex with which the position is identified there is no point in applying.  Our aim is to break down this division of jobs on the basis of one's sex and to make it clear that people of either sex may apply for any job so long as they are qualified suitably to undertake the work involved.  That is the intention of the section and that is why I consider the provision to be necessary.  I might mention that similar provision was found to be necessary in the majority of countries in which legislation of this kind has been introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In those circumstances would the Minister be prepared <Col N="1560" /> to insert a provision whereby this part of the section would be subject to a time limit?  I appreciate his wishing to convey to the public that members of either sex may apply for jobs that are advertised.  I have no objection to that but I would have thought that it is a step backwards in regard to the elimination of a male-female difference to provide for reference to men and women in advertisements.  But if the Minister is convinced of the necessity for the amendment I am prepared to go along with him except to request that he put a time limit on the provision, say, for a year in the hope that by then there would be no need for its continuance by reason of the public taking it for granted that there would be no distinction in terms of sex.  I should think that once the legislation is passed there would be general acceptance that no discrimination would exist.</P>

It is anybody's guess how long such a requirement would be necessary.  In any case, I would not have the power to make that kind of charge under any regulatory powers.  However, the provision will be open to amendment at such time as it is regarded not to be necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to section 7.  In sections 6 and 7 we are talking about discriminating advertisements.  I am glad that the Minister has accepted the suggestion of <Col N="1561" /> an amendment providing for a date of termination.  We must make every effort possible to acquaint with the legislation such people as personnel staff within industry, small employers and those running employment agencies because in the early stages there will be room for offences under the Act although these offences may not be deliberate but due to people inadvertently disregarding the legislation.  In other words, an employer may forget that this legislation had been introduced and as a result may submit a discriminatory advertisement.  I would suggest that there should be a certain amount of leniency for a first offence during the first few months of the operation of this Bill.  Possibly a warning could be issued.  I appreciate that the Minister has powers under this section.  If such an advertisement did appear, a rap on the knuckles could be given to the employer; but I would have no sympathy for a second offence. A small employer who errs and introduces an advertisement that may be discriminatory should get a brief respite and should not have to pay a fine.  A rap on the knuckles would be sufficient for a first offence.  I am not saying that there should be a general amnesty for the first few months and I would have no sympathy with any major employer who would have personnel employed to follow up new legislation.  I would certainly have sympathy for the small employer and I am satisfied that these discriminatory advertisements will occasionally appear. The phrases &ldquo;men may apply&rdquo; or &ldquo;women may apply&rdquo; are a kind of catch-cry and I will not be happy until they are removed from advertisements. Hopefully, they will not have to be retained for too long a period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the wide interpretation of section 8.  The section states that a person shall not procure or counsel another person to do anything which constitutes discrimination.  That is very <Col N="1562" /> wide; it embraces anybody.  If you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in West Limerick or I in Mid-Cork held a &ldquo;clinic&rdquo; and in a moment of forgetfulness unintentionally gave some wrong counsel or advice to someone as a result of which they committed an offence under this Bill, would it be possible that you or I could be brought before the tribunal here on a charge?  There could be a very wide interpretation of this.  There is probably a necessity for it.  I presume that the Minister has seen this provision in legislation in other countries, but I should like to ask him if there is such a section in the Sex Discrimination Act in Britain to which he referred and if he has any knowledge of the operation of this section.  I am of the opinion that this has the widest possible implications for people who could be charged with having contributed to discrimination without any intention to do so.</P>
      <P>I am very wary of this kind of power.  I know that certain members of my party would allege certain things about the Minister if they were speaking here today, saying that he was proposing dangerous legislation and saying that we could all be apprehended in certain circumstances. I know this is not the Minister's intention and I should not like the Minister to be given this image, particularly during the last few weeks of this House and the run-in to a general election.  I should not like the Minister to have this real tough fascist image in his approach.  I would advise the Minister to water down this section between now and Report Stage. It is a dangerous section.  People could run into all sorts of problems through discriminating, however unintentionally. I should not like the Minister to have this sort of image at this time.</P>

      <P>In page 5, lines 30 and 31, to delete paragraphs (b) and (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment proposes to delete paragraphs (b) and (c).  This section deals with employment excluded from the terms of the Bill and the first one is the Defence Forces.  One can understand the situation that exists there but why the Garda Síochána and the Prison Service?  We are introducing a Bill to eliminate discrimination in employment but this is discrimination. During the period of office of a Fianna Fáil Government the Ban Garda force was introduced.  The only fault I have with that force at present is its size. They are an excellent group and do great work.  They gave a great image to the Garda Force but regrettably it has not been expanded in recent years. We rarely see a ban garda on our streets.  Why should the Garda Síochána be excluded from this Bill?  There may be sections that it would be difficult <Col N="1565" /> to comply with when recruiting but when talking about promotion through the ranks is the Minister saying that we should never have a female Garda Commissioner?  If we are to be consistent we must bear these things in mind.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the Prison Service.  We have heard a lot about prison conditions and problems in prisons in the last eight weeks. There is an excellent staff of female workers in this service and they play an important role, but under this Bill we are saying that the governor of a prison must be male.  Is that correct?  Why such an exclusion? It is desirable that these exclusions are deleted from this section. It may mean amendments to specific sections in order to facilitate entry or access or control of entry or access to promotion in these services but I would prefer to see that done rather than the total exclusion of the Garda Síochána and the Prison Service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy Fitzgerald.  I can understand the exclusion of the Defence Forces but not that of the Garda Síochána and the Prison Service.  It sets a bad headline to exclude the latter services.  The fact that women could rise to the position of governor of a prison might have a good effect on the prison where she is based.  Women may understand the problems of prisoners from a different point of view and that might lead to an improvement in the general conditions of a prison.  I visited Mountjoy recently and I was impressed by the female prison officers I met.  They should not be excluded from the highest possible promotion in that service. I agree also with the previous speaker about the ban gardaí. The fact that this section of the force was not expanded is a disappointment to us all.  The ban gardaí can do great work in areas where men are not suitable.  I cannot see any valid reason for these exclusions.</P>

      <P>These amendments would have the effect of bringing the Garda Síochána and the Prison Service within the scope of the legislation. Reasons have been given by the people <Col N="1566" /> in charge of gardaí why this is not possible at present.  There is the scale of prison security operations in which both services are engaged, the problem of night patrols in relation to police, and the difficulty of dealing with riot situations.  Those objections relate to the duties of gardaí.  In relation to the Prison Service I should like to state that our prisons are segregated at present in terms of prisoners held and little progress has been made to date in integrating staff of both sexes in our prisons.  However, as the pace of prison reform advances&mdash;we hope it will be possible to advance after this period during which our prisons are being used for other purposes than dealing with the ordinary cases they have been accustomed to in previous years&mdash;it may be possible to see a reform in the service.  This situation will be kept under review but at present I cannot see my way to accept either of these amendments.</P>

      <P>Since the the Bill was introduced the Minister talked a lot about the elimination of discrimination.  I do not think the ban gardaí should be excluded.  When Fianna Fáil were in office ban gardaí were promoted to the position of ban sairsint.  I feel strongly about this because ban gardaí cannot be categorised and therefore, they cannot be told to do a certain job within the Garda Síochána or that they cannot cope with a riot situation, as mentioned by the Minister, or the present security situation. In Galway we have two members of that service and we are lucky to have them.  Ban gardaí are entitled to equal opportunity with the male members of the force in regard to promotion. The purpose of the Bill is to eliminate existing discrimination but this section promotes more discrimination. I urge the Minister to accept that the Garda Síochána and the Prison Service should come under the terms of this section.</P>

      <P>The Minister should bow to the opinion offered by her.  I cannot agree with his argument with regard to the rights situation.  The question might be asked, how many rights situations were caused by people of both sexes?  The rights were not confined to only one sector.  The Minister's argument was not valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government and the Minister were critical in the past of the private <Col N="1568" /> sector which they considered was opposed to change.  We should ensure that the headline is set in the public sector.  In the two sectors referred to there is no serious problem that cannot be overcome.  Both services should be open.  Historians will claim that this Minister continued discrimination against women.</P>

      <P>We are eliminating subsection (e).  I bow to the Minister's superior knowledge and his research of the situation resulting in this amendment&mdash;in other words, eliminating the exclusion of employment by a minister of religion or a religious community.  However, I must question very closely how the Minister can reconcile this exclusion and his non-acceptance of the previous amendment relating to employment in the Gárda Síochána or in the Prison Service.  In my opinion this amendment makes this legislation interfere with the religious life or religious communities.  What is needed from the Minister is a definition of what is meant by employment by a minister of religion or a religious community.  Were it to cover the broad field of people working for a minister of religion or for a religious community then it would be very undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not our intention that that would be the consequence of the exclusion referred to in subsection (e)&mdash;by a minister of religion or a religious community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1570" /> Fears were expressed that such a consequence might be read into it, that the employment of nurses, teachers and so on might not come within the scope of the Bill if employment by religious was excluded.  Since it was not our intention that such categories be excluded we are deleting that subsection. But, in respect of enclosed religious communities, where all members of the community are religious&mdash;a religious or monastic community or something of that sort &mdash;we believe that subsection (d) will cover it.  That is why we think it unnecessary to retain subsection (e), especially if it gives rise to the idea that teachers, nurses and others employed by religious might be excluded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be my intention also.  But the Minister's amendment is misdirected.  I entirely agree that the categories of laity referred to by the Minister must be included in the terms of the Bill.  May I now put the opposite side of the story, as I see it.  For example, I would regard a bishop as a minister of religion.  If we take the Catholic Church, which is the dominant faith in this country, it would appear to me to apply to priests, parish priests, curates especially, in their religious life.  I am sure that was the original intention of an exclusion in the Bill. Of course this would apply to any religion.  I would regard this entirely as a decision of ministers of religion or of religious communities themselves with regard to their internal employment.  Naturally the Minister is including teachers, nurses and other members of the laity employed in schools, hospitals and elsewhere by religious communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basically I have no objection to the Minister's amendment, to what he intends to convey by it or what he hopes to achieve.  I am not satisfied with the way he has worded it.  Paragraph (e) having been included in the Bill initially, the impression is given that it is designed to cover specifically members of religious orders.  If that were so we would all agree with that exclusion.  Now the Minister wants to ensure that the laity employed by religious are not excluded.  But there <Col N="1571" /> must be some qualification to show that it does apply to laity employed by religious rather than infer that it applies to both laity and religious. Between now and Report Stage the Minister should tidy up the section to get that message clearly across.</P>
    <P>This Bill was hastily prepared&mdash; not a lot of thought was given to it, as is illustrated by the number of amendments down.  While I fully subscribe to the inclusion of the people to whom the Minister has referred, we must realise that legislation, once it has left this House, will be vetted by the legal profession, indeed by any citizen on the advice of any legal person, and various constructions put on it.  We entirely agree with the non-exclusion of the laity but this could be interpreted as meaning that members of religious communities are included in the terms of the Bill.  I know that is not the Minister's wish but I think he must clarify the position. The amendment itself could convey the wrong impression and I would ask the Minister to examine the position between now and Report Stage in an endeavour to eliminate any possibility of wrong interpretation.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), after line 33, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f) in lighthouses, light vessels and lighthouse tenders operated by the Commissioners of Irish Lights&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in isolated rock lighthouses, in lightships and tenders is that sleeping and sanitary accommodation are on a communal basis and there are many stations, like that at Fastnet, where it would not be possible to provide individual or separate sanitary accommodation.  The purpose of our amendment, therefore, is to exclude the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  The Bill could apply to the depot in Dún Laoghaire and to head office in Pembroke Street but it would not apply to isolated lightouses far removed from home base.  The Commissioners <Col N="1572" /> should be able to operate in such a way that there would be no disruption of the lighthouse service whether it be maintained on rocks, in light vessels or light tenders where it is not possible to provide additional accommodation.</P>
    <P>The IT &amp; GWU expressed opposition to this amendment.  I would say it was because they misunderstood its terms and believed we were aiming at exclusion of the Irish Lights Commissioners on a blanket basis.  That is not so.  The amendment refers only to isolated lighthouses, light tenders and vessels.  It does not in any way attempt to exclude employment in the depot or in the head office at Pembroke Street.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this reasoned amendment and the case made for it so excellently by Deputy Dowling.  He is a Commissioner of Irish Lights and I am an ex-commissioner.  I have never yet seen a woman appointed as a commissioner and, perhaps, Deputy Dowling will make a case for that.  I hope it is not our intention to exclude women from promotion at head office. Grace Darling had her father as a helper but I am afraid Irish Lights cannot provide fathers to help women employees even if the day will come when women will be able to take over the service.  There may have been a misunderstanding in some quarters about the effects of this amendment but Deputy Dowling has made a very clear case for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to section 14 (2) (e) which states:</P>
      <P>Where because of the nature of the employment it is necessary to provide sleeping or sanitary accommodation for employees on a communal basis and it would be unreasonable to expect the provision of separate such accommodation or impracticable for an employer so to provide,</P>
      <P>The case the Deputy makes is fully catered for in that provision where we deal with exclusions in certain circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that it is covered in section 14.  If the Minister feels that a valid case has been <Col N="1573" /> made for the amendmment, there is no reason why he should not accept it, or is it his intention to stuff young women into lighthouses in isolated places?  If that is so, it is a very serious matter.  I have been in lightships and I know the discomforts and the problems attached to communal living and to providing adequate sanitary accommodation, even now.  I do not see why women should not be excluded.  Perhaps the Minister has some reason for including them.  If there has been pressure through representation, he should let us know that so that we can discuss it fully and factually.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister feel females should be recruited into the lighthouse service and that they should go to isolated posts where there is communal living?  If he does, he should say so to the House and then he must exclude the lighthouse service.  If the Minister feels it is not on for females to be sent to isolated posts where the sleeping and sanitary accommodation is on a communal basis, he must ensure females are protected and that the Commissioners of Irish Lights are protected.  Does the Minister feel Irish Lights would be acting properly in recruiting females if somebody insisted on it?  If the Act were contested and the case won, what would the situation be?  If the Minister wants to protect the commissioners he must do so now on the question of lighthouses. Is the Minister satisfied that where sanitary and sleeping accommodation is on a communal basis the commissioners would be right not to recruit females?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a case for an exclusion where sleeping and sanitary conditions of employees are on a communal basis and it would be unreasonable to expect the provision of separate accommodation.  Paragraph 14 (2) (e) provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where because of the nature of the employment it is necessary to provide sleeping or sanitary accommodation for employees on a communal basis and it would be unreasonable to expect the provision of separate such accommodation or impracticable <Col N="1574" /> for an employer so to provide.</P>
    <P>That would cover the case of the lighthouses in the circumstances referred to by the Deputy.  He asked me the reason for my reluctance to accept his amendment.  If we give a specific exclusion related to Irish Lights vessels and their operations, we would begin to open up the possibility of the exclusion of smaller fishing ships generally. One of the purposes of this Bill is to open up jobs to women which have hitherto been closed to them by custom.  For that reason, we have kept exclusions to the minimum.  In general. I do not favour the exclusion of shipping and the fishing industry from the scope of the Bill.  If they wish, women should be free to get jobs on board ships.  In the fishing industry there are indications that already a few women are taking on jobs.  It is not because of any particular representations but because of my desire to see that we do not lay a basis for the exclusion of the fishing industry from the scope of the Bill, that I do not want this exclusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is well aware, light ships and lighthouse tenders are purpose built boats.  In a general way I feel shipping should not be excluded.  There is a vast amount of expenditure on the service.  There is movement amongst the personnel. Some of the personnel are displaced when maintenance personnel proceed from one station to another to carry <Col N="1575" /> out repairs on light ships.  The situation in relation to the tenders differs from that of fishing as does the question of light vessels.  While lighthouse tenders may in some way differ from light vessels and lighthouses, personnel are there for a considerable period of time while the tenders may be able to move in and out of port.  Would the Minister agree that lighthouse vessels and lighthouses should be considered as distinct from lighthouse tenders which can move in and out of port?</P>

It could happen that they would be marooned or stranded there for months and we could not use their services. That is a very valid point.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that in practically every county there is an application for an increase in instructors?  Is he further aware that these instructors are at the moment engaged largely on paper work?  Farmers have to be categorised and the agricultural instructors have no time to go out to help farmers with the field work and draw up a plan so that they can get a grant.</P>

      <P>I am not so aware.  In the country as a whole we have at the moment 83 senior instructors between CAOs and deputy CAOs. <Col N="1578" /> We have 360 permanent instructors, 49 temporary instructors, 114 permanent clerical staff and 11 temporary clerical staff.  The clerical staff would, of course, cover horticultural instructors as well.  The country is well catered for so far as instructors in agriculture, horticulture and farm home management are concerned.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that all farmers have to be put into their different classes before they can get any grants.  Two years ago the instructors did not have to do that work.  They are doing it only since the farm modernisation scheme came along and they now have no time to do the work they were trained to do, namely, go out and advise the farmer in the field.</P>

      <P>May I take it from the Parliamentary Secretary's reply that there is no scarcity of land bonds for the purchase of land?  At the moment there is a big trade in land in anticipation of the report of the committee who are now sitting and in anticipation of the probability of some restriction on the sale of land.  A great deal of land is being offered for sale and my information is that there is a go-slow because there are not enough land bonds available.  I know people do not like land bonds.</P>

The recent issue, the 15 per cent land bonds, sold on the stock market yesterday at 105.50 and the Minister has created an additional fund of 14¾ per cent bonds to pay for land this year so there are bonds available for the purchase of land and these bonds are of good value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>While a notice under section 40 of the Land Act, 1923, as amended by section 29 of the Land Act, 1965, has the effect of prohibiting the sale, transfer, letting, subletting or subdivision of the holding concerned <Col N="1581" /> for a certain specified period, the main reason for the service of the notice is to afford the Land Commission an opportunity of inspecting the lands to ascertain their suitability for the purposes of the Land Acts.</P>
      <P>By virtue of an order made under section 27 of the Land Act, 1965, the determination of the lands to be inspected has been delegated to officers of the Land Commission not below the rank of senior inspector.  In deciding whether an inspection is called for in any particular case the inspector will, of course, have the benefit through his own local knowledge of the general conditions and the land requirements in the district.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that the fact that a holding is sold does not in any way prejudice the power of the Land Commission to carry out an inspection subsequently or to institute acquisition proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply is correct, but the Parliamentary Secretary is surely aware that if a holding is sold privately you have to go after the new owner.  Unless the order is put on and unless the holding is inspected before it is sold, it is twice as difficult to take it from the new owner.  You have to take him to the High Court for possession.  I asked for orders to be put on a few holding of land.  Some of them were put on since the question went down, some of them have not yet been put on and some of the lands were sold.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that the Land Commission know.  They do not know everything&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary know that there is a <Col N="1582" /> large number of sales of small pieces of land at the moment?  This is mainly because people with small businesses and probably little off-farm employment are afraid that they will be taxed on the bit of land.  They think that the price is good now, even though we hear it is not, and they are trying to sell the land.  We want the Land Commission to be in a position to put on the order&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is aware that as a result of an industrial dispute at Irish Steel Holdings Limited 180 employees were laid off last Friday week with a possibility of a further lay-off; and the steps he is taking to intervene in the interests of restoring and maintaining employment and production at the plant.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a number of employees of the company were laid off on Friday, 15th, and there were further lay-offs on Friday, 22nd.</P>
      <P>The adjudication committee of the Employer-Labour Conference considered this dispute at a meeting held on Wednesday, 20th April, and issued its findings to the parties to the dispute on Friday, 22nd April.</P>
      <P>These findings are being considered by both sides and I understand that an industrial relations officer of the Labour court has arranged for a conciliation meeting to take place today between the parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not a result of a Dáil question?  It does get <Col N="1586" /> action.  Might I ask the Minister, in view of the fact that there are now approximately 300 employees laid off as a result of the dispute, if he would not now agree that disputes such as this, costing the Exchequer so much money by way of social welfare payments and man-days lost, creates industrial unrest and industrial chaos throughout the country?  Is it not true to say that the early warning system in his Department has been an absolute failure and could he now not look at ways and means of rapid intervention before a strike situation escalates to the point where 300 jobs have been lost by now and if it is not settled by the weekend there will be further losses?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is amazing the treatment I get in this House when one considers the way Questions Nos. 2,3 and 4 were handled earlier today. In view of the Minister's reply regarding the interventions of the 20th and 22nd April, which occurred since the question went down to him&mdash;although three weeks had elapsed in the dispute at that stage and it was obvious to all concerned that there would be lay-offs &mdash;could he not now ensure that there would be a re-intervention by his Department in a dispute of this nature where a majority of employees are not at all concerned with the strike situation?</P>

      <P>I will comment to the Deputy that I am fully satisfied when he refers to the early warning unit of my Department&mdash;by which I presume he means the monitoring unit of my Department&mdash;that it has proved of solid assistance since its inception and I am totally satisfied with its workings. Of course in the case of each dispute, as the Deputy knows, it is a question of judgment whether it is wise on each occasion that the Minister for Labour of the day should intervene in a dispute.  In most cases it is preferable to see negotiations proceed through the appropriate channels, and this is what is happening in this case.  With an officer of the Labour Court intervening today the whole dispute has been seized on by the Adjudication Committee of the Employer-Labour Conference and is being dealt with between that body and the Labour Court.</P>

One new 40 megawatt extension to each of the existing peat-fired stations at Shannonbridge and Lanesboro are to be constructed.  In addition it is likely that a 40 megawatt unit will be constructed at Shannonbridge.</P>

There is no question of this project having been shelved by this Government or by me.  As Deputy Kitt says, consideration was given to this ten years ago and nothing was proceeded with.

They will be in here with motions in Private Members' Time condemning and complaining about the cost of electricity and at the same time they want to embark on a means of generating electricity which is not economic.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs why a telephone has not been installed for a person (named supplied) in County Galway who applied in February, 1974, and was promised a quotation in January, 1977.</P>

      <P>Terms have now been quoted to the applicant and the telephone will be installed within about three months of the agreement being completed.</P>
      <P>When the promise of a quotation by January, 1977, was made it had been expected that it would be possible to provide service by about April or May. I regret that this did not prove to be practicable because work already programmed took longer to complete than had been anticipated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received notice that this man would be quoted within three weeks terms for the installation of the telephone but I got notice also in October last that he would be quoted in January.  However, can the Minister say why the delay has occurred in this case having regard to the fact that since this application was made seven telephones have been installed in the area?  Would the Minister agree that since the man who is living in an isolated area has a child who is subject to becoming ill suddenly, requiring him to have medical attention, the case should be treated with priority?  The man concerned is very annoyed that he should be left waiting while other people in the area were accommodated.  I trust that the three weeks delay we are being told of now will not turn out to be a six months delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's concern and I regret the delay that occurred in this case.  It was longer than expected.  This was due to the fact that a certain volume of engineering work in the area took longer than anticipated.  This work concerned mainly the provision of service for applicants who had applied in 1972 and in 1973 and where the linework involved was abnormal. Diversion of construction staff to repair work necessitated by abnormal weather conditions also adversely affected the construction work programme but the Deputy may rest assured that the service will be provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the case made for this amendment portrayed a wrong conception of what <Col N="1614" /> the Bill is all about.  In support of his amendment Deputy Dowling argued that there was a need to protect women from the hazards of working on lighthouses.  A great deal of the discrimination which exists, exists under the guise of protecting women from various hazards and hardships.</P>
      <P>The Bill is designed to give women the opportunity to take up employment on equal terms with men in all areas hitherto closed to them.  Let women themselves be the judges of whether the job is suitable for them. For far too long the judging has been done for them.  Of course, there are jobs which are not suitable for all kinds of people, and there are people who are not suitable for all kinds of jobs.  I know jobs which are not suitable for men, and I know men who are not suitable for them.  We do not insert a paragraph in a Bill to exclude them from that kind of employment. I suggest it should not happen in this case either.</P>
      <P>On several aspects of discriminatory legislation the argument has been made that sanitary and sleeping accommodation prohibits the opening up of certain jobs to men and women. That argument is pretty well overplayed, particularly in relation to sanitary accommodation.  We have all had experience of communal traffic on trains and planes, and we still have not got to the stage where we have to send a special train or a special plane for women passengers, or men passengers, as the case may be.  That argument can be overplayed when people want to resist change in this area.  The Bill is intended to open up all areas of employment to women.  For practical purposes, if there are reservations they are covered adequately in section 14 (2) (e) of the Bill.  Therefore, Deputy Dowling's amendment is not necessary and I do not see any reason why the Minister should have another look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling asked the Minister whether he wanted to put girls working on lighthouses.  I submit it is not a question of what the Minister wants or does not want.  It is what women want.  If women want those jobs, they have the right to decide for themselves. <Col N="1615" /> For far too long discrimination has been preserved under the guise of protection. That should be finished with and let women who are rational, intelligent, adult, human beings decide for themselves.  I would oppose any change in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reflection on the ability of women to do particular jobs.  The basic conditions in lighthouses and rock stations cannot be changed.  They cannot be extended because, in most cases over the years, they have been extended to the limit. The facilities there are not suitable for women for employment of the type Deputy Desmond suggested they might like to pursue.  Sanitary and sleeping accommodation could not be provided for them.  Deputy Desmond seemed to suggest that if women are prepared to accept communal living with men on lighthouses, that is all right.  I do not hold with that.  She seemed to imply that if women are prepared to accept communal living, communal sanitary and sleeping accommodation with men that is OK.  I do not think that is right.</P>

      <P>There should be certain protections in this Bill.  If there are areas where women can be employed, there is no reason why they should not be employed.  The rocks cannot be extended.  The lightships are purpose built.  The women I know would not be prepared to take their chance in communal living in lighthouses. I would ask the Minister to ensure that the Commissioners of Irish Lights are protected from the point of view of the efficiency of this important service which protects mariners.</P>

      <P>I do not want to see the entire Committee Stage of this Bill marooned on the promontories of the Irish coastline or the rocks around our coast.  Section 14 (2) (e) provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where because of the nature of the employment it is necessary to provide sleeping or sanitary accommodation for employees on a communal basis and it would be unreasonable to expect the provision <Col N="1616" /> of separate such accommodation or impracticable for an employer so to provide,</P>
    <P>Therefore, an exclusion possibility is open to an employer.  I explained to the Deputy that if we are to give an exclusion for lightvessels, and so on, we will be forced logically to give consideration to excluding small ships in general.  One of the purposes of the Bill is to open jobs to women which have hitherto been closed to them by custom or general practice.  That is why we have kept the number of exclusions to the minimum.</P>
    <P>I do not favour excluding shipping and the fishing industry from the scope of the Bill.  If they so wish, women should be free to get jobs on board ships and in the fishing industry.  There are some indications of a growing interest on the part of women in the fishing industry which is expanding.  If there are real problems of accommodation referred to by Deputy Dowling, there is a section which gives the employer who would look for an exclusion in such circumstances a way out.  He will have to prove in accordance with section 14 (2) (e) that it would be impracticable to provide separate accommodation under the headings I have mentioned.  That is adequate to meet the Deputy's case and any fears he may have about lighthouse accommodation.  As I said, I will look at it again between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>It appears that the provisions of this Bill are directed towards the private sector rather than the public sector.  We should avoid that and I would ask the Minister to withdraw the amendment. The Local Appointments Commission make appointments and promotions in local authorities and in other branches of the public sector.  If that sector does not set an example for the private sector, there is no hope that this Bill will work.  It reminds me of what happened with regard to the legislation dealing with equal pay.  It has not been implemented fully in the public sector.  The House should not agree to an amendment that excludes the public sector from the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Deputy has said.  This is a further example of inconsistency. Deputy Dowling made a request on behalf of a small number of people but in this case there is a massive exclusion of people appointed by the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn pointed out, the Local Appointments Commission operate throughout the country and they are one of the most influential appointment bodies.  Those of us who are members of local authorities know that traditionally many areas of employment are regarded as the prerogative of men but <Col N="1618" /> this need not be the case.  I remember the occasion when the first woman did an engineering course in University College, Cork.  It was regarded as most unusual at that time but now the scene has changed drastically and very much for the better.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how the Minister could contemplate excluding an entire sector, as he is proposing here. Is he telling us that the Civil Service Commission or the Local Appointments Commission are above this legislation?  It is a ridiculous anomaly. The Minister appears to concentrate entirely on the private sector.  I realise that there could be problems in the public sector as well as in the private sector but that does not justify the Minister making this massive exclusion.</P>
    <P>There was a certain amount of confusion in the section as originally drafted but in this instance the amendment clearly excludes the appointments made by the Local Appointments Commission and the Civil Service Commission.  The Minister has a duty to tell the House how many appointments were made by both of these bodies in the four years since he has been in office.  I expect the number is substantial and it means that large numbers will be excluded.  Section 6 affects private employment agencies and the National Manpower Service and the exclusion in this instance is at variance with that provision.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission are excellent bodies and I have never heard any questions raised about their appointments.  Last night we debated a motion in this House.  That matter related to the political skulduggery that went on in a certain county; in that instance it was not a question of sex discrimination but political discrimination. An unsuitable candidate was appointed to a position and the man responsible is now a Minister of State.</P>
    <P>The Local Appointments Commission and the Civil Service Commission are admirable bodies but as far as this Bill is concerned they are entitled to discriminate against women if they wish.  Section 2 states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1619" /> (a) where by reason of his sex a person is treated less favourably than a person of the other sex,</P>
    <P>Both of the bodies concerned can so discriminate and they will not be brought to an inquiry under the terms of this Bill.  Similarly, if they treat a person unfairly or discriminate against somebody on marital grounds, they will not be penalised under the terms of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a duty to withdraw the amendment.  We should set an example in the public sector.  It is difficult for those in the private sector to understand why their appointments may be investigated by the agency appointed under this legislation when this does not apply to the public sector. The Minister should explain why there is this exclusion.  He should also tell the House the number of persons appointed by the two bodies referred to from 1973 to date.  By dividing that number by four we could have an annual figure of how many people are being excluded.  The Minister told us he has kept the exclusions to a minimum but in this instance an accusing finger can be pointed at him, as was done on the matter of equal pay.  I am sure the Minister will have the figures I requested because, obviously, it must have been researched before the amendment was brought before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true I have kept the exclusions to a minimum and that has been my objective in this legislation.  I should like to make it clear that people appointed in any part of the public sector come within the scope of this legislation; in their training and promotion all the provisions of the Bill will apply.  All that is sought here is that the actual selection process of the Civil Service Commission, which is an autonomous agency, will not be subject to the provisions of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criteria adopted by the Civil Service Commission have not been questioned in the past, certainly not in the lifetime of this Dáil.  That criteria are based on the merits of the candidates. <Col N="1620" /> The exclusion was included because of the nature of that recruiting agency for the public service.  I should like to make it clear that it is only the selection process that is excluded. So far as people appointed to the public sector are concerned, in their training and promotion the full provisions of the Bill will apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have expected it to be part of the Minister's argument to say how small the groups were but the argument does not stand up because it is the selection process which is excluded from the Bill.  We are prepared to accept the word of a certain group of people and to say that a certain body cannot err.  A person who may feel aggrieved or may claim to have been discriminated against has no redress under this legislation, yet in the private sector the field is wide open.  If we are serious about the introduction of social legislation, about industrial peace, about equal opportunity of promotion, appointment and selection for women, then let us set the headline in the public sector and in no way exclude these appointments bodies from the terms of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows that he is defending a very weak position.  I know that he believes in the truth of what I am saying and that this amendment should not be made.  Where has the pressure come from for the giving of this sacrosanct power to appointments bodies within the public sector?  We constantly hear the complaint from the private sector about how well the public sector is protected.  Unfortunately on this occasion the public sector is protected in an entirely different way.  Both these appointments bodies are excellent and should be open to scrutiny if somebody feels aggrieved or discriminated against. I would ask the Minister to withdraw this amendment and give an assurance <Col N="1621" /> that he will re-examine the situation between now and Report Stage and produce the figures for the four-year period to which I have referred so that we can get an average of the numbers excluded annually.  Any number of years would do.</P>
    <P>Are the implications of this provision a reflection on the appointments bodies themselves?  Has extreme pressure been brought to bear on the Minister or does he genuinely feel that these two bodies should not be open to review?  None of these arguments justifies the exclusion of the Local Appointments Commission or the Civil Service Commission.  They may be absolutely fair in their appointments and there may never be allegations of discrimination made against them. That is not important.  It is important that the same facility must be given to the individual in the public sector as is given to the individual in the private sector.</P>

      <P>What about my queries?  Why exclude these selection bodies?  We all know that there is no hindrance to anybody in entering the public sector or in applying for the jobs available but there appears to be a shielding of these two selection bodies. They may never discriminate and probably never will.  In all probability they would be models and would never have a case of discrimination brought against them.  The Minister will have to explain to the House the grounds for this exclusion.  We are entitled to press for this information.  We are cooperating <Col N="1622" /> with the Minister on this Bill and we will continue to do so but unless there are grounds for this exclusion we cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The view is that the selection processes are the only ones that are excluded.  In making appointments throughout the public service these bodies will have to obey the provisions of this legislation.  Certain grades in the civil service are at present single sex, for instance, there are clerical assistants (female) and post office technicians (male).  This differentiation must cease on the passage of this Bill.  That is understood.  We have looked at the workings of the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission and there is no evidence to suggest that there has been any sex discrimination in their work in the years preceding this legislation.  All that is sought is the exclusion of the selection process itself.</P>

      <P>As I said this morning, there will be trivial claims, human nature being what it is, and there will be justifiable claims as well. I expect that there may never be a case against either of these bodies but the opportunity must be there for an individual to seek redress in the same way as in the private sector.  It seems that, for some reason or another, the Local Appointments Commission are not being asked to answer to the Employment Equality Agency.  It is not those people for whom we are legislating; we are legislating for the person who may be interviewed before that body.  Those people must have access to that agency if they feel they have a grievance.  They may never feel it but the access must be provided.  Because I feel the Minister agrees with the sentiments being expressed, I would ask him to withdraw the amendment and research it further between now and Report Stage because it is not acceptable in its present form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few points on the section itself. There have been a number of amendments which have given it fairly extensive coverage.  I note that subsection (2) (a) says that notwithstanding subsection (1), the Minister may by order declare that this Act shall apply to such class or classes of employment referred to in that subsection as may be specified in the order.  In new legislation I suppose this is desirable.  Certainly I would hope that the exclusions already part of the Bill&mdash;I am referring particularly <Col N="1624" /> to employment in the Garda Síochána and in the prison service about which we failed in our vote this morning&mdash; would be kept under constant review. I am somewhat worried by the exclusion in sub-paragraph (d) of subsection (1).  I think I know what the Minister is trying to get at by this exclusion.  But suppose a person has a business in a private residence, in the garage of the home, what is the position then?  Is there an exclusion in that respect?  I would ask the Minister to ensure that the paragraph as it reads is specific enough and not open to abuse by somebody operating a small business in his backyard, garage or some such place who might claim to be excluded under that subsection.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the description &ldquo;close relative&rdquo; has been defined. Who decides what is a &ldquo;close relative&rdquo;? How close is a &ldquo;close relative&rdquo;? To what degree of relationship does it extend, again, to prevent abuse there?  Perhaps the Minister would examine that paragraph between now and Report Stage with a view to tidying it up.  I do not want to make any of this legislation a sort of bonanza whereby legal people can find all sorts of loopholes, making cases where none should be made and creating problems for all concerned.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25a:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 11, to insert the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;11.&mdash;This Act shall not apply&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  where the total number of employees does not exceed five persons (including part-time employees), or if the employer has more than one establishment the total number of all his employees does not exceed five persons,</P>
      <P>(b)  where special treatment is given to women in connection with pregnancy or childbirth,</P>
      <P>(c)  where special provisions are made in relation to pension schemes,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1625" /> (d)  where by tradition the membership of particular religious professions are restricted to one sex.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are some exclusions listed here that I have constantly believed would help all our social legislation.  The small employer gives me a lot of cause for concern.  There are throughout our community many such people who are not perhaps familiar with legislation emanating from this House and perhaps not financially equipped to comply with all of its conditions.  I am not for one moment suggesting that such people be entitled to discriminate in any way.  I have been consistent in my pleas here for exclusion of people with under five employees.  That is not because I want to afford them any liberties, not because I want them to be allowed discriminate in any way, on grounds of sex or marriage but in regard to this entire package of social legislation some of them are constantly worried and saying: &ldquo;There is new legislation now.  I should take on another one or two people and I am not going to&rdquo;. In other words, encourage these people but give them a little protection while they are so small.</P>
    <P>There should also be a specific exclusion where special treatment is given to women, for example, in connection with pregnancy or childbirth. If there cannot be equality there, they are entitled to a special circumstance situation.  They are not entitled to be asked to do the same work for at least part of that period.  But facilities should be made available to them to work for as long as they like or can healthwise and so on.  I should like to see that facility specifically provided in the Bill.  The Minister may answer that it is so provided in another section.  But I could not find where that type of special facility or flexibility within their places of employment was given to women in such circumstances.  This may be over and above an equal conditions situation.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) of my amendment says:</P>
    <P>Where special provisions are made in relation to pension schemes,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1626" /> The Minister may say that that is excluded already.  This is a very wide area, one about which we will be hearing a lot more in the near future, with the current European discussions and so on taking place.  I refer especially to private industry here.  We all want to see the introduction of an overall pensions scheme in industry generally, private as well as public.  It exists already in the public sphere.  There have been rapid strides made in that direction.  But anomalies can arise in relation to these schemes.  I think private schemes, for the most part, take the woman's retiring age at 60 and the man's at 65.  Because they are talking in a term of years, say from the present day to retiring age, the premiums are payable in respect of men and women and special allowances have to be made in relation to such schemes.</P>
    <P>No doubt in the not too distant future we will have the bones of an overall pensions scheme and this will present a lot of administrative problems because of the necessity to amalgamate present schemes, some of which are in no way comparable with others, some of which are good and some bad, probably the worst being CIE.  There are areas which deserve special consideration.  Deleting the section completely, as the Minister has done, may give an impression that we are now interfering with religious groups.  However, I do not propose to divide the House on this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am glad Deputy Fitzgerald has announced his intention not to press the amendment, which I do not think would improve the Bill. There are people who will have difficulty in coming to terms with all the legislation passed in the area of employment, but there are ways available to convey this information to them.  Therefore to say that people do not know is not a good defence for the case being made.  Deputy Fitzgerald spoke about the need to encourage small employers to take on an extra employee or two.  If this amendment were accepted it would have the reverse effect.  On the question of special treatment for women in pregnancy or childbirth, there are provisions in the <Col N="1627" /> social security code and there is therefore no need for inclusion in this Bill.</P>

On the question of preferential treatment for pregnant workers, I will have a look at it before Report Stage.  However, I do not think we can deploy any reasonable argument in favour of the exclusion of employments involving five or fewer workers.  For instance, in a small shop employing four, a girl should have equal chances in employment even though the work force is relatively small.  For these reasons I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

The ideal position would be that people would know from the legislation itself how they were affected.  The reality is that they do not.  Most small shopkeepers and businesses are not members of employers' organisations.  They are tied up trying to keep little shops floating and there are no organisations to provide them with information.  However, it is not a point I would wish to divide the House on.</P>

      <P>This, like section 8, is an all embracing section.  It states:</P>
      <P>Nothing in this Act shall make it unlawful for an employer&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) to refuse employment in a position to a person who will not undertake all the duties attached to that position or who will not accept all the conditions under which those duties are performed, or</P>
      <P>(b)  to dismiss from his employment a person not undertaking all the duties attached to the position held by that person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1628" /> This could be wide open to abuse.  An employer could use it, as it stands, to get around the entire Bill.  Of course an employer is entitled to reject an unsuitable or an incompetent person or one who has not the required qualification for a particular job.  Nobody is denying that right to an employer, but I do not think it makes for good legislation to have provisions like those in sections 8 and 11.  Therefore I ask the Minister to tidy it up before Report Stage.  The first paragraph makes it lawful for an employer to refuse employment to a person who is unsuitable.  Is it necessary to write in such a provision in the Bill? In my opinion it is not.</P>

      <P>I wish to support Deputy Fitzgerald.  In times of high unemployment an employer might well write in that an employee may not join a trade union or must join a certain trade union.</P>
      <P>It is Victorian to write such a provision into a Bill.  I agree an employer must have a right to select an employee and must safeguard the well-being of his firm by employing those whom he thinks possess most ability, but I cannot understand why the Minister writes such a provision into a Bill because it can be abused, particularly at times of high unemployment.  When there is high unemployment people agree to almost anything an employer suggests in order to get a job.  The Minister should have another look at this provision.  The Bill would be greatly improved without it.</P>

      <P>This is a provision which I do not very much care for but it is one that employer groups insisted on being inserted to protect them from what they saw as a far-reaching change in legislation in this area.  As Deputies have stated, it is a common sense situation that if a person is not ready to carry out the duties of a job for which he was employed he should not be employed in that position.  Employer organisations made the point on many occasions that this provision should be written into the Bill.  It must be clear that if the aggrieved person is convinced that he or she was not <Col N="1629" /> employed for discriminatory reasons the redress machinery provided in the Bill is available.  The provision was inserted to deal with the common sense situation, as employers saw it, of a person who was not ready to carry out the duties he was employed for.</P>

      <P>The Minister will recall that the Women's Representative Committee in their submissions had reservations about this section.  Their case was that it is normal employment practice to accept all the conditions of a job, whatever that job may be, and they did not think it was necessary to write such a provision into the Bill.  In fact, they felt it was dangerous to write in such a provision because an unscrupulous employer might vary the conditions of employment even while women were in the job.  An unscrupulous employer might introduce an element of heavy physical employment into a job thereby making it impossible for a woman to remain in the job.  It might be argued by the Minister that there is other legislation under which they could have redress but this seems to be a dangerous provision and the Minister should have another look at it.</P>

I hope the Minister has heeded the fears expressed by both sides of the House in this regard.  One of his own Deputies has agreed with us on this point.  While it is a good thing to have discussions with employers and trade unions in order to improve legislation, it is the Minister's duty to ensure that any legislation passed here is the best possible.  It is the duty of the Opposition to co-operate in any way possible in this regard.  Under this provision an unscrupulous employer may when interviewing females and males for any position pile on the duties for females.  He would be discriminating in that way.  This is a reasonable argument and a reason why the section should be tightened up so as to avoid any pitfalls that may arise.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 25 (b):</P>
      <P>In page 6, lines 8 to 19, to delete subsections (2) and (3).</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding any provision of this Act, nothing done by an employer in compliance with any requirement of or under an Act to which this section applies shall constitute discrimination in contravention of this Act.</P>
      <P>That part of the section is acceptable but subsections (2) and (3) are not.  I do not wish to be personal in my contribution because the Minister may not be long in that position and his successor may come from these benches in the not too distant future. However, whether it is this Minister or his successor, we are giving extensive powers to a Minister to amend or change.  I have already suggested to the Minister that under this Bill he gives himself, or his successor, the power to amend a section by order in the event of the climate being right to effect a change.  Under this section powers are given to a Minister to interfere with the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1938, the Factories Act, 1955, and the Mines and Quarries Act, 1965, by ministerial order.  I do not agree that any Minister is entitled to assume to himself such mandatory powers.  It impresses me as being bad legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister, after thoroughly investigating the Bill, finds it necessary to introduce certain amendments he has power to submit the formal amendments to the House.  If his reasons for doing so meet with our approval and the sections he proposes to change are found to be discriminatory he will get our support, but I question the right of any Minister to take on to himself such extensive powers which cover this Bill and four Acts.  I have no doubt that certain sections of those Acts should be <Col N="1631" /> amended but they should be specified in this Bill so that we can consider them.  Any reference to the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, prompts me to remark that the Act is a tribute to a former Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>That was a great Act and one ahead of its time.  It has served the country and employment well.  Rather than push these subsections through I would suggest to the Minister, and he will have the co-operation and assistance of this side in doing so, that he should introduce whatever amendments are necessary in the light of experience.  There is no reason why such amendments should not have been found in the interim and, if they are introduced on Report Stage, then we can agree or otherwise to them.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister is affording some protection to us men in this Bill.  As the law stands at present, there may be discrimination against women who need extra training. However, the employer may feel it is unfair to ask him to pay for the training and to pay the person while she is being trained, and that it would be much better if he took on a trained person which might be a man. Therefore, he will take on the man because the woman is not trained, even though the Bill has facilities for training the woman.  The Minister might consider offering some compensation to the employer who gives extra training in order to show that he is no male chauvinist and that he wants to be fair to women.  I think it is unfair to ask him to foot the bill for the training.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We thought it necessary to clarify what was meant here in regard to the sex occupational qualification.  What we wish to ensure by this amendment is that it is not intended that a woman should not be considered for a job because physical strength or stamina is the major requirement for the job. Since physical strength and stamina are generally associated with the male sex, we wanted to have further clarification of that characteristic of the <Col N="1635" /> job.  The amendment has the effect of basing judgment in such questions on the physiology, on a scientific assessment, of the person concerned, which means that the employers, the Labour Court or the courts of law would have to consider whether the individual man or woman in question possessed the characteristics necessary for the job. In other words, the individual himself or herself, rather than the sex of the individual, would be the determining factor.</P>

If the workload begins to build up, this legislation will get off to a bad start and the reaction to it from both sides will not be good.  As many cases as possible should be channelled away from them.  The safeguards should be contained in the Bill so as not to have an overload of work given to the equality agency.

I merely ask: is the Minister happy and convinced that he is right to delete it?  If he is, we can discuss it on Report Stage.  I do not know what information may be available to the Minister and his Department about how many of these posts there would be.</P>

      <P>In page 6, subsection (2), after line 54, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(g) where the nature of employment involves work outside Ireland and in other countries whose laws or customs are such that the job can only be done, or done effectively by a person of one sex.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have had approaches on this amendment. We have a number of companies going outside the country.  I refer specifically to engineering contracts in the Middle East.  Our state company, the ESB, are sending a group of people to some of these projects.  Very serious difficulties could be encountered if, for example, women are concerned. Possibly it will not mean exclusion but it will mean an equality agency travelling to the Middle East or wherever the problem would be to sort out the sanitary and sleeping arrangements.  That safeguard shall be built into the legislation.</P>

    <P>This is in relation to the change of equal pay officers into equality officers because the duties they carry out under the Bill are a little more extensive than those under the Equal Pay Act and therefore it is appropriate that their title should be changed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1641" />&ldquo;(5) Save only where a reasonable cause can be shown, a reference under this section shall be lodged not later than six months from the date of the first occurrence of the act alleged to constitute the discrimination.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to provide a time limit of six months for bringing a case of unlawful discrimination other than retaliatory dismissal. That is the same time as was proposed in this Bill under the Equal Pay Act. At that time that limit was considered a reasonable period in which to bring an action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have consistently disagreed with the time limits laid down by the Minister in this.  I am a firm believer in fast, snappy settlements to any difficulties that arise.  It is fair to both employer and employee because otherwise there is a certain dragging of feet by everybody and that does not help relationships. For that reason I would ask the Minister to reduce to half this term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made this plea in many other Bills before the House.  I am convinced that a grievance grows with time, and that the six month period is too long. The genuine complaint will be submitted fairly promptly.  The length of time given will only help a person who has a weak case.  The sufferer in this case will be the equality agency.  I do not want this agency to be overburdened with work that will only create a backlog for it which will be harmful to the successful work of this legislation.  As I have said, the experience in England with all the tribunals has been that a very high percentage of the cases coming before them were regarded as trivial, and that led to what is known as the £50 settlement.  I know that the Minister does not want that situation to arise here.  We want to see genuine cases being brought before the agency and dealt with properly.  If too many cases come before the agency, their work will become less efficient because of the backlog that will grow.  For that reason I would encourage a reduction of that period from six months to <Col N="1642" /> three months.  There has to be an adequate time but I am satisfied that the genuine cases of discrimination will be lodged promptly and they should be dealt with effectively and quickly by the equality agency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The six months are necessary.  We are all concerned with the efficient functioning of the agency but this Bill exists for the people against whom discrimination is taking place and not for the agency. Deputy Fitzgerald made the case that small employers may not be aware of this legislation or of their rights.  We must make them aware of their rights. That is even more the case in relation to many of the people who will be the subject of claims under this Bill. The question of informing them of their rights and of getting advice and so on will arise.  A time lag must be allowed if they are to get justice under this Bill.  Cutting six months down to three months will not be of benefit to the people whom we are seeking to help under this Bill.  The section makes provision for longer than six months where reasonable cause can be shown for the delay.</P>

      <P>I will not make an issue of this, although I am convinced that three months would be far more desirable with special consideration being given to cases with a justified long delay.  I have consistently made the point that in legislation where adjudicating committees work the sooner decisions are taken the better. Evidence should be taken at a time when it is fresh in the memory.  I am sure we have all experience of even a slight road accident where there are two conflicting stories and where each person involved believes his own story and the story becomes more firmly fixed as time elapses.  However, I have no objection.</P>

    <P>We discussed this point during the course of many Bills.  It is in relation to cutting the time of the appeal being lodged in the court.  The Minister may be reluctant to listen to my plea but I am convinced that no matter to what extent we encourage people to act promptly there will always be those who will be late.  Every Deputy must be aware of this.  Whether the final date in question be in respect of a third level education grant or anything else, there will always be somebody who will apply after the final date.  With these various pieces of legislation the Labour Court will have <Col N="1644" /> to contend with a certain amount of extra work in the nature of deliberations, consultations, appeals and so on.</P>

      <P>The Minister has acceded to my suggestions in regard to many aspects of these various pieces of legislation.  He has made changes that make it easier for the ordinary person to understand what is involved.  In this case I trust he will see his way to reducing from 42 to 28 days the period in which an appeal can be made to the Labour Court.  By encouraging prompt action in this way we will be enacting better legislation, legislation that will improve the efficiency of the operation. Nothing could be more harmful in investigations of the sort envisaged under this Bill than prolonged periods of delay.  Very often our courts are criticised by reason of the long delays that occur especially in appeal cases. In regard to this Bill we must remember that the person who considers himself to be aggrieved may be a very conscientious person who wishes to have his case heard quickly.  Consequently, I recommend acceptance of amendments Nos. 37a and 46a.</P>

      <P>I consider 42 days to be the minimum time for an appeal to be made against the recommendation of a pay officer.  There is similar provision in the Equal Pay Act.  This gives the employee just enough time to cope with any delays in obtaining the necessary information to allow him establish a case of appeal.  The period we are providing for is only a fortnight longer than that proposed by the Deputy.  I consider that extra fortnight to be necessary to allow for any margin of delays because in this area of industrial relations delays may arise for various reasons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">

If there is pressure on the Labour Court steps can be taken to extend it, possibly with special provision for dealing with claims.</P>

      <P>This section relates to the Labour Court situation. As I have said, the extra duties being allotted to the Labour Court will create a certain amount of extra work.  We must encourage both sides of our industrial society to allow us as few opportunities as possible for these cases to be brought before the agency or, indeed, before the Labour Court. In regard to the Unfair Dismissals Act I said that the ideal would be that there would never be an unfair dismissal but, human nature being what it is, the ideal is never achieved. So far as this legislation is concerned the ideal would be that there would never be a discrimination but again there will always be such cases and these cases will be put through the procedures outlined in the Bill. It will be for the court to determine whether there was discrimination in any case.  All we can do here is to discourage the public from bringing trivial cases before the tribunal or before the court because if there were to be a glut of trivial cases, the efficiency of the whole operation would be lessened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would recommend to the Minister that his Department should operate a more progressive public relations policy within industry generally.  People on both sides should be informed of the details of this legislation through shop stewards, various unions and workers' groups.  Very few people will ever read the contents of this Bill unless they have a particular problem. <Col N="1646" /> The Minister's Department should make available to the work force a brief synopsis of the Bill's contents so that people will know their entitlements. A synopsis should also be made available to the employers and this would ensure the more efficient working of the legislation and possibly prevent acts of discrimination taking place.  It could well be the case that an employer would not be aware of the situation.  Let us make every effort to streamline the working of this legislation to ensure that justice is done and that cases of discrimination do not arise.  Such a flow of information from the Minister's Department could prevent a large number of such cases which could bog down the equality agency, ruin their efficiency and give this legislation a bad reputation because of the backlog of cases.  This applies to other Bills we have been discussing over the last few months.</P>

Amendments Nos. 49 and 50 provide for similar amendments to section 9 (3) (a), section 10 (1) (d) and section 10 (3) (a) of the Equal Pay Act, which cover redress for retaliatory dismissals on equal pay cases.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is accepted. I should like to ask the Minister why he has returned to &ldquo;re-engagement&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;re-instatement&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>28.&mdash;The Agency shall have, in addition to any functions assigned to it by any other provision of this Act, the following general functions&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to work towards the elimination of discrimination in relation to employment,</P>
      <P>(b)  to promote equality of opportunity between men and women in relation to employment,</P>
      <P>(c)  to keep under review the working of the Act of 1974 and this Act and, whenever it thinks it necessary, to make proposals to the Minister for amending either or both of those Acts.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 52 and 53 prescribe the broad general functions of the agency and the functions assigned to the Minister which the agency will take over when established.  Amendment No. 52 concerns the broader functions of the agency, namely, general promotion of equality of opportunity of employment between the sexes.  Under amendment No. 53 the role of the Minister is to ensure enforcement of the law in the public interest which normally would involve cases of unlawful discrimination affecting the public generally.  This is the purpose of both amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments contain the machinery to empower the agency to encourage proper use of this legislation.  By that I mean not bringing cases to be heard but avoiding such cases by having little or no discrimination. Amendment No. 52 refers to the following function:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1659" /> (a)  to work towards the elimination of discrimination in relation to employment,</P>
    <P>I consider this a most important function, for more important than adjudicating on or hearing cases.  The old motto of prevention being better than cure applies in most walks of life and certainly it applies here.  For instance, if a person carries out ordinary maintenance on his car he will have a more efficient piece of machinery.  The same principle applies to human and industrial relations.  They can be operated far more harmoniously if the right kind of climate is created.</P>
    <P>I was amazed that the Minister introduced this Bill without its most important part, namely, the agency.  They will now have many new powers.  Much of the content of the Bill has been devoted to the procedures regarding investigations, appeals and compensation.  I should like to see the agency devoting all their time to the functions set out in amendment No. 52.  The contribution of the agency under these headings would be far greater than adjudicating on difficulties although I accept that they will have to do a certain amount of that work.</P>
    <P>I commit the support of my party towards assisting the agency in this operation.  I have always believed that human and industrial relations can be encouraged.  There will be obstacles and setbacks but if there are people in the agency committed to the elimination of discrimination we will have achieved something worth while.</P>
    <P>The promotion of equality of opportunity between men and women is a commitment of this party.  We have had worth while discussion on parts of this Bill and many improvements have been carried out.  Nevertheless more improvements can be effected and I hope the Minister will accede to the many points we have made on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 52 further states:</P>
    <P>(c)  to keep under review the working of the Act of 1974 and this Act and, whenever it thinks it necessary, to make proposals to the Minister <Col N="1660" /> for amending either or both of these Acts.</P>
    <P>I presume the Minister is assigning to the agency the function of reviewing the working of the 1974 Act and I have no doubt they will report to the Minister consistent with the points I have been making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to commend the Minister on broadening the scope of the functions of the agency to include the three provisions set out in amendment No. 52.  I envisage the agency as being in a position to highlight discrimination and to inform the people likely to be the victims of such discrimination of their rights under this legislation and the various measures dealing with equipment.  I am sure the agency will pinpoint the factors contributing to discrimination.  They could go back to education, to a period long before the people concerned reach the age where employment is a factor in their lives.  The amendment also provides that the agency will keep under review the working of the 1974 Act and this legislation and make submissions to the Minister.  The agency will be well equipped to do that.  It is wise to give them the opportunity of making known their views to the Minister regarding any improvements that might be made.  This is a step in the right direction and it will give the agency a role in policy-making in the future.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;30.&mdash;(1)  The Agency may undertake or sponsor such research and undertake or sponsor such activities relating to the dissemination of information as it considers necessary and which appears expedient for the purpose of exercising any of its functions.</P>
      <P>(2)  Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the Agency may draft and publish for the information of employers guidelines or codes of practice relating to discrimination in relation to employment.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Agency may make charges for any services provided by it under this section&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment enables the agency to sponsor research or such activities relating to the dissemination of information aimed at eliminating discrimination. A programme of education will have to be undertaken about discrimination in employment intended to change public attitudes and banish as much prejudice as possible.  It is envisaged that the agency will be a principal source of information and advice for the general public about this Bill and the Act relating to anti-discrimination. Information activities would include producing guidelines, codes of good practice for the information of employers and explanatory leaflets for both employers and employees.  This is the central purpose of the agency in their public enlightenment role.</P>

      <P>I will not oppose this amendment.  The Minister told us what will be the main functions of the agency.  Let us hope that is so.  This is my wish, too, but my fear is that too much of the agency's time may be spent in determining and investigating disputes.  That would be a tragedy because if the agency worked in the direction that is intended, they would achieve far more for the benefit of the community at large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very concerned about subsection (3) of this new section.  I notice <Col N="1662" /> the Minister shied away from this when he spoke on this section, which says that the agency may make charges for any services provided by them under this section.  What is envisaged here?  What kind of charges has the Minister in mind?  For what services would the charges be made?  Who would determine the value of those services and the extent of the charges?  I do not take from the agency the right to charge in those circumstances, but one must ask for more details about what is intended here.</P>
    <P>We are talking about research and information activities.  It is desirable that these services be carried out by the agency, but what are they charging and whom?  What services will they provide? Is there any danger that they will be charging for investigating disputes or for advising people on how to avoid discriminatory practices?  I believe this agency are providing a service to the State, the individual, the community and the employment scene.  I am very concerned to know what charges the Minister has in mind.  Is this a new departure?  Has he been encouraged by his colleague, the Minister for Finance, who seems to be always short of money, to get more money to pay for these tribunals?  A more detailed explanation is expected from the Minister on that paragraph.</P>

      <P>It is right that they should charge, but then there is the danger that the people who should purchase this material may not do so. The cost of one hearing would far exceed the printing costs of any literature that may have been involved.  The overall cost to the State, the employer, the employee and the productivity lost by both sides would more than compensate for the cost of printing and publicity.  I would be afraid of that section.</P>

      <P>We have guidelines and codes of practice relating to discrimination.  This would be for the guidance of employers, to explain exactly what is involved in this legislation. Booklets will also be published about the provisions of this Bill for the information of employees.  If we did not ensure that employers had literature to tell them exactly what they were required to do under law, they could make the point that they were not notified.  It is part of the job of the agency to ensure that employers knowing their obligations under this legislation, will abide by them, and that we will have less friction and difficulties because of this knowledge.  That is why the agency refer to employers in this section.</P>

      <P>Yes, one of the prime requirements of the agency would be that all the positive features of the Bill are made known to the employers and employees.  We thought it necessary that employers should be specifically told their obligations.  If they were unaware of the provisions of the Bill they are the people initially, who would stand to be in the greatest difficulty because there are penalties if they do not comply with its provisions.

      <P>&ldquo;41.&mdash;(1)  A person who considers that there is or has been discrimination in respect of him by another person, or that there is or has been a failure or neglect by such other person to comply with an equal pay clause (within the meaning of section 7 of the Act of 1974) or with an equality clause under section 4 or to implement a determination or order of the Court under section 17 or 22 or under section 8 or 10 of the Act of 1974, may apply to the Agency for assistance in making a reference to the Court or an equality officer.</P>

    <P>This amendment provides for the agency to assist the individual who considers that he has been discriminated against in referring a disputed case to the Labour Court or to an equal pay officer of the court under the Equal Pay Act.  However, the agency may assist an individual only specifically where the case raises a question of principle, where it is unreasonable, having regard to the complexity of the case or of the position of the individual <i>vis-á-vis</i> the other party, to expect the individual to deal with the case unaided or where some other special consideration applies&mdash;for example, because of retaliation&mdash;in particular where such individuals are unorganised, not in trade unions or already in secure employment.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to this amendment.  The functions are being dished out so liberally to the agency I hope they get around to performing them all.  That would be my greatest concern.  I consider the establishment of an agency the focal point or most important aspect of a Bill such as this and that without it the Bill would be worthless.  I should like to make sure that the agency would not be completely bogged down with an overload of work.  The functions mentioned here are very desirable. However, I believe the Minister has a duty to examine carefully and monitor the operation of this system at the commencement lest, because of a work load or too many cases coming before it, the agency would not be able to devote sufficient time to functions that I believe are more important in the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must appreciate also that in relation to this Bill probably it will take some time to get the machinery oiled. The establishment of the agency is fairly urgent.  I hope the Minister will <Col N="1674" /> give consideration to the appointment of people suitably qualified, that the policy operated by his colleagues in office, and by himself also on occasion, will not be the guiding instrument by which appointments will be made to this very important agency that will have, among other functions, those allocated to it under this amendment. From the beginning the important thing is that the agency be given an opportunity of establishing their priorities. The priorities I would envisage for them would certainly not be in the field of too many adjudications.  The fewer of those they have the better for the agency and for the future of this legislation.</P>

      <P>I should mention in relation to this section that on Report Stage I will have to consider the exclusion for a limited period of panels already in being from the scope of the Bill.  Already competitions have been held and successful candidates placed on a panel.  If the Bill comes into operation quickly before a new competition is announced, they would have to withdraw from the existing panel.  It is to enable them to do this that it may be necessary to give exclusion for a limited period.  I may have to do something on Report Stage to that effect.  As we saw earlier, all appointments to the public service will come within the scope of this legislation. But there are already panels of successful candidates drawn up.  If this Bill becomes law, next month we <Col N="1677" /> would be forced to re-examine the whole position.  That would be unfair to the candidates.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is consistent with some amendments put down to earlier Bills and accepted by the Minister in the case of the Unfair Dismissals Bill.  I have been for long critical of the term &ldquo;anti-discrimination&rdquo; being applied to any of this legislation.  I have never believed in the word &ldquo;anti&rdquo;.  It always struck me as a sort of opposition to something rather than taking a more positive, progressive approach.  I have no doubt that the Minister set out in his early days in Government with the intention of boosting his party or <Col N="1678" /> Government's image.  Four years later, we see the disastrous effects.  At that time he was pointing out all he would do, all the discrimination he would eliminate in the social field.  Now that the performance has levelled out, there is no point in continuing this.  For that reason I have moved an alternative Title, Equal Opportunities (Employment) Bill, 1977.  The date on the Title at the moment is 1975.  It was introduced then but it was not touched until 1976.  In section 30 the Bill states:</P>
    <P>(1)  This Act may be cited as the Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Act, 1975.</P>
    <P>In years to come when history is being written it will be known it was not a 1975 Act and it might be embarrassing for the Minister to see that date and realise it did not become law until a few days before the election in 1977.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is concerned with the creation of a new means of appointment of the Director of Consumer <Col N="1684" /> Affairs, a means different from the one which existed in the Bill as originally drafted.  The main features of the new procedure are that, firstly, the Director will be appointed by the Civil Service Commissioners after an open competition and secondly, that the appointment will be open to anyone in the State who has the necessary qualifications.  It will not be confined to personnel already within the civil service.  However, on appointment the director will become a civil servant and have all the immunities attached to that status.  The appointment will be for five years but will be renewable.  The director may be removed from office at any time by the Minister but the Minister will have to lay down a statement giving the reasons for such removal on the table of the House. These will be open to discussion in the normal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, if the Minister decides to remove a person he will not be able to replace him with somebody of his own choosing.  The Minister will be confined, by the provisions of this section, to appointing somebody through the procedure of open competition and he will have no direct control over the person chosen by that procedure. Therefore, there will be no question of his appointing somebody who might in any way reflect his own views or the views expressed to him by some pressure group as to who would be the appropriate personality to hold the post of director.  Criticism has been made of the fact that any power exists for the Minister to remove a director.  Some people felt that such a move should not be allowed to take effect until there has been a resolution approving it passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas or some other such proceeding.  That view was expressed by Deputy Haughey. The safeguards already contained in the Bill in relation to the personality and the means of appointment of a replacement and the requirement of laying the reasons for the removal before the House are sufficient and stringent enough.  There is no doubt that the Opposition of the day will probe any unreasonable action by the Minister involved in the proceedings. They will be able to take effective <Col N="1685" /> action against any capricious move by a Minister in this area.</P>
    <P>The danger of going further would be that if the director for some reason or other ceased to be effective&mdash;that could happen through illness of one sort or another or if he had in some way compromised himself&mdash;it is desirable that the post be vacated as quickly as possible and the business of the director which is quite considerable be allowed to be carried on by the replacement. If the Minister is not allowed to remove the director at any time but is required to go through a lengthy procedure before any such removal can take effect there is the danger that a person would continue to hold on to a post while he was not effective in it either by reason of illness or having compromised his position in some way.  For that reason it is our submission that the best procedure is to allow the Minister to remove him quickly but to submit the Minister to the requirment of having to explain the reasons for such action subsequently very fully.  The knowledge that he would have to do that would be a sufficient check on the Minister against acting in a manner which is not in the public interest in removing the director.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the effort of the Parliamentary Secretary to cover the questions put to him by Deputy Haughey yesterday and I appreciate that the Minister's position is a difficult one.  I welcome the reaction of the Parliamentary Secretary to the contribution by Deputy O'Malley on Second Stage and his amendments to this section.  In fact, he goes a long way to try to meet the requirements because, as I see it, this amendment covers amendment No. 21 in the name of Deputy O'Malley.  This is a dual purpose amendment because it covers both appointment and removal from office but it does not meet the requirements in Deputy O'Malley's amendment No. 22.  It gives the director some greater security from political interference by the Minister at any given time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last evening the Parliamentary Secretary made an effort to answer a question posed by Deputy Haughey <Col N="1686" /> with regard to the obvious contradiction as between subsection (2)&mdash;the office of director shall be a position in the civil service&mdash;and subsection (4) (a).  As far as I understand it, it is the Government collectively who remove a civil servant from office.  That is a reserved function, if you like, of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The distinction here is between removing a civil servant from the civil service, which would have to be done in the way mentioned by the Deputy, and removing him from this particular office, which is what is in question here.  If he were removed from the office of director he would not necessarily be removed from the civil service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a convenient answer.  In the original Bill it was envisaged that this office would be filled by an officer from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Now it is the Civil Service Commission who will select the officer.  As the Parliamentary Secretary said a moment ago, it could be anybody; it need not necessarily be a civil servant.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with a comment the Parliamentary Secretary made last evening.  There was a Bill dealing with mergers and monopolies.  That has disappeared.  Originally it was not the intention to create this post but I welcome its creation.  Now the powers of the director can be extended.  I also welcome the Parliamentary Secretary's reaction to Deputy O'Malley's amendments and to his contribution on the Second Stage.  I give him full credit for taking the advice given to him on that occasion and bringing in amendments on the lines suggested.  All credit to the Parliamentary Secretary for doing this. Now the Parliamentary Secretary states he would not be removing the director from the civil service if he proved unsuitable. I find this a little too much to swallow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is dealing with the removal of the director from the office of director.  If he were being removed from the civil service that would be a different matter and that is not dealt with in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us assume the director selected by the Civil Service Commission is not a civil servant.  On taking up the office of director he becomes a civil servant, and in due course he is found wanting.  Up to the time of his appointment as Director of Consumer Affairs he has not had any experience in a Government Department. If he becomes an alcoholic and the Minister in his wisdom decides he is not fit to continue in that office, an arrangement is to be made whereby this person will be side-slipped into the civil service.  This is where the danger lies.  If he is a civil servant, he may be removed from office by the decision of the Government.  Here is a specific case of one civil servant who cannot be removed by a decision of the Government. He can only be removed by a decision of the Minister, and that decision and the reasons for it must be <Col N="1688" /> laid on the table of the House.  Nowhere in the amendments submitted by Deputy O'Malley did he go so far as to suggest how you would get rid of the director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>The first part of subsection (3) of section 9 of the original Bill read:</P>
      <P>The Director shall hold office for such term as may be determined by the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley's amendment No. 22 sought the deletion of the remainder of the subsection:</P>
      <P>and may be removed from office at any time by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I was a member of the Government over a period and in that capacity I was a party to the removal of civil servants from office for one reason or another.  No member of the Government ever enjoyed that situation.  The Parliamentary Secretary is not a member of the Government, but I remember, particularly as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs having to send recommendations on those lines.  It was never a pleasant function, and I can say categorically that I had a predecessor&mdash;perhaps I am made of sterner stuff&mdash;in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs a number of years before me whose health had broken down because of the distress occasioned to him by the necessity for him to sign files to the Government recommending this action.  One can visualise why such action becomes necessary in that Department.</P>
      <P>In regard to decisions of this kind which are built into our legislation, it is felt that members of the Government will not act improperly collectively when it comes to the removal of civil servants from office, and I think that history will have shown that.  I admire the effort made here and I am not specifically opposing it, but I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, between now and Report Stage, to have another look at this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many reasons why people have to be removed from office, for <Col N="1689" /> instance, health.  If a Director of Consumer Affairs is appointed for a five-year period and after three years he gets a stroke or a heart attack, the Minister can remove him from office and there is no embarrassment in disclosing the reason why.  However, in the other case I have mentioned, that of the alcoholic, he has been selected by the Civil Service Commissioners as being fully qualified to perform this very serious and responsible function. Then he develops this sickness.  We in Ireland have different interpretations of that sickness.  The Parliamentary Secretary may say that it should not be necessary for the Minister to remove him from office.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce calls him into the office and says he must remove him from that office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is not.  What is in the amendment is that he will be appointed by the Minister following a recommendation by the Civil Service Commission.  Subsection (3) of the amendment states:</P>
      <P>A person appointed to be the Director shall hold office for a period of five years but the Minister may, if he thinks fit, continue the appointment (including an appointment previously continued under this subsection) for such further period not exceeding five years as he considers appropriate.</P>
      <P>Am I reading correctly that he can be appointed for five years and that appointment can be extended for another period of five years?  Does the bracketed portion &ldquo;(including an appointment previously continued under this subsection)&rdquo; mean that he can be employed for five years and continue his appointment for a further period not exceeding five years and that he can continue to do that?</P>

We will not get on to the section tonight. I will concede this amendment to him, but I want to express an opinion and ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider it between now and the next time.  The bracketed portion should be omitted.  People go stale in office.  It happened to us.  It happened to the Government before they got started, but the situation is that ten years is long enough for this Director of Consumer Affairs and it would be advisable that he be removed from office.

      <P>In page 7, subsection (5) (a), line 22, to delete &ldquo;description&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;descriptions&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is purely an amendment to correct the text as there may be more than one <Col N="1692" /> description involved.  It is suggested that we should use the term &ldquo;descriptions&rdquo; in the plural rather than the singular.  The section says:</P>
    <P>(5)  The functions of the Director shall be</P>
    <P>(a) to keep under general review practices or proposed practices in relation to the advertising of, and the provision to members of the public of information in relation to and description of goods, services, accommodation and facilities.</P>

      <P>In page 7, subsection (5) (b), line 25, to delete &ldquo;he&rdquo; and to insert &ldquo;the Minister requests him to carry out examinations or where the Director&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is to allow a Minister to request the director to carry out inquiries into particular matters. The Minister, naturally enough, is going to be responsive to public opinion and is going to be in touch with it through Deputies in the House. It is desirable that he should have this power and the director should have the power to comply with a request from the Minister to carry out an inquiry in relation to a particular matter on which any Deputy or any member of the public might go to the Minister and say &ldquo;Look, this aspect is worth inquiring into&rdquo;.  It goes without saying that the Minister would not have the power to influence the director's findings.  He would merely have the power to ask him to inquire into a matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a serious amendment. Again I have difficulty.  The Parliamentary Secretary is suggesting that we amend subsection (5) (b) from:</P>

      <P>to</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1693" /> ...where &ldquo;the Minister requests him to carry out examinations or where the Director...</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with the functions of the director.  Subsection (4) which comes immediately before the one we are discussing says:</P>
    <P>The Director shall be independent in the performance of his functions.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that this independence is maintained if it is built into this section that he should carry out his examinations of such practices when he considers in the public interest such examinations are proper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will recollect that last night I was dealing with the position in regard to the people who comprise the selection board at a meeting of which directions were given in relation to Laois Vocational Committee. I pointed out that the committee comprises one member of the Irish Vocational Education Association, two inspectors from the Department of Education, and Councillor Thomas Keenan, who has been a member of Laois County Council for approximately 21 years.  Another member is the Minister for Defence, Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan, who has been a representative of the constituency of Laois-Offaly for over 30 years.  Another member is Councillor Fleming, whom I have known for many years.  The seventh person on the committee is Canon Grey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that the representatives of the IVEA will be only motivated with ensuring that the best possible <Col N="1694" /> person is selected to fill the appointment. The two representatives of the Department of Education, I am convinced, will act in a completely impartial manner.  Councillor Thomas Keenan is a hardworking, dedicated public representative who I am certain has acted according to his conscience in making this selection which is the subject of the motion before the House.  The people of Laois Offaly in electing Deputy Flanagan for so many years have indicated their high opinion of him and I am certain that Councillor Fleming acted with the best motives. Canon Grey is not a member of the Fine Gael Party so no matter how one looks at it there are four ordinary members as against three politicians. I would like Deputy Lalor to put on the record of the House whether or not he doubts the integrity or the honesty of Canon Grey.  From what the Deputy stated last night it seems that he questions the Canon's honesty and integrity.  The Deputy should put on the record of the House the motivations he attributes to the three politicians who are members of the Committee, and the motives he attributes to the four non-politicians.  There has been a tremendous amount of confusion created by this request for a public inquiry by Deputy Lalor.  It got widespread publicity and the matter should be further clarified by the Deputy.  The record should also show that Mr. Parsons is a fully-qualified teacher.  This appears to have escaped the notice of some people.  The judgment of Judge McWilliam on page 3 says:</P>
    <P>On receipt of this letter, the Committee obtained counsel's advice as to whether the provisions of clause 12 (b) of the Memo were mandatory or not and was advised that the provisions were merely a recommendation and, at a meeting of 10th June, 1974, proceeded to appoint Michael Parsons to the post as and from 1st September 1974.</P>
    <P>The point is that counsel advised the committee that Memorandum V.7. was merely a recommendation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>What counsel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1695" />
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>A counsel that they had consulted.  I do not know who.  It is not referred to in the judgment.  The Deputy should bear this advice in mind.  The judgment also pointed out that Memorandum V.7. was not binding on the Minister although there would be evidence of the improper exercise of his powers were the Minister to ignore his own requirements without reason.  It would appear also that this would not be binding on the committee.  I am convinced that the committee were acting in good faith.  It is stated in the final paragraph of the judgment that Mr. Parsons is neither principal nor acting principal of the school and that the committee are bound forthwith to take such steps as may be necessary to appoint a principal to the school.</P>
      <P>A public inquiry at this stage would be against the spirit of the judgment and would lead to a long delay in the appointment of a principal.  Those who would suffer from such a delay would be the pupils of the school and I do not believe that either Mr. Parsons or Mr. Phelan would welcome such a situation.  It would be no harm to recall some inquiries that have taken place in the past on foot of legislation.  There was the inquiry into the RTE programme on illegal moneylending.  The resolution setting up the tribunal in that case was passed here on the 17th December, 1969.  The tribunal sat on 51 days but did not report until 5th August, 1970.  In 1957 there was an inquiry into cross-channel freight rates. The relevant resolution was passed on the 23rd October, 1957, and the hearing took 25 days.  The committee did not report until the 4th May, 1959. Further back, in 1944 there was an inquiry into the Dublin milk supply situation.  In that case the relevant resolution was passed on 30th November of that year and after 22 public sitting days and 91 private sitting days the committee reported back on the 30th December, 1946.  There is no justification for a public inquiry on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lalor has told us that he did not consult with Mr. Phelan before tabling this motion.  If he had consulted with Mr. Phelan I am sure he would <Col N="1696" /> have been advised against taking this action because Mr. Phelan would have had the interest of the pupils at heart. The Minister has stated that he considers an inquiry to be inappropriate, one of the reasons being that an advertisement has been published seeking candidates for the post.  The closing date is Friday next.  We can rest assured that the bringing before the House of this motion will not encourage any man or woman to apply for the position. Instead, interested parties will be deterred from applying.  On the last occasion there were nine applicants. I wonder how many applications have been received to date on this occasion. Deputy Lalor has made a great mistake in seeking a public inquiry into this matter.  This question has been going on for the past three years and Deputy Lalor has not missed any opportunity of capitalising on it.  Mr. Justice McWilliam in his judgment did not seek to compel the committee to appoint Mr. Phelan to this position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lalor has placed much emphasis on the question of Fine Gael monopolies but in this regard he should look to his own house.  I have here a copy of the <i>Leinster Express,</i> dated April 16th, 1977, and in which is published a report of what occurred in Laois County Council when, in the absence of two Fine Gael Councillors, Deputy Lalor assumed control.  When, in regard to the sending of a party to London, Councillor Taaffe suggested that one person from each party go on the trip, Deputy Lalor replied &ldquo;No, we are in control now&rdquo;.  Apparently, what Deputy Lalor suggests is wrong so far as Fine Gael are concerned is all right when Fianna Fáil are in control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reason for Deputy Lalor tabling this motion is his desire to get as much publicity as possible from it both in the national and in the local papers.  This stems from his being scared of Councillor Hyland in the light of his success in the last local government elections. The people should be made aware of Deputy Lalor's motives.  We might recall that in his own area he was the third candidate to be elected and that Councillor Hyland headed the poll, having received 1,146 votes as against 656 votes for Deputy Lalor.  Councillor Phelan received 684 votes.  Obviously, Deputy Lalor is endeavouring to win back dwindling support not only for him but for his party in Laois-Offaly.</P>
      <P>It is to be deplored that Deputy Lalor is trying to get publicity and make capital out of this situation.  He has put down this motion in order to achieve some little bit of publicity and notoriety so that he can keep ahead of Councillor Hyland in the general election. In the past he was able to control the organisation in County Laois.  He could put up somebody who would be able to gather a few votes and he would come home ahead of him. Councillor Hyland is now in control and Deputy Lalor is trying to obtain some publicity.</P>

He did not talk about the facts of the case because he could not do so.  I know that this would not happen in Offaly and that Deputy Enright would not be a party to it.  We conduct our affairs in a proper way.</P>

      <P>Here was the Mafia of Fine Gael.  There is no point in saying that they were not members of the Fine Gael organisation.  Three were not.  Who appointed the four representatives on the interview board? They were appointed by Fine Gael. The most extraordinary thing was that the recommendation from the Laois VEC was signed by four who were in favour of the candidate they thought should get the job.  The other three, the two officials from the Department of Education and Mr. McCann, did not sign the document.  Why not? They knew that the Laois VEC was in breach of an Act.  That is the position and no twisting or hunkersliding can get away from that.  Some of the representatives on the VEC are well known to twist and turn and somersault anyway they like when it suits them.  The pupils are the ones who have suffered during the last two years and the administration side is not going very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we get back to the facts of the case from a legal point of view. Laois VEC sought the opinion of a senior counsel and he did not seem to think they had a great case.  We all know what legal people do.  They say &ldquo;You might do well&rdquo;.  You go into court and they tell you when you are beaten &ldquo;It was the wrong judge and you should have been in court No. 4 instead of court No. 2&rdquo; and you then have to pay the piper.  Laois VEC have to pay the costs of this.  That is the position.  There has been some talk about the money coming from a Central Fund or from the Department of Education, but it should come from the pockets of the people who saddled <Col N="1699" /> us with this situation.  I am not in the legal profession and know very little about it but it costs a few thousand pounds to open the doors of any court. The costs in this case must be substantial. At the next estimates meeting will Laois County Council have to vote extra money to the Laois VEC to pay for this bungle in trying to put someone into a job who was not qualified?  It is as simple as that.  This matter has dragged on for a very long time and, as far as I know, the members of Laois VEC were informed legally and otherwise that they were in breach.  I want to put on record that the minority of members on the Laois VEC were not a party to this. They knew they were wrong but what could they do?  They are now under a cloud through no fault of their own. It was the fault of the Fine Gael monopolised Laois VEC.  Deputy Enright talked about monopolies.</P>

The big boys in Fine Gael said &ldquo;We will shove you out if you do not row in with us.&rdquo;  Deputy Enright was interested in everybody when he was speaking.

      <P>Deputy Enright talked about a public inquiry.  In 1972 he wanted a public inquiry into the affairs of a very good company giving very good employment in Offaly, namely, J. and L. F. Goodbody in Clara.  He is now talking about the expense involved in a public inquiry and he does not want a public inquiry. He cannot have it both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter has been dealt with at emergency meetings and other meetings. The local papers said &ldquo;Another saga.  VEC in more trouble.&rdquo;  The former Minister for Education would not agree to the appointment, and I <Col N="1701" /> have no doubt the present Minister will not agree either.  Will the candidates who will be interviewed next week or the week after be fully qualified? Will we have more compromising? Deputy Enright said this matter should not have been raised here.  Why not?  Laois VEC are in breach of memo V.7.</P>
    <P>I do not see the Minister for Defence here who led the show for them down the country.  He has now planked himself on the interview board.  I thought Ministers had to resign from all councils and local committees.  Now it seems there is a new rule.  The Minister for Defence must have said to the Leader of his party &ldquo;I will not resign. You can do what you like, but I will not be moved.  I will hang on.&rdquo;  He is hanging on to see how the election goes so that when he is defeated he can revert to the committee.  He probably likes to have a leg in both camps. He defied memo V.7. and tried to say it could be changed.  He tried to twist it.  The correspondence shows he defied the Minister and wanted his way, right or wrong.  I do not know whether the applicant he has in mind has the qualifications, but he may have. It will be interesting to see what he will do.  The interview board is Fine Gael controlled.  There is no use in anyone trying to tell us it is not.</P>
    <P>After the High Court case the Laois VEC wanted to rush through an advertisement and get it in the papers as quickly as they could to the effect that they had won.  I believe an official from the Department of Education rang up the Laois VEC and told them to hold their advertisement.  They had to ring the papers in a panic and ask to have the advertisement withdrawn although it was with the printers.  When he was summing up Justice McWilliam said the VEC were in breach of the regulations. As I said earlier about senior counsel's opinion, you can always leave your options open.</P>
    <P>A letter was sent to the VEC on 7th March, 1975, by a senior counsel stating it seemed to him it followed that the Minister is entitled to direct the VEC to make another appointment where he has declined to approve of the earlier appointment or appointments. <Col N="1702" /> To me as a lay man that was good enough.  He left the options open. Some of the members of the VEC, including the chairman, tried to twist it and say they were all right and it was worth a gamble in court.  It was worth a gamble in court at the expense of the Laois taxpayers.  They will have to pay the piper.  I do not know how the people of Laois will look at that. They will probably take a very serious view of it.  When the Laois County Council come to allocate money to the VEC many questions will be asked about the money to be paid to solicitors, junior counsel, senior counsel and everybody else involved in this High Court action.</P>
    <P>This matter should have been rectified long before it went to court, but the Minister of the day was in a jam. He did not know where to run.  There was no burrow open or if there was he was afraid to go into it.  He decided to let the case go to the High Court but they were nailed.  Now they are saying they were in the wrong court, that instead of being in Court No. 2 they should have been in Court No. 4, that the judge was in bad form and so on.  The taxpayers in Laois had to pay for all of this and the people take a serious view of the matter.</P>
    <P>Anybody who knows &ldquo;Blessed Oliver&rdquo; knew how he would act.  They knew he could twist things and say everything was all right.  They knew he would say &ldquo;We are going to appoint you, Mr. Parsons&rdquo;.  However, he could not do it because in fairness to the Minister he would not allow it. I have no doubt that when the interview board meet they will try to launch this man whom they intended to appoint two years ago irrespective of qualifications or ability.  In the High Court case the judge left it open to them to appoint the second man but they did not want him.  A few years ago it was all right to have him but not now.</P>
    <P>When the interview board met the neutral representatives did not agree. If they had agreed they would have signed their names but this they refused to do.  They told the other members they were in breach of the rules but they would not listen.  Many <Col N="1703" /> decent men on the Laois VEC were caught up in this and they were opposed to the course of action suggested. It was not that they had anything against the man the interview board were anxious to appoint but they knew they were in breach of the statutory regulations.  How will this appear to the other VECs throughout the country?  What will it mean to the many teachers who are applying for posts?  The whole situation looks very bad to them.  Many of these people will question where they stand in this matter.</P>
    <P>I agree the best applicant should be appointed and I hope that will be done as soon as possible in the interests of the pupils and the school.  Those on the administration side cannot be in a happy position about this matter because it is obvious there cannot be great harmony in such a situation. Fine Gael are to blame for this and they must carry the responsibility.  The people of Portlaoise are aware of this.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael thought they would get away with it because they have been monopolising all the boards for the past eight years.  They thought they could dictate the tune.  I mentioned earlier the pension board.  This is a minor board but they monopolised it. They put all their people on it but that did not work out because the general election took place and they lost out.</P>

I am glad to say that Fianna Fáil members in Laois as well as the Independent and Labour members were not a party to it.  It was the mafia of Fine Gael who put this scheme into operation but now they have to pay the penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would go a lot further than looking for a public inquiry.  The people concerned should have been dismissed.  I am sorry for some of the members who wanted to uphold their statutory obligations but the majority did not want <Col N="1704" /> that.  They wanted to run the business their way despite the Minister and the Department.  That body should have been dissolved long ago for failure to honour their obligations.  I hope the pupils of Portlaoise and the administration will not suffer.  I hope there will be harmony from now on and that the school will succeed.  Deputy Enright did his best to defend the situation but he knew it was not right.  He had to appear as though he were in favour of what happened.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the interviews are undertaken only applicants who have the necessary qualifications will be invited to participate.  When the recommendation goes to the Minister I hope he will look at it&mdash;and I have no doubt he will&mdash;to see that the right man is appointed to do the job in the best interests of everyone concerned.</P>

      <P>I was extremely disappointed last evening that the Minister took such an attitude.  He stood up, spoke for 15 minutes in complete justification of the need for either an inquiry or the dismissal of the Laois Vocational Education Committee and finished up by criticising me for putting down this motion at such an inopportune time and for interfering with the future prospects of the pupils of Portlaoise when we are within shooting distance of having a new principal appointed to that school.  Those words were very insincerely expressed when one recollects the contribution made in this House on 22nd May, 1975, by the Minister's predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As my colleague, Deputy Wilson, said last night the Minister presented his brief in a most apologetic manner and did it with every degree of justification. He rolled off paragraph by paragraph an account of a rebellious committee telling the Minister for Education to go to blazes.  As I said <Col N="1705" /> yesterday evening, the regrettable fact appears to be that those rebels will get away with it.  I also said last night that I regretted the necessity for moving this motion, but the people of Laois-Offaly will make their own decision about this case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright criticised me for raising this matter.  He said I was clutching at straws and that I had milked&mdash;that may not have been his actual expression but the end product was the same&mdash;this dispute for what it was worth and that I had continued to raise it over the past three years. I confess to that but, unfortunately, I must also confess that the end product is one that will redound to the eternal shame of the last two incumbents of the office of Minister for Education.  Last night I said that I respected Minister Burke.  If he were not in Europe he would have dismissed the Laois Vocational Education Committee by now.  In his contribution on 22nd May he said that.</P>
    <P>I am aware of what is involved when I talk of dismissing a vocational education committee.  When this problem was a year old I raised this matter on the Adjournment.  At that time I said I was not calling for the dismissal of that committee because I realised that we want as much local democracy as possible, but local democracy properly operated and used, not misused as it has been by the majority of the members of the County Laois Vocational Education Committee.</P>
    <P>I give credit to Deputy Enright for contributing to this debate although, as Deputy Connolly said, his contribution was a bit wishy-washy.  There are three Fine Gael Deputies representing our constituency.  One is the Minister for Defence who is a target in this issue.  He has not even come in to defend himself, and not for the first time.  I am sorry Deputy MacDonald is in Europe.  It may be fortuitous that he is away because if he were here he would be forced tonight to go through the lobbies against his will, but basically this is no trouble to a Fine Gael man.</P>
    <P>That Deputy was kicked off the vocational committee.  Along with the other four members of that committee, <Col N="1706" /> in June, 1974, he voted in favour of the qualified man.  Let us not think that the innocent VEC which existed in 1974 walked into this situation blindfolded, not knowing how they were fixed.  At that first meeting there was a direction from the Minister to the Laois Vocational Education Committee telling them that the man selected by the selection board was not qualified and that the Minister would not accept the recommendation if his name was put forward.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright is a legal man and he presented a legal case.  I would hate to be trying to earn money selling that case.  He tried to justify the committee's decision of June, 1974, against the orders of the Minister to appoint the number one man because the then chairman had got legal advice.  It is the greatest distortion of justice to find that not alone was Deputy Enright deceived by this but Justice McWilliam was also deceived because he built it into his final decision.  I say this with all seriousness because the item on the agenda which Deputy Enright quoted in this regard and is taken from the minutes of the Laois Vocational Education Committee meeting of 10th June, 1974, says:</P>
    <P>The chairman stated&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>The chairman being Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;that he had confirmation from a reputable firm of solicitors who had consulted senior counsel that the clauses in Memorandum V.7. section 12 (b), &ldquo;That the person appointed should have not less than five years' whole-time teaching experience&rdquo; was not mandatory, but merely a recommendation.</P>
    <P>That is the message sold again to Justice McWilliam.  I want to put on record in this House&mdash;and this is one of the reasons I wanted this inquiry&mdash; that no such inquiry ever went to a solicitor and no such answer ever came from a solicitor.  As I said in my contribution last evening, this is where the whole across-the-board committee were set astray from the word go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate advice.  Here we have a copy of the opinion&mdash;my colleague did not want to put it&mdash;of Kevin Lynch mentioned by the Minister in his brief last evening, presented to Laois County Committee on 7th March, 1975.  Laois ratepayers have paid money for that. That long document finished up, as Deputy Connolly said, in the final paragraph saying:</P>
      <P>...it seems to me to follow that the Minister is entitled to direct the Vocational Education Committee to make another appointment where he has declined to approve of the earlier appointment or appointments.</P>
      <P>That document was in the hands of Laois County Council prior to my raising this matter, making it, according to Deputy Enright, two years ago in May, 1975.  That was the position in May, 1975.  I should like to quote extracts from what the Minister for Education said at that time.  I shall quote him from the point of view of getting across to the Government and to the present Minister for Education the shallowness of his criticism of me last evening bringing in this motion at this untimely juncture when, for the past two years, he had before him the promise, the obvious commitment, built into the statement made by his predecessor in this House on 22nd May, 1975, now almost two years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the Minister an opportunity to study it.  The Minister quoted elaborately from the contribution his predecessor had made in February of that year, but he did not quote elaborately from the Minister's contribution on the 22nd May of that year when he said:</P>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to recount in detail the advice of senior counsel to the committee.</P>
      <P>That is the opinion to which I referred a moment ago&mdash;</P>
      <P>It will suffice to say that he concluded his opinion by a statement in relation to the Minister's position where he has had to decline to approve the proposal put to him. This statement was generally in conformity with the request which I, as Minister, had made to the committee in relation to the filling of the vacancy and which a reading of my reply on the Adjournment debate will clearly illustrate.</P>
      <P>Later on in that speech the Minister said in relation to what he could do about this recalcitrant committee:</P>
      <P>I am not precluded, however, from pointing out that the committee's attitude presents me with a situation where certain action which is open to me to take within the provisions of the Vocational Education Acts is one which a Minister for Education would hesitate to adopt until all attempts at reaching a solution based on reason and conciliation have failed.  I hope the Deputy and the House will appreciate my concern that every effort should be made to avoid the necessity for resorting to such action in the particular circumstances of the case in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was in May, 1975; fair dues to the Minister.  Previously, in October, 1974, the then Minister had written a letter in much the same strong terms to the chairman of the committee.  The present Minister took the opportunity <Col N="1709" /> of quoting a couple of paragraphs from that letter last evening, but he did not quote the operative one.  However, I built the quotation into the speech I made last evening.  It was a letter of 23rd October, 1974, an extract from which nonetheless bears repeating. What the secretary of the Department wrote, on the instructions of the Minister, to the chairman of the Laois Vocational Education Committee, the then Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan, was:</P>
    <P>If the matter should not be satisfactorily resolved at such a meeting, the Minister feels that he will have no alternative but seriously to consider invoking the relevant powers conferred on him by the Vocational Education Acts.  This, of course, the Minister would be most reluctant to do.</P>
    <P>That reluctance has continued from that date until now.</P>
    <P>We had the present Minister saying last evening words to this effect: all right; the whole show will be over in a fortnight and I will do the right thing.  I do not think the right thing will be done.  Like Deputy Connolly, I accept Deputy Enright's sincerity in this, particularly because he selected the individuals who would be on the interview board and spoke about them as being decent men.  He spoke about the chairman of the Vocational Association, who was in the House for the discussion last evening, Mr. McCann, a man who was so decent that he could not see his way to signing the rebellious document of appointment, an improper document of appointment, on the last occasion.  There were two officials from the Department who did not.  I will clear that with the Deputy.</P>
    <P>How does one go back to the people who maladministered the affairs of vocational educational in Laois for the last three years in relation to this and expect justice from them on this occasion? How can it be done?  Here we have a situation in which a Mr. William Phelan took the Laois Vocational Education Committee to court and sought a High Court ruling ordering the committee to appoint him.  He did not get that decision.  Knowing the three county council people about whom Deputy Enright speaks so well, <Col N="1710" /> what I expect to happen is that they will be capable of thumbing their nose at his application.  I can quote from a contribution made by one of them recently at a meeting of Laois County Council, held in March and reported in the <i>Leinster Express</i> on Saturday, March 12th.  The meeting would have been held on the previous Monday. At this stage, according to the report, Councillor Kelly, a Labour county councillor, submitted a list of signatures from people living in the Portlaoise area who, he said, supported Mr. Phelan for the post of principal. The report goes on:</P>
    <P>Councillor Keenan said that if these signatures were put on record it would disqualify Mr. Phelan from being eligible for the job since it would be canvassing on his behalf. &ldquo;I propose that they be ignored.  If they are accepted by the Committee they will debar the candidate,&rdquo; he added.</P>
    <P>Councillor Lodge said they were submitted by people who had the best interests of the school at heart.</P>
    <P>Mr. Graham asked how many signatures had been submitted and the Chairman replied that there were 101 sheets each containing about 20 names.</P>
    <P>Mr. Graham: So we have 2,000 parents for 260 pupils.  That is very good.</P>
    <P>Councillor Keenan: Put them in the wastepaper basket.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer again to the statement by the former Deputy Richard Burke, Minister for Education, on 22nd May, 1975.  He said:</P>
      <P>The continued pursuit by that committee of the attitude it has adopted in this case seems to me entirely irrational.  I trust it may still be possible to prevail upon the committee to understand that no good can come from an unyielding stance in an indefensible position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the Minister's description and here we are, two years later, with an end product&mdash;an injustice is being <Col N="1711" /> done.  I say that seriously.  The Minister at that time went on to thank me for not pressing him for the dissolution of the committee and said he appreciated my views and that they were shared by him.  Indeed he found fault with me for not suggesting an alternative and he said:</P>
    <P>It is not his duty to do so.  It is my duty as Minister to do so but I would like the benefit of the Deputy's point of view in this matter, personally or privately.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>...but I want to assure the House that I shall, as I have tried to do since the beginning of my term of office as Minister, try to do the right thing.  However, the question is what is the right thing in this matter?  The Deputy has excluded dissolution of the committee but there are other options and we will take them in due course when I communicate with the County Laois Vocational Education Committee.</P>
    <P>The debate finished on those terms. surely, having given the new Minister for Education time to settle in, I could have expected in 1977 that he would have demanded some action from the committee.  It must surely be obvious to even the most committed Deputy on the Government side that justice will not be done by the interview board and the committee.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Bully boys&rdquo; is the only way to describe those people.  I do not describe all of the majority members of the Laois VEC in these terms.  I have spoken about the leading man there and his sidekick.  I blame it all on the two.  In the past 30 years there has been no trouble in getting Deputy Oliver Flanagan, the Minister for Defence, to come in here to defend himself.  I expected he would be here on this occasion.  I was hoping Deputy MacDonald would be here.  I should not be a bit surprised if Deputy MacDonald had been encouraged by the Whips to go to Europe at this time. I have enough faith in Deputy MacDonald to think that he would kick at this juncture because it is bad enough to be asked to support something you <Col N="1712" /> are not in favour of, but to be asked to support a crowd of bully boys who have kicked you in the teeth is a bit much.  It is turning the third cheek.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister did not reply to my question of who will pay the cost of all this.  Is it the ratepayers of Laois or the VEC's legal expert, Councillor Keenan?  According to the report I have, Councillor Keenan announced at the meeting of the committee on 7th March, 1977 that the committee's costs in the High Court case which they lost would be paid by subvention from the Department of Education.  I asked the Minister if he would pay the costs of a case which arose because the VEC in Laois had refused to obey instructions from his predecessor.  The committee also had gone against their own paid for legal advice.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that Mr. Phelan did not get the High Court decision that he had gone for and that he had justifiably expected&mdash;I suppose I should leave out the word &ldquo;justifiably&rdquo;. I do not think Deputy Enright would disagree with me that in the normal run of pub law justice there is not a man or woman in Portlaoise or in County Laois who does not believe that Mr. Phelan should have got this post.  Deputy Enright said last night that the end product would be that we would get the best man for the job.  There were nine candidates for the position on the last occasion and seven presented themselves.  I am sure there will be more candidates on this occasion and there may be a different quality of opposition.  I am not begrudging the children of this school the best headmaster available but the vacancy would not exist if Laois VEC did their duty and, with due respect, if the Minister for Education did his duty.</P>
    <P>It is possible that I am doing Mr. Phelan harm.  Friday is the latest date for receipt of applications and I do not know whether he has applied for the post or not.  However, I should like to ask the House if Mr. Phelan has any chance now of being selected. Deputy Enright asked me to give my views about Canon Grey and I politely replied that I would not.  We know there are three reliable independent <Col N="1713" /> people on the committee and there is also the Minister for Defence, Deputy Flanagan, who amazingly got himself re-elected to it.  it appears that the Deputy is getting shaky and he does not appear to have enough reliance on his dictatorial ability to get another person to do his bidding. There is no doubt about the way Councillor Keenan feels because he was on the committee before with Councillor Fleming.  I cannot see Mr. Phelan getting any greater justice on this occasion.  I hope that the three gentlemen involved, if Mr. Phelan submits an application, will avail of the opportunity of telling me I was wrong, for the sake of Mr. Phelan.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright said I was anxious to kick up a fuss about this matter because I was losing my place in the political queue for election.  I leave that accusation to the electorate of Laois-Offaly. The Deputy also picked out Councillor Hyland for special reference. He could not have picked out a finer man and I have no doubt that he has the confidence of the people of Laois.</P>

      <P>The annual cost, in terms of pay, allowances, uniform cost and an element of superannuation, of increasing the strength of the force by 2,000 is estimated to be about £11 million at current rates.</P>
      <P>Calculation of the capital costs associated with an increase of that size would be extremely difficult since, among other factors, the cost of new premises and of restructuring existing premises would have to be worked out.  Moreover, any such calculation would of necessity be largely speculative since the costs involved would depend on decisions in regard to the allocation of the extra strength.</P>
