      <P>When we adjourned the debate yesterday evening I was trying to analyse the work of the IDA during the past 20 years in relation to my region, particularly my constituency of north Tipperary.  While credit can be given to the IDA for their great work in providing jobs in many areas, <Col N="1502" /> I must be critical of them in relation to my area.</P>
      <P>I have been 21 years in public life and during that time not one State-financed major industry has been established in my area.  Therefore, it must be appreciated that my attitude towards the IDA is one of dissatisfaction because of their neglect of north Tipperary. The national achievement during that period may have been good on a regional basis, particularly in relation to the mid-western region and Limerick and Clare, but the creation of employment in north Tipperary has been minimal.  When the IDA were established it was decided to include north Tipperary with Limerick and Clare, which was an unfortunate move. Since the inception of the IDA emphasis has been placed on developing the Shannon Airport complex and the populated areas of Limerick city and the surrounding district.  Because of this emphasis, the periphery, which is north Tipperary, has received very little consideration.  This has led to an imbalance to the detriment of north Tipperary.  One could say that we in north Tipperary had to be content with the crumbs from the rich man's table.</P>
      <P>There have been recent announcements of major industrial developments in the region.  I refer to Alcan on the Shannon estuary and the Beecham consortium at Shannon Airport.  During the weekend the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy announced a substantial development in Limerick city, a £4 million industrial complex. There has been no mention of a major industry for north Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are fortunate that our major industries in north Tipperary are based on natural resources and I compliment the managements of these industries on their attitude towards development and expansion.  We are grateful for the employment created by these industries. However, I am concerned with Mogul Mines which is adjacant to my home town in north Tipperary.  It is a wasting industry, now in its tenth year.  It is apparent that it has passed the half-way stage of its development and we should be considering plans <Col N="1503" /> for a major industry to fill the vacuum that will be created by its closure. When one considers what is involved in establishing an industry to employ 600 people, one can see that plans for its replacement should be made well in advance of its closure.</P>
    <P>Priority should be given by State agencies to plans for a major industry in advance of the terrible day when Mogul closes its doors.  If the people of north Tipperary are to have confidence in State agencies, such as the IDA, great activity must be seen in the area, otherwise one can expect complacency and disinterest.  The people of the area read of industrial development in other areas while they have been waiting too long.  I have raised this matter on many occasions in the House, at local level and with senior officials of the Department and SFADCo, and have asked the question: &ldquo;How is it that so many industrialists have come to my area, been interested in it and yet the industries have been located elsewhere?&rdquo;  The answer I have been given is that the agency can only go so far but the final decision rests with the industrialists who are concerned and interested in establishing an industry here.  I cannot accept that, because I believe that at some level, be it high or low, when industrialists show an interest in establishing an industry they are nudged and directed to specific areas where, in some cases, they do better grant-wise.</P>
    <P>The situation in my region is unfortunate for north Tipperary but fortunate for Clare.  For years Clare has benefited from various programmes for underdeveloped areas.  Industrialists who site their factories there are given additional grants because it is west of the Shannon while those who decide to set up an industry in north Tipperary, which is east of the Shannon, do not qualify for the same amount of financial assistance even though they may want to start an industry in some of the fine towns which can boast all essential services.  When industrialists are given such great incentives to start an industry west of the Shannon it is easy to see why many <Col N="1504" /> industries were lost by north Tipperary and gained by Clare and the Shannon Airport complex.  It is time concerns in north Tipperary were given the same incentives.  I accept that at one time it was necessary to give Clare special consideration but anybody travelling through parts of Clare and my constituency can see the imbalance as far as industrial development is concerned. Each area should be given a fair share of the industrial cake.</P>
    <P>The small industry development is essential also.  An industry that prospers in a small community and gives employment to 20 or 30 women is contributing just as much to the national economy as a major industry employing between 400 and 500 people.  If we are sincere and concerned about renewing and revitalising rural Ireland we must give a greater share of money to build up the small industries.  I am talking in terms of areas of population of 500 people.  For such settlements to survive it is important that we make ourselves aware of their needs at county council and government level.  There are four major towns in my area, Thurles, Nenagh, Roscrea and Templemore and in the past we were fortunate in obtaining some small industries.  However, I am not satisfied and I will continue to voice my criticism of State agencies that ignore towns like those I mentioned.</P>
    <P>In my town a 70 acre industrial site has been available for the last three years for a major industry.  That was accomplished through the good offices of the country development team and the agents for the IDA in the area, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, but that site remains a monument.  The Parliamentary Secretary should take cognisance of this situation because State and local money was used to purchase that valuable piece of property.</P>
    <P>I should like to welcome the announcement that Ballingarry coalmines are to reopen even though it will only be on a restricted basis with a maximum of 150 workers being employed. That is good news for this depressed area which suffered for many years since the closure of the mines <Col N="1505" /> almost seven years ago.  Without being critical, I wish to state that the reopening is no thanks to the IDA or any State agency.  I should like to compliment the two gentlemen from Clonmel who are concerned with this industry because it was through their good offices, their interest and their courage that a start is being made again in Ballingarry to produce a fuel badly needed to offset our balance of payments deficit and contribute greatly to the development of the area.  The Minister should bear in mind the serious unemployment situation in the area of Slieveardagh.  Some years ago the area was designated as a special place for industrial development because the situation there was so serious.  That is ample proof that the powers-that-be realised how urgent the problem was.</P>

      <P>I have allowed the Deputy a lot of latitude in the matter of dealing with local specific questions in detail and while I hesitate to rule him out of order I must point out that the Bill deals with other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past we have had economic programmes for industrial expansion, White Papers and guidelines, but as far as I am concerned those efforts lacked muscle, power and the finance to back up their objectives of creating jobs and keeping our people at home.  As a result I consider that all those programmes were an abysmal failure, irrespective of the whitewashing that was done.  I appeal to the IDA to tackle the job of assisting all parts of the country.  I appreciate that there is a high proportion of unemployment in Dublin but we must consider the country as a whole.  The man in Nenagh is as much entitled to a job as the man in Ballyfermot and the man in Ballingarry who has been unemployed since the mines closed seven years ago is as much entitled to recognition as the man who has been unemployed for some time in Cork and Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to compliment the regional development boards and the county development teams and recommend greater power for them.  They have done tremendous work at regional <Col N="1506" /> and local level and are the organisations most aware of the local problems. They should be involved in decision-making and the placing of industries.  I shall continue to watch the progress of the IDA in my area and look forward to greater industrial development in north Tipperary and the country in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Every debate I have sat through since coming into this House has included people from the Opposition who seemed determined to drag our manifesto into the discussion.  I cannot understand why they are so pre-occupied with it, except perhaps to substantiate the view held generally throughout the country that we are making a good job of its implementation. I always understood that in this House the Opposition would always be available with fresh thinking and initiatives to help our Ministers to do a better job, but it seems they are destitute of any thinking of that nature. They continue to refer to the manifesto at every available opportunity, as if it were the only thing our term of office is to produce, and they continually harass our Ministers because they are not fulfilling their commitments speedily enough.  The truth of the situation is that the general public are astonished at the speed with which our Ministers are fulfilling their commitments. Indeed, so astonished are they that they expect next year, when all our commitments have been honoured, a fresh manifesto will emerge from the back rooms of Fianna Fáil, to which I look forward.  It is about time that was said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the Bill about the manifesto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been niggling me since I came into this House.  I cannot understand why they continue to refer to this matter at every single opportunity.  Surely there is somebody with some initiative on that side of the House who can produce some fresh thinking.  Our thinking is on the record. We are producing the goods and the general public are happy with them. I fail to understand why the Opposition cannot be happy also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1507" /> Reference was also made to the fact that it was not the Fianna Fáil Party who originally established the IDA. That is on the record and I shall not deal with it.  At this stage in our development it does not matter too much who started the IDA.  What matters is that we give them the teeth to perform their function as intended, and that is what the Minister is at present doing. Indeed were we to apply that criterion to everything else I suppose we could say that Henry Ford had something to do with the motor car.  Were we back some 50 or 60 years ago our communications probably would be at a very low ebb.  It is the development of these things that matters.  Consequently, I am glad the Minister has taken upon himself the power to provide the IDA with the necessary finance to do the job originally intended.</P>
    <P>Our most pressing national problem at present is that of unemployment.  It is also agreed by everybody that the most difficult object to achieve by the Government in office at present is the attainment of full employment.  Fewer people are now required in the agricultural sector.  That, together with the virtual elimination of emigration in the last decade, makes the problem all the more acute.  Because this problem is so acute it is necessary to strengthen legislation in order to provide the IDA and other related organisations with the financial and legislative facilities to play their full role in the final solution of those problems.  They will have to provide the framework for the modernisation and development of new infrastructures, retrain our workers, especially our farmers, and also our school leavers; provide opportunities for graduates and <i>entrepreneurs</i>, large and small, promoting productive investment in industry, services and handcrafts.</P>
    <P>With free trade now a reality the need for mergers in certain industries has become more apparent.  The Industrial Credit Company have played an important role for some years in bringing about that type of merger.  A number of our larger Irish industrial complexes have benefited <Col N="1508" /> greatly from this organisation.  Together with the Industrial Credit Company, I understand that the Industrial Development Authority will now provide advice on the desirability of these associations and amalgamations, that they will help with the negotiations and, where necessary, provide financial assistance in the form of interest subsidies and loan guarantees for moneys borrowed for these purposes.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Common Market and the advent of free trade have worried many of our smaller industries.  It is accepted that the small business today must adapt itself to the large market to enable industry face the tougher climate of the open domestic market and foreign competition. It is necessary for businesses to standardise their production lines where at all possible.  To remain profitable it has been found that companies have had to operate on a much larger scale.  It is also important for companies to develop new techniques and products.  To achieve this massive investment in research is often necessary, thus creating problems for most of our small companies.  Indeed often they do not have the financial resources to undertake the necessary research to stay abreast of their competitors. This Bill will provide finance to industry to engage in the necessary research to meet modern technological advances in all industries, especially the larger types.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the belief was widely held that the only way the industrial challenge of the United States could be matched or met was to set up giant corporations in Europe.  I am glad to note that there is somewhat different thinking now.  Despite the fact that industrial mergers have to be favoured where they are indispensable it is the considered opinion of many now that there is a tremendous future awaiting our smaller industries and crafts.  From close examination of the American industrial scene it is obvious that the small industry can thrive alongside the larger industrial complexes.  Indeed, it has been found that some 80 per cent of all companies and industries operating in the United States have less than <Col N="1509" /> ten employees.  Europe, perhaps, by tradition, has always favoured the smaller-scale firm or business.  If, as is suggested, we are coming to the end of large-scale industrial operations here, increasingly we must turn our attention to the small-scale operations. So far as rural Ireland is concerned, it is my belief that the greatest development there will be in the small industries field.  Because of the great difference in consumer tastes and habits there will always be a corresponding variety of manufactured goods necessary to satisfy those tastes.  It has often been found that it is cheaper to invest in labour than in equipment.  As far as Ireland is concerned the need, for the time being at least, to mechanise is less urgent that it would be on the Continent or in the United States.  For that reason it is necessary that the small industries division of the IDA play an increasingly important role in the future development and relief of unemployment in modern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to note the recent Rothery Report from the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards Group which concerned itself with a study of some 25 Irish <i>entrepreneurs</i> in the manufacturing and engineering industries.  All of these people started with no capital at all, or at most very little.  Today, ten years later, they employ 3,574 people and have a turnover of some £41 million.  It is interesting also to read that they had a growth rate of some 50 per cent in their turnover in that period.  Companies of that kind and <i>entrepreneurs</i> working at that level surely must have a major source of industry available for our people. Also they must play an increasingly important role in the creation of new jobs.  Of those 25 <i>entrepreneurs</i> approximately six started industries concerned with domestic housing, not so much the actual construction of the houses as the products that went into them.  They also made a little dent in the world consumer durable products scene.  If they had a minute participation in that world market, surely there is ample opportunity to develop that scene so far as Irish <i>entrepreneurs</i> on the small scale are concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1510" /> Of the people surveyed their background was unique in that they had a low level of formal education.  For many of them their only formal education was primary or vocational school education.  I venture to say that our universities have not assisted significantly in the growth of entrepreneurial activity and job creation.  Of the 25 people surveyed, only two had formal university training and they had a BE degree and had been in industry after leaving university.  It could be said that many of our university-trained people are not orientated towards machines. Certainly they are not orientated towards product development and marketing development.  Most of the people on whom we rely to set up small industries were employed in existing manufacturing and service industries.  If they were asked why they set up their own industries many of them would say it was because of frustration with their employers and lack of opportunity. That is the kind of people we should be talking about and looking for.</P>
    <P>All the people in the survey generated their own initial capital from revenue. Very few of them had IDA help; the figure might be two.  I agree that later on the IDA played a part in helping them to diversify and expand but in the initial stage they had to generate their own capital.  There seems to be no system which helps new <i>entrepreneurs</i> in the initial stage of their development.  Those people&mdash;and there are hundreds of them in the country&mdash;should be identified in the industries in which they work.  They should be introduced to new products, especially those orientated towards the export market.  They should be given assistance so that they can get over that painful initial period when finance can play such an important role.  If they were given that kind of assistance they would play an increasingly important role in providing new job opportunities and new industrial development here.</P>
    <P>For some considerable time a source of controversy has been the kind of industry that should be sought and encouraged by the IDA.  It is probably true to say that in the market-place <Col N="1511" /> of industrial development we cannot be as selective now as we were in the past because we are competing with other developing countries.  Despite the fact that the IDA have the experience and expertise in this field, they still have to compete with the increasing demands and incentives from other countries that are anxious to promote their own development programmes.</P>
    <P>As far as we are concerned we are in the market for both labour-intensive industry and capital-intensive industries. It is true to say that the capital-intensive industry usually brings with it a more up-to-date technology.  It is recognised that this kind of industry has less employment potential so far as numbers are concerned but it is the experience of those concerned with this kind of industry that it can usually withstand periods of recession and it has greater stability in the long term. At first sight labour-intensive industry would seem to be the most desirable in a high unemployment situation but in times of recession or over-production in certain types of industry it can lead to high redundancy and industrial relations problems.  There have been many such examples in Ireland in the recent past.</P>
    <P>It is heartening to note that because of improved conditions recently in industrial exports there has been a substantial drop in the number of jobs lost through factory closures and redundancies. The IDA are to be congratulated on their efforts in the recent past for producing for the first time in three or four years a net increase in the numbers working in industry.  One of the frightening figures from the annual report was that between 1973 and 1976 we created 71,000 jobs but there were virtually 74,000 losses.  There must be something in that for all of us.  What is the point of being hellbent on providing structures and the necessary finance to create all those jobs when we are not paying enough attention to job losses?  If we could have maintained even a decent percentage of those jobs we would be well on the way to obtaining a desirable employment situation.</P>
    <P>Despite international competition <Col N="1512" /> Ireland is still attracting good quality manufacturing products from overseas and it is hoped this will continue.  In my own area there are such names as Travenol, Epitex, Allergon, Bluebell and Thermo&mdash;all of them international names of repute that are welcome to the industrial scene.  I hope the IDA will be able to continue providing the industrial scene with this kind of operator. The IDA scheme to encourage and assist joint ventures in manufacturing products has been a unique success and perhaps therein lies the growth centre for greater industrial development in the future.  It is hoped that a continuation of this programme will lead to more secure employment and greater security for employees.</P>
    <P>In all this activity, and especially the development of heavy industry, it is important to ensure that the amount of equity investment put up by the promoters will be sufficient to deter them from abandoning their schemes in times of recession, unemployment or industrial unrest.  It is recognised that the IDA grants&mdash;borrowing in Ireland and tax concessions of all kinds&mdash;have helped to attract industry here.  They have been very generous in the past but safeguards must be built in to any industry supported in this way that commitment does not cease at the first sign of trouble.  I do not suppose it is anything to do with the recent letter from the Church hierarchy about justice but I think that message should be prescribed reading for people engaged in industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The general public has given a majority to Fianna Fáil to run the country and to take the initiative as far as industrial relations are concerned. In life and in death situations the onus of responsibility will fall squarely on our shoulders and we will have to answer for it.  If the nettle has to be grasped, I am satisfied that our Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy has the courage to grasp it.  If the game is being played, and if the teams are the unions on the pitch, just as in any game when a foul is committed the referee has to blow his whistle.  Perhaps the time has come for the Minister to blow his whistle.  I <Col N="1513" /> am happy to remember that he comes from a long line of people who have had the courage to grasp the nettle if necessary.</P>
    <P>I am not talking about bringing in legislation to curb the power of the unions, as we hear advocated from people who do not understand the situation.  Maybe it is the other way round.  It may be necessary to bring in legislation to strengthen unions. When you realise that there are 93 unions representing our small labour force in a population of just over three million and that in other countries three, four or five unions represent millions of people, you will see the need for legislation of some kind. The time will come when something will have to be done to strengthen the unions so that their executives will have the confidence and support of their members.</P>

      <P>Industrial relations are the concern of another Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  The Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy have a large part to play in the encouragement and introduction of industry and are concerned with all foreign industrialists and problems arising from labour relations.  The day may come when the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy will also be responsible for industrial relations. I do not want to put a Fianna Fáil Minister out of work or make his Department defunct but there seems to be overlapping in this regard.</P>
      <P>The small industries programme has been very successful over the years.  It is in this area of activity that the greatest scope for future development lies as far as industry is concerned.  In the case of consumer goods and services, small firms have a special role to play in satisfying local needs that cannot be met by mass production. Customers seeking individuality can only be satisfied by the small scale operator.  This is especially true in catering for such clients as tourists and foreign customers.  This is an increasing market and should be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as repairs and services are concerned, we are all aware that the <Col N="1514" /> small scale operator provides the best service in this field.  Paradoxically, economic and technological progress, which many of us feared would eliminate the small firms, has created new needs which the small operator is best able to provide.  When it comes to servicing cars, television sets, washing machines and so on, the small firm gives the greatest satisfaction.  God help anybody who has to go to the big operator because he can be waiting a a long time for service.</P>
    <P>In industry the small operators supply large industrial concerns with the goods required.  Many of our large sophisticated production groups depend to a large extent on small businesses to supply them with specialised components. Small companies have the advantage of being able to specialise and co-operate with one another.  It is by specialising that the small operator can often supply technically advanced goods and services much more cheaply than the large firm.</P>
    <P>A small firm is also best equipped to stimulate development in rural areas. It has proved to be very difficult at times to set up large industrial complexes in the west but it has been proved eminently more profitable for small firms which require relatively little capital and labour to set up in that area.  It has often been said that if some of the capital made available to attract foreign industries on a large scale had been left for small Irish industries, much cheaper and more secure development might have taken place.</P>
    <P>It is agreed by all that the development of medium and heavy industries should be energetically pursued but at no time should it be allowed to monopolise existing capital so that there would not be sufficient for the development of small industries.  Unfortunately the small industry, despite specialisation, will not of its own have the resources to solve marketing and research problems.  That is why the IDA should encourage small firms to co-operate.  They should encourage firms to concentrate on certain aspects of production and to economise on marketing, purchasing and advertising. <Col N="1515" /> Groups of small firms could join together to seek new outlets and thus become more export minded.  Agreement could be reached between small firms to share the research costs which are so necessary to develop new products and techniques and to help maintain their share of the exports market.</P>
    <P>To encourage greater development in the small industry division, it will be necessary to give county development teams much greater autonomy. As it is, those teams have no discretion in the small industries programme although they can make recommendations. If better results are to be sought discretion above the £1,200 limit will have to be given to the special regional development fund.  I suggest that £5,000 might not be too much to put at their disposal.  It would be safe enough to assume that there is no danger of things being let slip through because there is enough expertise and management expertise on the development teams to guarantee scrutiny of all applicants.</P>
    <P>It is only when we look at the complexity of the application form for a small industry that we begin to realise why many young entrepreneurs are scared off.  Existing measures applied to applicants looking for small industries grants are stifling the initiative of people who are most anxious to get into this scheme.  The application form has all kinds of questions&mdash;about design, building, machinery they have and or which they want, raw materials, employment potential, training, management and technical control, finance, turnover, costings, working capital, liabilities, marketing, had they been in touch with the CTT, NDA and so on. When gentlemen from these organisations arrive in their pin-striped suits to talk to small industrialists or people in their working clothes who are anxious to start new industries, they can easily be scared off by all this talk of high finance and marketing through various organisations.</P>
    <P>The people from the IDA do great work for medium and larger industries but the small-scale operator should not <Col N="1516" /> be put through this rigorous test before he is given a few thousand pounds to get on the road.  These operators have proved to be most successful.  The county development officer scrutinises the first application.  Then it goes before the county development team. They have always been most anxious to help.  It then goes to the projects officer of the IDA, small industries section, and is given an in-depth scrutiny.  A report is often required from the industrial research and standards department on financial projections for operations up to two years in advance.  What small industrialist or entrepreneur starting off can give that kind of programming to the officers? They require a breakdown on the relationship with agriculture, market breakdowns, cash flows, chartered accountants' reports&mdash;all resulting in delays of six to 18 months.  This is often the critical period for the man who has not the formal education to withstand this kind of pressure and he is put off.  The initiative is often lost and valuable job creation opportunities are lost with it.</P>
    <P>The requirements of the application are too rigid.  Greater trust should be put in those willing to take their courage in their hands and set up small industries.  The enterprise development programme is very necessary in the developing of jobs needed in the small towns and in servicing the needs of new large scale industry.  While the enterprise development programme should seek out graduates and others engaged in local authorities, semi-State bodies and public institutions as well as executives in manufacturing and service industries who have skills and ingenuity, we must never forget the number of small businessmen in rural towns who have very special skills and who are always willing to utilise the training they have got&mdash;many of them have got the training in Britain&mdash;to create new job opportunities here.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of those people have no university training but they have the expertise which is required. All they need is the financial assistance to create the job opportunities we so badly need in rural Ireland.  There is one classic example which is used <Col N="1517" /> very often as far as Mayo is concerned. A man, after spending a few years in England returned home with less than £1 in his pocket.  He started a small project in his village and today he employs 40 people.  If that is not the success story of the year I do not know what it is.</P>
    <P>There are many areas that the small projects team call sensitive and they will not give support to them.  There is a long list of them given.  In many cases people like carpenters and joiners provide a social need.  They provide very worth-while local employment. They were refused grant assistance by the IDA while joinery is still being imported not only into Mayo from other parts of the country but from the United Kingdom.  I do not believe that it is true to say that the sharpening of the tools in one small business in an area leads to unemployment in an adjoining area.  It must be remembered that there are many developing towns in the country and large industries need the services of those small-type industries based on joinery and such related craft industries.</P>
    <P>The IDA should lift the blanket refusal and grant this type of operation some assistance.  They would then find they could generate many job opportunities in rural Ireland.  Small engineering works, particularly in the agricultural engineering sector, are being refused grant assistance.  This happens in an area where agriculture is and will continue to be the livelihood of the vast majority of the people.  It is hard to comprehend how the IDA can justify refusing grant aid assistance to such type of small engineering industries when one considers that approximately £42 million worth of this type of agricultural equipment is imported every year.  Much of this could be made in some of our industrial engineering concerns.</P>
    <P>We all know how the Sugar Company have developed agricultural machinery.  It is not only holding its own on the world market but is leading the world market in many areas.  It is obvious from that one example that we have the expertise and the enterprise. Why are the IDA not grantaiding small- and medium-sized agricultural <Col N="1518" /> engineering projects?  They must lift the blanket refusal from this type of project.  The job opportunities which could be created there are vast. It was mentioned in a report I saw recently that one person started off that type of industry with a welder in the back garden.  I know of no small engineering industry that started off on that scale that had not a turnover well into the four, five and six figures within a few short years.</P>
    <P>A special section should be set up in the IDA to investigate the engineering industry.  It seems ridiculous in an agricultural country like this that we should import £42 million worth of agricultural engineering goods in a year.  This is a suitable time to examine the policy in relation to small-type industries. Will this programme cater for local enterprise in joinery and other related industries?  We have the enterprise, the technique and the expertise waiting to be tapped.  Considerable jobs could be created if sufficient grant aid is willingly given to the IDA.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the IDA might have a word with the ESB in this regard.  There are many small-type operators who are being denied the chance of getting a start in life by excessive demands by the ESB for connecting electricity.  If necessary grants should be made available to defray the cost of those connections. When a man has the initiative to go ahead that initiative often lasts a very short time and can be stifled by the smallest setback at the initial stage.</P>
    <P>I saw some trade statistics from the Central Statistics Office for the different years.  They cover importations but they give them under global headings. Division 72, under electrical machinery, gives the imports for April as £10 million.  What machinery?  Could we have a list of the type of machinery imported?  Under transport equipment we find that £15 million worth of goods were imported and under Division 83, travel goods, we find that £318,000 worth were imported.  How many small industries are engaged in this type of industry?  They should specify what type of travel goods are imported so that the young entrepreneurs who are interested in setting up <Col N="1519" /> industries in that field would have an opportunity of seeing what is coming into the country and then can say to themselves: &ldquo;I can do that.&rdquo;  This would then put an end to another importation.</P>
    <P>The Central Statistics Office should differentiate the different sections under engineering, science, textiles, plastics, chemistry and so forth so that those people will have the opportunity to see where their talents can best be utilised. There should be a new system of licensing in regard to industries in the United States and the United Kingdom. There must be a huge European market in that field.  If proper programming was done under a licensing scheme we could produce many of the goods under licence from larger firms to supply the home market and the export market on the Continent of Europe.  This should be updated every year.  The IDA should seek those arrangements.</P>
    <P>It is also hoped that this new Bill will provide support not only for the individual but for partners and limited companies as well.  It has always been accepted that the formation of a limited company is a very sensible exercise for anyone starting out in manufacturing or other business.  The IDA should broaden their base to cover such projects.  It will be disappointing if support is there only for working capital.  In a small industries programme the person who has the ideas, expertise and knowledge of the markets and perhaps an excellent chance of success does not always have the capital or collateral.  Will this kind of operator get only the normal grant of 60 per cent in the designated area of the fixed assets?  If so how will he be able to secure the remaining 40 per cent?  There would seem to be a missing dimension there.  I would be delighted if the Minister would clarify that in his summing up.  In his statement introducing Second Stage he said, as reported in the Official Report of 2nd November, 1977, Volume 301, column 158:</P>
    <P> Accordingly it is proposed in this Bill to provide for the giving of loan <Col N="1520" /> guarantees and interest subsidies to first-time industrialists, in respect of loans raised to provide working capital. </P>
    <P>The IDA might be persuaded to take equity in such small projects.  If they would it would be interesting to know if they would allow the promoter to buy out the business from the IDA if and when it was successful.  If so, would it be possible to have the terms of the purchase laid down in advance? This would be a considerable incentive to young promoters who would like, as would all of us, to be the owners of their own projects.</P>
    <P>In a progressive society the greater part of a country's wealth is generated by the private sector.  Privately-owned business has always been less wasteful of its resources than has public business. If it is intended to allow the private sector to develop its full potential as far as industrial development is concerned it will be necessary to have another look at the taxation system as it applies to private industries operating in this country.  Many long-established industries have been brought to the wall in the past and they might have been saved if they had had the necessary reserves from an enlightened tax system.  It would have given them the resources that were so necessary for their development.  Most industries expand and they replace their equipment from their own financial resources, but how can these resources be built up if the company tax system as it presently exists in this country so denudes them of capital resources that they are unable to expand or replace old and worn-out machinery?  So they end up with declining profits and become another dead body of Fóir Teoranta.  It is well recognised by small business in this country that there has been over-taxation of company profits over the years which has resulted in the lessening of working capital available to industry. Consequently job opportunities could not be created and all too often Fóir Teoranta had to be called to the rescue, or indeed to preside over the final obsequies of many a fine Irish industry.  It is very little comfort to established Irish industry trying to <Col N="1521" /> make ends meet to know that the IDA are granting tax-free holidays to overseas concerns coming here to set up a business.</P>
    <P>It has been touch and go with the IDA who have been endeavouring with might and main to attract new industry here for the purpose of job creation, so as to keep pace with the loss of jobs in other industry often caused by impoverishment brought about by a penal tax system of long-established Irish business interests.  As well as supporting the IDA in attracting industry by offering all kinds of tax concessions, grant aid and so on to foreign investment, we should make every effort to remove handicaps placed on Irish industry.  The greatest handicap at this time is the company taxation law.  If there were a more enlightened taxation system applicable to Irish industry some of the provisions of this Bill might not be necessary. Some of the provisions would lead one to believe that we are now trying to redress the situation created by our own taxation greed in the past.  If we are to accept the policy which says that we must promote maximum private investment, it is logical to assume that the source of such investment must be allowed to be accumulated in this country.  Money held here must be encouraged to be channelled into this investment rather than to lie idle or, worse still, to be invested abroad.  If capital taxes force Irish wealth to leave this country or doom it to low-yield activity, then a disservice has been done to the nation. The Minister should look at these taxes with a view to having them revised or, better still, abolished.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement concerning the setting up of a consortium for the purpose of job creation and generally monitoring our performance in this regard, identifying obstacles to the growth of industry and suggesting solutions that would be in the common interest.  It is important that Irish people control their own destiny, and the control of the major part of our industry is very desirable. In this regard I welcome the section of the Bill that allows equity participation by the IDA in Irish business.  The <Col N="1522" /> personal and corporate taxation systems applied in Ireland have actively worked against the accumulation of private reserves and investment funds which are required in a developing country such as ours.  The results are inconsistent with the Government's policy of seeking to create a domestic climate conducive to private investment. There are many indications that over the past few years the private sector has been unwilling to undertake further investment in this country.  This is forcing the IDA and the Government to pick up the slack out of public funds.  There is a body of opinion which feels that the corporate tax system is acting as a disincentive to private investment and that instead of bringing in revenue to the Exchequer it is putting further burdens and pressures on the Exchequer through an increased demand for public investment funds.</P>
    <P>If this is the case it is time that the abolition of direct tax on businesses should be considered.  The results of such abolition would be that more money would be obtained by companies for use in their own reinvestment programmes so that they would be in a position to build up capital stocks and thus reduce their dependence on borrowed funds the servicing of which has aggravated the difficulty of many businesses and has been the cause of many of them ending up in financial difficulties in the past.  I cannot see how the abolition of company tax would in any way mean the evading of tax by the companies concerned. If the company decided to pay dividends to their shareholders out of their surplus this would be taxable against the personal incomes of the recipients.  Even if some of the surplus or profits were distributed as bonuses to the staff that would also be attached to the personal taxation system.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies from the eastern part of the country mentioned here on more than one occasion that Dublin now had a crisis situation as far as unemployment was concerned.  I agree that Dublin is a special case and indeed in some respects has been a special case since the foundation of this State. Some new strategy must be worked out <Col N="1523" /> for the east coast and the conurbation of the city.  I do not like the suggestion that the west has benefited out of proportion to its needs to the detriment of the city area.</P>
    <P>Since the foundation of the State, 90,000 people left County Mayo on the emigrant ship.  There were no jobs for them.  I will regard the balance as having been levelled off when the IDA or any other agency provide the 90,000 jobs to bring my fellow countrymen back from foreign shores. The score will be levelled then, and not until then.  I say that with the greatest respect for the IDA who in the recent past made a dynamic improvement in Mayo.</P>
    <P>Let us take two figures which are important in this context.  In September, 1977, the unemployment situation in County Mayo was as follows: a total of 5,272 persons were drawing unemployment and assistance benefit, and there were 4,376 small holders in the same region.  That is the official position of unemployment in County Mayo.  I suggest those figures mask, to a degree, the real position, considering that girls who left school in 1976 and 1977 and are not entitled to unemployment benefit are not included in those figures.  Neither are school leavers with academic qualifications for whom there are no jobs.</P>
    <P>The position in County Mayo has changed dramatically in the past ten years.  In 1965, 1,371 persons were employed in manufacturing industry in the county.  By 1st January, 1977, that figure had risen to 4,052.  Great efforts were made by the IDA in the location of sizeable industries in Mayo to achieve that figure.  The one single industry which is the talking point along the west coast is the Travenol laboratory which came with the promise of 200 jobs, and we now have 1,000 people employed in Castlebar with spin off industries located in Belmullet, Swinford and Tuam, and further developments on the way.</P>
    <P>However, that industry has brought its own problems and, coupled with the decentralisation of the Department of Lands to Castlebar, it has brought a unique problem to Castlebar.  There <Col N="1524" /> is now an imbalance between the male and female population structure in the area.  This imbalance has to be corrected because, if it is allowed to get out of control, we will end up in a worse situation than the one in which we started.</P>
    <P>The population structure has gone out of balance in my area and it will require at least one sizeable male-orientated industry located in the west Mayo region to correct that imbalance. There are many suitable and ideal locations in west Mayo for such a venture.  I would ask the IDA to pay particular attention to this problem and to generate new jobs to correct the population imbalance which has grown up in the past few years.</P>
    <P>There is a rumour afoot&mdash;and I hope it cannot be substantiated&mdash;that the decentralisation programme is being stifled by moves from the city to cut off work from it and thereby lessen the number of people employed in the Castlebar office.  That programme was initiated by the Fianna Fáil Government in office and nothing in the past few years has improved the situation so far as the location of the Department of Lands in Castlebar is concerned.  I hope my Government, the new Government, will proceed with new initiatives to finish off the job they started: the total decentralisation of the Department to Castlebar.</P>
    <P>There is another figure which is very interesting and which has to be referred to here, that is, the number of people in County Mayo between 15 and 19 years of age and 20 and 24 years of age.  In 1966, the 15 to 19 year age group stood at 10,895 and, five years later, in 1977, the 20 to 24 years age group stood at 5,928, a loss of 4,967&mdash;in other words, 45.6 per cent of the young people of County Mayo.  If those figures alone do not suggest to the Minister and to the Government that there is a continuing need for job creation in Mayo, nothing else will&mdash;and I do not care what goes on on the east coast.</P>
    <P>How can you lose almost half of the teenagers and young men and women and hope to have a community which can survive and thrive?  We must pay attention to these figures.  The IDA must <Col N="1525" /> gear their operations to these figures.  If by spending a few thousand pounds, on a small entrepreneurial industry, or a few million pounds on a large-scale male-orientated industry, we solve this problem, a decent job of work will have been done by the Minister and the Government to provide the infrastructure which will keep 100 per cent of our young men and women in our own native county.</P>
    <P>Not one of those people between 19 and 24 years of age wanted to leave County Mayo.  I will tell the House why.  It is the last uncommercialised area in western Europe.  It will become the playground and the main tourist attraction of Europe in the future.  It is the only place left which is unpolluted, uncommercialised and still has the native hospitality for which the Irish are famous.</P>
    <P>Since we are discussing industrial promotion it would not be out of place to refer to Asahi and the fears expressed by many people about the raw material being transported to that industry.  It is a pity all the people who criticised it were not present when the tests were carried out on the inflammability of acrilic-nitrate.  It was found that petrol was much more explosive and much more inflammable than this material.  Those types of trucks are passing our doors every day of the week.</P>
    <P>That industry is a very useful addition to the industrial scene in County Mayo.  It cost a great deal to put it there.  As I said before, perhaps enough equity was not taken up by foreign promoters.  There was a huge capital allocation from the financial interests involved in this country.  I hope phase two will come to fruition. There is a feeling of unease that phase two will not get off the ground.  Everything must be done to ensure that happy labour relations will exist in that company.  It would be a national tragedy of immense proportions to County Mayo if anything were to happen in an industry of that size.  It is the first large-scale heavy industry we have seen in our county.  We need others, especially male-orientated ones.  Imbalances must be corrected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1526" /> I am happy to welcome this Bill which strengthens the legislative structure and financing designed to make the IDA more useful in its promotional activities, more efficient in attracting industry and with a direct say in the future of industry.  I look forward to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and the Minister for Labour becoming the inseparable twins of Irish industry, all the time taking initiatives and introducing legislation which will improve the industrial relations structure and industrial development generally.  Indeed, this will be demanded by the people. The people have given us the right to govern and to do everything necessary for the nation's well-being.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. Unlike Deputy Flynn from my own county, I shall refrain from mentioning the unmentionable document, any mention of which is now painful to some members of the Government and their backbenchers.  Deputy Flynn will find out in time what the facts of life are where political manifestos are concerned.</P>
      <P>There are just a few points about the Bill.  It is designed to broaden the functions of the IDA, bringing the IDA up to date from the legislative and financial point of view.  The Bill provides for the establishment of an industrial consortium.  Now certain people have reservations about the ability of this consortium to do the job specified.  Possibly one of the reasons for those reservations stems from the vagueness of the utterances so far in relation to this body.  It will not create jobs.  We are told it will be a co-ordinating agency.  I have certain reservations about the capabilities of this body but I genuinely hope it will work and carry out its functions in accordance with the expectations of its originators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anything dealing with industrial expansion or development is non-contentious. Both sides have always sought to ensure that anything done to further industrial development had the support and co-operation of both sides. The only notable exception to that was the opposition of the Fianna Fáil <Col N="1527" /> Party to the establishment of the IDA. They had a perfect right to have reservations.  They were probably founded on fear of the unknown. Since then the IDA has proved eminently successful and the Government and their supporters are now prepared to back it up to the hilt.</P>
    <P>Now I have the same kind of reservations about this consortium for the same reasons, fear of the unknown but, hopefully, an ungrounded fear.  In ten or 15 years' time someone in this seat may stand up and express gratitude for the day when this consortium was set up.  I hope that will be the case though I have reservations about it.</P>
    <P>It would take a very brave person to criticise the IDA, because it has done an excellent job on behalf of industry in the past 27 years.  However, we must remember that the IDA is in the good-news business.  Ask anybody in rural areas what is the most important agency and I can assure you in nine cases out of ten he or she will unhesitatingly reply the IDA, just because it is a good-news agency.  When something is announced it is already in existence.  If there is no good news there is no announcement.  It is their privilege to operate in that way.  There is nothing wrong in not announcing bad news.</P>
    <P>We are responsible for the framework in which the IDA operate but there are times when one would hope for an in-depth look at the overall working of the IDA.  To date, we have been regarded as an agricultural country and, looking at the figures, we still are.  Unfortunately a very disturbing figure is now being bandied about. In 1971, 21 per cent of our total work force was engaged in agriculture.  The projection for 1986, nine years hence, is something in the region of 10 or 11 per cent of the total work force engaged in agriculture.  In effect that means that a great thrust forward will be necessary in the expansion of industry. Allied to that, the virtual termination of emigration is another factor which will cause unemployment to become a more critical area.  We who are lucky enough to live in areas <Col N="1528" /> where major developments have taken place recently have witnessed a reversal of emigration, with people who emigrated some years ago due to lack of opportunity here coming back now with their families, setting up house here and getting jobs.  So, I fully agree with Deputy Flynn's general sentiment that until we can say: &ldquo;We have now created enough jobs to cater for our current needs and the needs of those who were forced to leave the country&rdquo;. we have not righted the situation.  That is a fair assessment.</P>
    <P>The task ahead will be difficult. With emigration virtually stopped the average young man or woman, having completed education at national, vocational, secondary or third level, is not prepared to seek a living elsewhere, not because opportunities elsewhere have receded or do not even exist but because we are a more educated community, more demanding and we feel the country in which we are born owes us a living.  I often think of the enormous responsibility we in this House have because it is this House that is expected to uphold the rights of these people and provide opportunities for them.  We should more often think about this responsibility when entering on a political career because if we fail we shall be damned in the eyes of many thousands of people whose expectations we have raised and whose demands we have not met.</P>
    <P>Unemployment at the moment is very high.  Due to recession in the past couple of years it has increased but even prior to that, the tolerance expressed by the people and by successive Governments of the level of unemployment in so-called good times is, in retrospect, amazing.  I am not making a political point but we tolerated a level of unemployment in successive National Coalition Governments, as Fianna Fáil did in their time in office &mdash;before we came into office in 1973 about 70,000 people were unemployed and we are told that the late sixties and early seventies were boom times &mdash;which may be politically acceptable inasmuch as we can get away with it as politicians, but it is not socially acceptable and the problems created <Col N="1529" /> by that level of unemployment are something that I think we cannot handle in future because people are becoming more demanding.  They demand a rise in their standard of living; they demand their rights from the powers-that-be, such as this House, and while that level of unemployment in the past may have been at least on the surface acceptable, it may not be so in the future.  Definitely, it would not be socially acceptable because the problems created by it would be so great and on the increase that it would be beyond our capabilities to solve it within the present framework.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention in this context the problem of overtime brought about by inflation and high expectations.  The person in employment is demanding more and more overtime.  This must be to the detriment of the unemployed.  This is an area that must be examined very carefully because there are people who are in gainful employment, some in State agencies and State bodies, who are absolutely paranoid about overtime. In many cases all their commitments are based on the expectation of overtime. At the same time you have the general working body seeking shorter working hours.  There is no contradiction here because overtime brings a higher rate of pay and if you establish a shorter working week and actually work a longer week your proportion of overtime will be greater and consequently your take-home pay.  We cannot afford that luxury with large numbers of people unemployed.</P>
    <P>The role of the IDA has been discussed many times here and elsewhere. Within the limitation of their functions to seek industry abroad and establish industry here, they work well.  At this stage, I think it is time to look again to see if what was functional, acceptable, correct and practical 20 years ago is so today or if it should be changed.</P>
    <P>There is a lobby here which says that the IDA set out to get industry into this country and that they accept the concept of industry at any price. That is not true.  Deputy Flynn mentioned the Japanese industry, Asahi, which is situated in my constituency. <Col N="1530" /> That caused a fair amount of comment at national level because of the alleged danger of pollution from disposal of effluent and because of the danger of raw materials being transported across the country.  Many of the fears have been allayed and questions have been answered to the satisfaction of all concerned. More recently in Cork there was controversy concerning the same problem.</P>
    <P>Many genuinely well-meaning groups are concerned about the concept of industry at any price, but we must be careful not to turn away major industrial development.  We are now members of the EEC and it is because of that membership that much of our expansion has taken place.  We are a good base from which commodities can be launched into the EEC markets. We have a labour force and the facilities, apart from some areas.  We are an attractive country in that we provide good incentives to foreign investors, but all that is not at any price.</P>
    <P>However, a price must be paid to industrialise a country, and anybody who says differently has his head in the sand.  The industrial revolution which took place in the last century in England has shown that a high price was paid for industrialisation.  While on one side there were great improvements and vast strides forward were made in employment conditions with the establishment of workers' unions and so on nevertheless a price had to be paid.  In some cases, where there was not the sophistication we have now for monitoring pollution, a very high price was paid and mistakes were made.  I maintain that this country is now in the middle of an industrial revolution.  We were untouched by the last industrial revolution.  We have a great opportunity in that we need not repeat the mistakes made elsewhere and we can in retrospect find out what mistakes were made and how they can be avoided.  Because of international pressures we are tempted to take an industry from abroad regardless of the consequences.  That is a disadvantage. When an industry comes here there are many constraints and it goes under great scrutiny, but we are leaving ourselves open to the unreasonable charge <Col N="1531" /> that the pressures are so great on the IDA and the competition is so cutthroat that we are prepared to grasp at anything.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Council have done studies and have commissioned studies with regard to the siting of industries.  There are two schools of thought here.  One suggests that large industry should be located in large growth centres and the other is that smaller type industries would be a more appropriate approach for this country.  We are told that the policy pursued is one somewhere in between, where small industries are as far as possible established in suitable areas for that type of development and larger type industries are located in areas more suitable to them.  I agree with that concept, but in my area there is an example of a large industry located in a place where there has been no previous industrial experience.  It was put there because of the availability of water and the availability of facilities for the disposal of industrial effluent.  Without those two factors that industry would not have been located there.  As a member of two local bodies in that area, an urban council and a county council, I had the privilege and the advantage of seeing what type of problems arise with regard to this policy of locating such an industry in a rural area.  Naturally I have no criticism to make of that decision.  I have always been delighted with the decision and when pressure was on with regard to this industry and when certain very critical questions were raised, I always defended this decision to locate the industry there.  However, it did cause problems.  Those problems are physical and social.  The physical problems concern the provision of many basic needs of an industry, water, sewerage, housing and roads. There is general agreement that where the IDA have been successful in attracting an industry the Government and their agencies ensure that the back-up services are provided.  I should like to express my gratitude at the speed and efficiency of the Government and State agencies in providing this service for industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1532" /> One message that came home forcibly to me was that a multiplicity of agencies is concerned in the establishment of a major industry.  That is as it should be but the people involved in this case, a Japanese firm, were amazed at the number of people they had to consult.  At times they felt they were being sent around in circles.  The Government were involved because the allocation being made by the IDA was such that Government approval was necessary.  The planning authority, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, An Foras Forbartha, the Department of Agriculture and other agencies were concerned.  While all this may sound very confusing, perplexing and possibly frustrating to industrialists it serves a purpose for us in that we have all the safeguards, and by the time the end result filters through we can be sure it is going to be to our satisfaction.  From the experience I have had I suggest that the proposed consortium take on the job of co-ordinating the efforts and the involvement of the agencies I have mentioned.  It would save time if we had a committee on which would be represented all these agencies.</P>
    <P>The Department of Labour should also be included.  Unfortunately, that Department does not come into the reckoning until it is too late in many cases.  Deputy Flynn mentioned that in labour relations, governments, in particular the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, would not stand aside&mdash;I suppose he meant to say that they would not stand idly by&mdash;while people played games.  I presume the Deputy was referring to industrial unrest. It should be remembered that this is not a game; it is a very serious matter. I would be slow to suggest any major change in our attitude to the industrial regulations concerning the unions and so on or the involvement of the Minister because unions fought a hard battle down the years to establish themselves and their rights.  If the consortium takes on this job of co-ordinating the work of all the agencies at an early stage in the establishing of the industry the Departments of Labour, Industry, Commerce and Energy and Agriculture should also be <Col N="1533" /> involved.  We all know that labour unrest is a big problem and it can cause great losses.</P>
    <P>When the IDA have done their job in attracting an industry a committee should then take over to co-ordinate the efforts of the agencies involved.  In many cases one is dealing with a foreign concern the personnel of which may not be aware of all the nuances involved and the people they must see. Some of them come from countries with a different cultural background to ours and they do not understand our methods.  I found, as a public representative, that I was asked to do things completely outside my function.  I did them because of the circumstances involved and my anxiety to ensure that the people concerned were satisfied.  I was forced into the position of having to go to certain agencies and individuals and explain the problem because the industrialists concerned did not know where to go.  There is also a language barrier in many cases and cognisance must be taken of that.  A co-ordinating committee would be a great advantage to foreign industrialists.</P>
    <P>I should now like to make a point concerning our attitude to industrialisation here from an educational viewpoint. This was brought home to me forcibly when I read an article in the issue of <i>The Sunday Times</i> on Sunday last under the heading &ldquo;Who wants to Work in a Factory?&rdquo;  The article, about an area in North London, concerned the attitudes of young people to factory work.  We have had an academic-orientated educational system here for many years and it is still with us.  Parents tend to push their children into areas of academic instruction and education that will lead them to what is known as a permanent position.  At one time the civil service was the be all and end all and if one did not get a job there one was in trouble.  Lower down on the scale were teaching and nursing and these were the three main areas which absorbed our youth.  We now have many more opportunities for employing youth but these opportunities have not been recognised by the major section of our educational system.  We are still in a <Col N="1534" /> position where the attitude to industrial work is not at all satisfactory. There is a deep-seated antagonism to factory work.  Parents tend to inculcate into their children the idea that working in industry is something which has to be avoided at all costs.  This is especially so in the west.  Because of the harsh environment there, the lack of good land and so on, unless one got a job in the civil service or became a teacher or a nurse the only alternative was emigration.  Consequently, the idea was that these were the only avenues open to anybody who wished to stay in the country and earn a living.  That sort of attitude still persists today and we must break down the prejudice towards factory work.</P>
    <P>While we might pull down our unemployment figures, there is such a thing as job satisfaction and unless we provide employment which gives a level of satisfaction to the individual we are not doing our jobs as administrators. How to break down this prejudice I do not know.  But I do know that to visit a factory and have a cup of tea with the personnel manager, while it is part of the window-dressing in the breakdown of this prejudice, is in no way sufficient; it cannot do the job.  The holding of seminars concerned with job opportunities in industry is another area that can be exploited, but on its own it will do no good.  I should like to see some type of assault on this problem, perhaps by the setting up of a committee of experienced people to co-ordinate the efforts being made.  This would involve the Department of Education and the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.  We have this deep-seated prejudice and antagonism because of historical circumstances and it will not be easy to break down this attitude.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to third level education is not satisfactory in that we have third level institutions which are not playing their full part in the area of industry and technology. There are some third level institutions specifically orientated towards that type of activity, but we have not enough of these institutions.  One only has to ask the personnel manager of <Col N="1535" /> any major factory whether people with highly technical skills are available and he will say that they are not.  Yet there are highly qualified people walking the streets of our towns because they cannot get employment.  This is part of the malaise springing from our attitude to industrial employment, and we cannot afford the luxury of ignoring this problem.  This is a major area of concern, together with the basic problem of providing jobs.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a very sensitive area.  People will be engaged in a certain kind of employment for the rest of their lives.  Unless they have job satisfaction and are happy in their work they will not give the productivity which is necessary for this country to prosper.  Neither will they be what we would regard as good citizens, because they will have a grudge against society and against authority for having given them employment for which they were never meant or for which they have no liking.  There is a large area of discontent here and a change of orientation is needed in our efforts to expand industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of offering my congratulations to Deputy O'Malley on his appointment as Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  I wish him every success in this demanding ministry and I offer my congratulations to his very able Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, who has shown her ability already in introducing the Bill dealing with consumer protection which was recently passed by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this very important Bill before us which I hope will have a speedy passage through the House. Many of the sections contained in the Bill are long overdue and are badly needed by the IDA to enable them to develop and expand their activities. Many people felt that the IDA already had these powers and were not using them.  It is now clear that they did not have these powers and this Bill will enable them to involve themselves more in the promotion and development of industry.  They are acting on <Col N="1536" /> behalf of the Government to attract industry.  This Bill gives them more power and money and the possibility of becoming more involved in industry. The Bill gives them the right to take shares in companies and, with the authority of the Minister, they could become majority shareholders.  This is a welcome innovation because the state must play a positive role in the promotion and development of industry.</P>
    <P>As a T.D. for two of the most industrially deprived counties, Roscommon and Leitrim, I must record my concern for the future of these two counties. Unless the IDA and other State agencies play a more positive role in the provision of employment in these areas they will not have a future.  Since the foundation of the State, both of these counties have suffered from emigration and unemployment.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that these deprived areas are given a fair share of the national cake.  As the new Deputy for that constituency, it is my duty to ensure that it is not neglected by the Government and the IDA.  If I achieve that success during my first term in this House, I will be very happy.</P>
    <P>Roscommon has lost 50 per cent of its population since 1901.  As a result of being deprived areas, western counties have had major decreases in population. For instance, in 1901 the population was 100,791 and it is now 53,510, according to the 1971 census. That means 56 persons per square mile.  It is estimated that more than 22,000 are under 25 years of age and that 82 per cent of the population live outside urban areas compared with a national figure of 48 per cent.  I am the youngest of a family of eight and five of my family had to emigrate.  My hope is that they will return and that they and members of my constituents' families will not have to emigrate again.  I know what it was like when my parents said good-bye to a girl of 16½ who was emigrating to England to start life there as a stranger without a friend.  I hope the Government will ensure that emigration will never again reach such proportions.</P>
    <P>The IDA have an important role to play in the creation of employment in <Col N="1537" /> the west.  The decline in population has slowed down in the last few years but sufficient jobs are still not being created to meet the demands.  We are fortunate to have the services of active and able development officers in the small industries programme, namely, Tom Lynch in Roscommon, Josie Martin in Leitrim and Tom Moloney in Athlone. These men have given great encouragement to small industries in my constituency. I should like to pay tribute to the late Seamus Duke who was development officer for Roscommon until his untimely death in 1971.  He did much work in a short time in order to bring industry to Roscommon, his native county.  Many people in County Roscommon owe their jobs to the work of this man.</P>
    <P>I recommend, as Deputy Flynn did, that the Minister should consider expanding the role of development officers.  They should play a more important role in attracting small industries to deprived areas.  They are conscious of the needs of their areas and know the people.  If they are given more money they can do more to encourage industries.  I know many young men who are prepared to start new industries and they are being advised by the development officers for their areas.  The difficult task of these men would be made more difficult if they had to travel to Dublin for advice. Some years ago there was talk of the development officers being phased out. Thank God the Fianna Fáil Party made sure this would not happen.  I should like to place on record my support for these people and I would ask the Minister to give them more money in order to create employment.</P>
    <P>In Roscommon there is a company that employs 40 people in the production of lime for farmers in the area. Some years ago they were discouraged by the IDA and were told that their business would not be viable.  However, they went ahead without any State aid and will expand their business if they are given aid.  These men from the Strokestown/Elphin area started quarrying on their own but were discouraged from the start by the Coalition Government, who refused to give them assistance.  Senator Keating <Col N="1538" /> and his colleagues told them they would not survive but they were proved wrong.  By their efforts, the lime is now being used by farmers in Roscommon, Longford and Leitrim and their business has increased by 400 per cent.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that this firm and others like it are helped to expand in order to create more employment.  We should encourage more people to provide employment in their areas by using native materials.  By so doing they will be of benefit to areas into which it is difficult and costly to attract industry.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government will give more encouragement to industry.  I would ask the IDA to encourage semi-State bodies to expand their activities in areas like Roscommon and Leitrim. In my own area of Roscommon CIE closed a quarry employing ten men some years ago.  That quarry was in operation for 45 to 50 years and it produced the best quality stone.  As a county councillor I sought to have it reopened.  I was told by CIE that it would be opened last spring, but I am still waiting for it.  I suggest that in areas like that, where there is such a serious need for employment, State bodies like CIE should be forced to reactivate industries like the quarry I have been speaking about.  The quarry was closed down under the previous administration and I will be delighted to bring the news to my constituents that it will be reopened by the present Government.</P>
    <P>The development of a milk processing plant in Ballaghadereen, the establishment of factories by the Roscommon Mart with funds from the people &mdash;I am a shareholder and so are several farmers&mdash;and other such local enterprises give good employment in an area where there has not been employment.  Unfortunately the Roscommon Mart undertaking, employing 36 to 40 people, has been closed down by industrial action.  I have intervened and I hope the men will be back at work in a week.</P>
    <P>I compliment the co-ops on the work they are doing in Roscommon.  They play an important role in providing employment.  It shows what can be done when people get together.  We <Col N="1539" /> have bacon and beef factories and I particularly point to the Hanley Brothers' bacon and beef factory in Roosky which provides excellent employment for people from Leitrim and Roscommon.  I compliment the IDA on the assistance they have given to that firm who process pigs and cattle produced locally, giving much needed employment.  It is a pity that there are not more such local industries processing local produce instead of sending cattle, pigs and sheep on the hoof to England and elsewhere, giving employment there instead of here.</P>
    <P>The IDA must look at this situation seriously to ensure that we will get the maximum benefit in Ireland from the produce of farmers.  Farmers should be given the maximum prices for their produce, which should be processed and finished here and then exported. This, in turn, would not only create local employment but skilled jobs as well.  Irish processed meat is of the highest quality and its reputation abroad is growing.</P>
    <P>The removal of tax from co-ops was a very welcome move and I should like to encourage the co-ops to reinvest their savings in their own localities. Any surplus they have should be invested locally to give much needed employment.  The Roscommon Mart must be complimented on their investment in Athleague.  They did not wait for somebody to come from Belgium or Holland.  They initiated a thriving industry with the help of the IDA.</P>
    <P>Grave concern has been expressed in Ballyforan in south Roscommon at the recent decision of the Minister, on the advice of the ESB, not to develop a generating station in that area.  I request the Minister to reconsider his decision and to ask the ESB to think again about their recommendation, which was based on a cost factor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of this Bill, the Minister has no responsibility for the ESB.  The Deputy will have an opportunity to raise this matter at some other time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>It affects employment in that area and that is what we are all concerned with.  I suggest that the Minister's decision was based on an ESB recommendation which, in turn, was based on inflated figures.  The people in that area want to see a generating station built there.  There are 16,000 acres of good peat crying out for development in the area, sufficient raw material to establish an 80 megawatt station.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister has instructed Bord na Móna to give consideration to setting up a briquette factory in that area.  I hope we will have good news for the district.  A briquette factory would give much needed employment, would utilise to the maximum the raw material found in the area and would help generally in an area that is gravely hit by unemployment.  At the moment it is difficult to get briquettes; I think Bord na Móna are not producing enough.  There is the raw material available in the Ballyforan area and there could be much employment in the production of the briquettes.  The people of Ballyforan are fighting for employment in their area, a deprived area in south Roscommon. I support them in their struggle.  Their fight for the area is my fight.  If we could obtain some industry for the district it would reduce the unemployment figure and would give a boost and encouragement to people in that deprived and neglected area of south Roscommon.</P>
      <P>Some years ago the fact that the bogs were there was a major drawback to progress and to the development of farming, but since the oil crisis of 1973 the bogs are regarded as a major resource. The IDA should encourage semi-State bodies to set up industries. I should like to compliment Bord na Móna on what they have achieved.  No private enterprise undertaking could have set up such a development and I wish to place on record my appreciation of their work.  Long may they continue to develop our natural resources. In the Arigna collieries there is a poor quality coal known as &ldquo;crow&rdquo; coal. This coal is being studied by the Department of Industry, Commerce and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1541" /> Energy from the point of view of generating electricity.  I hope the studies will be completed quickly and that we will have a generating station in the area.  This would give much needed employment in north Roscommon.</P>
    <P>The IDA should consider and assess the potential of the greatest waterway in these islands, the Shannon. They should develop this natural resource, having due regard to tourist and environmental considerations.  At the moment consideration is being given to setting up a development board for the River Shannon.  About a year ago a seminar was held in Athlone by the midland regional development organisation and the general consensus was that the full potential of this waterway should be fully utilised and developed, this giving much needed employment.  There is great scope in the entire area for a major industry which could utilise the valuable natural resource of water.  I understand that the IDA are seeking about 100 acres of land along the Shannon.  I hope they will meet with success in their endeavours to provide employment.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment must play a role in the provision in Roscommon of the infrastructure required, namely, roads and water and sewerage services.  The area has been much neglected in the past decade. Unless the regional water supply scheme for south Roscommon proceeds quickly&mdash;I am expecting a decision from the Minister on this matter very shortly&mdash;it will be a major drawback. The area is surrounded by the Rivers Shannon and Suck but there is a scarcity of water for drinking purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite clever in getting in a lot of points that do not arise on this Bill.  Matters relating to regional water supplies are not in order in this discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that without water it is difficult to have industries.  The provision of water supplies in south <Col N="1542" /> Roscommon has been neglected but I shall not deal with that matter any further now because of the ruling by the Chair.  The provision of water and sewerage facilities and the improvement of roads are important matters and I hope the services will be developed.</P>
      <P>I should like to support the recent call by Leitrim County Council for the development of a timber processing plant in County Leitrim in order to develop the woods, a natural resource of the area.  There is great potential to set up a chipboard factory so that the planting that has taken place will be utilised.  Leitrim has been badly neglected and it has suffered much unemployment in the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary to give consideration to the promotion of the &ldquo;Buy Quality Irish&rdquo; campaign.  There is a need to point out to the people, to the IDA and to the semi-State bodies the desirability of buying quality Irish goods.  Recently I went to an hotel that was supported by Gaeltarra Éireann and I found that the sugar on the table was supplied by Tate and Lyle of England.  I took some of the cubes of sugar with me and checked on the matter and I have been in communication with the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and his Department to ensure that this does not happen again.  It is a shocking situation that this should happen when we have a factory at Tuam that produces sugar.  I realise we cannot stop the importation of commodities under EEC regulations but we can discourage their use.  It is quite unacceptable that an hotel in County Donegal that is supported by Gaeltarra Éireann should use sugar from abroad when it can be obtained at home.  The Tuam factory is providing much needed employment in the area and possibly it could expand if we could prevent the importation and use of foreign supplies.  I mention this instance as just one example of what is happening.  We should not be importing agricultural products; we should be producing them and developing the industry.  We should be ashamed of a situation where any <Col N="1543" /> agricultural products are imported here instead of producing them ourselves and providing employment.</P>
    <P>It has been brought to my attention by industrialists in my area that the Industrial Credit Company credits that were given some time ago carry an extremely high rate of interest when compared with the merchant banks and other banks.  It is in the region of 13¼ per cent.  If this rate was reduced to 9 per cent or 10 per cent it would be a boost for industrialists who are working hard to produce and give much needed employment.</P>
    <P>I would also ask him to consider the special employment subsidy which is being granted in England for the textile industry and to ask him to ensure that this special assistance is not continued there.  Ireland is inclined to comply with every EEC directive but if they do not suit the English, they will disregard them.  They are giving this special employment subsidy which is placing our firms in a very uncompetitive situation with firms producing similar goods in the North and in Britain.  One firm in my constituency, Gentex, are hoping the Government will either introduce a special employment subsidy or ensure that the subsidy in England will be abolished so that they will be in a more competitive position.  The Minister is aware of this point because he has received a deputation from interested parties and I hope he will introduce some measure to ensure that this situation is resolved. Other industries in my constituency have also been affected.  It even affected an industry set up by a former Member which is providing employment for 40 girls in Roscommon town.  I compliment the IDA on their work and the provision of a factory in Roscommon town which was taken over by Stainless Steel Products.  This firm has gone from strength to strength and employs over 200 people.</P>
    <P>A 24,000 square feet advance factory is being built in Roscommon town and I would ask the IDA to ensure that it is filled as soon as it is completed. The advance factory programme has been a spectacular success. <Col N="1544" /> Industrialists like to move fast and they find the facility of an advance factory very attractive.  The IDA should encourage this and consider providing more advance factories in my constituency.</P>
    <P>I would like to give the Minister some idea of the unemployment situation in my constituency.  There are 500 people waiting to be employed by Stainless Steel Products.  I hope this firm expands and provides employment for them.  This factory is giving good employment under good working conditions.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with another point which was raised by Deputy Flynn: the implementation of the Fianna Fáil policy of decentralisation of Government Departments.  This was initiated under Fianna Fáil.  This may not be directly concerned with the IDA but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It has no relevance to this Bill.  This Minister would have no responsibility for this, and if Deputy Flynn dealt with it he was not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister and the IDA an article in <i>The Sunday Times</i> of 9th October, 1977, regarding the Ford engineering plant.  This is relevant to the IDA because they are involved in attracting industry here. This plant, which would employ 2,500 people, has gone to Wales.  The article which is damaging to the IDA has been undisputed.  Some interesting points were brought out in that article which paints rather an unhappy picture of our situation.  Perhaps the IDA were not aware of the plans in time to present an attractive offer.  Henry Ford II was in Cork on the 15th June and met the then Taoiseach, Deputy Liam Cosgrave.  The article said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We stayed up till two in the morning discussing life in general but we didn't say anything about the plant,&rdquo; says one Ford man. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach stayed up until two in the morning discussing life in general with Henry Ford II and the plant for Cork was never mentioned.  Then <Col N="1545" /> somebody realised that there was a possibility that this plant could be attracted to Ireland.  The article went on to say:</P>
    <P>Not until after that did word reach the Irish Development Agency. Instantly, Lynch ordered an all-out effort...</P>
    <P>By the end of July, the Irish had assembled a package worth around £50 million in investment grants&mdash; plus the prospect of a tax free holiday for the profits earned by the engine plant until 1990.  Their most imaginative proposal, however, was that the construction of the plant should be done by a specially-formed consortium of <i>British</i> firms funded by <i>British</i> taxpayers' money. </P>
    <P>I would like that article to be disputed by the IDA.  If that is the situation, I reject the idea of this type of incentive whereby English consortiums would be backed by the IDA to attract industry here.  Firms told me that they would be prepared, backed by the IDA, to attract industry here and provide the technical knowledge necessary.  These firms have told me that they would have been, and are, prepared to provide an Irish consortium and the technical know-how and back-up services necessary to provide as good, if not better, technical information which could have been used in this instance to provide a large plant in Cork and so give a great deal of employment.</P>
    <P>I want the IDA to say exactly where they stand on this issue.  They are encouraging Irish architectural and engineering firms to set up service industries.  We have provided services for Arab countries and other countries throughout the world.  I reject the fact that the IDA should work with an English consortium to provide this service for a factory we were trying to attract here.  I am gravely disappointed that this plant was not set up in Ireland because it would have given much needed employment in that area.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister and the IDA well in their work.  They will play the most important role in the country over the next four to five years.  Unless we create jobs so that there will be no need for emigration we will have <Col N="1546" /> chaos.  We cannot have well-educated people coming on to the labour market each year with no hope, no role, no future.  What Deputy O'Toole said about the employment situation in industry here I would say is correct, that prejudices are being broken down.</P>
    <P>A number of young people come to me, well-educated, with their leaving certificate, saying they are now prepared to work in industry because they see a future in it; there is little point in having a leaving certificate or so many honours but remaining unemployed. There is honour in work.  I agree that industry should be made more attractive, as should the conditions of employment.  But we must break down prejudices and I think they are being broken down.  I know that many people in my constituency with very good education are prepared to work in industry.  By their so doing industry can be improved and expanded because education is no burden to anybody working in industry; educated young people with skill are needed to overcome the obstacles facing industry in the years ahead. People are now queueing up for employment in industry here.</P>

      <P>My first duty is to welcome the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  As a Limerick man I am proud of his appointment and I wish him well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all agree that the IDA have been most impressive in the field of job creation.  I often wonder if a body such as the IDA was formed in time or rather was it established very late. In the 1940s our unemployment problem was solved by emigration.  Our figures at that time could be quite easily swept under the carpet, in Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Coventry.  Our Administration at that time never foresaw the day when England or American would find it impossible to continue absorbing our unemployed. On that account we did not plan for the future but rather depended too much on emigration.  Our record on employment was not good for many years.  In 1973 we went into the EEC on a high percentage poll in comparison with our then population. <Col N="1547" /> For that reason our difficulties from then on were very obvious.</P>
    <P>I should like to revert to the function of the IDA.  I ask the question: are we getting the full value of the amount of money spent in grants? Of course, I am subject to contradiction but grants are paid on job potential rather than on job creation. That being so it is an incentive to foreign industrialists to inflate their job potential.  I have never heard of an industrialist who would not inflate the job potential of his industry.  While recognising that the IDA must issue grants and incentives on the percentage of the assets of the industry concerned there should be some ceiling or control of grants according to the number of jobs actually realised rather than on the basis of job potential. I have often asked whether or not it could be arranged that the cost of a job be multiplied by the number created.  I do not know if that is possible and I hope the Minister will tell me.  The final portion of the grant should not be paid for at least two years, thus establishing an incentive to create more jobs in any firm concerned. The more people the firm employ the more money they would receive in the form of grant.  It would be only human nature that they would in no way neglect the possibility of increasing the number of jobs.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the small industries programme.  We in Limerick have a deep interest in it because it was Mr. O'Connor, our county manager at one time, who initiated the programme and who was the first regional manager of the IDA there. That programme, as established originally, was to bring attention to bear on industries in rural areas.  If we could pursue that policy further we would be doing a good job.  We all come across people from time to time who, in a small way, are anxious to start up their own small industry, say, in the field of furniture and so on. However, sometimes, because of overproduction or over-capacity, they are denied a grant.  I believe that the smaller firm would create a great incentive and be of tremendous advantage <Col N="1548" /> to our people in rural areas.  If people could start off in a small way we would have an opportunity of ascertaining whether or not they would make a success in the industrial field. I am quite certain that many people who would have been very efficient industrialists were denied the opportunity of proving their ability because they were denied such a grant.</P>

      <P>The pay rise of 5 per cent proposed in the Government's pre-election manifesto must be assessed in conjunction with the tax reliefs that are also proposed. Together these proposals would make for a substantial increase in workers' living standards.  They would also have a favourable effect on the competitiveness of Irish industry and <Col N="1549" /> prepare the way for significant increases in employment.  The manifesto proposals have been widely endorsed by the electorate and I do not think that any useful purpose is served by conjecture at this stage that they would not prove acceptable to the trade unions.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister has said but does he not feel at this stage that that impression was not necessarily given in the manifesto and that at the moment it is highly unlikely that 5 per cent will be acceptable to the trade union movement and that it is unreasonable to impose on the trade union movement the decision of last June?</P>

      <P>I cannot accept the Deputy's suggestion that it is highly unlikely or unreasonable that a 5 per cent increase should be accepted.  As I have indicated, it would provide for very substantial increases in the real take home pay of workers, much more substantial than anything experienced in recent years.  As I have already said, it is premature to speculate.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that it would be helpful, in the context of the suggested 5 per cent settlement together with the tax reduction, if he and other Government spokesmen speaking on this matter&mdash;if it is regarded as wise that they should speak on this matter at this point in the negotiations&mdash;should indicate quite clearly how an increase of £8 to £10 per week would be received by the wage earners?  There is confusion and misunderstanding on the issue.  Should it not be, from the Government's point of view even, clarified and completely substantiated that increases of £8 to £10 per week would be in the offing if the Government's proposals found acceptance with the employers and unions in <Col N="1550" /> the Employer Labour Conference talks?</P>

      <P>That is indeed so.  I believe members of the Government have made such statements on a number of occasions.  I would not rule out the possibility of many other statements, discussions or meetings as appropriate as the pay talks unfold. Again, at this juncture it is surely appropriate to enable the parties concerned to set about the arrangements for the pay agreement in their own way.  It is no wish of the Government's to interfere to any extent with the process of collective bargaining.</P>

It would be helpful from the Government's point of view if factual supporting material was advanced by Government spokesmen.  They have made statements that £8 to £10 a week would be available.

      <P>I do not know who created the expectation of £8 to £10 a week increase as a minimum to workers.  Certainly no spokesman on the Government side has done that.  We have been at pains to point out that the combined effect of tax reductions and pay increases would <Col N="1551" /> lead to increased cash sums to the average industrial earnings in that range.  The actual increase in cash terms for any worker, of course, depends on his individual circumstances, his individual pay rate, the tax bracket in which he finds himself and so forth.  My understanding is that Government spokesmen on this matter have always indicated that there was a range of increases, as is typical in every national wage agreement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not.  I have to point out that in so far as average earnings are concerned, quite apart from any fresh pay rise, if you take the Government's indication of a 5 per cent pay increase for next year and if you add to that the carry-over effect of this year's pay agreement and the normal element of drift which creeps into all pay rounds, including this year's, you arrive at a figure in excess of 10 per cent for the increase in earnings next year for industrial workers, somewhere in the range of 10 per cent to 12 per cent. That is not an insignificant figure.  It is well in line with the sort of increases in earnings that have been talked about across the channel.</P>
      <P>We are frequently subjected to that type of argument.  Though I do not accept that comparison as particularly relevant, nonetheless to the extent that it does creep in, let us make it clear that increases in earnings for workers next year on average will be in double figures even with a fresh 5 per cent pay rise as suggested by the Government, so I do not accept, therefore, that it is in any way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Deputy therefore is misquoting.  The council believe that, while the objective may be difficult to reach by 1986, significant progress towards it can be made by that date, if the community wills its achievement and accepts the required policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government recognise fully that, on the basis of economic performance in recent years and having regard to the expected increase in the labour force in the years ahead, satisfactory progress towards the objective will demand changes in existing policies.  It is the Government's view that the required policy changes can best be identified and implemented through a more concerted and planned approach to the development of the economy generally.  As emphasised by the council, the success of efforts to increase employment depends on the appropriate support from all sections of the community, and it is the intention of <Col N="1555" /> the Government to pursue the policies and provide the leadership needed to generate that support.</P>

    <P>At the recent meetings between the Taoiseach and other Government Ministers and representatives from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Employers' Confederation the issue of the Government's proposals in the areas of pay, tax reliefs, <Col N="1556" /> social insurance contributions and employment creation was raised.  The Taoiseach emphasised at both meetings that the proposals are part of the same overall package.  They are all linked and, therefore, if any were to be settled at a figure other than 5 per cent, the Government would naturally have to consider the adverse effects which such a settlement could produce and to decide upon the consequential action needed to ensure the progress towards the Government's announced targets for reducing unemployment and inflation was not impaired.</P>
    <P>While the discussions with congress concentrated on the prospects for the creation of employment and the reduction of unemployment in 1978, the confederation put forward several proposals relating to components of the package.

I should point out that at that stage it was not clear, for instance, whether the union side would agree to enter negotiations or talks for a new agreement.  They have still to ballot on the matter.  It would be the Government's position, therefore, to set out simply the economic circumstances as we saw them, the nature of the action required from all sections of the community and then try to indicate some of the consequences, positive on the one hand and negative on the other, of various rates of pay increases and leave the parties then to go away and commence negotiations.

      <P>The Deputy's question appears to be based on a misconception in so far as guidelines have not been fixed as envisaged by him in respect of workers' income levels under any new pay agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government in their pre-election manifesto and since taking office have indicated the advantages of tax cuts and a reduction in the amount of the social insurance contribution of low-paid <Col N="1562" /> workers combined with a pay rise of about 5 per cent as the basis of a national strategy for raising employment and cutting inflation.  Taking into account the carryover of pay increases from 1977 into 1978 and the effects of the proposed tax cuts and other measures, workers generally would benefit from a worth-while increase in real take-home pay under the Government's proposals.  I am confident that workers in settling pay claims relating to the period after the expiry of the current national agreement, will carefully weigh the advantages of these real benefits against the illusory effects of large nominal increases in pay offset by mounting price rises and continuing high levels of taxation.</P>
    <P>In the light of what I have said, the question of fixing permissible income levels of bank profits, investment shares, dividends and similar sources of income does not arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister accepts the point I was trying to establish, and which the Taoiseach appeared to be trying to establish, that there is a relationship between a wage agreement and increased employment.  Will the Minister not agree that this is a gross over-simplification of the whole thing, and the general principle of permitting unlimited dividends, interests, profits and so on in one sector of the economy and asking another sector to accept limitations appears to create the impression among workers that they are being discriminated against in favour of a minority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's point that such a viewpoint could arise.  It is no part of the Government's intention to discriminate unfairly against any sector, be it workers or any other group.  There are many complex problems in this area.  One of the difficulties is that because many other forms of income are not fixed to any particular base they can fluctuate downwards as well as upwards, and many of the categories of income to which the Deputy referred, such as profits, dividends and so forth, suffered significant declines during the depression of recent years.  Therefore, it is not all that surprising that there should <Col N="1563" /> be some corresponding increases once recovery got under way.  It is a problem of relating categories of income which can vary significantly from one year to another to categories of income which, for very good social reasons, we want to see remaining stable and not subject to very severe short-term situations.  That is one problem. The other problem which arises from the Deputy's remarks is the notion that it is too simplistic to relate pay restraint to any expansion of investment in employment.</P>
      <P>I take the point that pay restraint of itself does not necessarily lead to increased employment, but on the other hand in the absence of pay restraint it may not be possible to bring about additional employment or increased investment.  One could say that pay restraint is a necessary condition but by itself it may not be sufficient to achieve increased investment and employment. It is one part of a series of measures which are needed.  While I sympathise with some of the points expressed, I do not believe that we could produce within the short span of a few weeks a satisfactory solution for incomes policy to apply to all sectors of the economy.  At this stage when we are already embarking on negotiations for a new national wage agreement, it is necessary to leave aside these complex issues until we have a more appropriate opportunity for developing long-term policy.</P>

I did get the impression from a recent speech that the Minister was critical of previous national wage agreements and I did not think that was wise from his point of view.  Would the Minister agree that the likelihood of obtaining a moderate settlement based on the improvement of the economy is enhanced if the trade unions see that this moderation is to be applied evenhandedly across the board and that it will not enhance prospects of securing moderation from wage earners if they see other categories not subject to such moderate standards?</P>

      <P>I have already indicated that these are fairly complex questions which would take some time to resolve and I am quite willing to have them discussed in the context of formulating some longer-run economic planning.  I have said in reply to Deputy Browne that it is not a fact that the real incomes of workers have declined under national wage agreements; they have not.  We were associated with the earlier agreements.  The first one or two national wage agreements during the Coalition's term of office also provided some increase in real incomes. Had the terms of the current wage agreement been held to, there would <Col N="1565" /> have been a substantial fall in the real take-home pay of workers.  Deputy O'Leary is to be complimented on being the only Minister who was associated with negotiating agreements under which workers were to voluntarily accept a cut in their real take-home pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, that fall will not take place because as the year has progressed there have been <i>de facto</i> more unofficial increases taking place&mdash;wage drift, if we use the polite phrase&mdash;and the net result according to the trade unions themselves is that they estimate that real incomes will rise by anything between ½ per cent and two per cent this year.</P>

At the meeting, held on 15th November, the association informed the officials of its decision to reduce the rates charged on existing and new loans to the levels subsequently announced.</P>
      <P>There can be no doubt about the importance of interest rates on housing loans in the context of social and economic planning.  The availability of loans at reasonable rates is significant for the stability of the construction industry and, as a consequence, for the economy at large.  The level of interest rates is equally important for those who are buying or who wish to buy their own houses.

      <P>asked the Minister for Economic Planning and Development the controls he envisages for interest rates on housing loans in his plans for economic and social <Col N="1569" /> progress; and if a fixed relationship will be maintained between the interest rates on building society and SDA loans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several factors which influence movements in the level of interest rates on the various types of housing loans.  In the event of these movements leading to an unsatisfactory situation, it would of course be appropriate for the Government to consider suitable action.</P>
      <P>Since the factors that govern the interest rates charged on building society and SDA loans are very different and do not necessarily change simultaneously, it is unlikely that a given relationship between the two rates could be maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that for the first time in many years the SDA interest rate is 3 per cent higher than the building society rate and that until recently it was 1½ per cent lower?  Therefore, a gap of 4½ per cent has been filled in favour of building society borrowers.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the interest rates of the two groups have moved in the direction suggested. That makes my point, which I spelled out in my reply, that the factors which influence the trends in the two sets of interest rates are different.  SDA borrowers did have the benefit of lower stable rates of interest during the period of very high interest rates which we experienced in recent years.  Surely you can equally plausibly construct a case which says that the person who had to pay the very high building society rate in recent years is the first person in need of some reduction.</P>

    <P>SDA loans are made available at rates of interest which are based on the rates at which the Exchequer can borrow long-term domestic fixed interest funds and the rate of interest attaching to these loans is fixed for the life of the loan.  The interest rate <Col N="1572" /> at which building societies advance loans is determined by movements in short-term interest rates and the interest rate on these loans is variable throughout the life of the loan.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take questions Nos. 12 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1975, accurate data on female participation rates disaggregated by age-cohort could be derived only from the full Census of Population. As this is normally taken every five years, annual figures are simply crude interpolations of the quinquennial data.</P>
      <P>Due to the cancellation of the 1976 census by the previous Government, it is not possible to derive annual estimates which are strictly comparable with the 1971 census data.  Estimates of current participation rates are based on the 1975 Community Labour Force Survey.</P>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report a table showing female participation rates differentiated by age-group for 1971 and 1975.  The data for 1971 are based on the Census of Population returns.  I stress that the results of the labour force survey are not directly comparable with the census data because of definitional problems and the sample nature of the survey.</P>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the NESC report, &ldquo;Population and Employment Projections 1986&rdquo; which contains a range of labour force projections differentiated by sex and age group.  The range incorporates alternative assumptions regarding female participation rates, namely, that:</P>
      <P>  (1)  the 1975 participation rate remains stable in the period to 1986, and,</P>
      <P>(2)  the 1971-75 trend, adjusted for an expected slower trend rate for married women, will continue in the period to 1986.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The results of the 1975 Community sample survey showed that in 1975, 170,400 women aged 25 or over described themselves as &ldquo;at work&rdquo; or &ldquo;unemployed, having lost or given up previous job&rdquo;.  For the purposes of economic and social planning, it is assumed that female participation rates since 1975 have moved in line with the adjusted 1971-75 trend.  On this basis, the number of women aged <Col N="1575" /> 25 years and over who are currently at work or seeking work is estimated at about 172,000.  This estimate and related assumptions may have to be revised in the light of the results of the 1977 Community Labour Force Survey expected in 1978.</P>
    <P>If female participation rates continue to move in line with the adjusted 1971-75 trend in the period to 1986, then the figure for that year corresponding to the 1975 estimate would be about 181,000.</P>

Because of the partial coverage of the sample survey, the latter figures are subject to sampling errors.  For this reason and for reasons related to fundamental differences, both conceptual and definitional, between the two sources, the census data cannot be directly compared with the sample survey figures.</P>

      <P>I have already indicated that as far as unemployment is concerned the long-run acceptable target is nil, or as closely as we can go.  In so far as participation rates are concerned I have already indicated that we would start off with two sets of trends but we would also have to take account of, from the Deputy's point of view, the most unfavourable trend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the female participation rate of women over 24 in Ireland is roughly half that of the rest of the EEC?  Given that the trend is in that direction is it not conceivable that our rate of participation will double by 1986 thereby creating 170,000 new jobs which have not been budgeted for in any projection to date?</P>

However, on the basis of available information, a comparison can be made between employment participation rates for women in Ireland and in the European Community as a whole.  It is not possible to aggregate the various age groups between 25 and 54 years of age to provide an average participation rate for the whole group.</P>

      <P>The recent Report of the National Economic and Social Council (No. 35): &ldquo;Population and Employment Projections 1986: A Reassessment&rdquo; stated that over the 11 years from 1975 to 1986 a net increase in non-agricultural employment of between 18,000 and 23,000 jobs a year would be required to reduce unemployment to a 4 per cent level in <Col N="1579" /> 1986.  These figures would require to be adjusted by roughly 1,000 a year for every one percentage point variation in the unemployment rate chosen.</P>
      <P>The NESC estimates incorporate two assumptions regarding female participation which I have already dealt with.</P>
      <P>While my Department is in broad agreement with the NESC projections and the assumptions underlying them, I nevertheless recognise that they must be continuously reviewed and adjusted in the light of the most up-to-date information as it becomes available.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;`the Board' means an Bord Míochaine agus Déidliachta Iarchéime or the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board established by this Act;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position here, as Deputies who were involved in the Committee Stage discussion are aware, was that I indicated during the course of that discussion that I proposed to look again at section 37 as it was in the Bill, as amended in Committee, and the original section 36.  Section 36, as originally drafted in the Bill, proposed to give me powers to allocate to the Medical Council which we are now establishing functions in regard to post-graduate training and education.  On reflection it became quite clear that that would not be a very good way of proceeding because we already had a post-graduate council, a council for post-graduate education.  Therefore, there would be a conflict or overlap between the two bodies.  I undertook to look again at the situation.  Having looked <Col N="1592" /> at the situation again I decided&mdash;and I am sure the House will agree with me&mdash;that the right way to proceed is as follows.  We will leave the Medical Council all the functions which they already have in the legislation, that is, the functions in regard to education, training, discipline, ethics and so on.  But, side by side with that, we would give the existing Council for Post-Graduate Education and Training statutory status, give them, by statute all the duties and obligations which they now have as an informal council.</P>
    <P>Therefore the purpose of the number of amendments I am bringing forward here on Report Stage will be to bring about a situation in which we will now have two bodies of statutory status: (1) the Medical Council, which will have its functions as set out in this Bill, and (2) the Council for Post-Graduate Education and Training, which will have the specific function of initiating and promoting action in regard to post-graduate education and training in the future.  In so far as this amendment is concerned all we are concerned with here is defining the board.</P>
    <P>This new board will be an Bord Míochaine agus Déidliachta Iarchéime or, in English, the Post-Graduate Medical and Dental Board established by this Bill.  This is just to amend the definition section to indicate that where the words &ldquo;the board&rdquo; appear in the Act they will refer to this new statutory body.</P>

      <P>I want to take the opportunity when speaking on this amendment to register protest at the idea that this set of amendments, involving another discipline in the field of medicine, should have been circulated to some Members here only this morning.  I do not think it fair to anyone involved in the discussion, anyone studying the Bill, to be asked <Col N="1594" /> to consider new amendments and an entire new chapter of the Bill when the amendments are circulated only on the morning of the Report Stage being taken.  It is additionally unfair that some hours later we are asked to discuss those amendments as Report amendments rather than discuss them on Committee.  It is clearly quite ridiculous to amend the Long Title of the Bill and insist that it be a Report Stage discussion, that there be no opportunity afforded to have a Committee Stage discussion on a major amendment of a Long Title of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy&mdash;I was not here when it was taken&mdash;but all those amendments were to be taken with No. 4 and discussed fully in Committee. Apparently amendment No. 4 was accepted and agreed by the House. I can do nothing about that.  The major amendments later will be taken in Committee.  These amendments arise out of No. 4.  Amendment No. 4 was recommitted.  There was a full Committee Stage debate on it.  I do not know how long it lasted&mdash;it would seem for a very short period&mdash;but we have now gone past it.  I am sorry about that but there is nothing I can do about it.</P>

The Minister was somewhat lucky, shall we say, in that the recommital of the Long Title would have allowed me to discuss the other amendments to the Long Title which were ruled out of order.  However, I do want to register a protest. I do not think it fair to the House that major amendments should be circulated, amendments constituting a major change in the Bill, on the morning of Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P> In page 4, line 30, to delete &ldquo;Practise&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;be registered&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This large number of amendments would not be necessary if the principle behind some later amendments is accepted.  From that point of view I find myself a little constrained in discussing this amendment without knowing the Minister's attitude towards some later amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage and repeatedly on Committee Stage I expressed my belief <Col N="1597" /> that we should endeavour so far as possible not only to allow the medical profession to regulate itself but that we should introduce as many statutory safeguards for the general public as we could.  I said I believed the Long Title of the Bill which speaks about a Bill that will provide for the control and registration of persons engaged in the practice of medicine would lead the general public to believe when the legislation becomes law that all those engaged in the practice of medicine will be controlled and registered on foot of this measure, that if disciplinary action is taken against them by the Medical Council and if their name is erased from the register they will no longer be allowed in law to practise.</P>
    <P>However, as we went through the Bill we discovered that in law a person whose name is removed from the register will still be allowed to practise. I believe that concept is undesirable. When we are updating legislation that is 50 years old we should take the basic precaution of ensuring so far as possible that if a person's name is removed from the register by his medical colleagues because they believe he is guilty of gross professional misconduct he should not in law be allowed to practise or to hold himself as being in a position to practise.</P>
    <P>From that point of view I considered that if the Bill did not achieve those measures, to have a Fitness to Practise Committee set up under the Bill was as misleading as the Long Title. A Fitness to Practise Committee would lead the general public to believe that if the committee made a recommendation that a doctor was not fit to practise and if the recommendation was confirmed by the Medical Council and the High Court, the general public could reasonably be expected to believe that in law the doctor was no longer entitled to practise.  That is not the case.</P>
    <P>From that point of view I did two things.  I introduced some later amendments that would have the effect of giving High Court authentication to the Medical Council's decision that a doctor should not practise and, as an alternative if the amendments were not accepted, I considered it would be right <Col N="1598" /> that the Fitness to Practise Committee should be called &ldquo;a Fitness to be Registered Committee&rdquo;.  That is what the committee would be doing.  If it was sitting in judgment on a doctor who was believed to be guilty of gross professional misconduct and if it advised that the doctor's name should be removed from the register, that is all that would happen.  While the committee might consider the doctor should not practise and should not be allowed to practise, it does not have the power on its own or in the Bill as constituted to say that in law the doctor cannot continue to practise so long as his name is not on the register.</P>
    <P>From that point of view I considered the title of the committee&mdash;the Fitness to Practise Committee&mdash;could be misleading as far as the public are concerned. If the later amendments that would make it illegal as a matter of law for a doctor to continue to practise after his name was removed from the register and after the decision was confirmed by the High Court are not accepted, I consider the references to the Fitness to Practise Committee should be changed to &ldquo;Fitness to be Registered Committee&rdquo;.  It is rather difficult to make the point in relation to the amendments without discussing the later amendments but I am sure the Minister and the House will appreciate the significance of the point I am trying to make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I see what the Deputy is getting at but what is meant here is the fitness to practise orthodox medicine.  It does not mean fitness to be registered.  To solve this problem we would have to have an overall general medical council that would regulate orthodox medicine as we know it and then we would have to consider osteopathic and homoeopathic medicine.  I do not think the Minister can control all of that at present although in time he may get around to it.  What is being discussed is fitness to practise orthodox medicine as we know it here and I think Deputy O'Hanlon will agree with me on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand Deputy Boland's point.  The person concerned will not be allowed to practise orthodox <Col N="1599" /> medicine as such.  He can practise and give advice.  Deputy Boland can give advice to me about my health.  He can say &ldquo;You are not looking well.  I suggest you have a rest&rdquo;.  He is practising medicine when he says that.</P>

      <P>We are going into semantics if we talk about changing that.  It would be making the whole thing inoperable if we went into all those aspects of it.  We have to accept that we are discussing fitness to practise orthodox medicine.  I appreciate the Deputy's point but I do not think we could cover it by this.  The Minister has gone more than half way in meeting most of the points we raised on Committee.  I want to pay tribute to him for doing this because he has done a tremendous job with these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell made my arguments for me and I am very grateful to him.  I see exactly what Deputy Boland is at, but if he thinks about it carefully he would realise that he is more concerned here with words than with the reality of the situation.  Fitness to practice is a well known expression; it is in common and medical parlance.  It has its own standing as an expression.  Everybody knows what exactly it means.  In this context it means, as Deputy O'Connell pointed out, fitness to practise orthodox medicine on the basis of being a registered medical practitioner with certain minimum qualifications in formal medical education. It is a handy phrase to incorporate all that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we could all agree with Deputy Boland that the general situation in regard to the practice of medicine as such could be spelled out and dealt with at great length, it is not really necessary in practical terms for the purposes of this Bill which is dealing with a certain section of the community who have a certain formal education, certain professional qualifications, who, as such, are entitled to be registered and who the general public are entitled to know are <Col N="1600" /> registered, have these qualifications and therefore, have a certain standing and fitness in this area.  I do not think it is necessary for me to elaborate on what Deputy O'Connell has said in that regard.</P>
    <P>In one sense everybody practises medicine every day.  My hope, on which I shall elaborate at greater length very shortly, will be that everybody will be his own medical practitioner.</P>

      <P>She practises medicine when she decides whether to let them go to school, to send them to bed, to give them an Aspro, a hot drink or whatever.  Let us be absolutely clear about that.  We all know that the practice of medicine has a very wide context which is not incorporated in the Bill.  What we are dealing with here is a restricted group of professional people who have certain formal basic medical training, who will be registered as such, and as far as the general public are concerned, the only thing that will matter is that these people will be registered; that will indicate that they have the minimum qualifications at least, and that this body will exist to ensure that in the practice of their profession they maintain certain standards, abide by certain codes of behaviour and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have a certain sympathy <Col N="1601" /> with what Deputy Boland has in mind, that the whole corpus of people who would set up to practise medicine in any way so far as the general public are concerned would be controlled, it is certainly not on at the moment and is not contemplated in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his last sentence made the point I have been trying to make repeatedly during the debate on this Bill, and that is, that it is not envisaged in this legislation that effective control from the point of view of the general public should be brought about.  I am saying it should be and that this is the legislation in which it should be done.  In later amendments I have outlined in a very simple way how it can be done by the High Court confirming and making an order similar to the Medical Council's decision which would make it illegal and a statutory offence for a practitioner to continue to practise after the Medical Council had struck him off and had in effect, said: &ldquo;We do not think this man should be allowed to practise in public&rdquo; and after the High Court had confirmed that decision.  I feel it is undesirable that the man still in law, admittedly with some difficulties, is entitled to practice because he holds a primary qualification.  We should not allow that to happen.  If it is allowed to continue in this legislation, the reference to the Fitness to Practise Committee is to some extent a charade and misleading the public.</P>
      <P>We are all concerned and do our best to ensure that the general public are as well informed as possible about the operation of the medical profession and that the medical profession are safeguarded to the greatest extent possible.  In my view we should not be ignoring the opportunity to make it a statutory offence for a doctor to practise orthodox medicine if the Medical Council have said he is not fit to have his name entered on their register. That was the thinking behind this amendment.  If the other amendments which would regulate that are not accepted.  I do not believe the Fitness to Practise Committees really deserve that title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1602" /> Since we last met I have come to the conclusion that virtually every part of this Bill is based on the Merrison Report, the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Regulation of the Medical Profession, published by H.M. Stationery Office and submitted to the British Government in 1975.  They outlined in great detail the situation that obtains in England.  There, a doctor being removed from the medical register is still strictly speaking entitled to practise but because of the widespread national health system operating there, he cannot operate within that system if his name is not on the register.  There are controlling committees in different areas in that scheme who co-ordinate with the Medical Council to ensure that any doctor who had his name removed from the medical register is removed from the national health service which effectively debars him from practising in Britain.</P>
    <P>There is no equivalent system here and for that reason we should make it a statutory offence under this Bill or face up to the fact that this Bill will not completely govern who may practise orthodox medicine even if he is struck off the medical register.  If that is a fact, unpalatable as it may be, do not call this a Fitness To Practise Committee or say that this is a Bill to provide for the registration and control of persons engaging in the practise of medicine, when it is only a Bill to control some of the persons engaged in the practice of medicine.  That was the thinking behind this and my other amendments.  There is no point in delaying the House so I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept your ruling fully that this is a new matter.  It arose out of discussions which I had with representatives of the medical profession since Committee Stage.  The purpose of the amendment is to give a vote to every fully registered medical practitioner in the election of members to the council irrespective of whether or not he is actually practicising medicine or resident in the State.  If a doctor pays his retention fee and his registration continues he will be entitled to vote. It will be seen from the wording of <Col N="1604" /> this section, as amended in Committee, that that is not what is in the Bill at present.  Paragraph (f) reads:</P>
    <P> ten fully registered medical practitioners engaged in the practice of medicine in the State.... </P>
    <P>It goes on to state:</P>
    <P> appointed by election by fully registered medical practitioners engaged in the practice of medicine in the State; </P>
    <P>These are the words which we propose to delete.  If Deputies will study amendment No. 10 it is on page 7, line 41 that it is proposed to delete the words, &ldquo;engaged in the practice of medicine in the State&rdquo;. We will then have the situation where the persons who can be elected will still have to be in practice but the electorate need not be in practice.</P>

      <P>The point the Minister is making is a fair enough one.  I take it that it is to some extent designed to allow doctors who have retired and are not in active practice to participate in the election to the Medical Council and also doctors who are involved in the universities in some teaching function.</P>
      <P>We were given a lot of things this morning including the Minister's amendment but there is also a newspaper report suggesting that the Irish Medical Association are now unhappy with the composition of the Medical Council.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> of today's date states:</P>
      <P> The IMA is now seeking direct representation on the Medical Council in view of the fact that its responsibilities had been &ldquo;widened to embrace all aspects of competence, continuing education and medical ethics.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As we are back on Committee Stage could the Minister explain if the IMA made this point and if in relation to this amendment he has considered the idea that the IMA might have a member appointed or elected?  The point I am making could also be discussed on amendment No. 11.  The newspaper report goes on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> One clause which would give Mr. Haughey power to alter the Medical Council's composition, after the <Col N="1605" /> enactment of the Bill, is being opposed by the IMA as this could be done without prior consultation. </P>
    <P>I am a little taken aback at that suggestion because I did not see in the Bill that the Minister could alter the composition of the Medical Council except in so far as he might make regulations to various provisions of subsection (1) but only with the consent of the Medical Council.</P>

It would be as well if it were made clear that, as I understand it, the composition of the Medical Council after the passing of this Bill as amended by this amendment might only be varied by the Minister with the consent of the Medical Council.  I am merely giving the Minister an opportunity to make that point clear.  The amendment is a good one and one which we should have noted on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I accept the logic of this because all members of the medical profession who are in active practice will be required to pay a retention fee so they must have a say in it.  With regard to the point made by Deputy Boland, the Irish Medical Association have stated that they felt rather annoyed that they were not consulted.  They have to realise that we are the legislators not them and that we are the people who may amend any Bill going through the House.  We have a right to do this in the interests of the public.  We are legislating for the public so it is our duty to amend Bills.  I feel that this point should be made clear.</P>

      <P>As I indicated, all we are dealing with in this amendment is a tidying up of the process whereby <Col N="1606" /> the practising profession will be represented on the new council.  I want to make it absolutely clear what we are doing.  We are ensuring that whereas the representatives referred to in paragraph (f) will be elected to the council the people to be elected must be in practice in the country.  The electorate will be all the people who are on the register, whether they are in general practice or not.  That is the very specific purpose of amendment No. 10.</P>
      <P>In reply to the point made by Deputy Boland I, first of all, fully agree in principle with what Deputy O'Connell said, that we are the legislators and we must legislate and we cannot hand our duty to legislate over to others no matter how reputable or important those people may be.  The position here is quite straightforward. The Irish Medical Association were on the working party which did preparatory work for this Bill and at no stage did they suggest that they wished to claim representation on the Medical Council.  They are putting this point forward now.  I am not too sure how concerned they are about it, whether they just put it forward for consideration. I do not think they would make a very serious issue of it.  We are not really changing the basis of the council and to that extent the situation has not changed.</P>
      <P>The number in the council has been increased for very specific and good reasons but the balance has been maintained. Even though the increase has been made from 21 to 25 the balance and the mix on the council has been maintained at the increased level.  I do not think the IMA would make an issue of this matter.  It would be entirely inappropriate that the IMA as such should be represented on this council.  Their function and their responsibility are completely different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly a very large number of members would be on the council anyway but they will be on the council under a different guise, in a different role, wearing a different hat, and that is only as it should be.  They have also put forward a number of other points which we are meeting and, when Report Stage is over, I will write <Col N="1607" /> very fully to the IMA&mdash;I have not had time to do so in the interval&mdash; indicating my view as to why I do not think at this stage we could change and give them representation as such on the council.  I am also meeting them on a number of other points they put forward.</P>

      <P>I do not think I need dwell too long in explaining this amendment.  It is quite straightforward and self-explanatory. Deputy Boland and Deputy O'Connell like what I am doing here because we discussed this very fully on Committee Stage and what I am proposing now meets with their full agreement.  The effect of this amendment will be that the Minister will appoint four members of the board and at least three of these will have to be non-medical people and, in the Minister's opinion, they will have to represent the interests of the general public.</P>

However, it meets the <Col N="1608" /> point.  There is an interesting point in the Merrison Report.  On comparative terms there will be four ministerial appointees out of 25 members on this new council, three of whom will not be medical practitioners.  The Merrison Report recommended in the British equivalent that there should be 54 elected members, 34 nominated and ten lay members so that, from their point of view, the lay representation of ten as against 88 on that proposed British council would not be as high as the lay representation on the proposed Irish council brought about, as the Minister says, as a result of the amendments of Deputy O'Connell and myself.</P>

    <P>Again, this arises out of our Committee Stage discussion.  It is also in accordance with the suggestion made to me by the IMA.  The effect of the amendment is to drop the proposal that the chief examiners of the health boards would be the local returning officers.  As I pointed out on Committee Stage, since the electorate consists <Col N="1609" /> of only 3,000 people approximately, a national returning officer is considered adequate.  Section 9 (1) (f) is being amended to give all registered medical practitioners a vote in the election of members of the council so that local knowledge to determine who is engaged in the practice of medicine will not be necessary.</P>

      <P>It is now proposed that the education and training committee which the Council is obliged to establish under section 13 (2) (a) should include among its members representatives of UCC, UCD, UCG, Trinity College and the College of Surgeons appointed under the provisions of section 9 (1) (a)&mdash;that is, a representative of each medical school.  I am sure the House will agree this is an improvement. The council includes, as Deputies know, the five teaching medical schools.

      <P>It would be fair to say this is a suggestion that has come <Col N="1610" /> about because of the apprehension in the training schools that an education committee might be set up on which they might not necessarily be represented. There is probably still some degree of uncertainty as to the position between UCD and the RCSI in the event of any future closer co-ordination between these two bodies but if that comes about, I presume it can be dealt with.  It is, of course, desirable that teaching bodies should be represented on the education and training committee.  This was in my mind when I was framing my amendments. I found some little difficulty in finding a neat way of doing it and, in fact, I did not include it amongst my amendments and so I am very glad the Minister has decided to include it.  The Minister might tell us why he did not consider actually naming the education and training committee as the education and training committee and would he tell us if there is any special reason why it is not named specifically?</P>

      <P> In page 10, to delete lines 38 to 40. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will recall that on Committee Stage I said I thought it was somewhat unfair to suggest that, probably in the very unlikely event that an employee of the medical council becomes a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, he should not in whole or in part of his secondment period enjoy the benefit of any superannuation fund.  I understand&mdash;I did not take the opportunity of checking&mdash;that some professions, on their members being elected to either House, allow them to be seconded.  They continue to make their superannuation payments and in the event of their departing <Col N="1611" /> from here for whatever reason their superannuation payments have not been broken because of their spell here.  It is only right that this should be embodied in new legislation.  I think the House is inclined to be too severe from time to time on possible Members and I believe a member of the medical council serving as a Deputy or a Senator should still be allowed to pay into whatever superannuation fund exists and that is the reason why I tabled this amendment. I do not think this clause in relation to superannuation benefit is in some similar sections in recent legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the generous motives which impelled Deputy Boland to put down this amendment but I am sure he will agree on reflection that it is not necessary.  One job, one superannuation contribution and one benefit is a reasonable proposition and it would be establishing a very serious precedent if we were to break away from it.  It is not incorporated in any similar legislation.  On Committee Stage.  Deputy Boland referred to teachers.  They are in a peculiarly different situation.  On election to the Oireachtas, a teacher retains his appointment but employs a substitute. When a person is elected to the Oireachtas he comes under a new pension scheme&mdash;thanks to my enactment, Deputies have a pension scheme of their own.</P>

A person who was an employee of the Medical Council and became elected would benefit by the Oireachtas scheme for the period of his membership and he would not be paid by the Medical Council or be expected to make superannuation contributions.</P>

Deputy O'Connell went on to create some difficulties for his own recommendation by saying that if a doctor were practising in more than one place, as a great many doctors do, there would be a problem as to whether he should display a certificate in each of his places of practice.

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P> In page 12, line 46 to insert &ldquo;and registered&rdquo; before &ldquo;post&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>The amendment merely suggests that the documents could be sent by registered post as well as by prepaid post. We are dealing with very important documents, not with simple ones. These documents would be informing doctors that the Medical Council were initiating inquiries into allegations of malpractice against them.  There could be other documents informing doctors that matters were being referred to the High Court.  All these would have a bearing not only on the happiness of the practitioner but on his future and that of his family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested that the section should provide for the issuing of these documents by registered post, and at Committee Stage the Minister said there would be some difficulty in that regard because a person might refuse to accept delivery and could later claim he was unaware of the fact that a committee of inquiry was to sit in judgment on him.  The Minister said that parts of this Bill were similar to <Col N="1614" /> that of the Solicitors Act, 1960.  I looked at that Act to see how it dealt with solicitors who were having disciplinary proceedings taken against them and I found a section containing a provision very similar to that in my proposed amendment.  It provides that any document could be served in two ways, either by hand or being sent by registered post at the person's last known address.  They went on to provide that where a person was absent from the State or where the issuing body were not able to ascertain where he was residing and were not able to serve a notice on him, the Medical Council could apply to the High Court which would make an order.  It also provided that the High Court could direct that the notice could be deemed to have been served by public advertisement.</P>
    <P>In relation to the notice issuing to a doctor telling him that the Fitness to Practise Committee proposed to hold an inquiry into allegations against him and in relation to a notice that the Medical Council had confirmed a recommendation of the Fitness to Practise Committee that his name be erased or suspended from the register, opening up the appeals period to him, these are documents of such consequence that it is not good enough to suggest that they merely be sent by prepaid post.  I was afraid that a situation could develop at some future date where some smart legal person retained by a doctor could argue very cogently a case that his client was completely unaware that disciplinary procedure had been initiated against him.  I felt it was likely that such a case could be argued if the doctor could prove that he was out of the country at the time of the issuing of this document by prepaid post and was not aware of the start of this procedure and if he consequently gave no evidence to the Fitness to Practise Committee and had no opportunity of defending himself. If the documents were issued by registered post the doctor could not argue that he was out of the country because a registered letter will be returned to the sender if it has not been accepted and signed for by somebody at the address to which it was sent.  Obviously that address would be the last known <Col N="1615" /> address of the doctor in the register. For that reason I suggested that registered letters should issue.</P>
    <P>I went on to steal the similar section from the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1960 in relation to amendment No. 87 by suggesting that if the registered letter was returned to the council they should have the option of endeavouring to deliver that important notice by hand.  If they failed in that they might find themselves in a quandary.  I suggested in amendment No. 87 that the council could then go to the High Court and say that they had tried to serve notice on the doctor but that he was unavailable and they could ask the court to issue an order as to how they should endeavour to notify the doctor that proceedings had been initiated against him.  If the Medical Council should decide to erase his name they should notify him of the decision and inform him that he has two months in which to appeal to the High Court.</P>
    <P>I felt that this long list of amendments ought to be introduced so as to provide some safeguard for the council.  Alternatively amendment No. 87 could be accepted.  This would provide a section which would cover completely all aspects of the serving of notices of such an important nature to doctors, to the aggrieved parties and to the Medical Council.  If amendment No. 87 were accepted I would be very happy to withdraw the other amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Boland has said.  I also looked through previous Acts and there is mention in several Acts of registered prepaid post.  The registered post is not a foolproof method but it does ensure a safer passage for the communication.  There is a much greater chance of the communication reaching the person, and the Minister might consider accepting this.  Letters can get lost and this is such a serious matter that I hope the Minister will consider accepting the amendment. Deputy Boland's suggestion is reasonable and I hope the Minister will see the merit in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1616" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there is merit in it.  It is a question of deciding the most practical thing to do.  There is a fairly considerable difference between doctors and solicitors in this context.  Solicitors are officers of the court and as such they are much more part of the court procedure.  The court is really a disciplinary body where solicitors are concerned and there is that difference of status.  I admit it is not a very compelling reason for a different approach.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the Committee Stage we had a long and serious discussion with the Attorney General on this point and he is quite firm that this is the better way to do it and that prepaid post should be used.  He did advert to the practical difficulty that a person could avoid the proper procedures by refusing to accept the registered letter.  While Deputy O'Connell was speaking I could not help thinking that Deputies have a certain experience in this respect because if a constituent wants to really make sure that a Deputy receives his representation he will send it by registered letter to his home.  There is that precedent which we could follow.  Against that, the Attorney General very much favours the procedures laid down in the Bill and the council must accept that the address on the register is the address to which the communication should be sent.</P>
      <P>There is one further safeguard to which Deputy Boland and Deputy O'Connell have not adverted.  The court must be involved in this.  This is in answer to a specific point made by Deputy Boland.  When the case would come before the court it would be open to the practitioner to point out that he had not received the communication. This procedure cannot be finalised without the court being involved. At that stage it is almost certain that the court itself of its own initiative would inquire into this aspect, and if they did not it would be a matter for the practitioner's solicitor to point out that notice had not been received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With some regret I must maintain the position which is in the Bill and which is strongly advocated by the <Col N="1617" /> Attorney General, whose advice we must accept in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Whilst I might have been inclined to accept the suggestion to merely enter the amendments to provide for prepaid and registered post, I find it incomprehensible that we should be asked to accept that suggestion in relation to amendment No. 87.  It deals with the very difficulty which the Minister presented to us. A person might refuse to accept delivery of a registered letter and the amendment provides that the document can be served by hand.  It then provides that if neither of these methods is satisfactory the Medical Council may go to the High Court and ask for a ruling as to how the documents should be served.  This Bill was delayed for some time because of difficulties regarding constitutionality.</P>
      <P>Those aspects were introduced for constitutional reasons in order that the High Court could put their seal of approval on the decision of the Medical Council.  If the Minister's advisers found it necessary to go to such lengths to allow a professional body to have access to the High Court to have its decisions confirmed, there should be no doubt that the notices issued had been received and understood by the person concerned.  I am not impressed by the Minister's suggestion that if a decision was made by the Medical Council to remove a person's name from the register he has a two-month period in which he can appeal to the High Court and make the defence that he was unaware of the activities of the Fitness to Practise Committee or of the Medical Council because he had not received the notice by prepaid post. Surely the way to get around that is to accept amendment No. 87.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1960 when the Minister was steering the Solicitors Bill through the House he probably gave detailed reasons for the necessity of this section. If it is right for the Solicitors Act, why is it not right to include it in this Bill?  During last week's debate the Minister became involved in a discussion with either Deputy Dr. Browne or Deputy Dr. O'Connell on the merits <Col N="1618" /> of solicitors and doctors.  The Minister pointed out that a solicitor might do away with your money but that a doctor has a much more precious thing in his hand&mdash;the ability to save life.  If we are talking about taking away his rights to use that ability we should ensure that this Bill contains as many safeguards as the Solicitors Act.</P>
    <P>A doctor who is anticipating a disciplinary move could decide to leave the country and stay away until the period within which he could appeal had expired, by which time the High Court may have confirmed the decision of the Medical Council.  He could then return and ask the High Court to set aside their order and everything that had gone before it because he had not received the documents notifying him of his different status.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P> In page 13, to delete lines 45 to 48. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section is obnoxious because it discriminates against coloured doctors who come here to take up temporary <Col N="1619" /> duty while studying for post-graduate degrees.  I am not accusing the Minister of being a racist.  He is a reasonable person and is broadminded.  But unfortunately the Bill reads:</P>
    <P> For the purpose of this section, the Council may require any person seeking temporary registration to undergo such tests as may be necessary to determine that he has the necessary linguistic ability for the practice of medicine in the State. </P>
    <P>We all know that doctors from other EEC countries may practise here without restriction since the 1st January, 1977.  We know that doctors without a knowledge of English from other developed countries do not come here to study for post-graduate degrees.  Therefore, we can only conclude that doctors coming here to study for post-graduate degrees are from India, Pakistan and the African states.  Ireland is renowned for its post-graduate education.  We may not have contributed to the Third World in financial terms but we have made a significant contribution by training many of their doctors.  Because they know that we provide excellent post-graduate training a lot of doctors from India, Pakistan and African countries seek to come here to obtain post-graduate degrees.  It is a great tribute to our country that they do so.  However, in this section we are saying that those who want to undertake post-graduate work&mdash;post-graduate work leading to higher degrees involves taking up appointments in our hospitals&mdash;will not be given provisional registration.  The words &ldquo;provisional registration&rdquo; are important. These people are not seeking to settle here or set up in practice; they are merely coming for &ldquo;provisional registration&rdquo; while they obtain higher degrees.  But we are debarring them at the port of entry.  We are making it impossible for them to come here.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that we do not want people coming to work in our hospitals, even for the purpose of obtaining post-graduate degrees, who do not know English.  According to this section if they do not know <Col N="1620" /> English they will not be accepted.  In my view that is blatant discrimination. We are only applying it to such people but not to Germans, Italians, French or those from other member states.  They need not know a word of English and they can come here. They can have permanent registration here and can set up in practice.  Any German, without a knowledge of English, can set up in practice here tomorrow.  Nobody can say anything to him.  He has a full right to do so. But a doctor from the Third World, the undeveloped countries, who applies to do a post-graduate degree but whose knowledge of English is not perfect, as determined by a body set up by the Medical Council, is not allowed into the country.  If that is not blatant discrimination I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>Is it not obvious that the authorities interviewing foreign doctors will know by his qualifications and his ability to converse with them during the course of the interview whether he is a suitable person for appointment to a hospital? I can see no purpose in this section.  It is an iniquitous piece of legislation.  It is dangerous and holds us up to ridicule.  It damages the good name of this country.  It holds us up as a racist country, something I am trying to stop.  I appeal to the Minister to delete this section.  All reasonable people agree that it is not necessary.  We are asking that people without a knowledge of English be allowed take up provisional registration.  The fact that they are not allowed such provisional registration is what is so damning about this legislation.  In the interests of the good name of this country I plead with the Minister to accept my amendment and leave it to the discretion of the interviewing board in the hospital as to whether a doctor seeking provisional registration and a post in a hospital for the purpose of obtaining a post-graduate degree is a person who could, in the course of his duties in the hospital, understand and make himself understood by patients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to refuse that very impassioned plea by Deputy O'Connell.  The only thing I can say by way of reply is that I  <Col N="1621" /> believe he is overstating the case and magnifying into a point of principle something which is really only a very simple practical matter.  What is involved is the getting over of a practical difficulty: that a doctor seeking temporary registration here from wherever he may come&mdash;not necessarily the Third World only&mdash;would have to undergo some test of linguistic ability.  I would have thought that Deputy O'Connell would agree that that is important.  In the medical world it is important that a doctor be able to communicate with a patient and a patient communicate with a doctor. Perhaps it is equally important that a doctor should be able to communicate with his colleagues in his profession.</P>
      <P>This matter is still under discussion in the EEC context.  It is not necessarily a black and white or an open and shut case as far as the Third World is concerned.  A doctor coming here from an EEC country with no knowledge of English or Irish might in theory be entitled to the same status as an Irish doctor, but the point is that he would not get a job in the hospital world, with a health board or in an institution if he was not competent to carry out his duties.  The only thing he would be left with would be to establish himself in private practice. As far as this is concerned the only possible suggestion would be of discrimination as far as private practice is concerned, and I cannot imagine the type of person Deputy O'Connell is concerned about being worried about establishing himself temporarily in private practice.  I do not think it would arise.  As Deputy O'Connell feels so strongly about this I would like to scrub this provision, but I am strongly advised and urged not to do so because it is a practical necessity.  I hope the council will interpret this in the most liberal, humane and understanding way and that they will never attempt to use it to place difficulties in front of students or practitioners from the Third World or any part of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell has adverted to our tradition in this regard.  It is a good tradition, a high and noble one. Not alone have we sent priests, doctors, nurses and a great variety <Col N="1622" /> of people in the welfare world to the Third World but we have also received here sympathetically students from the Third World.  We have been doing that long before it became popular to do so.  A lot of countries and a lot of groups now are getting agitated and excited about the Third World and it is only right to point out that Ireland was involved in helping those countries for centuries in the practical way Deputy O'Connell has outlined.  I hope our traditions in that regard will be maintained and strengthened.  Indeed, I foresee in the near future a considerable growth in the number of students, in medicine and in the paramedical world, who will come here for training and education.  That is something we can do to our own advantage and also as a contribution to the development of the Third World.  Nothing would be further from my mind and I think that would also be true of the medical world in general.</P>
    <P>There is very great activity in the medical world now to establish contacts with the Third World, to try and promote two-way co-operation, co-operation at all levels.  The people in the medical institutions are very active in this field.  I would think we could leave it to their good judgment and discretion that this would not be used in any discriminatory way, or that the fears of Deputy O'Connell has expressed could be realised.  I want to assure Deputy O'Connell that if I thought this could be genuinely and realistically looked at as being discriminatory I would not hesitate to remove it.  It has been put in, suggested to me and put forward to deal with a very practical difficulty.  I suggest that it is a common-sense sort of provision and that the traditions of our medical world&mdash;the people in the different colleges and institutions&mdash;are such that there is no danger that it would be used in the way Deputy O'Connell was worried about.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell made a very eloquent plea for its removal and it is very difficult for me to resist that. When a Deputy of this House feels strongly about something of this nature it is not just enough for the Minister in charge of the legislation <Col N="1623" /> to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; in a dogmatic fashion. I do not want to do that.  I merely want to assure Deputy O'Connell that in my view it will not be used in a discriminatory way.  It is simply a common-sense, practical proposal, of general application and for the present I feel I must leave it there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Minister is genuine in his remarks.  But he has actually strengthened my argument by the points he has raised.  He said that a doctor from the EEC without a knowledge of English might in theory have equal status with an Irish doctor but he would not get a job in a hospital. That is what would happen the coloured doctor if we abolish this.  He would only have provisional registration: he would not have the rights of an EEC doctor.  He could come here. He might have equal status as long as he was here studying for a higher degree, but he would not get a job in a hospital.  The interviewing boards in the hospitals will decide whether or not he is competent to take up a post for as long as he is here only.  We are not treating him the same as an EEC member.  He has only provisional registration to study for a higher degree.</P>
      <P>The Minister has put my argument in saying that the hospital must decide. The Minister said a doctor from the EEC without a knowledge of English might in theory have equal status with an Irish doctor but he would not get a job in a hospital.  That is correct in regard to a coloured doctor but we are incorporating it in this Bill.  We are making it impossible for coloured doctors, doctors from the Third World, to come in here.  We are making it impossible for them.  We are laying down unreasonable and unnecessary regulations that they can come here to study, not to stay here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may not have alluded to the fact that the British Medical Council may be afraid, may be putting pressure on us to stop coloured doctors coming here for fear it will be a back door entry to Britain for them and, in consequence, we may be bypassing their test of linguistic ability. I have a sneaking suspicion that this <Col N="1624" /> is pressure being put on us by the British Council, in which case it would be a dangerous thing for us to fall in line with them.  The Minister said that he was strongly advised and urged not to do so.  I have always considered the Minister to be his own man and one who listened to reasoned arguments.</P>
    <P>I honestly believe I have put forward reasoned arguments why we should not become racist in this.  We will not get doctors from Sweden coming here for post-graduate degrees; they are far in advance of us.  Neither do we get doctors coming from North America to undertake our post-graduate degrees because they are also far in advance of us.  The same applies to any of the other developed countries. The provision was incorporated in the British Medical Council law to stop an influx of coloured doctors into Britain.  That is why it is done.  We do not have that problem.  We do not have a colour problem and I do not think we should resort to the same measures employed in Britain.  We occupy a leading place in the world in regard to medical post-graduate education. We offer them an opportunity to come here.  We should not forego this great opportunity; it is an indirect contribution to the Third World that we invite these people over here.  We have been doing it for over a century. The great names of Irish medicine are well known to them.  We have given the names of Irish doctors and professors to diseases, different conditions, and they are household words in the Third World.  I remember one man saying that where the name of Christ was never heard he heard the name of Dr. Tom Garry and collis fracture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I interrupt on a point of information?  I am afraid I misled the House to some extent.  It is always dangerous to think one knows everything in this context.  I was going on my recollection of the EEC Directive from my chairmanship of the EEC Legislation Committee.  I have looked it up and in the EEC Directive there is the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> Member States shall see to it that where appropriate the persons concerned <Col N="1625" /> acquire in their interest and in that of their patients the linguistic knowledge necessary to the exercise of their profession in the host country. </P>
    <P>That would go a long way to removing the discriminatory problem Deputy Dr. O'Connell has in that regard. It is easily applicable in the EEC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It proves the point that this qualification should be in relation to people coming from the other EEC member states to practise here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>But we do not say those coming here for permanent registration; it is provisional only.  If the word &ldquo;provisional&rdquo; was taken out of that, then I would be glad to accept it.  But the word &ldquo;provisional&rdquo; does not apply to any doctor of the EEC countries, because doctors coming from those countries get permanent registration under the free movement of doctors provided by the statutory regulations introduced on the 1st January, 1977.  They also say that they shall see to it that they acquire linguistic knowledge; but they do not stop them coming in.  Therefore doctors could have a broken knowledge of English and improve it while here. Frankly I have heard people from south Kerry speaking and I do not understand a word they say.  It is no reflection on them but I never understand a word they are saying.  What happens if I am on a committee deciding on the linguistic issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care what trouble I get into; I am always in trouble any way.  The Minister's argument would be very logical except that it is provisional registration.  Were he to agree to omit the words &ldquo;provisional registration&rdquo; we would not be discriminating against coloured doctors; we would be treating them all as one. But the EEC regulation says that doctors can come here; they just see to it that they acquire a linguistic knowledge.  Of course, they could be here for five years and acquire it in <Col N="1626" /> their interests.  Of course, a doctor can practise here, and he can acquire it, but it does not say he must undergo a test of linguistic ability.  That is a completely different thing.</P>
      <P>That is why it is so important that we do not allow this to go through.  I was never more serious about any legislation before the House in recent times. We would hold ourselves up to public odium and the odium of the rest of the world if this provision were allowed to go through.  I know the Minister is under a lot of pressure but this is where he can be his own man.  He can listen to advice but he knows it is not right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>That means the doctor is here for only a short length of time.  Before he can work in a hospital, before he can do the necessary study to obtain a post-graduate degree, he must obtain temporary registration.  He can never practise under the general medical services and there is no danger. What I am objecting to is that we are stopping him at the port of entry and that is open discrimination.</P>
      <P>My way is that we should leave it to the hospital authorities when he applies for a job to do post-graduate work. I suggest we should leave it to the interview board to decide if he has sufficient knowledge of English to continue to work in the hospital so that he may obtain a higher degree.  It is not possible to obtain a higher degree without gaining a certain amount of experience in a hospital.</P>
      <P>In hospitals in the Third World they do not have post-graduate degrees.  We are enabling doctors from those countries to come here for a short length of time to get those degrees so that they may return as surgeons, physicians, gynaecologists, psychiatrists and so on.  We are helping them in that way but they are also making their contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am saying we should not stop them at the port of entry and that is what we are doing when we say they must undertake a special test of linguistic <Col N="1627" /> ability.  I say they should be allowed to come in and apply for the jobs.  If the interview board consider that someone has not got enough English to study he should be told he can stay here until his knowledge of the language improves and then come back to the hospital.  That is the reasonable approach that should be adopted.</P>
    <P>By adopting the method suggested by the Minister we are not giving them a chance.  It is blatant discrimination and I should not like the Minister to yield to pressures from other sources that do not see the logic of what I am saying.  We will hold ourselves up to public odium if we adopt the course as suggested towards people who come to this country to do post-graduate degrees.  I earnestly appeal to the Minister, as I have never appealed before, to reconsider this matter and to accept my amendment.  It will be in the interest of the country, the medical schools and our post-graduate medical facilities which are trying to consolidate at the moment.  We need it badly. We have had a golden era in medicine but we are now on the decline.  This would give us an opportunity again. I am appealing to the Minister not to destroy it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1630" /> Section 33 was introduced on Committee Stage to permit the voluntary removal from the register of a registered medical practitioner who applies to have his name removed from the register.  The purpose of the section is to meet the situation where an Irish doctor wants to go to France, for instance, to practise medicine but who cannot get on the French register while he is still on the Irish register.</P>
    <P>Without this section there is only provision for erasure from the register as a disciplinary measure.  With the introduction of a retention fee it will also enable a doctor to have himself removed from the register for a period during which he does not wish to practise medicine and does not want to have to pay the retention fee for that period.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides for a situation where a doctor gets into trouble during the period he is off the register and the council can refuse to put his name back on the register.  The person concerned has the right of appeal to the High Court against the council's refusal to restore his name to the register in such a situation.</P>
    <P>During Committee Stage Deputy O'Connell mentioned that if a doctor realised he was in trouble and that his name might be erased from the register he could apply to have his name removed instead of facing disciplinary action.  The amendment is to deal with such a situation.  It provides that if any disciplinary action is contemplated or is being taken in regard to a doctor, these proceedings must be completed before the council can consider an application from the doctor to have his name removed.  It is a sensible precaution.</P>

    <P>This amendment, like amendment No. 17, arises from Deputy Boland's proposed amendment on Committee Stage that the council should notify a doctor of any change it makes in the register relating to the doctor in question.

      <P>Again, the House will recall the discussion we had about this matter on Committee Stage.  We are concerned here with the question of the production of a patient's records.  We all recognised that no matter what we did here there would be difficulties.  What I am proposing should go a long way towards meeting the situation.  My amendment reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> (8)  If the Fitness to Practise Committee require the medical records of a patient of any registered medical practitioner to be produced for the purposes of any inquiry conducted <Col N="1640" /> by that Committee, such records shall not be made available to the Committee, without the consent of the patient concerned, unless the Committee specifically direct the registered medical practitioner concerned to produce such records. </P>

      <P>I would like to suggest to the Minister, as I will not have an opportunity of doing it later on, that this is a correct area where a person's medical record should not be bandied about and gone into in the course of investigation into a doctor's fitness for practice or otherwise.  There is a further aspect in relation to medical records.  In the case of a doctor who has had his name removed from the register and had that decision confirmed by the court, should power not be given to the Medical Council to recover the medical records of that doctor's patients?  Those patients could then be asked what they wanted done with the records, if they wanted them sent to another doctor or destroyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a similar provision in the Solicitors Act which I accept is in relation to legal documents and documents which might be vital for people. A patient's medical record, if he is being treated for a number of years or if he is being treated for a serious illness by a doctor who has had his name removed from the register, might be very useful to the doctor the patient is then attending.  I thought it would be a good idea if the Medical Council were allowed, on application to the High Court, to recover the medical records of the patients of a doctor <Col N="1641" /> no longer in practice and dispose of the records as the patients directed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 52:</P>
      <P> In page 18, line 38, after &ldquo;person,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and not less than one month previously by notice of reminder in writing sent by prepaid and registered post to the person.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>I believe we were all in agreement on Committee Stage that it would be very harsh to suggest that the Medical Council might remove a doctor or go to the courts seeking authorisation to remove a doctor's name from the register because he had not paid a retention fee about which they had sent him a notice not less than two months previously.  The Minister suggested he would try to build in some sort of reminder procedure.  I am not very happy with the wording of my amendment but I am not very happy either with the wording of the Minister's amendment.  It certainly appears to leave the subsection rather cumbersome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment would have provided that not less than two months before the council decided to remove a doctor's name they should send him a notice in writing telling him they were requesting payment of his retention fee.  My amendment would then have gone on to say that not less than one month previously a notice of reminder in writing be sent to him by pre-paid and registered post.  At a month's notice the Medical Council might then proceed to send this reminder to that person.  It is a harsh provision to suggest that a doctor's name should come off the register because <Col N="1642" /> he has failed to pay the retention fee when there may be extenuating circumstances or it may merely mean that it is a sin of omission.</P>
    <P>Some of us are very forgetful about paying bills.  We ought to ensure that as near as possible to the date of removal from the register the doctor is reminded that he has not paid the retention fee and he stands in danger of having his name removed from the register.  That is why I put in the words &ldquo;not less than one month&rdquo;. The Minister's amendment just says: &ldquo;on more than one occasion&rdquo;.  That leaves the two months provision there. The doctor may be sent two or more notices and then a two-month period would elapse and his name would be removed from the register.  I was anxious to have a notice sent to the doctor at a time nearer to the date when his name would be removed from the register.</P>

      <P>I do not want to reopen the whole question of whether or not a doctor's name should be removed from the register for non-payment of retention fee as this was fully discussed on Committee Stage.  I undertook to try to ensure that a practitioner's name could not be removed from the register by the court for non-payment of the retention fee on the basis of receiving only one notification to that effect.  I am suggesting in my amendment that there must be at least two notifications sent, one presumably the demand and one the reminder before the council can go to the court.</P>
      <P>I believe that is reasonable.  We have, in this and so many other areas, to rely on the common sense and the reasonableness of the council in operation. The council, after all, will be medical men sitting in judgment on their profession and I think we can expect them to be reasonable, sensible and fair-minded.  I believe I have done what I promised.  I have met the House in response to the arguments put forward on Committee Stage.  I am now proposing in my amendment that at least one reminder must be given.</P>

      <P>The wording is no credit to whoever drafted the amendment. <Col N="1643" /> I am not particularly happy. As the Minister's amendment will stand the notice and the reminders will be issued more than two months before the council set out to take the doctor's name from the register.  I am suggesting that at a time nearer than the two months the doctor should be reminded that if he does not pay by a certain date the council will take steps to remove his name from the register. It could be argued that it is a good thing leaving it at two months but I believe it would be better to remind the doctor nearer to the time and make a final effort to try to get the payment from him.</P>

      <P>These amendments are all designed to try to meet a situation about which I have spoken on a number of occasions in the course of the debate.  While the medical council will have the power through its Fitness to Practise Committee to investigate allegations of misconduct against a doctor or themselves to investigate if they are not happy about the suitability of a doctor to practise, where the Fitness to Practise Committee recommend that either his name be erased from the register, that he be suspended from the register or conditions be attached to his entry on the register, the council may adopt these <Col N="1645" /> decisions, go to the High Court and ask the court to put the constitutional stamp of approval on the council's decision but, nonetheless, in law the person is still entitled to practise.  As I said earlier, I believe the general public will feel that that man is not entitled to practise if his name is being removed from the register but, in fact, he is entitled to practise to whatever limited degree.</P>
      <P>The Minister agreed he would be entitled to practise as a surgeon once he had the educational qualifications and to prescribe any drugs not enumerated under the Misuse of Drugs Act. While he certainly would not get employment in a public authority I do not see that there is any statutory disbarment to his operating in the private sector, in a private nursing home or even in general practice if people are silly enough or ill-informed enough to attend him.  He is a doctor with qualifications.  His name is not on the register but he is still legally entitled to practise.  The amendment envisages a situation where the council would go to the High Court and ask the court to confirm their decision that his name should be removed from the register and the High Court would confirm that and only when the High Court confirmed that the Medical Council had acted properly would this amendment then give to the High Court the power to make an order suspending the doctor from engaging in the practice of medicine.  Subsequent amendments provide that anyone standing in breach of the High Court order would be guilty of an offence. I am not sure if we are taking amendment No. 93 at the moment.</P>

      <P>Under that second amendment the council would be obliged to go to the High Court to have their decision ratified and the court would then be given the right where a doctor was suspended from practising to prevent him by court order from engaging in the practice of medicine and a subsequent amendment would make it an offence for him to disobey that order.  That would be the legal constitutional stand on the decision taken by the Fitness to Practise Committee confirmed by the Medical Council and by the High Court.  As far as I could make out wandering through the legal jungle of the Solicitors Act, 1960, with respect to the introducer of it, the High Court appears to have power to suspend a solicitor from practice.  The Minister may make the point that solicitors are officers of the court.  That point entertained my mind but nevertheless the Act deals with the same sort of situation we are trying to deal with here, a disciplinary committee of members of the profession reporting to the High Court that a solicitor was guilty of misconduct and certain things should happen to him.  The court seems to have power to suspend him and to direct that other people do not employ him in any legal capacity.  Now there is a very real principle involved in this. This amendment would give the High Court the right to put a legal disbarment on a doctor to prevent him from practising medicine for whatever <Col N="1647" /> period of time his name is suspended from the register.</P>

      <P>The Minister is very adept at trying to divert the House into different channels when the main stream is not to his liking.  We went through all this on Committee Stage. This is delaying the House.  There are two different sorts who need to be controlled&mdash;the bogus doctor who has no qualifications at all and who masquerades as a medical practitioner and the other is the person who holds a primary degree, or even better qualifications, whose colleagues on the Medical Council decide that his name should be removed from the register because he is not a fit person to practise medicine.  The council go to the High Court and the High Court confirms their decision.  As well as confirming <Col N="1648" /> that decision the High Court should have power to make an order forbidding him to engage in the practice of medicine.  It is here the whole element of protecting the public is built in and that is why I believe the amendment is so important.  If the Minister wants to make any sense out of the Long Title of the Bill then he needs some additional safeguards other than the mere removal of a name from the register because the Long Title reads:</P>
      <P> AN ACT TO PROVIDE FOR THE SETTING UP OF A COUNCIL TO BE KNOWN AS COMHAIRLE NA nDOCHTUIRI LEIGHIS OR THE MEDICAL COUNCIL WHICH SHALL PROVIDE FOR THE REGISTRATION AND CONTROL OF PERSONS ENGAGED IN THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE AND TO PROVIDE FOR OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE AND THE PERSONS ENGAGED IN SUCH PRACTICE AND TO PROVIDE FOR THE REPEAL OF THE MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS ACTS, 1927 TO 1961, AND TO PROVIDE FOR OTHER MATTERS CONNECTED WITH THE MATTERS AFORESAID. </P>
      <P>The Bill will not be capable of controlling people who engage in the practice of medicine even if the Medical Council, having investigated something, have come to the conclusion that one of their colleagues should not be on the register and that he should not practise medicine.  and have gone to the High Court which confirms it for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not ridiculous that the High Court will not be in a position to say to the man: &ldquo;The Medical Council feel you should not practise and we are making an order, regrettably, forbidding you to practise&rdquo;.  The same applies in regard to suspensions or the attachment of conditions.  There might be two situations in which the Medical Council would attach conditions. One would be where a doctor was either very young or inexperienced or very old and had not kept <Col N="1649" /> up to date.  The second situation would be where a doctor might be less cautious than others in the dispensing of drugs to addicts.  I recall reading of such a case in Britain.  The Medical Council might decide that they would leave him on the register but that he would not be allowed to dispense dangerous drugs or to have drug addicts as patients because he had been less than cautious.</P>
    <P>Take a doctor who is not cautious in the dispensing of dangerous drugs. The Medical Council would enter that condition in their register but that doctor, under the Misuse of Drugs Act, could still dispense drugs because that Act provides that drugs could be dispensed by a registered medical practitioner, which he still would be. The Medical Council would have said: &ldquo;Do not dispense drugs&rdquo;, or &ldquo;You may not have drug addicts as patients&rdquo;.  However, under the Misuse of Drugs Act that doctor may dispense drugs and the decision of the Medical Council, even if confirmed by the High Court, would not be legally enforceable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand that.  If a doctor is struck off he can no longer dispense drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Misuse of Drugs Act provides that dangerous drugs may be prescribed only by a registered medical practitioner.  In 1973 when the Bill was passed it was not envisaged that medical practitioners could be registered with conditions attaching to their registration.  If a doctor had conditions attached to his registration stating that he was not to prescribe drugs for addicts or that he was not to have addicts as patients, and the High Court confirmed that, the doctor could go on dispensing drugs.  Is it not ridiculous that though the High Court and the Medical Council had decided that a man should not be allowed to prescribe drugs, the law still would allow him to do so because the law would have allowed him to engage in the practice of medicine?  Is it not ridiculous that a man could be suspended for a period from practising but he may engage in <Col N="1650" /> public practice and there is no statutory disbarment?</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 93 would include two further offences.  Its acceptance would mean that a person struck off by his colleagues on the Medical Council and by the High Court would be stopped by law from practising. The amendment is designed in the interests of the general public, and when the Minister was on this side he regularly made points on the basis of the public interest.  These amendments are in the public interest and it will not be good enough for the Minister to say that the profession should be allowed to govern themselves.  If the Bill is allowed to be passed as it stands we will have a situation where the Medical Council's decisions will not be legally enforceable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unable to accept the amendments or the Deputy's contentions.  First of all, let me deal with the technical side of what he is proposing&mdash;I will not dwell on any one amendment but on the amalgam, the general effect of all of them put together.  It is a nebulous concept to say that the High Court cannot stop people from doing something, as Deputy Boland suggested, that the way to do it is to put something into the Bill providing that persons other than registered medical practitioners should not be entitled to do X, Y, Z.  If a person does it he is brought before the court and fined or put in jail.  The only other way the High Court can make people do something or stop them from doing something is by way of injunction, frequently of limited duration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be too far-reaching and vague to be put into a statute.  The Bill is to regulate people of certain competence and ability in <Col N="1651" /> the practice of medicine so that the public will know who they are.  Deputy Boland has brought up a complicated argument about drugs.  The simple fact is that by the combined effects of the Misuse of Drugs Act and this Bill only registered medical practitioners will be able to prescribe or to give certificates for drugs, and if a doctor is struck off the register he will not be able to prescribe not only dangerous drugs but any drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not imagine any sensible council in the sort of circumstances outlined by Deputy Boland putting an obscure set of conditions on the register in the case of the doctor concerned and not ensuring that they were followed up.  In the type of case Deputy Boland is talking about, I do not think any council would hesitate for a moment to strike off that doctor.  If they were foolish enough to allow him to stay on the register with some sort of conditions attached, they would have to see that those conditions were brought to the attention of everybody in the area, particularly chemists who would be expected to honour the conditions.  This is not a very realistic situation.</P>
      <P>I am trying to outline the approach of this Bill to the practice of medicine. It is as far as we can go.  A register will be maintained and kept up to date, certificates will be issued for display in consulting rooms and as far as possible we will ensure that the general public know what the registration of medical people is all about.  We hope by education and otherwise to ensure that members of the public in need of medical attention will go to registered medical practitioners.  They would be very foolish to do otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding medical appointments, a very important part of the medical world, nobody will get an appointment to practise medicine in an institution or hospital unless he is registered.  We are going as far as we can and as far are common sense, realism and practicality permit.  I reject Deputy Boland's <Col N="1652" /> attempt to go that much further and to bring the High Court in some sort of omnibus way into this situation and ask it to execute a role which it is not fitted to execute.  Basically, the High Court is there to administer the law as we pass it.  It is not there to arrogate to itself para-administrative functions in the way that Deputy Boland is seeking.</P>

In the best of all possible worlds it might be desirable to attempt what he is trying to do but even then we could not do it completely.  In the meantime we must stay with the sensible, rational approach of this Bill.  The Medical Council will register practitioners who have certain competence, certain degrees and formal training and try to ensure that only such persons will give medical attention in the normal way to members of the public.  We are ensuring that only those people on the register will get medical appointments.</P>

      <P>There are several issues that arise.  I do not accept the Minister's suggestion that the High Court is not competent in this area because in the Minister's own Bill he provides the right of the Medical Council to go to the High Court for confirmation of their decisions.  In that regard I hope that at some stage later on in the debate the Minister will explain something to me; it will arise on the next amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Medical Council may make a decision to erase a doctor's name from the register.  They do not appear to have the power to actually carry out that erasure unless they go to the High Court for confirmation.  It seems to me ridiculous that they may say that a man's name should be erased <Col N="1653" /> from the register if they are merely given the permitted power to go to the High Court and this is not obligatory upon them.  I wonder what would happen if for some reason the council did not go to the High Court.  The Minister said that the council always would go.  Ministerial undertakings are not good in law and perhaps the council should be obliged to go to the High Court or they should have the power to remove the name from the register without going to court if they think it is the right thing to do.</P>
    <P>Section 42 (3) (a) states:</P>
    <P> the High Court, on hearing of the application, may either&mdash;</P>
    <P> (i)  cancel the decision, or,</P>
    <P>(ii)  declare that it was proper for the Council to make a decision under this section in relation to such person and either (as the Court may consider proper) direct the Council to erase his name from the register concerned or direct that during a specified period (beginning not earlier than 7 days after the decision of the Court) registration of his name in that register shall not have effect,  </P>
    <P>Is the Minister seriously telling the House that the High Court has not got competence in this area?  My amendment merely provided that where the High Court declared that it was proper for the council to make a decision under this section, the High Court should make an order saying that the person should not engage in the practice of medicine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If my amendment were accepted the law would be there.  In section 46 specific powers are given to the High Court to make interlocutory orders.  That power is given under the <Col N="1654" /> section.  Do not let us try to fool anybody that this is a power the High Court could not have.  It would have the power if the amendment were accepted.  The Minister says the High Court is not competent.  If the High Court is not competent to say that a man should not by law practise medicine, then the High Court is not competent to say that the decision of the Medical Council was right and that they should remove him from the register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment merely suggests that when the Medical Council decide that a man is not fit to practise medicine and that his name should be removed from the register the High Court should confirm that and make an order to the effect that the man is not to practise medicine until such time as the Medical Council restore his name to the register.  If the Medical Council want to suspend a man for a period the High Court, on confirming that the decision was fair and reasonable, could make an order suspending him for the same period.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 93 specifies:</P>
      <P> In page 23, after line 49, to add the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  Engage in the practice of medicine during a period when an order of the High Court suspending him from so engaging is in force.</P>
      <P>(d)  Engage in the practice of medicine contrary to the conditions laid down during a period when an order of the High Court attaching such conditions to his so engaging is in force.&rdquo;.   </P>
      <P>I do not see how that is not an offence; I do not see how the High Court is not competent to make those orders if the amendments are accepted.  If the Minister is questioning the competence of the High Court he is questioning the provisions of his own Bill which purport to give to the High Court the power to confirm or cancel decisions of the Medical Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1655" /> In the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1960, the Minister saw fit to give to the courts power to prevent a solicitor who had been struck off from practising as a solicitor and power to prevent any other solicitor from employing that man in any other legal capacity.  Solicitors deal only with money and documents and doctors deal with lives.  The Minister saw fit in 1960 to give to the High Court the power to agree with the decision of the disciplinary committee that a man is guilty of gross professional misconduct and that he should not be allowed to practise law.  Why are we in a different position when we say that the High Court should be able to agree with the decision of the Medical Council that a man is guilty of gross professional misconduct and should not be allowed practise medicine?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the practice of medicine is a much broader and completely different concept.  The practice of law is a very restricted, narrow sort of operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Minister's point of view.  When the Minister was on this side of the House he often spoke of the necessity for protecting the interests of the public. The simple way to protect the interests of the public would be to give the High Court power to suspend a doctor from engaging in the practice of medicine.  The Medical Council can suspend a doctor from their register but they cannot stop him practising, even when the High Court has confirmed their suspension.</P>
      <P>It is a ridiculous situation in 1977, when the Minister is being reported in the newspapers every day on the importance of educating the public and that he envisages that every mother will become a doctor to her little flock.  These are pious platitudes.  If every mother is going to be a doctor to her little flock why is the Minister not ensuring that when she brings her little flock to a doctor with formal qualifications that that doctor is properly registered?  If he is not properly registered he should not be allowed to practise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1656" /> The Minister and Deputy O'Connell suggested that I would be giving medical advice to Deputy O'Connell if I told him he was not looking well.  The Minister suggested that I would be giving medical advice to Deputy O'Connell if I told him to take an Aspro.  I want to assure Deputy O'Connell that I would never advise him to take an Aspro because he is well able to take care of his own health.  If Deputy O'Connell was struck off the register he would still be entitled to carry out certain practices. If the Minister knew this and was stupid enough to ask Deputy O'Connell for medical advice, Deputy O'Connell would be entitled to cut off the Minister's leg.</P>

The Minister is not prepared to accept the amendments because their provisions are not included in the Merrison Report, and this Bill is a copy of the Merrison Report. Most doctors in Britain are involved in the national health service.  If a doctor's name is struck off the register of the British Medical Council, the Council's liaison body ensures that his name is erased from the national health panel.</P>

      <P>Many doctors would be happy to be struck off the general <Col N="1657" /> medical register because they would still be able to make a living.  The Merrison Report suggests that there is no necessity for such control in Britain because the national health service is comprehensive.  A doctor would lose his livelihood if his name was struck off the national health register in Britain.  The Medical Council will regret that the High Court has not the power to legally suspend a person who has been struck off the register.  I believe the Medical Association would be in favour of legally preventing a suspended doctor from practising.  The higher the standards the better the reputation of the profession.</P>
      <P>The Minister has closed his mind to the argument.  All I am achieving is putting my view on record.  Time will show that those involved in implementing the Act will be sorry that these provisions are not contained in it.</P>

      <P>These amendments were designed to change the situation in which the council are permitted to go to the High Court for confirmation of their decisions but are not obliged to do so.  I am not sure that they ought to be permitted to do so.</P>
      <P>It appears to be strange that the Medical Council can not erase the name of a doctor from the register without going to the court.  For some reason or other they are not obliged to go to the court.  It would be a silly situation if the Medical Council, having made their decision, decided not to go to the High Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not say I am exactly grateful to the Deputy but it is as well to clear up this point.  It is clear what exactly the situation is legally and constitutionally.  It is a composite <Col N="1658" /> process.  The council must, if it wants to see the erasure finally effective, go to the court to do so.  It cannot complete the process of erasure, whatever it may be, without going to the courts and having that done.  That is my clear cut confirmed legal advice on the matter.  When one is satisfied about that then the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is the word that is wanted.  It is always possible, as Deputy Boland recognises, that at the last minute something might arise which would persuade the council that this process should not be finally gone through and the person should not be removed from the register.  That is why we are putting in &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>It is to keep the Medical Council in the clear.  For example, if after making a decision they had second thoughts and did not go to the High Court that decision would be public knowledge.  Although he was not erased it would be public knowledge that they had gone to that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for bringing the court into the matter is a constitutional one.  It is well established by now, since the famous solicitor's case, that a vocational body cannot take a man's livelihood away without a court coming into it.  The court is brought into it for that constitutional reason.  It is only common sense that one leaves a last minute opportunity with the council&mdash;there may be some last minute evidence or some new factor may arise in the <Col N="1659" /> situation&mdash;not to proceed to erase the man's name off the register.  Unless they go to the courts his name stays on the register.  It is a composite process.  That is why I am leaving the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in.</P>
      <P>I should like to make another point by way of further explanation.  The basic disciplinary body is the council. It is the council that decides if a person is unfit to practise or should be removed off the register.  It is a professional medical decision.  The court only comes into the case to decide whether the council followed the procedures correctly, if it followed natural justice.  The court has no function in deciding about a person's medical capacity or anything of that nature. The basic medical professional decision belongs to the council.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1660" /> It was not clear to me on Committee Stage whether the High Court, in pursuance of subsection (1) of this section would have the power to make a permanent order.  I understood it would and I understood the Minister to indicate that it would, but when I read the section later I was inclined to think that subsection (1) was regulated by subsection (3) which only gives the High Court the power to make interim or interlocutory orders.  My reason for tabling this amendment was to establish clearly that the orders could only be of an interim nature.  The powers given in this section to the High Court are the same as the Minister described a short time ago as the High Court taking on to itself legislative authority. It is no such thing.  The High Court gets its authority from the Acts and if an amendment is accepted here that is where the court gets its authority from. It is ridiculous to suggest that the High Court has taken something on to itself on foot of section 46 or any other section that gives it the power to make an order.  I want it confirmed that these orders are not of a permanent nature.  We all agree that this section will only be used in most unusual circumstances. I am anticipating that the Fitness to Practise Committee's activities and the activities of the Medical Council would take place subsequently but in the interim, because of the serious and urgent nature of the case, the council could go directly to the court. I do not think it should be allowed to the court and seek a permanent order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

I wondered if such a case was so urgent, self-apparent or, if it was not felt possible to wait for the Fitness to Practise Committee to make their report, the Medical Council would go straight to the High Court.  In those unusual set of circumstances I wondered if the High Court should not just give the council power to suspend the man's name from the register but that the High Court might not also be given the power to suspend him from the practice of medicine until such time as the Fitness to Practise Committee and the Medical Council had carried out their investigations and made their full recommendation.

      <P>No, the second line of this amendment makes reference to paragraphs (a) to (f).  Amendment No. 85 would have introduced a paragraph (f).  This amendment would now refer to paragraphs (a) to (e).  The suggestion is that in any case where the court has confirmed the council's proposal to erase, restore, suspend, or attach conditions to an entry in the register the section obliges the council to notify the Minister.  My amendment would put an onus on the council also to publish in the national press, again in the interests of the public, the fact that a doctor's name had been removed from the register, equally importantly the fact that a doctor's name had been restored to the register and also to cause notice to be published in such other manner as it may decide.  The reason for that was that I felt it might be necessary in relation to our agreements within the European Community for the Medical Council to publish notices of the removal from or restoration of a doctor to the register in some of the EEC countries as well.  The thought is not original.  It belongs to the Minister and the 1960 Solicitor's Act except that there the onus is on the registrar to publish a notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, and in such other manner as it may decide which allows the Incorporated Law Society to advertise <Col N="1664" /> the fact that a solicitor's name may have been removed or restored.  I believe this amendment is in the interests of the general public.  If it is thought important that the Minister should be notified of any change like this in the register then surely a step should be taken to ensure that the general public are notified also.</P>

      <P>My approach here is slightly different from that of Deputy Boland.  I regard the council as having done its duty when it amends or alters its register, then notifies the Minister and the onus is on the Minister to take whatever consequential action is necessary&mdash;to notify health boards, perhaps even publish advertisements in the paper or do whatever he deems appropriate.  But the notification to the Minister will place on him, as the person responsible for the administration of the health services, the responsibility of taking any consequential action.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(b)  Whenever a casual vacancy occurs among the members of the Council appointed by election, the Council, after consultation with the Minister, shall co-opt a person who would, pursuant to the provisions of this Act, be eligible for election to fill such vacancy and any person so coopted shall serve as a member of the Council for such period as is unexpired of the term of office of the person whom he replaces.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is to deal with a situation regarding casual vacancies. Rule 6 of the Second Schedule provides for the filling of casual vacancies among the members of the council other than those appointed by election. <Col N="1669" /> It had been intended to deal with casual vacancies among the elected members in the regulations dealing with the election as provided in section 11.  However, it is now considered more appropriate that the filling of casual vacancies among the elected members should be provided for here as in the Second Schedule.</P>

      <P>Again, this is in loyal and dutiful fulfilment of a promise which I gave on Committee Stage.  It is an important point.  Members were concerned about the quorum provisions on the council. It was pointed out that if the quorum was seven a person could be struck from the register by four people.  The quorum will still be seven in the normal course of events but the amendment provides that it shall be ten in the matter of erasure of a name from the register, the suspension of a registered medical practitioner or the attachment of conditions to the continued registration of a registered medical practitioner.  When these matters are on the agenda the quorum shall be ten.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment does not meet my wishes but I respect the Minister's desire to do everything possible to be fair.  A Fitness to Practise Committee will make a recommendation to the council about the erasure of a name from the register and the council will make a decision. There are many other functions of the <Col N="1670" /> council that are not related to a doctor's conduct; for instance, there are matters relating to medical education and training and so on.  I can understand a quorum of seven making a decision on such matters but the question of erasing a doctor's name from the register is a serious matter.</P>
      <P>On the previous occasion I pointed out that four people could decide a doctor's future.  In this amendment we are just increasing it to six people, that is, less than one-quarter of the total members of the council.  I know that the Minister has gone more than halfway to meet me.  Perhaps he could reconsider the matter in the Seanad. I should like something on the lines that the decision on such an important matter would be the decision of the majority of the members of the council In discussing such a serious matter I think the majority of members of the council should be present to ensure that not alone is justice done but that it is seen to be done.  Six people might be vindictive.  It can happen at meetings. I am sure Deputy Boland, as a member of councils and committees, has seen this happen.  Often decisions are taken that are not good decisions.</P>

In Britain the recommendation was that the Professional Conduct Committee should consist of a chairman and 18 members, to include 12 members reaching the GMC by direct election, four by a nominating body and two lay members.  They went on to say that the quorum for the Professional Conduct Committee dealing with disciplinary cases should be a chairman and nine members, that is, ten out of 18 members. The Minister is suggesting ten out of 25.  The British recommendations went into some detail to deal with the matter.  They said it was right in relation to decisions of the Professional Conduct Committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the passing of this Bill I am very grateful to the House for the manner in which it has received this very important legislation and the very detailed, assiduous, careful and reasonable attention the House has given to it.  I do not say that in any ritualistic, formalistic way.  I mean it quite sincerely. Deputy Boland, Deputy O'Connell and Deputy O'Hanlon made very <Col N="1676" /> significant and important contributions to the Bill and I hope that in return they will recognise that where they put forward suggestions or proposals which seemed reasonable, practical and acceptable, I did not hesitate to accept them.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann expresses its concern at the increasing frequency of offences of armed robbery and similar offences of violence, and deplores the failure of the Government to check this trend. </P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, in the few minutes during which I spoke, I complained about the Minister's contribution, while making allowance for the fact that he had not expected to make it at that time.  I complained about it particularly because, in view of the fact that he put in an amendment and that the House will be asked to vote confidence in the capacity of the Garda Síochána from now on to contain armed violence, I would have expected him to have told the House what he has done since assuming office on 5th July to reverse the trends of neglect, slackness and indifference which he affected to find in the behaviour of the National Coalition Government in this field.  He spoke for 30 minutes, with great passion, in parts, and I am as wise now as when he started in regard to what exactly he has done to improve the situation, the striking power of the Garda, to improve their recruitment rate and to give them resources which they previously lacked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I positively and straightly charge him, because he had his opportunity, that he has done absolutely nothing about any of these matters.  He has not improved the recruitment or numbers of the Garda let alone produced an improvement in numbers comparable with that which the previous Government produced in four-and-a-half years.  He has not done anything about improving their equipment or making sure that extra patrols are where they are needed.  All we get from him now is something he would have laughed his predecessor to scorn for offering <Col N="1678" /> the House, namely, a scolding lecture to banks, filling stations, supermarkets and the rest, about looking after their own property better.  I thoroughly agree with him that anyone who has property which is at risk and, above all, who has employees whose duty requires them to look after their property and who know that because their property is valuable they will be at risk, has a duty to do his best to make sure that his premises do not represent a sitting target for gunmen.  But I disagree with him in thinking that the Dáil should regard that as an adequate response to this motion.  If Senator Pat Cooney, then Minister for Justice, had offered that to the House, had met a motion like this by telling the House that it is the business of people with supermarkets, dancehalls and whatever else it is to look after their money in the first instance, he would have been laughed to scorn and would have been accused of having no notion about where his responsibilities lay and of not caring where they lay.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I have to make the same charge in respect of the Minister.  I have already spoken about my personal regard for him and I will not go back over that.  I have to say that I think it is the prospect that he has four-and-a-half years of his own in power during which he can mend any number of fences that leads him to give this contemptuous answer to the House on a serious motion.</P>
    <P>Nobody can accuse the National Coalition Government of not being concerned about violence.  There is some evidence, which I will give to the House before I sit down, to show that it was because of the National Coalition's uncompromising stand against savagery and brutality that a certain proportion of public sympathy wandered away from them.  I am sorry that in saying that I appear to be making a reflection on the people of Ireland of whom you are one and I also am one.  There is that streak in the Irish people which was not content with the uncompromising approach of the National Coalition Government in areas like this, spearheaded by the previous Minister for <Col N="1679" /> Justice.  He paid a political penalty for that.</P>

      <P>His party, to which I am proud to belong, and the Government, which I was proud to serve, paid a political penalty for it also.  I would pay it again and pay it ten times over. It is not good enough that a Government like that, now in opposition by the people's wishes, which we unquestionably accept and recognise, in relation to a motion emanating from this side of the House on a topic like this should be met by the Minister for Justice with a scolding lecture about how people with property should look after it better and without giving the House one single hint about what he had done materially to improve the striking power of the Garda Síochána or to make them better fit to combat this wave of violence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I charge the Minister with having produced no improvement in Garda numbers, no improvement in Garda organisation, no improvement in Garda equipment and a severe disimprovement in Garda morale on account of a couple of factors in regard to his own approach to his job, which I will mention in a little while.</P>
      <P>The Minister disclaimed last night having what he called a phobia about overtime.  All right.  He has not got a phobia about overtime; but exactly a year ago tonight the man who is now Minister, sitting on those benches, moved a motion in the House which deplored the very thing we are now deploring.  It was nothing like as bad then as it is now.  The whole burden of his speech then, the whole pivot on which it rested was what he alleged was a skinflint policy of the then Government in cutting back Garda overtime. I challenge the Minister to give the House this evening&mdash;I am sure anyone will give way to him if he wants to come in to speak twice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We will take it from the mouth of the Minister for the Gaeltacht, Deputy Killilea or anyone else of his party colleagues to whom he wishes to give the facts.  I challenge him in security, because I know he will not and cannot do it, to give the House tonight the figures for extra money which he has spent on Garda overtime since assuming office nearly five months ago.  I do not believe there <Col N="1681" /> is two pence worth of extra overtime, I do not believe there is two pence worth of extra equipment and I do not believe he has put two pence worth of serious thought, let alone consultancy, into trying to improve Garda organisation, equipment or morale.  If he had done this he would have told us about it when he had the chance last night.</P>
      <P>I do not believe those things are there.  I challenge him, his side and the Government to tell us about them tonight if they are.  I am quoting from the speech he made on the second night of the debate, on the 24th November, 1976, when the motion was resumed.  He quoted from the editorial of the <i>Garda Review</i>&mdash;I will go back to this topic also before I finish&mdash;he adopted this opinion by quoting the <i>Garda Review</i> that the Garda were being &ldquo;strangled financially&rdquo; by the last Government.  I want to know to what extent the rope round the Garda neck has been loosened by this Government. I had not the same suspicions about it last night as I have now.  The Government came into power on a raft of promises, including an immediate dealing with the law and order crisis.  &ldquo;What law?  what order?&rdquo; was one of their advertisements.  I must take my hat off to the advertising agency that produced it; it was a very effective one.  It pulled me up in my stride when I saw it.  He has had five months to contrive something of this sort and absolutely no sign came through last night that anything had been done in this regard.  He rested his entire case a year ago on what he thought, what he said or alleged was a limit on overtime.  What overtime has he authorised or permitted?  What extra overtime over and above what ordinary circumstances require, or what the Garda authorities would have recommended, has he authorised?  If this debate concludes without the House being told, we are being sold short by the loudest mouth that ever was in Fianna Fáil on this topic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave figures.  Other Deputies on his own side gave the same figures this time a year ago in regard to armed robberies.  They said with perfect truth that there was a time when an armed robbery in this country was <Col N="1682" /> a nine days' wonder, when it would be &ldquo;the armed robbery&rdquo; and it would be in the headlines for days on end.  He contrasted that with the situation which developed in the 1970s whereby they were so common that they were to be found if at all on page 11, 13 or 15 of a paper with company reports and items of that kind that are not normally reckoned as front page news. That was a perfectly fair and legitimate comment for him to make.</P>
    <P>The figures which the Minister thought were so appalling in November, 1976, have been left far behind in November, 1977.  They are out of sight; and not only that, but the figures for the summer of this year, the two-month period spanning the election and the assumption of office by the new Government, are out of sight too.  June was a very quiet month as far as robberies were concerned.  It was a very active month politically but so far as armed robberies were concerned it was very quiet.  I could only find in the newspapers an account of two armed robberies in June.</P>
    <P>Now I freely concede it is not representative and the average level for 1975 and 1976 was higher than that. In July it bounced back again.  There were 13 armed robberies.  They caught up with themselves.  In the two-month period&mdash;a very fair representative period, 61 days&mdash;there were 15 armed robberies.  Between 28th October and 19th November this year, a period of 22 days, there were 28 armed robberies, 20 of them in this city of Dublin.  That is an increase which no amount of juggling with figures, no amount of talking about seasonal trends, or adjustments up or down will account for.  The fact of the matter is, and I do not take any pleasure in saying it, that the situation, far from improving as a result of the advent of a new Government, has disimproved.  I do not want to be taken as saying that there is the slightest flaw or fault in the Minister for Justice's heart in regard to law and order.  I say that with no tongue in cheek.  He is as much committed to law and order and putting down crime as anyone in this House, but he is not making enough <Col N="1683" /> of understanding or seeing the reality of the situation he is now facing.</P>
    <P>The situation is incomparably worse now than it was when we handed over. He quoted here last night figures in regard to the overall growth in crime in the quarter for which the most recent figures are available compared with the comparable quarter in 1975. These figures seem bad.  The figures for the first quarter in 1977 showed that crime of all kinds had increased in that year during which the National Coalition was in office by 11.7 per cent compared with the first quarter of 1976.  But the overall crime figures issued by the Garda Síochána about a fortnight ago which gave the figures for July, August and September&mdash;a quarter during which on all but five days a new Government was in office &mdash;showed an increase in crime compared with the corresponding period in the previous year of 27 per cent.  This is an enormous increase.</P>
    <P>I am not saying it is the Government's fault.  Anyone who did say it was the Government's fault would forfeit, and deservedly so, the regard of this House.  Of course it is not the Government's fault, but it is their fault that they do not appreciate or understand the seriousness of the position. It is their fault that they have not put into effect any of the improvements and reforms they were so earnestly urging on the Minister's predecessor. It most certainly is their fault that they think they can shrug off the responsibility, firstly by delivering a lecture here about people who have control of large sums of money, and secondly, by putting down an amendment which neatly proposes to shift responsibility for this development from the Minister, which is where political responsibility ultimately belongs, on to the Garda Síochána.  That is a cowardly manoeuvre.</P>
    <P>Our motion proposes to fix on to the Minister responsibility for the trend in crimes of violence and deplores the failure of the Government to check this trend.  Of course, Deputy Collins, Minister for Justice, is not a policeman and no one expects him personally <Col N="1684" /> to take a hand in this and no one expects him to direct day-to-day Garda operations.  He is not trained to do it.  He is not able to do it.  He is not fit to do it any more than I am. But he must take political overall responsibility for what happens in this area.  What is his amendment?</P>
    <P>To delete all words after Dáil Éireann and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;notes with concern the increasing frequency of crimes of violence, particularly armed robberies, and expresses its confidence in the Garda Síochána to reverse this trend.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government have left the picture in this amendment.  They are not willing to carry any responsibility, political or otherwise, for this; that, together with the attempt to which attention was drawn, and very rightly so, by a newspaper last month, to do down a public servant in an area not 100 miles from what we are talking about by Press insinuations&mdash;those two things show a contemptible frame of mind.  I hope the Minister is not personally responsible for the drafting of this amendment.  I am certain none of his officials are.  But it shows in the party and the Government to which he belongs a contemptible frame of mind.</P>
    <P>I want to give the Minister three pieces of advice, three concrete suggestions in regard to dealing with this problem.  The first two I hope he will not think unduly controversial.  My first piece of advice bears on his relationship with the Garda Síochána. In his speech last night&mdash;mark you, it only echoed the speech he made that night exactly a year previously&mdash;he repeatedly and rhetorically declaimed a point of view that the previous Government had been responsible for letting violence increase.  He said this was not just his own opinion at all.  It was &ldquo;the opinion of the Garda Síochána.&rdquo; I am quoting him now from the Official Report.  He said</P>
    <P> it was the gardai who said they had not the resources and that they were being denied them by the Government.  It was the gardai who said that squad cars were stranded at the time because the men who <Col N="1685" /> drove them were not being paid.  It was the gardaí who said that the criminals were not being caught because there was not sufficient manpower. </P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that if Deputy Harte wanted to check what he was saying he would find the truth of the matter not alone in the Official Report but in an editorial in the Garda magazine.</P>
    <P>There is no such thing as the Garda magazine.  There is a review, and it is a very good and very readable review, and I try to digest it from cover to cover.  It is an organ of the Garda Representative Body, but it is not the &ldquo;official Garda review&rdquo; on anything; and it is a very dangerous and irresponsible and regrettable thing for this Minister&mdash;I am speaking now on non-party lines because it could be that I will never sit on that side of the House ever again&mdash;that could be; we cannot see into the future&mdash;and it could be that any prediction, any warning given here would be one purely for the benefit of the far side&mdash;but it is a dangerous and foolish thing for him to take up an editorial in essentially a trade union organ and brandish it around as though it were necessarily the truth.  It tends to encourage the expression of views like that, which he may very well one day find are by no means welcome in his Department. It tends to encourage the building and the driving of a wedge between the gardaí and the Government that pays them, and the Government for which they are supposed to work.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose the Minister did this with any ill intent but I want to warn him about the unwisdom of trying to score political points by using an expression of opinion of this kind, although he must take note of it, certainly ought to read it and by no means ignore it, but not give it official status by adopting such opinions as being in some way opinions which bind him, because he will one day find that that column will contain opinions with which he violently disagrees, and he will not be so keen to have them binding then.  That goes not only for him but for the next Minister for Justice from whichever party he comes, my party or the Minister's party.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1686" /> The second piece of advice I want to give him is not to interfere with Garda recruitment procedures, which have been there for a very long time and have worked very well.  I have here the written reply given to Deputy Gilhawley a couple of days ago. Deputy Gilhawley asked if it was true that some applicants for the garda who had been rejected by the interview board were being recalled for further interview.  The Minister gave a very frank reply.  I shall only quote a part of it because my time is running out.</P>
    <P> All candidates who qualified in the competitive entrance examination will be called for interview.  899 have been called for interview to date, of whom 596 have passed.</P>
    <P>90 candidates who were rejected by the interview board were recalled for interview.  73 of them presented themselves and 52 were successful.</P>
    <P>By 31st August, 1977, the number of candidates who had been rejected by the interview board as distinct from being rejected on medical grounds was much higher than at any previous competition and this was the cause of complaint not only from candidates but from Deputies of all Parties.  The Commissioner, accordingly, arranged to recall for further interview all candidates who had been rejected by the interview board up to that date including a number who had not at that stage been notified that they had been rejected. </P>
    <P>That is a damnable procedure.  I know the Minister will say there were men on this side urging him to do it.  I am sure there were.  Possibly I might have done it myself.  But what it means is that there are men now coming into the force that the interview board, the established machinery, did not think acceptable, not for reasons of moral obliquity&mdash;they could be for reasons which are in no way a reflection on the men concerned&mdash;perhaps an insufficient motivation to become policemen; it could be any of these reasons which are in no way discreditable&mdash; but for reasons which, whether discreditable or not, that board and those <Col N="1687" /> with authority there since the foundation of the State, or near it, did not think those men acceptable.  In response to political pressure which, I am sure, came from this side as well as from the Minister's, the decision of that board was upended and new interviews were held; and the net result will be that men are coming into that force who on the ordinary criterion would not have been thought acceptable. That is the wrong way to go, and the Minister will regret that too.</P>
    <P>The third thing is that he will have to stand up and be counted, although I know his heart is in the right place in this regard when it comes to the political dimension of what we are talking about.  I have here a small cutting from the <i>Irish Times</i> of 26th July which reports a Fianna Fáil councillor &mdash;I will not name him&mdash;as saying at a meeting of Roscommon County Council that the people of Ireland &ldquo;had shown that they did not agree with the persecution and prosecution of republicans.&rdquo;  He interpreted the election result as being something which was a reflection on the then Government's attitude towards dealing with terrorists.  Such a statement is just as deadly to those over there as it is to this side of the House.  Unless this Minister and the Government are willing to stand up and disclaim that point of view, even when uttered in an oblique way as in Roscommon, they have a long bitter road ahead of them. No amount of soft treading, no amount of withholding of statements when statements are called for, as was the case recently in regard to Ballina, will make any difference until the kind of weak minded people who are willing to make excuses for savagery and murder understand that all political sides reject them and will not tolerate them in their parties at any price; and so long as a councillor of that kind is a paid-up member of Fianna Fáil, that party is not safe, not to speak of the State.</P>

      <P>Listening to the statements made by the Opposition spokesman on Justice and by the last speaker, one shudders to think what might have <Col N="1688" /> been the future of this nation and its security.  I will recall a few words uttered by Deputy Harte last night when he said we would be blind if we did not know that there was suspicion that for many years there had been political involvement, particularly when Fianna Fáil were in office.  He said we would be blind if we did not know that most of the gardaí voted for Fianna Fáil in the last election and we would also be blind if we did not remark that so also did the Provisional IRA supporters.  There is no doubt that that statement, made in the Parliament of this nation by the Opposition spokesman on Justice, does nothing less than score a point for subversives by equating the Garda Síochána and the IRA, by making them equal in the ballot boxes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently Deputy Harte thinks that the increase in crime occurred only in the past six months. With some little knowledge as a former member of the Garda Síochána, I suggest that the escalation in the growth of crime coincided with the coming into office of the Coalition and it gradually increased during their term in Government.  I can assure Deputy Kelly that the Minister for Justice in his first few months in that responsible office has received greater acceptance from the public, the Garda and the legal profession than Deputy Kelly obtained during his brief period as Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be no doubt that during the period of the last Government minor crimes were completely ignored because there was no political kudos for the Government there.  They were concerned with what they described as major law and order issues, forgetting that major crime is in many instances a consequence of failure to prevent or to deter minor crimes.  Another factor was the complete termination of overtime for the Garda.  That meant that the primary function of the Garda was <Col N="1689" /> interfered with directly by the Government in so far as the preventive nature of their duties is concerned.  Some of the people engaged in major crimes today are doing so because there was no attempt to rehabilitate them in the past few years as any responsible Government would have done.  It was the present Minister who concerned himself almost immediately with providing a suitable place for young offenders.</P>
    <P>The growth of crime in the past few years has been a direct consequence of Government inaction, of their failure to do anything about unemployment. We had brilliant young people with idle minds being left to the mercy of the winds.  Nothing was done about bad housing conditions and our health services were allowed to grind to a halt until the present Minister for Health came to the rescue.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that the banks, hotels and other institutions could help to ease the situation by playing their part.  Indeed all citizens could play a great part in the prevention of crime by assisting the police force.  I do not see why the banks and the supermarkets should have any more claim on the time of the Garda than any other members of our society.  For that reason I commend the Minister for reiterating something that has not been said so well since a previous Fianna Fáil Government were in office.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the remarks and statements made, the credibility of the people who made them must be in question and consequently the motion of no confidence in the present Minister cannot be taken seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, let me say that my comments will be on the motion and what has led up to it. There is nothing personal as far as the Minister is concerned.  I have a very high regard for him, one of the reasons being that he is one of the Ministers of this Government who realises that he does not always need a scowl on his face.  People will respect him more because he behaves in a natural way. His pleasant manner will get him out of a lot of scrapes, though whether it will get him out of this one is another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1690" /> My main reason for speaking is that I was appalled when I saw the amendment put down by the Government. The suggestion is that the Government have no responsibility for law and order and that it is the Garda who are responsible.  The amendment specifically notes with concern the increasing frequency of armed robbery and expresses confidence in the Garda Síochána to reverse this trend.  I do not believe that it should be left to the Garda to deal with this matter. The Government must give a lead and I believe that the Government are not giving a lead.</P>
    <P>I do not think debates of this type should be dealt with by somebody coming along and speaking off the top of his head.  Possibly the Minister might have been caught.  I thought he would have been allowed to move the amendment and then speak afterwards. He referred to an increase of 50 per cent in crime in 1973/74, 100 per cent in 1974/75 and 50 per cent in 1976/77. The figures show that in 1972 when Fianna Fáil were in office the figure for armed robberies was 132.  Deputy Eileen Desmond mentioned this figure last night.  In 1973 the figure dropped to 123.  I am not saying that the figure dropped because of the change of Government.  In the following year the figure rose to 153 and the next year it reached 186.  There was no increase of 100 per cent or 50 per cent.  There was a substantial increase but the increase came about over a period of 12 months.  This year it appears that there will be an avalanche of this type of crime.  I hope that it will not be so but we are approaching the Christmas period.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister speaking on television the other night and I did not think he made a good point when he tried to shovel back a lot of the blame to his predecessor.  Apart from that I did not find very much wrong with what he was saying.  While he was talking, as if they were thumbing their noses at him, four armed robberies took place within a period of 15 or 20 minutes.  It was timed so well that the robberies took place while the Minister was appearing on television. Is not this an awful state of affairs? <Col N="1691" /> It is a terrible thing that this can happen.  It has happened all over the country as well as in the capital city.</P>
    <P>I admit that the figures increased while the Government of which I was a member were in office but we did everything possible to combat this. From some of the things said and particularly because of the section dealing with justice in the Fianna Fáil manifesto, I thought there would be a tremendous effort made to stop this sort of thing.  I believe this is as serious for this country, if not more so, than the troubles between people in the North.  If we have reached the stage where armed robbery is accepted as a normal thing which goes on the back page of the newspaper, then we are in serious trouble.  The amount stolen does not really matter; the fact is that an armed robbery can be carried out.</P>
    <P>I blame a lot of this on the fact that apparently the courts are not doing as much as they should.  Suspended sentences for people who bring a rifle or a revolver into a hall or a bank are ludicrous.  It is ridiculous that this should be allowed to continue and I do not care what the reasons are.  The one way in which the Minister can help is by bringing in legislation which will increase very substantially the penalties for armed robbery or attempted robbery.  I do not envy the Minister his job.  I do not envy any Minister for Justice.  I would say without hesitation, though he lost his seat in the election, that the previous Minister for Justice was perhaps the most courageous man in the country in a very critical time.  The present Minister is a courageous man and will need to be.  His life will be under threat as soon as he does something that certain people do not like.  Having taken up this office, the onus is on him to spearhead the necessary action to stop this racket and to ensure that those who are caught are punished in a way that others will recognise as something in which they do not want to be involved.</P>
    <P>For a short time last night I watched a television programme showing that in America young boys on probation <Col N="1692" /> are brought into prison.  They showed what the conditions are and some of the prisoners were very co-operative in that they were prepared to say what the effects were.  Something like this might help here.  We have now reached the stage where the youngsters who broke windows and wrecked telephone kiosks a few years ago now feel that they require a great deal of money to live the style of life to which they have become accustomed.  Apparently the easiest way to get that money is to rob a bank or a post office, a shop or a petrol station.</P>
    <P>Years ago when the position was not at all like it is now I stated in this House that I considered the onus was on the owners of property to make greater efforts to protect their property. I know that the banks, the post offices and supermarkets have given the impression that they are very humane people.  They tell their staff not to get hurt if they are held up.  The result is that those who commit crimes now appreciate that there is very little chance of opposition and once they get inside and are sure of getting away success is assured.  I am not suggesting that we should have heroes in the banks, but we know that tackling the robbers on the spot would have a greater effect than anything we could do.  The banks are at fault in not having alarms installed in safe places on their premises.  Even if it only sounded outside the bank, the robbers would hear it and would know that it could be heard outside.  At present all an armed robber has to do is to enter a bank and threaten to shoot the people responsible for the money.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the other members of his party who took part in last year's debate must realise that there is little point in pretending now that the problem can be solved immediately. Last week the Taoiseach was asked how many school leavers were unemployed and his reply was that he had not got the information.  He had the information last year and the year before. When Fianna Fáil were in Opposition they knew how to solve the problem of violent crimes.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to suggest that the Garda voted for Fianna Fáil.  The <Col N="1693" /> point is not who they voted for.  The point is that they are responsible for maintaining law and order.  A sneering reference was made tonight to the Coalition Government being a law and order Government.  Does that mean that Fianna Fáil are not in favour of law and order?  The amendment to the motion is a typical example of Government thinking.  We have been told that violent crimes have been the subject of an inquiry and that the Department of Justice have not yet completed their report.  Many of the answers to the problems should be contained in that report.  The Minister said that there were still some questions to be answered, but I believe it is an urgent matter.  The question of the number of gardaí who have been added to the force was dealt with in one way by the Minister and in another way by Deputy Harte.  The Minister will agree, even allowing for the number who retire from the force each year, there has been a large increase in the force since he was last a Government Minister.  Before he took office this year, preparations had already been made for a further substantial increase. It is not right to suggest that the numbers are not being increased because the necessary arrangements were not being made.</P>
    <P>The <i>Garda Review</i> has been referred to as the source of certain information which was given to the Minister when he was in Opposition.  There are some interesting articles in The <i>Garda Review</i> but nobody would try to claim that it was handed down to Moses from the Lord.  I have been a trade union official for 30 years and I will give my opinion when making a case.  My views may not be correct but it is for somebody else to correct them.  Similarly, those who are trying to make a case for the Garda will make the best case they can.  Therefore, it is foolish to use their argument in debating this issue. Since the National Coalition Government cannot claim credit for the decrease in the number of armed robberies when they took office, it would not be fair to blame the Government for the increase in armed robberies since they took office.  Of course, there are people who feel that violent <Col N="1694" /> criminals would not be harshly dealt with by the Government.  I believe the Minister is anxious to ensure that these criminals are apprehended.</P>
    <P>Another statistic is that 70 per cent of armed robberies are committed by common criminals.  The other 30 per cent are committed by common criminals who masquerade under paramilitary names.  They are all doing it for a cause.  Quite a number of armed robberies have been carried out with toy guns.  According to the newspapers, some children in Dublin have been arrested and accused of taking £500 from a bank.  A neighbour of mine told me he was pleased with the way in which the latest plane hijacking was dealt with and that we were nearing the time when it would not be safe to go out on a bicycle.  We are reaching the stage where it will not be safe for anybody to show that he has even the smallest amount of money.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to try to ensure that new methods of detection are introduced.  Deputy Mrs. Desmond referred to investigations being carried out in other countries which give the police advance warning of crimes.  The gentleman on the television with the Minister the other night was inclined to spin that story.  I accept that in his time he was a very competent man but I do not think the solution put forward by him is as easy as all that.  I agree there can be a chain of incidents which can be linked.  For example, if a group carry out a number of raids there will be recognisable characteristics and, in that way, the robbers can be traced.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the paramilitaries it appears that a lot of one-off raids are taking place.  Somebody gets enough to keep him or to have a good holiday.  It is possible that while the Garda are chasing around the city looking for the car used in the escape that he is heading off to lie in the sun in Spain or the Canary Islands. There should be a lot more vigilance to prevent that sort of thing happening.</P>
    <P>One discouraging thing is that although the Garda up to 12 months ago had a high detection rate and convictions the amount of money recovered after the robberies was very <Col N="1695" /> small.  This is a matter which should receive more attention.  Money stolen is either hidden until the person responsible is released from prison or given to some friend.  In either case it should be possible to watch those people to ensure that they do not benefit from the money.  The figures given for the recovery of money stolen in armed raids over the last couple of years is in the region of 9 per cent and if that is true certainly crime seems to be paying as far as the armed raid industry is concerned.</P>
    <P>I assume that the main reason for putting this motion forward is to bring to the notice of the Minister and the Government the Government's failure to keep a promise, to produce the necessary steps to have law and order which the National Coalition believed in, and which I hope this Government believe in, restored.  Law and order refers just as much to preventing a person being robbed as it does to a person being attacked by unlawful organisations.  The Minister should get out of his mind the idea that it is all right to say that the Government are not responsible, that the Garda are responsible and that they are doing their best.  That is no answer to the problem and unless a lead is given by the Minister as head of the Department responsible to the Government, the House and the country, to do something about it, not just a penny halfpenny effort, we will find that between now and Christmas many more people will be having a good Christmas at the expense of their neighbours because that is what it amounts to.  The Minister must do something very substantial quickly. Under no circumstances would I be prepared to support the amendment which suggests that this is not the responsibility of the Fianna Fáil Government who promised so much in this field but the responsibility of the Garda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Our motion, tabled by Deputy Harte, our spokesman on Justice, expresses concern at the increase in frequency of armed robberies <Col N="1696" /> and deplores the failure of the Government to check the trend.  The Minister's amendment agrees with the first part of our motion, notes with concern the increase in frequency of armed robberies but expresses confidence in the Garda to reverse the trend.  In other words, the Minister for Justice concedes that armed robbery is increasing but he passes the buck to the Garda.  He washes his hands in so far as checking the trend is concerned. It is the duty of any Government to uphold the law and to prevent crime and armed robbery.  In particular, it is the duty of this Government because when in Opposition they complained bitterly about the escalation of crime. They complained about the failure of the previous Minister to tackle the problem of armed robberies and crime.  Not alone did Fianna Fáil while in Opposition strongly protest against the failure of the National Coalition to tackle crime but they contested the election using that as a major plank on their platform.  They said they would restore law and order, prevent crime and deal with criminals. They have failed to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without being personal, I should like to state that it was cowardly in the extreme of the Minister to hide behind the Garda in his amendment.  It is the duty of the Minister to organise the Garda in such a way that they are equipped in numbers and time to tackle these crimes.  Despite all the talk about the failure of the National Coalition to be generous on the question of overtime the record shows that since the Government took Office no worthwhile contribution has been made to overtime by the Minister.  If there was an increase it was a paltry one. Any effort to regard that as a worthwhile contribution towards tackling crime must be regarded as an insult and not taken seriously.  A record will be established this year for armed crime here.  A record will be established for robbing banks, pay packets and post offices.  This is a serious business and it is not good enough for the Minister to say that all the raiders had to do in Listowel was to remove a pane of glass and make off with £20,000.  It is not sufficient for the <Col N="1697" /> Minister to say here that banks, business firms and presumably post offices should see to it that their premises are better protected, that they take even more precautions to ensure that their money is not stolen.  It is not as simple as that because it is not a private matter.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that our post offices are properly protected&mdash;and that is not a private matter&mdash;because there have been robberies of large sums of money when criminals simply got into the post office, waited for the vans to drive into the yards for the escort to disappear, then they took over the vans and got away with the money.  Is there proper or any security on trains?  We had a large robbery on a train going from Dublin to Sligo, and others.  That is something the Minister cannot pass on to private undertakings; it is a semi-State body owned by the public, run by the public purse and which should be protected.  The point I am making here is that this is not a private matter.  It is not good enough to say that the banks should protect their own or their customers' money because that type of crime generates further crime.  That type of crime provides criminals with the sinews of war and the arms and finance to perpetrate further crime. That is why it is so serious and something that cannot be treated simply as a private matter between the banks and the criminals.  I agree with those who say that when we have reached the stage when a man or woman can walk into a bank, armed, or pretending to be armed and simply walk away with £20,000 or £30,000 something must be done about it.  The bank officials are unarmed.  I agree it would be lunacy and suicide on their part to attack armed men but, as Deputy Tully said, there must be a way out; it must be made difficult and dangerous for criminals to get this type of money.  It must be made difficult for them to walk into a bank and get away with anything from a few hundred to several thousand pounds.  The position at present is that that can be done.</P>
    <P>There is a bigger onus on this than on the previous Government because the last Government conceded that <Col N="1698" /> money was difficult to come by.  That may not have been an excuse for not preventing, if such were possible, these armed robberies.  But this Government say there is no scarcity of money, that it can be got for this, that and the other thing.  I do not want to spell out all the schemes this Government have thought up on which to spend money before they assumed office and since.  I do not complain about them spending money in that way because they say it can be got without any further taxation.  Here is a field in which money could and should be spent in order to prevent this type of crime in order to prevent criminals generating still further crime.  That is the position at present.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister's speech last evening and I did not hear anything from him that was new.  I did not hear the Minister say that when he came into office he found that the equipment or machinery of the Garda Síochána to attack that sort of crime was inadequate or that he had taken the following steps, and then enumerate them.  I did not even hear the Minister say that he had serious steps under consideration to introduce innovations to attack the type of crime about which I have been speaking. The whole emphasis of his speech was an attack more or less on banks not having taken adequate precautions to prevent such robberies.  He mentioned the Listowel pane of glass on a number of occasions.  I believe that banks, business houses, carriers of large sums of money&mdash;whether they be State or semi-State bodies or post offices&mdash;all should take adequate precautions.</P>
    <P>It must be conceded that there is one type of precaution only that will deal with the armed robber, that is, armed force to see to it that he does not succeed.  What use is there in people in a bank, in broad daylight, unarmed, making an attempt to hold off armed robbers?  If the Minister disagrees with that view I should like to hear him or somebody on his behalf, now or in the future, spelling out how he proposes dealing with this type of crime because stopped it must be.  If it is not stopped it will generate further crime; <Col N="1699" /> it will lead certain people to believe it is easy to get rich quickly and encourage others to embark on crime.  That is the serious aspect of the problem we are now discussing.  It is no longer news to hear that a bank has been robbed, that a post office has been robbed or that a huge payroll has been taken on its way to the factory.  One almost expects to hear such news on the radio daily and it is a sorry state of affairs to have to admit.</P>
    <P>Something must be done about it. The Minister, when in Opposition, seemed to have all the answers; while in Opposition he seemed to have grounds for complaint right across the board.  Now that he is in power and has been Minister for Justice since July this year the end result will be that a record for armed robberies has been established this year.</P>
    <P>I have always had every confidence in the Garda.  I believe they will do everything humanly possible to check this trend provided they have sufficient numbers and sufficient time at their disposal.  Some people might think it a waste of time to have gardaí on protection duty on these types of buildings. It is an expensive business but one that must be undertaken to check and reverse the trend of armed robberies. Everything should be done to make the Garda Síochána a happy and contented force.  According to newspaper reports there seems to be further discontent in the force.  I wish to refer briefly to the threat of the superintendent's clerks to go on strike. That is stemming from the Conroy Report which introduced overtime, a matter I spoke about in another debate some days ago.  The clerks are doing a very difficult and skilled job. In addition to being policemen they must be lawyers or a least the equivalent of highly skilled law clerks.  These men prepare the book of evidence in most involved cases and they hand this over to the State Solicitor.  However, they are being paid considerably less than the man on the beat because the latter gets double pay for Sunday work and additional pay for Saturday work.  I understand they are being paid much less&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): These men are getting substantially less than other members of the force even though they are doing most important work.  I urge the Minister to see that the effective salaries are brought to the same level as those of other members of the force.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a difficult task. Any Minister for Justice has an onerous job, sometimes an unpleasant one. However, that does not absolve him or the Government from tackling this scourge that has afflicted the country during the years and which has reached a record in 1977.  It cannot be left to the banks or the firms.  If the only loss that was involved was a loss of £20,000 to a bank or £10,000 to a manufacturing firm or a similar amount to a post office that would be bad enough but we know it does not end there.  The money obtained in this way is put to work in the form of other crime.  There is a new generation of people who believe that crime pays and that it is an easy way of getting money.</P>
      <P>I deplore the spirit of the amendment. It is passing the buck.  It is hiding behind the uniform of the Garda Síochána, a uniform that has been held in the highest esteem and respect for the past 50 years.</P>

      <P>Before I begin my speech I wish to withdraw something I said last night.  In passing I referred to someone in Fianna Fáil having a bad memory.  It was said in the heat of the moment and was in bad taste on my part and I apologise to the Minister and to the other member of his party on whom it reflected.  It was not a premeditated idea of mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With other Opposition speakers I wish to express my total disappointment regarding the way the Minister met this case.  I should like to have heard what he had in mind about the rising crime rate and the low detection rate.  Deputy Doherty who followed the Minister was the only Fianna Fáil speaker.  The Deputy was a former member of the Garda Síochána but he <Col N="1701" /> had even less to say than the Minister. Even though he could have spoken for 30 minutes&mdash;every other Deputy except one availed in full of the time allotted to him&mdash;his contribution was less than nine minutes.  He tried to confuse what I said last night.</P>
    <P>I did not equate the Garda Síochána with subversives and far be it from me even to attempt to do that.  I clearly pointed out the political manoeuvring of Fianna Fáil while in Opposition, exploiting the very serious threat being made against the State at that time and particularly against the then Minister for Justice.  That was exploited by the present Minister when he was in opposition.  His only contribution was that the Minister for Justice and the Government withdrew overtime for the gardaí, that if it was restored the high crime rate would decrease even though the Minister was telling the House that this was not the case.  This theme ran through every contribution by the present Minister when in opposition, and I said that by doing that he won the support of every garda in the country and this was acknowledged by them. Many gardaí I have spoken to, even though they have been Fine Gael supporters, acknowledged they voted against the Government because of this issue.  I was making the point that the Minister and Fianna Fáil succeeded in obtaining the almost impossible, by getting the gardaí to vote for candidates in the Fianna Fáil Party and in the same ballot boxes people who supported the Provisional IRA also voted for them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doherty went to great pains to misinterpret what I said.  I do not want to be misinterpreted.  I am referring most deliberately to the manoeuvring of Fianna Fáil on this sensitive issue, the emotional issue of overtime, even though a former Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, before the change of Government in 1973, is on record here as stating that he was against overtime.  Deputy O'Malley repeated this on many occasions.  That is the point I was making.</P>
    <P>I was also making the point that a Government in office at this time deserves the support not only of their backbenchers but also of members of <Col N="1702" /> the Opposition on matters of security. My argument will rest on that case.  We pledge to the Minister that we will support him in every way possible but we will reserve the right to criticise. Despite his arguments last year in this House, as recorded in the Official Report, we now find the Minister cannot do the things about which he criticised the former Minister for Justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want anyone to misunderstand my statement which Deputy Doherty tried to misrepresent. Like many other Deputies I received a photocopy of a letter from a person in Donegal which was sent to a Member of the other House apologising that he could not subscribe to the Fianna Fáil Party fund because he was a member of the Provisional IRA or Provisional Sinn Fein but stating he would do so in the name of another brother.  Every Dáil Member in Donegal, including the Chair, Deputy Brennan must have received a copy of the letter.  If someone subscribes to the Fianna Fáil Party it is easy for me to conclude that he must have voted for that party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the debate last night the Minister referred to the editorial in The <i>Garda Review.</i>  Like other Deputies I receive it each month and discuss it with local Garda members and anybody else who wants to discuss it.  It is a very good magazine but the editorial, like the editorials in any other magazine or newspaper, is the opinion of one person.  When the pen is put down and the ink is dry that editorial is the opinion of one man <Col N="1703" /> The Minister parades that editorial and the <i>Garda Review</i> as being the authentic voice of every member of the Garda Síochána while he knows, and I know, that that is not true.  It is the point of view put forward by one man and it should be seen in that context.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister went to great pains to say the banks were letting down the country, that they did not tighten their belts, that they were making it easy for robbers to invade their premises and take money.  That is true in some cases.  It is very strange that those of us who are members of local authorities know that if a person owns a hotel, boarding house, bingo hall, a dance hall or any place where a crowd may gather, before he gets a licence to operate, that person must have a fire inspection carried out by the local fire officer and unless the premises are passed he will not get the licence.</P>
    <P>Why does the Minister pass the buck to the banks?  Can he not bring in legislation and say &ldquo;We will not give you permission to operate unless you pass our security examination&rdquo;?  With all this talk of crime and the high rate of crime in the South, the number of crimes committed in the North at present has fallen by 33? per cent.  I had a friend in Belfast examine the Chief Constable's report for 1976.  I was amazed at what they had achieved there.  What have they done?  They have given grants to firms and factories to provide security officers.  They have given grants to those businesses who want to develop by capital expansion and protect themselves from a security point of view.</P>
    <P>Is there any imagination in this House to think along those lines?  No, no imagination whatever.  We go rambling on and blame one another.  If the Minister brings in legislation and shows us that he is serious about coming to terms with subversive organisations, he will have our support.  It must be remembered that not all the people who have robbed banks are subversives.  There are some people who robbed banks, and are having a <Col N="1704" /> good time and who fly to the Canary Islands for a holiday with their wives and families.  We all know that these things are happening but the Minister is doing very little about them.</P>
    <P>From the Chief Constable's report the average rate of armed robberies in the North during 1976 was 69 per month and the average this year is 46 per month, a drop of 33? per cent.  Any firm which had been robbed or bombed and has not taken full advantage of the grant service is not properly covered and are told &ldquo;You have to insure yourselves against this&rdquo;.  Is it not about time that this sort of thing was dealt with in this House?  Those grants in the North are available to any company which employs more than ten people.  This shows imagination and is coming to terms with robberies and crimes, and the result is shown in the Chief Constable's report.  There is a grant available for every ten people employed up to 100 or any additional part of 100. The Minister should note that.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a lot of confusion about where we stand on this motion.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick said, I believe this Fianna Fáil amendment is one where they can hide from the remarks of the Opposition.  I would rather if the Minister had allowed the amendment stand.  I would have liked to have heard more Fianna Fáil Deputies contributing.</P>

      <P>Catholic churches in Dublin, in particular Mount Argus, decided that it was necessary for the church authorities to keep six full time security officers during the last Mass on Sundays in case radios are stolen from cars.  Outside the Milltown golf course nine stereos were stolen from cars last Saturday night week. The cars were opened, radios stolen and the cars were locked again.  This is the increased crime rate about which we are protesting and saying to the Minister &ldquo;For God's sake implement the survey which the former Government commissioned and give us a good police force and then a new deal.&rdquo; Why must the survey stay in the Department of Justice for six months when we know there is unrest in the Garda, that something will have to be done about it and that it will not go away if we close our eyes?  These things are necessary if the rate of crime is to be decreased and if increased protection is to be given to the general public so that all our families can go to bed at night knowing they will not be robbed before the morning and that our sons and daughters will not be molested, raped or attacked.  That is what this is all about.</P>

    <P> (1) The bulk of the tobacco revenue is derived from raw leaf imported for manufacture into cigarettes, pipe tobaccos or other products.  As the duties on the leaf are collected without reference to end-use it is not possible to furnish accurate statistics of the revenue derived from the separate products.  The figures in the second and third columns also take account of imported tobacco (excluding cigars) and cigarettes.</P>
    <P>(2) In addition, turnover tax was payable on retail sales in 1970 at the rate of 2½ per cent up to 30th April and 5 per cent thereafter; and, in 1977, V.A.T. at the rate of 10 per cent on retail sales is applicable.  Separate figures of receipts of these taxes are not available.</P>
    <P>(3) The only figures available in respect of cigars are for the years ended 31st March in 1950, 1960 and 1970 but these figures would not differ significantly from those of the calendar year.</P>
