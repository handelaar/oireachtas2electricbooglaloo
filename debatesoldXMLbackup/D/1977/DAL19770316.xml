      <P>Last night I appealed to the Minister to accept this amendment. I cannot see any logical reason from his arguments why it should not be accepted.  The controversy that has raged throughout the discussion on the Minister's proposal to ask the House to pass a Bill which refers to an agreement the details of which he is not prepared to divulge is not at issue in this amendment.  The amendment seeks to have written into the legislation the fact that the agreement had not been made available to the Oireachtas during the debate on the Bill.  It is essential that the words in the amendment be included in the Bill to make clear the situation under which the debate took place.  The Minister referred to commercial dealings between the State and commercial enterprises and said it was his intention that the State be involved commercially with other enterprises in the future.  He told us that because of that agreements entered into with business interests must be kept secret.  For that reason he did not <Col N="1464" /> intend making the terms of the agreement referred to in this Bill available during the course of the debate.  He also expressed his intention of never making such agreements available to the Opposition when future Bills of this type are debated.</P>
      <P>The Minister has performed a major cover-up during the course of the debate regarding the details of the agreement but it is worse that he is persisting in refusing to accept an amendment like this.  He is trying to cover up a situation he created during the course of the debate.  He does not want to make the terms of the agreement available to the House nor does he want that fact written into the legislation.  This is the second coverup we have had and I cannot see any logical reason for this one.  If one reflects on the debate that has taken place on this Bill so far one must be struck by the fact that were it not for the investigations carried out by Deputy O'Malley and his diligence in seeking information this would have been the greatest farce of a debate ever to have taken place here.  If no facts had emerged during the course of the debate in relation to what was contained in the agreement, we would have had the most unreal situation imaginable. The House and the country must be grateful to Deputies O'Malley and Colley for pursuing the Minister during the course of the debate, not that he let very much slip&mdash;he did on one or two occasions.  The research carried out by Deputies on this side has helped put some information in relation to the agreement on the record even though the Minister tried to have it excluded.</P>
      <P>Since I became a Member, I have never seen a Minister attempt what the Minister for Industry and Commerce has done in this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am appealing to the Minister to accept this amendment which will not change the terms of the Bill.  The amendment seeks to have stated in the Bill something which <Col N="1465" /> the Minister has admitted is true, that the agreement was not made available to the Oireachtas.  The debate would have been a farce were it not for the diligence of members of the Opposition in their research.  There still remains an area of doubt regarding the major provisions in the agreement.  The Minister has asked the House to sanction the spending of £10 million which will be handed over to certain individuals. Some of the individuals who have been listed during the course of the discussion and whose names are now to be written into the Bill in accordance with amendments that were accepted last night are persons for whom I have the highest admiration, people who, through their business acumen and hard work, have helped to build up this country from a very weak industrial base over a period of 30 to 40 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little admiration for what the Minister has attempted in this regard in this House. From a very early age all of us are warned by our parents before we move out into the big world to look before we leap, not to buy a pig in a poke. Here we have a classical example of the parliament of a nation being asked to support the purchase of a pig in a very big poke.  Nobody can see what is in the bag.  I do not know whether my appeal is getting through <Col N="1466" /> to the Minister or whether he will accept this very simple amendment.  I cannot see what difficulty it will create for him.  His reputation has suffered somewhat during the course of the debate up to now and this might be an opportunity to restore even a very small part of his credibility, at least if he is honest enough to have written into the Bill what the exact position was.</P>
      <P>This is a very sad occasion for democracy and for our Parliament. Consultation was to be a theme of the Coalition Government.  The Minister remembers that as one of the 14 points they put before the nation.  I am afraid that as in the case of many of the other points, there is a great lack of consultation.  Maybe it is time the Minister and his friends moved over; maybe they are getting stale.</P>

      <P>I should like to get back to the amendment, but one cannot help letting one's mind drift along those avenues, because power does corrupt.  Is this the first sign of corruption?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak on this Bill but the reason I do so is the importance of this amendment.  It has been stated clearly that the facts of this agreement were not put before the House.  What is worrying me and should worry Deputies on both sides of the House is the total irrelevance of this Parliament.  We are debating something here we have not seen, maybe for good reasons but the reasons put forward have not been sufficient, to my mind.  As Deputy Colley said yesterday, whatever is in the agreement, whether it is good or bad, we cannot accept responsibility for it because we do not know its content.</P>
      <P>The Deputies in this Parliament are supposed to be the watchdogs for the people of Ireland.  The watching we do cannot be effective when we have no teeth.  I did not think such a Bill could be put through this House, but I have become highly educated in this respect during my few years here.  It is extraordinary, as I gathered from the discussion on the Bill, that various people know what is in the agreement but this House, which is supposed to be the Parliament of the people, does not know what is in it.  Are we not supposed to be sufficiently intelligent or sufficiently trustworthy to be told what is in this agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another amendment was passed yesterday in regard to which it was difficult to understand the difference between secret and confidential.  If I give something to a person confidentially I mean him to keep it secret. The Attorney General stated that there were certain clauses in the agreement that should be kept confidential, but there is no getting away from the fact that confidential is secret.  The purpose of the amendment before the House is to write into the Bill a provision <Col N="1468" /> to the effect that the Deputies who discussed the Bill had not the facts before them, and I think, in fairness, the Minister will have to accept that. If the Deputies on that side of the House happened to be over here, they would be looking for the very same information and would be lacking in their duty if they did not do so.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to discuss the merits or demerits of the agreement. However, I have been present for a great deal of this debate since it started, and I have to admire the amount of research that was done by Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Colley. They have done a great service to the State.  It is unfortunate that the Minister cannot see his way, in the interests of his own party, to give the information sought.  When he cannot give it it is only right to provide that the Bill passed this House without all the information that was sought being placed before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am allowing the Minister to interject only.  I cannot allow a second speech.  That privilege applies only to the mover of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and I want to thank you for your agreement and, indeed, I thank the Opposition. I trust it will be clear why I have asked to be permitted to intervene now.  Yesterday evening Deputy Colley read into the record of the House a copy of a telex message which he said had been sent to Deputy O'Malley and which Deputy Colley said &ldquo;draws attention to the reality of the situation&rdquo;.  Deputy Colley understood this message&mdash;I presume, the original of it&mdash;had been sent to one of the people mentioned in amendment No. 3 which was then under discussion. Having read out the message he said: &ldquo;The signature and address are given on it which I do not propose to give here unless it is necessary.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel Deputy Colley should give this additional information.  The reasons for my request are fairly obvious.  In the message which Deputy Colley read out the Northern Bank Finance Corporation is mentioned, I think, four times. There are also references to alleged rights of this bank and to clauses <Col N="1469" /> relating to the bank's loan arrangements. In the absence of definite information it is, I think, a fair assumption that this was a communication from the Northern Bank Finance Corporation or one of its associates to one of the Bula people.  I am not an expert on these matters and I have had not sufficient time in which to secure advice. The language of the message is rather odd and the message as a whole could have very significant implications for Bula from a business point of view.  On the assumption that this communication was from the Northern Bank Finance Corporation or one of its associated companies one would expect that it would have been regarded as highly confidential.  As a coincidence I note in one of the advertisements placed in yesterday's newspaper that the Northern Bank properly place a high regard on confidentiality.  Their advertisement states: &ldquo;Your account is private.  Everyone in the bank is pledged to secrecy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If, therefore, the message which has been read onto the record of the House is a confidential document between banker and customer, this is a most serious matter.  However serious it might be in such circumstances, it would pale into insignificance as compared with the situation which would arise if this communication were not from the Northern Bank Finance Corporation or one of its associates. If the communication did not come from the Northern Bank Finance Corporation or one of its associates then there can be no authoritative basis for any of the statements made in it and the message has the most serious implications both from the point of view of the private company concerned and, of course, from the point of view of the State's proposed shareholding.  For these reasons it is absolutely essential that the authorship and the authenticity of this message should be put beyond any doubt and that the position should be recorded in the records of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley to reply to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir.  I simply want to reply to what the Minister has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is <Col N="1470" /> in slight difficulty here.  I allowed the Minister to intervene or interject and I made it clear that second speeches would not be allowed and that it is the privilege of the mover&mdash;in this instance, yourself&mdash;to reply.  I cannot allow a debate in reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister requested the permission of the Chair to say something, even though under Standing Orders he did not have the right to speak again.  The Chair sought the agreement of this side of the House to allow the Minister to speak.  He has now said something which obviously calls for a reply and Deputy Colley is being denied the same courtesy that was extended to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Most certainly not.  Deputy Colley as the mover of this amendment has the right to reply to the debate and Deputy Colley will have full and ample opportunity to reply to all that has been said in respect of the debate on this amendment, including the remarks of the Minister just now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, I am not in a position to comment on what the Minister has said in this regard.  I am simply contributing to this debate in order to support amendment No. 4, which I take it we are now dealing with.  I fully accept that there is not a great deal I can say in support of this other than what has already been said in support of amendment No. 2. When I was Minister for Industry and Commerce I found myself subject to demands from this side of the House to publish the contents of a report on an investigation of the woollen and worsted industry.  My defence at that stage was that it was not in the interests of the woollen and worsted industry to publish the contents of the confidential report that had been requisitioned by the Department.  It was a report which made recommendations regarding closures, amalgamations and mergers and I was at the receiving end of a great deal of pressure from the Opposition.  There was a great deal of adverse publicity about trying to cover up the recommendations made in that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot recollect whether I was the <Col N="1471" /> subject of attack from the then Deputy Keating but I am sure I was attacked by the then Deputy O'Leary because he was spokesman for Industry and Commerce.  I do know that Deputy Donegan, now Minister for Fisheries, was the Fine Gael spokesman for Industry and Commerce and he gave me quite a deal of abuse.  My defence was that it was not in the interests of the woollen and worsted industry to publicise the recommendations.  I stood over that and I have never been associated with the demand on the present Minister to publicise the contents of that report, even though it is probably outdated now.  There was no Bill, of course, because in those days of &ldquo;non-open&rdquo; Fianna Fáil Government we never got around to introducing any Bill in which we did not put our cards on the table.</P>
    <P>I have no reason to doubt the word of the Minister when he says that this agreement should not be published in the interests of the firm in which he as Minister for Industry and Commerce is preparing to take a 49 per cent stake.  If it is not in the interests of the Minister and of the State to publish this agreement, I cannot see why he will not accept the statement of that fact that is built into our amendment.  Through Second Stage and Committee Stage we have fought with the Minister asking him to lay on the record of this House a copy of that agreement.  He has consistently told us that it is not in the best interests to make this document public.</P>
    <P>The first amendment has been defeated.  The Minister may feel that the building in of a statement in regard to a secret agreement might look defensive and that it is not the type of thing he would like to see in legislation.  I cannot see anything wrong about a definition section which concerns an agreement which has not been made available to the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas embraces the Dáil, the Seanad and the President.  We became very aware of this some time ago when the former President was insulted and when there was one arm of the Oireachtas falling out with another.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1472" /> The difficulty encountered here is that one could find the Minister asking to intervene again in this debate, as he did at some stage yesterday, when I was in full flight in relation to amendment No. 3 and when I found that the Minister was accepting it. I do not know whether or not he has positively put on the record whether he is or is not accepting this one.  He did contribute twice but at no stage did I hear him say he was against it. We know he is in favour of the secret agreement.  I cannot understand why the Minister will not allow it to be entered; it occurs throughout the Dáil debates over a period.  Of course, the Minister cannot now reply.</P>
    <P>This is a situation in which a copy of the agreement has not been made available to the Oireachtas.  When this Bill goes to the President for signature, I hope the Minister will condescend to let the President have a copy of the agreement.  If there is any man in this country entitled to a copy of that agreement, it must be the President.  Perhaps that is why the Minister did not positively refuse by word of mouth, apart from nodding his head, to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe I did refuse; I believe the record will show that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I missed that. The Minister may remind me that it is on the record of the House.  Perhaps the Minister is not following all of what we say with rapt attention and I might be guilty of the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know what right the third arm of the Oireachtas has in this regard because it is part and parcel of what is built into our amendment. We know now that the Minister is refusing to accept this amendment. That means that he does not want to have it recorded in the Bill that the agreement has not been made available to the Oireachtas.  We can vouch for the fact that the agreement has not been made available to the Members who make up the minority in Dáil Éireann.  Listening earlier to Deputy Barry Desmond there were occasions when I felt that, for some reason or other, he may have had access to a <Col N="1473" /> copy of that agreement because he spoke authoritatively on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>One must assume that all Bills before introduction to this House by a Minister have been cleared by the Government.  Therefore, I assume that the Members of the Government must have been aware of the content of this Bill before its introduction.  What we do not know is whether Members of the Government were also allowed to see a copy of the agreement or what was the arrangement within the Cabinet in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that he is unwilling to accept this amendment.  If he accepted this amendment which includes the words &ldquo;the agreement which has not been made available to the Oireachtas&rdquo;, could it transpire that it has been made available to so many Members within the Oireachtas that the amendment itself might be out of order because that would be stating a non-factual position?  Certainly I am worried that, when this Bill goes to the President for signature, he will be afforded an opportunity of seeing the agreement.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy yesterday spoke about the day he received this Bill in the first instance&mdash;and he was probably expressing the view of a number of Deputies.  When he looked through it, first of all, for the explanatory memorandum it was not there.  But, perhaps, one could maintain that the Bill is self-explanatory apart from the non-circulation of this agreement.  Then he continued to search the envelope thinking it would contain a copy of the agreement but it did not.  That was a legitimate search in which any Deputy of this House might engage.  While I appreciate the basic reason for the Minister opposing amendment No. 2 and also having a basic objection to having the word &ldquo;secret&rdquo; built in because of its ominous sound, I cannot see what justifiable reason he has in refusing to accept an amendment which is simply and solely a basic statement of fact.  I merely wonder if statements of fact or truth have now become bad news to the Government so that they cannot even accept them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to refer briefly to the Minister's intervention this morning.  When I quoted this telex message I did not indicate the person to whom it was addressed.  I said it was one of those mentioned in our amendment but I did not say the person to whom it was addressed.  The Minister quoted me correctly in regard to what I said about the person who sent it, that is, that while I had the name and address here, I did not propose to give them unless such became necessary.  It has not become necessary as a result of the Minister's intervention.  But I should like to make it absolutely clear that this telex message I read out did not come from the bank or anybody acting or purporting to act on behalf of the bank.  Indeed, somewhat closer attention to what it says would make that evident on its face.  But I can say it came from somebody who clearly feels disenchanted with the bank and what it did in relation to his business, who was suggesting, I think, to one of the former directors, I think that is the correct description, of Bula&mdash;I cannot quite remember with the changes whether or not he is still a director but anyway to a man who was a director and who may still be a director of Bula&mdash;that he should watch out, that he seemed to be under a misapprehension as to what was the position as between Bula and the Northern Bank Finance Corporation.</P>
      <P>Perhaps, having given that background of the sender, I might be permitted to read it again, it being clear what was the context.  It contains one sentence which anybody giving it some thought would realise could not have come from the bank.</P>
      <P>It says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You are reported as saying that pending the loan repayment the bank acts in accordance with the wishes of the beneficial owners.  But when the loan is repaid, the bank is obliged to retransfer the shares to Bula Holdings or its nominees.  Did you clear the statement with Northern Bank Finance Corporation. Your statement is one hundred per cent wrong if it purports to represent Northern Bank Finance Corporation's <Col N="1475" /> position.  Northern Bank Finance Corporation claim the right to dismiss the board and sell off the assets without reference to the beneficial owner or otherwise.  We refer you to the J.G. Mooney case.</P>
    <P>That sentence makes it quite clear that it could not have come from the bank. It goes on:</P>
    <P>We refer you to the call clause in Northern Bank Finance Corporation loans.</P>
    <P>I have no knowledge of the terms of the loans, or whether there is a call clause, or what it is.  Quite clearly, this person is aggrieved with the bank and, in effect, is warning Bula as to what they may have got themselves into, 80 per cent of the shares having been transferred to the Northern Bank Finance Corporation.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity, if there was doubt about it, of making it perfectly clear that communication did not come from the bank or anybody on its behalf, and did not purport to come from the bank or anybody on its behalf.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister seriously suggesting he was under the impression that this came from the bank?  Could he visualise any bank saying in a communication: &ldquo;We refer you to the J.G. Mooney case&rdquo;? Could he visualise that in all seriousness? I find it incredible that the Minister would even suggest that could have happened coming from a bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, I do not recall in the Minister's intervention that he said: &ldquo;Of course, if the statement comes from somebody other than a bank, it is wrong.&rdquo; I do not remember him saying that and, therefore, the suggestions in it are wrong so far as Bula are concerned and this could not happen to Bula.  If the Minister wants to say that, I am quite prepared to yield to him again to give him the opportunity to say it.  I do not want any misunderstanding about this position. Does the Minister wish to say that?  He does not.  Right.  The message <Col N="1476" /> is clear enough.  The message is quite clear now.  I do not know what the purpose of the Minister's intervention was.  I can understand he may have felt there was some danger of a misinterpretation that this had come from the bank.  I can understand he would want to clear that up.</P>
    <P>He went a little further in what he said about it if it did not come from the bank.  The fact that he has failed to accept the invitation I have just given him shows quite clearly that the Minister's concern may have been quite different from the one he expressed here this morning, and it is understandable.  I do not know the terms on which the money was borrowed, apparently, by Bula Holdings from the Northern Bank Finance Corporation. I say &ldquo;apparently&rdquo; because we were not given the details of this. All we know is that the shares have been transferred and, as far as the shares register is concerned, without conditions, and the Northern Bank Finance Corporation, a subsidiary of the Midland Bank, are now registered as the beneficial owner of 80 per cent of the shares of Bula Limited.  There is so much more about this transaction that we do not know, that I suppose we should be grateful we know even that much.</P>
    <P>Since the telex message made certain suggestions about what the terms of such a transaction would be, I assume if the Minister had wanted to say those terms did not apply in this case, he would have said so.  He got the opportunity to do that and did not.  So far as I am concerned the position is clear enough.  I hope it is clear to others.  If it is not, I will be glad to clarify it in any way I can.</P>
    <P>If I may now return to the amendment, I will not keep the House unduly long on it.  The position on that is also fairly clear.  An agreement has been entered into.  We do not know all its terms but we know some of them.  The terms we know of indicate that the agreement is seriously defective in a number of ways, that it was incompetently negotiated, and that nobody with a modicum of expertise in the field of commerce would have entered into such an agreement, or allowed <Col N="1477" /> himself to be manoeuvred into such an agreement.</P>
    <P>We have pointed out some of the defects.  I do not want to go back over them all again here this morning. Given that these major defects exist, and that there are people who find it incredible that such conditions were agreed to by the Minister, and that what we know of the agreement is as defective as it is, why should there be an objection to the factual statement being inserted in this Bill that the agreement was not produced to the Oireachtas?  In the course of this debate the Minister has said quite a few things, but he has not said anything which would indicate a rational reason for refusing to record that factual position. It is a factual statement&mdash;he does not deny that&mdash;that the agreement has not been produced.</P>
    <P>I indicated before the reasons why I think it is wrong that it should not have been produced but, given that it was not produced, I can think of no good reason why that should not be recorded.  In proposing the amendment I have indicated quite a number of good reasons why it should be recorded. Nevertheless, in consonance <Col N="1478" /> with the general attitude the Minister has taken throughout this debate, an attitude which at best could be described as <i>non possumus</i> and which could be described more harshly on many occasions, he is saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to this amendment.  I do not propose to involve the House in unnecessary discussions if that is the position.</P>
    <P>All I can do is repeat what I said when I was proposing the amendment. We on this side of the House want to have no part in the agreement, the agreement we have not seen, the agreement of which we know something. We want to have no hand, act or part in it.  We want in no way to be represented as approving of that agreement. We have done what we could to place on record that we did not approve of the agreement, and that we did not see it.  This is a further effort to exonerate the Houses of the Oireachtas from any responsibility for that agreement. Understandably the Minister wants to share the responsibility and, for that reason, he will not accept the amendment. In due course, I am sure, the whole story will emerge and people can judge it for themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 21, after &ldquo;£9,540,000.&rdquo; to add &ldquo;The said shares so acquired shall rank <i>pari passu</i> with all other shares of the Company for all purposes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to ensure that the shares acquired by the Minister will rank equally for all purposes with all other shares in the company. In the normal way one might think there was no necessity for this kind of precautionary provision but in the course of Committee Stage debate, Deputy O'Malley suggested, and the Minister did not deny it, that the secret agreement to which reference had been made on numerous occasions contained a provision to the effect that the Roche/Wymes/Wood block of shares, which is expected to amount to 41 per cent could, in certain circumstances, out-vote the remaining 59 per cent of the shares.  I hope that is not so but if it is the position then the Minister will not be able to accept this amendment.  If it is not the position I cannot see any reason why he could not accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that Patrick Wright referred to in the Bill, and apparently in the agreement, is now deceased. His estate will hold 10 per cent of the shares.  Some of those shares may come on the market and, subject to what is going to happen on a later amendment the Minister could well acquire those shares.  &ldquo;Coming on the market&rdquo; is a slight misnomer when one is speaking of a private company but we mean coming on the market within the terms laid down in the memorandum and articles of association of the company.  It is conceivable that the Minister might acquire those shares and he could end up with 59 per cent of the shares.  Nevertheless the suggestion that has been made in this House, and has not been denied by the Minister, is that even if he had <Col N="1481" /> 59 per cent of the shares, the 41 per cent block could in certain circumstances outvote them.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to ensure that this situation will not happen and that the shares being acquired by the Minister will, for all purposes, rank equally with all other shares.  That is not an unreasonable proviso for the Dáil to insert.  If there is such a provision in the agreement, that is monstrous because not alone is the State a minority shareholder but it has built itself into a permanent minority.  As I said, even if the State acquires the Wright holding of shares, it will still be in a minority position when it comes to voting.  To be paying £9.5 million for that kind of situation would hardly be a satisfactory outcome.</P>
    <P>Either the agreement has this provision in it, which is totally unacceptable, or it has not.  If it has not, the Minister should have no difficulty in agreeing with the proposition that the shares to be acquired by the State should for all purposes rank equally with all other shares in the company and we need not have any further difficulty with this matter.  I trust that the latter is the position and that the Minister will be able to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I want to go back to an earlier stage of the debate because notwithstanding something that was said with very great clarity, whether by accident or by design, the Opposition do not seem to understand it.  I am not going to quote my words where I convey the same sense but from the words of greater authority than mine in legal matters, the words of the Attorney General, who can put these matters into very clear, explicit and, from the legal point of view, very expert language.  I want to quote from the Official Report for 16th February 1977, at columns 1622-1623:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, when enacted, will not in any way make the agreement referred to in section 1 law.  It is not correct to suggest the Bill proposes to make the agreement the law of the land, <Col N="1482" /> or that the Bill ratifies the agreement . . .</P>
    <P>It is by no means unusual for Ministers to enter into contractual arrangements with outside parties. When they do so, the legal rights and obligations of the parties arise from the agreements and not from any statutory source . . .  Any legal rights and obligations of the parties will continue to arise from the agreement and not from the statute.</P>
    <P>A great deal that has been said by the Opposition about being asked to make the agreement the law of the land is irrelevant and does not arise.  That was said very clearly by the Attorney General on 16th February and has been and still is the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment relates to a section which authorises the acquisition of shares in Bula Limited, and the effect of the amendment would be to provide by law for the rights which are to be attached to the shares acquired by the Minister.  It is not appropriate that the rights of the Minister should be regulated in the manner proposed.  The rights of the Minister as a shareholder have been safeguarded adequately in the agreement and it would not be appropriate for me to put into law the rights I have as a shareholder.  In fact we are not making the agreement part of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From our side, that position has been completely clear and had it been taken note of it would, of course, have indicated to Members on the other side, if they had wanted to know it, the irrelevance of a great deal of their observations and their amendments. It is understandable, and by no means exceptional, that people who control the operations of a company should desire to ensure that the admission of a substantial minority should not result in their being deprived of the company's control. Operational control is not in this case an objective of participation by the <Col N="1483" /> State.  Subject to safeguards which I am satisfied are reasonable and adequate, it is proper that such control should continue to be exercised by the existing private interests.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the State has secured a considerable number of preferential rights some of which are designed to ensure that the State's right cannot be prejudiced in a fundamental way.  Some of them have the objective of securing rights and powers of a kind which would be appropriate to a lease in respect of State minerals. I am satisfied that the State's overall interests have been safeguarded and that in so far as special rights are concerned, the balance lies in favour of the State.  Therefore I am not prepared to accept an amendment which purports to make provision by law in regard to the rights which have been acquired under the agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told us more now than he told us at any other stage.  Would he be prepared to tell us whether he would still not have control even with a 59 per cent holding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is remarkable how the Minister can go so far and no further.  He has relied on contributions made by the Attorney General and has referred to statements made on this side.  My understanding of his remarks this morning is that we on this side have been right that the Minister cannot get control of the shares except by some chance which the Minister has failed to put on record.  It is becoming more and more difficult to get the Minister to commit himself in this respect.  When the Minister refuses to reply to a question there is the logical conclusion that he cannot reply because of the situation he is in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest the Minister has made a slip and that we will never have a majority situation in this company, much as the Minister may be jockeying for that situation.  He apparently has been advised, rightly or wrongly, not to accept any of our recommendations. When he sat down with those gentlemen it must not have been a pleasant experience and I have a certain <Col N="1484" /> amount of sympathy for him in that respect.  I have not the same admiration for that group that a number of people have.  In other circumstances this Bill would not be necessary because this property would be in the hands of the State, without any interference.  We are dealing with a company who moved very suddenly at a time when the Minister for Industry and Commerce was on the point of making an order.  Therefore, I have no compunction in urging the Minister to take every opportunity on behalf of the State to get the people's rights back.  That can be done through the State being able to lay its hands on the 10 per cent holding of the late Patrick Wright.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that we cannot get the Minister to clear up that point for us and the Attorney General is not here this morning to do so.</P>
    <P>We have an agreement and built into that agreement are a lot of secrets and the Minister has said that it is not in the national interest and in the interest of the firm in which we are 49 per cent involved to divulge the contents of that agreement.  Amendment No. 6 is one way of trying to extract from the Minister information as to whether we are going to be in a state of perpetual minority interest or whether there is a prospect of getting State control.  The last thing I would expect the Minister to be fighting for would be a minority shareholding.  The first thing I would expect the Minister to look for would be a controlling interest.  The Minister always goes down when he gets the opportunity of telling us &ldquo;I am all for control.  One of the ways we can get control is such and such.&rdquo; The Minister is quite good at getting messages across of great things happening when nothing at all is happening.  I am sure he has plans and ideas in this regard and if he would say &ldquo;I have plans but it does not suit me to disclose them, but those plans include control of this outfit in the national interest&rdquo;, I would approve of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to be careful in discussing this amendment to see what it is about.  It mentions the words <i>pari passu.</i> In other words, the Opposition <Col N="1485" /> are saying that the shares being purchased by the Minister in the company should be shares with equal rights to those enjoyed by the other shareholders; that they should not be denigrated or of a lesser class than the shares held by the other members of the company.</P>
      <P>This debate seems to be confused in the mind of Deputy Lalor.  He seemed to be talking about the numbers of shares rather than the rights. The section is quite clear.  It says:</P>
      <P>The Minister may acquire not less than 49 per cent of the issued shares of the company in accordance with the Agreement . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made in this debate to certain utterances by Deputy O'Malley and I understand he raised this matter of whether the shares had equal rights or not with those retained by the present members of Bula.  It surprised me that Deputy O'Malley when raising this point did not refer to the articles and memorandum of the company. He must have read the articles and memorandum because he referred to a specific clause in the articles on another matter, that of the guarantee. If the shares in Bula were of different classes&mdash;say one share had a preferential right over another&mdash;I would have thought that Deputy O'Malley as a lawyer, having read the articles and memorandum of the company, would have referred to any rights that might be allocated to any particular shares. He did not do so.  My impression, having listened to this debate as a lawyer listening to lawyers and having interjected now and again, is that Deputy O'Malley was putting up windmills and tilting at them in Don Quixote fashion.  It is open to no other interpretation to me as a lawyer and I do not think it can be open to any other interpretation to any accountant or businessman listening to the debate. If there was any foundation for the imaginary fears propounded by the Opposition, which I assume are the grounds for the amendment, one would imagine that a certain elemental factual foundation would have been laid for this proposed amendment.  Instead of that we have some imaginary <Col N="1486" /> fears which are extraordinary in so far as they were raised by a lawyer who has read the constitution of the company. We have no reference to any fact in the articles or memorandum.  I have not read the articles and memorandum of this company.  I do not know what they contain.  I could assume, but I have not done so.  I would have thought that when a lawyer gets up in this House, particularly as a front bench spokesman, he would have some factual foundation for putting forward an amendment of this sort.  This is quite apart from the point rightly made by the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a statute here, not with a contract but I would like to underline that the Minister has made a very concise statement in reference to this contract and he has used some very interesting words.  One must look at this contract as one that is being entered into on financial, legal and business advice and using political and social judgment.  It is quite evident from what has been said today that there are other benefits accruing to the State that are not particularly allied to the rights under the shares of ordinary shareholders.  Those would be the circumstances having regard to the fact that a 49 per cent shareholding is being purchased in this company. It would be natural that these precautions would be taken.  They are obviously being taken and on the very top level advice that this country possesses.</P>
    <P>We should not be trying to set ourselves up as company lawyers, company physicians, mining speculators or whatever.  We have done our duty in expressing our views in this House concerning this Bill.  The main difficulty from the point of view of the Opposition is that it is something completely new in political thinking in this country.  It is a type of thinking and conduct that will be followed by many other countries.  We have now to approach things in the light of that. We cannot just separate this business enterprise as between private enterprise and State enterprise.  Therefore, when the State participates in a private concern it must accept the <Col N="1487" /> rules and take the precautions normally taken by a private individual, by a bank, a finance house, a private company or a private investor.  That has been amply shown to be the case here.  However, I want to underline again the question as to where are the facts in the memorandum as a ground for this amendment that have not been referred to by Deputy O'Malley?  This is something I cannot understand having listened to a lawyer, an experienced politician, an experienced front bencher and an ex-Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very nice to have Deputy Esmonde's assurance that there is no basis for the fears expressed, the fears exemplified in the terms of the amendment.  As I say, it is very nice to have this assurance but not very useful because one assumes that Deputy Esmonde, like ourselves, has not seen the agreement.  I do not know whether it has escaped Deputy Esmonde's notice, but the parties to the agreement as defined in section 1 are also the shareholders of Bula Limited presumably as at the time of the making of the agreement.  The agreement can, therefore, very easily contain provisions such as we have outlined in regard to the rights of shareholders.  If it should become necessary, in order to implement such an agreement, to change the value of different classes of shares, and there is an agreement between the shareholders to do so, there will be no problem, as the Deputy well knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important thing is what is the agreement in this regard.  The Minister has steadfastly refused to tell us, although he did tell us today more than he told us on any other stage in that regard.  He said operational control is not an objective of the State's participation.  The message is very clear.  He does not propose to get and has not got control.  Fair enough.  But the crucial question is the one I put to him, a question we put to him many times before, a question he has failed to answer many times before and which he failed to answer again this morning. The question is: if he acquires a <Col N="1488" /> majority of the shares, will he then have control?  The suggestion made is that he has already agreed that in such circumstances he will not have control. This is a very relevant matter.  He has either agreed to that or he has not.  If he has not agreed it is absolutely a time-wasting exercise for him not to say so.  If he has agreed why should he not say so?  What damage would that do to anybody except the Minister?  It could not do any damage to the company or to the other shareholders.  But it could of course be extremely damaging to the Minister's reputation, such as it is, for commercial acumen.  But the Minister has made no such admission.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to ensure that the agreement does not, in fact, contain the type of provision I have outlined to enable any such setup to occur in future.  It is significant the Minister refuses to accept that.  It is also significant that, in dealing with the amendment, he quoted the Attorney General speaking on another matter.  He quoted him as saying the very obvious thing that the Bill does not make the agreement law.  In one sense that is perfectly true.  But the Minister went on to say it was not proper for him to lay down conditions of this kind.  I am not sure if &ldquo;lay down conditions of this kind&rdquo; were the words he used, but I want to tell him now that it is proper for this Dáil to do so. If the Minister has in this secret agreement agreed to provisions which would take away from him the right to exercise control of this company, even if he has a majority shareholding, then he should tell the House that and justify it and defend it, if he can.  If, on the other hand, he has not done so and he thinks it is not proper for him to provide for this in the Bill, then it is proper for Dáil Éireann to do so to ensure this situation will not be allowed to arise in future.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is, of course, that the whole course of the debate makes it virtually certain that the Minister has agreed to give away his right to control, even if he has a majority of the shares, and no amount of claptrap about commercial interests can justify concealing the fact.  Either it is done or it is not done.  If it is not <Col N="1489" /> done it is obviously in the best interests of the Minister and of the House that that should be made perfectly clear. But, if the Minister has so agreed, what possible commercial damage could be done to the company or to the other shareholders by an acknowledgement of that fact?</P>
    <P>The most significant aspect of the Minister's attitude in this regard is his failure to accept this amendment.  His alleged justification for not doing so is a very thin one; it would not be proper to put it into this.  It could be very appropriate if such a proposition came up in the future and the Minister's hands were tied and he could not agree to it as a shareholder.  It <Col N="1490" /> could be a very useful weapon to have.  I am afraid the real truth of the matter is becoming clearer and clearer.  I want to remind the Minister that, however much he tries to cover up the failures which have been piling up, failure upon failure, in this regard as more information comes to light, the whole story will come sooner or later and really he would do better to tell us the whole story now and in the process let us try to salvage something from the wreck by accepting amendments of this kind.  The Minister chooses not to do so.  We have done all we can.  The Members who support him will have to take the responsibility for what they are doing.</P>

      <P>With regard to amendment No. 7 I have been informed by the Chair that the amendment is out of order because it is irrelevant to the provisions of the Bill.  Could you assist me in explaining this?  I do not want to argue the ruling of the Chair.  I just want to draw the attention of the Chair to the fact that in the course of the Committee Stage debate there was a discussion on this point.  There were some conflicting statements but the statement was certainly made by the Minister, and I think by the Attorney General, that there was a restriction as regards the money being provided which effectively restricted the purchase of shares to 49 per cent.  This side of the House sought to ensure that there was no such restriction, although one political commentator wrote a full article to the effect that Deputy O'Malley and I were trying to prevent the State acquiring a majority shareholding.  The opposite, of course, was the case.  We wanted the State to do so.  In the circumstances it seems somewhat peculiar to me to say that an amendment which seeks to ensure that the State is not limited to 49 per cent of the shares is deemed to be irrelevant to the provisions of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, a letter was sent to Deputy O'Malley in regard to the matter.  The amendment proposes that nothing in the Act should prevent the Minister acquiring more than 49 per cent of the shares in the company. The amendment introduces what is in effect a proviso relating to the purchase of further shares in the company.  The Bill authorises the acquisition of not less than 49 per cent of the shares and the expenditure of £9,540,000 for this purpose does not deal with the acquisition of further shares.  Therefore the Chair has held that the amendment is not relevant to the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I must accept your ruling but I think it one of the more peculiar ones which come from the Chair from time to time.  I wish, however, to make it perfectly clear that from this side of the House we have sought consistently to try to ensure that the Minister has a controlling interest, not a minority interest.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 2, line 34, after &ldquo;attorney&rdquo; to add &ldquo;provided always that the Minister may not take up any rights <Col N="1493" /> issue in the Company or give any guarantee on its behalf or incur any liability in connection therewith until a motion of approval to his so doing shall have been passed by Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This matter was referred to during the Committee Stage by Deputy O'Malley when he pointed out that on the evidence available this company had no cash available to them.  They had assets in the form of land and minerals thereunder and they had a number of very substantial encumbrances but had no cash because the shares had been issued for a consideration other than cash.  Even the £9½ million being paid by the Minister will not, of course, be paid into the company.  The company will not end up with one penny more cash.  It will be the shareholders concerned who will get that cash.  Money will be required to develop the mine.</P>
    <P>The normal way in which portion of that money would be raised is by a rights issue, in effect each of the shareholders being called on to subscribe an amount of money which would be divided in proportion to their shareholding. If that were to happen the Minister would be called on to contribute 49 per cent of the figure that would be sought in order to produce the amount that would be required as the company's share in relation to what would be sought from lenders.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley made a number of calculations on Committee Stage.  I will not go back over them as the details are set out in the Official Report of the proceedings of the House for 9th February last at columns 1184, 1185 and 1186.  The conclusion he came to on the basis of these calculations was that the liability of the State in respect of the various items could well amount to something in the region of £15 million, approximately half the total liability, plus the £9.5 million provided in this Bill and the £2 million rights issue, to which I have referred.  This would mean a total requirement of cash from the State in the region of £26½ million.  One cannot say with certainty how much, if any, of this money will be required because we have no information as to precisely what will happen.  However, we know <Col N="1494" /> that as of now the company have not got the cash.  We know that a considerable sum of money&mdash;and I do not wish to get involved in an argument as to how much&mdash;will be needed in order to develop the mine before any return is obtained from it.  This money must come from somewhere.  We know, also, that in order to borrow money the company will be required to subscribe some cash of their own.</P>
    <P>The authorisation in this Bill is for the payment of £9.54 million.  You have just pointed out, Sir, in regard to the previous amendment, which was ruled out of order, that the Bill provides for the acquisition of 49 per cent of the shares and not for the acquisition of further shares.  Therefore, it seems reasonable to provide that if there is to be any question of a rights issue or of the giving of a guarantee by the Minister on behalf of the company with further liability, actual or contingent on the taxpayer, the Minister should be required before entering into such a commitment or before paying such money, to have the approval of the Dáil by way of the passing of a motion authorising him to act in this way.  That is what this amendment seeks to ensure.</P>
    <P>We do not know precisely what the position is in regard to the guarantee situation but it is clear to anybody who has listened to the debates on that point during Committee Stage that the situation is very unsatisfactory.  Again, I am not anxious to go back over that ground.  Suffice it to say that the position, to put is as neutrally as possible, is uncertain in regard to the guarantees while it is a distinct possibility in regard to a rights issue and that under one heading or another there will be a further liability for cash devolving on all the shareholders in the company but particularly on the Minister as the holder of almost half the shares. There is little doubt that lenders to the company in which the Minister and, consequently, the State, is the holder of such a proportion of shares, will insist on guarantees from the State.  In those circumstances it is not unreasonable that further commitments of that kind and which could amount to substantial sums of money&mdash;considerably <Col N="1495" /> greater than what is envisaged in the Bill&mdash;should be incurred only after a motion of approval to that effect had been passed by Dáil Éireann.  I trust the Minister will consider this to be a reasonable provision and that he will find it possible to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>To some extent I understand and appreciate Deputy Colley's argument but for reasons which I trust will seem good to him and to the House, I cannot accept the amendment.  There is an important question of principle involved here.  In the Bill I am seeking authorisation for the acquisition of shares in a private company in the natural resources sector.  That acquisition is in accordance with a policy on the development of natural resources which envisages participation by the State in the mixed-economy concept in association with private interests.  This is intended to be a commercial association in so far as that is both possible and appropriate from the point of view of the State.  As the Bill stands the position is that there are already established procedures, procedures that are fundamental and well understood and which are central to the whole way in which both moneys and authority are voted and with which any Minister must comply if he is to incur the expenditure of public funds or to give guarantees.  That is almost the core of the way in which Parliament works as one will realise on reading the whole history of Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no reason for the imposition of additional constraints on me in this case.  As I have suggested, the imposition of such additional constraints would be counter to the concept that the State's association should be within a framework of reasonable commercial freedom.  There is an inconsistency between offering the State greater freedom and greater power in some amendments and in diminishing the element of freedom and power by way of other amendments.  Here is the dilemma which seems to me to enshroud so much of the Opposition's position and to weaken very much the <Col N="1496" /> whole logic of their position right through.</P>
    <P>There are very many commercial transactions on the part of the State and there are elaborately-evolved controls in this regard.  Sometimes these controls work well but sometimes they are found not to work very well.  However, they are developing and expanding continuously.  Either there are additional constraints of the kind suggested in this amendment for all that category of activity which, in my view, would put a considerable damper on the activity of the State&mdash;that is a proposition that is arguable but which I would consider harmful and one which should be opposed on the grounds of reasonable commercial freedom&mdash;or, alternatively say &ldquo;No, you must have reasonable commercial freedom for the State and although the controls, the checks and the methods in regard to floating money are well understood, thoroughly tested and long developed, we want something extra, something special in this case.&rdquo; That is a preposterous proposition.  In the light of the debate that we have had on this Bill during the past six weeks and in the light of some of the things that are on the record and which are disgraceful, it is a proposition that is all the more preposterous.</P>
    <P>I will not have special arrangements made for one firm, arrangements that are different from those in the rest of the category.  In regard to the whole area of State activity I will not have a diminution of the framework of reasonable commercial freedom.  That seems to me an overwhelming powerful argument for the rejection of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset of his remarks the Minister expressed the hope that I would find reasonable and acceptable the case he makes for not accepting the amendment.  I regret that, although I sought to do so, I find myself unable to regard his argument as being either acceptable or reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, let me point out that the Minister seemed to think there was a contradiction in some way between, on the one hand, this amendment which seeks to impose further constraints on the <Col N="1497" /> company and, on the other hand, some amendments which seek to give greater power than was being sought by the Minister.  I presume what he had in mind was the fact that we had sought to amend the Bill in order to ensure that the Minister would not be restrained to a 49 per cent shareholding.</P>
    <P>Therein lies the kernel of the whole problem.  The Minister is speaking of this company and the State's participation in it almost as though it were what we generally understand as a State company controlled entirely by the State. The Minister is speaking of it in those terms when he is talking about its commercial freedom.  There is an enormous difference.  In any company in which the State has a minority interest, as in this case, there is a very arguable case for saying that where additional money is required in such cases it should come specifically before the House.  There is a very strong argument where the State does not control the company, where the State cannot ensure the pace of development or whether there is development.  There is a major distinction between that situation and a situation where the State actually control a company and its operations.  If the Minister cannot see that distinction he is missing the whole point in regard to most of the debate we have had on this Bill at all Stages. If the Minister has not accepted that distinction, there is no hope that I will convince him at this stage that it exists.</P>
    <P>There is a major distinction, and most people can see that clearly.  In this case not only is it a situation in which the State have, and will apparently permanently have a minority position, but we have the additional problem that the agreement relating to the State's participation is being kept secret.  Given those two factors, it is very reasonable that the making available to this company of further money, or the guaranteeing of further money, should be specifically authorised by this House.  It is a minimal requirement for anybody who has any pretensions to seeking to impose parliamentary control on expenditure. Would that be an interference with the <Col N="1498" /> commercial freedom of this company? That seemed to be the case the Minister was making.  One can glibly say that it would be so, but in practice I wonder if it would.  Even if it were, it is a price that must be paid for a minority State participation, a situation in which the State is paying out substantial money but is not having any control over how the company develops, if at all.  A price must be paid for that kind of situation.  The well-established procedures to which the Minister referred were presumably the ordinary procedures of Estimates and Supplementary Estimates being brought before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The State guaranteeing mechanism also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows that these mechanisms in recent years are tending to be more and more theoretical than practical.  If we consider the question of Estimates and Supplementary Estimates, complaints are being made from all sides of the House, and serious complaints are being made from this side of the House, about the decreasing amount of time being given by this House to the discussion of Estimates and about the fact that inevitably year after year there comes a day before the Christmas recess when some hours are devoted to a mass of Estimates and Supplementary Estimates with enormous amounts of money involved and only token discussions on them.  This kind of thing has happened before, but to my knowledge it has never happened before on anything like the scale or with the frequency with which it is happening in recent years.  In effect the Minister is saying that these normal mechanisms would apply in this case.  We know that the likelihood is that, if the normal mechanisms apply, the kind of commitments to which I referred earlier, which could well amount to something in the region of £26 million, could be undertaken without ever being discussed in this House.  One might say that, if we can live with that for other things, why can we not live with it in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me back to the point <Col N="1499" /> that this is special in that it is only a minority interest.  It is very arguable that, where it is only a minority State interest, the matter should come before the House if further expenditure is involved.  Where the State has a majority holding and control it is reasonable to assume that there will not be much argument about extra money being made available for the development of the project, because in due course it will redound clearly to the benefit of the State.  Where it is a minority holding only, there can be much greater room for argument as to whether the return envisaged by the State justifies the kind of expenditure involved.  When added to that the fact that the whole investment of the State in this company is based on an agreement which has been consistently concealed from the House, it seems to me that there is every case for insisting that further commitments of large amounts of money by the State for or on behalf of this company should be <Col N="1500" /> specifically authorised by Dáil Éireann and that the normal mechanisms to which the Minister refers are not adequate for the reasons I have outlined.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to argue that normal commercial freedom should apply to all companies in which the State had any interest, whether minority or majority, whether just under 50 per cent or presumably 10 per cent, I cannot accept that proposition.  It is not a reasonable or realistic proposition.  It is an argument in general terms which the Minister has advanced for the purpose of this case.  But when he gets an opportunity to think about it as a general proposition he will realise that it is an untenable argument.  For all of those reasons I must insist that this amendment represents a sounder and better position on this issue than the position outlined by the Minister and consequently, despite the Minister's refusal to accept it, I must ask that this amendment be put to the House.</P>

      <P>This matter also was referred to on the Committee Stage discussion.  It is, perhaps, not a major point but I think it is worth referring to it again.  The Minister accepted an amendment on Committee Stage in which the words &ldquo;subject to the Agreement&rdquo; were deleted.  In this section the words &ldquo;and pursuant to the Agreement&rdquo; will still stand.  There may be a difference between the two sections; the first is on section 4 and this is on section 5. Section 5 deals with the provision of money from the Central Fund &ldquo;for the acquisition under this Act and pursuant to the Agreement of shares of the company . . . &rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the words &ldquo;and pursuant to the Agreement&rdquo; are not necessary, unless the agreement provides for the acquisition in certain circumstances of more than 49 per cent of the shares.  I presume from all that has happened and from what we have been told as to the limitations imposed by the terms of the Bill as it stands that it is not possible to acquire more than 49 per cent of the shares either on foot of the agreement or on foot of the Bill.  If that is so, then the words &ldquo;and pursuant to the Agreement&rdquo; do not appear to be necessary. We propose in this amendment to delete the words on the grounds that they are unnecessary.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot agree with Deputy Colley.  From the point of view of the drafting of this legislation it is considered necessary to keep these words in and it is consistent with good drafting.  Section 4 (3) from which the words &ldquo;and subject to the Agreement&rdquo; were deleted was dealing with a power of the Minister for Finance to sell the shares and it was not considered necessary to keep those words in although they had been there originally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are dealing with now is section 5, which is to be linked up with section 2.  Deputies will recall that section 2 provides that the Minister will acquire shares in the company and the words &ldquo;in accordance with the Agreement&rdquo; are in this section. Section 5, with which we are dealing, refers to the provision of <Col N="1503" /> money out of the Central Fund, and to link up with the scheme of the Bill as set out in section 2, this section provides that moneys required from time to time for the acquisition under the Act and pursuant to the Agreement of shares are to be advanced out of the Central Fund.  It is a drafting point which I would ask the House to accept as proper, and for that reason I do not think it would be desirable to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>I think the Attorney General is right in describing this as a drafting point.  Drafting points may be of considerable importance sometimes, but in this case I do not think it is of major importance.  I find it difficult to accept fully the arguments put forward by the Attorney General, but in view of the fact that it is not a major issue, I do not think it is necessary for me to pursue it.  Therefore, I am prepared, in the circumstances of the amendment not being accepted, to withdraw it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment arises out of what can only be described as a very peculiar discussion which took place on Committee Stage.  For anybody who is interested it is reported in the Official Report of this House for the 1st March, 1977, <Col N="1504" /> volume 297, approximately from columns 492 to 507, inclusive.  I say &ldquo;peculiar&rdquo; because one will see on reading it that the Minister made certain statements and the Attorney General subsequently made statements which appeared to conflict with what the Minister said and then the Minister withdrew or appeared to withdraw what he said the first time. Without going into all that, this amendment arises directly out of what was said by the Minister on that occasion.  It would not have occurred to us to put down an amendment but for what he said.  It may be that it arose out of a misunderstanding but I do not think the misunderstanding was on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>The section involved states:</P>
      <P>The expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of this Act shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>It is a normal provision in almost all Bills, certainly Bills of this kind.  The difficulty has arisen because in the course of discussion on Committee Stage the Minister, having given as examples of expenses which might be incurred such things as consultants' fees, travel and staff, at a later stage referred to the possibility that certain continuing fees might be incurred, the liability for portion of which would have arisen before the enactment of the Bill and the liability for the remainder would arise after the enactment of the Bill. The Minister seemed to indicate that in such circumstances it was possible that the total fee would fall to be paid on foot of section 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into all of the very complex and somewhat peculiar discussion which took place on this on Committee Stage.  It is true that at the end the Minister was saying something else and appeared to be suggesting that in such a case there would be an apportionment and that such a continuous fee would be paid in two parts.  That seemed to emerge at the end, although there were qualifications on it.  In the course of the discussion the Minister did say and suggest that a continuous <Col N="1505" /> fee of the kind I have outlined could fall to be paid under section 7.</P>
    <P>The real difficulty involved here is that since the Minister gave as possible examples consultants, travel and staff, it appeared that he was envisaging the possibility that expenses incurred in the administration of this Act could include these items.  I questioned the Minister at the time as to how that could arise in the administration of the Act because while one can think of expenses arising in relation to consultants or travel or staff, on the face of it they would seem to be expenses which properly would be payable by the company.  Of course, the liability would devolve as to 49 per cent on the Minister but that is a theoretical situation. Assuming the company is operating normally, the company would pay it out of its own resources.  I cannot visualise, and I do not think the Minister was able to do so either when he was asked, a situation in which liability would arise for such things after the enactment of this legislation which would not be the liability of the company but rather the liability of the Minister as expenses incurred in the administration of the Act.  For that reason we have sought in this amendment to provide that no expenses incurred by the Minister prior to the passing of the Act and no expenses so incurred after its passing which should properly be payable by the company shall be so paid, in other words, to make it crystal clear that the kind of situation to which the Minister adverted during the Committee Stage debate will not arise and to make it perfectly clear that the only liability incurred would be in respect of expenses incurred before the passing of the Act and thereafter any expenses incurred which are properly the liability of the company will be paid by the company and will not fall to be paid under section 7.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree with me on this much anyway, that it reads most peculiarly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to say more than that.  It is perfectly possible that I was confused on that&mdash;I think <Col N="1506" /> I was confused.  It is certainly a confusing section of the Dáil record.  There is no question about it.  I do not think that any real clarity emerged from that section of the debate to which Deputy Colley made reference.</P>
      <P>This is a standard clause which is in every Bill.  The amendment implies that I or any Minister would be prepared to accept as a charge on public funds an expense which is not a proper charge on such funds.  That is the implication which is inescapable.  It is an implication I cannot accept and, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment. If an item is properly chargeable to the company or to anyone else, then it is not a proper charge on public funds and irrespective of what may be in any Act it would be improper in a specific sense for any Minister to accept the charge.  Again, we are dealing with things which have a history in the State and before the existence of the State.  Those distinctions are clearly understood, are upheld rigorously by the public service and my position is that the understanding and the administration is perfectly clear. Any confusion was introduced by me on the Committee Stage debate when I was confused but there is no such confusion in reality or in practice.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley has said that but for that Committee Stage debate it would not have been necessary to put down the amendment.  I have spoken frankly about my contribution to that debate. In view of what I have said I believe that the amendment is not necessary. It does make implications regarding me and my conduct of my job or on my successor which are not acceptable. In view of what I have said about the Committee Stage debate, I hope that Deputy Colley will find it possible not to press this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I freely admit that the amendment is open to the interpretation the Minister has put on it, that is, that he or his successor would in some circumstances pay out money which should not properly be paid out.  It is open to that interpretation.  To that extent I suppose I could not reasonably expect the Minister to accept it. It arose directly out of the discussion on Committee Stage.  In view of what <Col N="1507" /> the Minister has said, and I congratulate him on being so frank about it&mdash; I wish he had been equally frank about other aspects of the Bill&mdash;I think the position is clear.  In effect what the Minister is now saying is that the position is as it always was, always will be and that anything that might have been said in the Committee Stage debate, in the course of a certain confused discussion, does not affect the issue.  On that basis I withdraw the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of and approves of the progress made in EEC negotiations towards settling management and conservation measures, in the interim and for a permanent fisheries regime.</P>
      <P>I want to refer the House to the debate of 14th July, 1976, in the Seanad when the Taoiseach reiterated our position in relation to the 50-mile limit and to say that that is Government policy and that is what we are aiming for.  The Government fisheries development programme is between 1975 and 1979 to increase our fleet to 300 vessels and to increase our tonnage from 75,000 tons to 150,000 tons.  On February 22nd the Government moved a unilateral decision to outlaw boats of over 33 metres&mdash;110 feet&mdash;and over 111 horsepower from an area around our coasts which is now referred to as the Irish box.  This area is bounded on the north by 56º.30 north latitude, on the west by 12º west longitude and on the south by 50º.30 north latitude. That area of the Irish box is 50 miles from our coast in some cases and as much as 100 miles from our coast in others.  There was an immediate reaction from the Commission.  That was the value of the unilateral action we proposed to take.  If there had been no reaction from the Commission the decision of the Government was to take that unilateral action.</P>

      <P>There is no written version of the speech.  I am speaking from notes.  The debate was only mooted yesterday by the Opposition and we met them by having the debate today.  In the meantime, there was no opportunity to produce a written speech; I am speaking from notes. This reaction from the Commissioners was valuable because it meant that they were taking account of our proposed unilateral action, an order for which I have signed.  They came forward with their proposals.  First, I should like to put on the record an official letter from Commissioner Gundelach to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of 22nd February which states:</P>
      <P>Following my letter of 16th February and the meeting held on 21st February with officials of your Government and with the other Member States concerning the unilateral conservation measures envisaged by your Government, I must inform you that it leads me to the unavoidable conclusion that the measures you have proposed raise wide ranging issues which would make it impossible for the Commission to give its approval at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the disappointment <Col N="1513" /> of the Irish Government seeing the Community unable, up to now, to find an appropriate solution for all Irish fishery problems.  However, although there was lack of agreement on one point during the last council meeting, others like the ban on Celtic Sea herring and the prohibition of factory ships were accepted.  Therefore, the Commission, for its part, does not preclude the possibility of arriving at a Community solution on the matter still under discussion.  Obviously, we need some time to find such a solution and on behalf of the Commission I must, therefore, ask your Government to postpone the date of application of the proposed measures at least until 15th March.  Such a gesture would certainly be appreciated by the other Member States, and I can assure you that the Commission will be ready to do all in its power to look for an early and satisfactory solution.</P>
    <P>I hope also that we will have the possibility of discussing this matter at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <P>I have only one copy here but I shall gladly give the Deputy a copy.  Of course, it will be on record.</P>
      <P>The Government then had to decide whether to go on with this unilateral action or to give the EEC Commission an opportunity to make their proposals to us.  It is no harm here to go back to the situation in 1972 when the previous Government was in office and when the Treaty of Accession was signed by that Government.  I refer the House to Article 100 on fishing rights and I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No. 2141/70 on the establishment of a common structural policy for the fishing industry, the Member States of the Community are authorised, until 31 December 1982 to restrict fishing in water under their sovereignty or jurisdiction, situated within a limit of six nautical miles, <Col N="1514" /> calculated from the base lines of the coastal Member State, to vessels which fish traditionally in those waters and which operate from ports in that geographical coastal area; however, vessels from other regions of Denmark may continue to fish in the waters of Greenland until 31 December 1977 at the latest.</P>
    <P>Subsection 3 states:</P>
    <P>If a Member State extends its fishing limits in certain areas to 12 nautical miles, the existing fishing activities within 12 nautical miles must be so pursued that there was no retrograde change by comparison with the situation on 31 January 1971.</P>
    <P>The previous Government left the incoming Government in the position that the maximum area over which that Government had any jurisdiction as far as fishery protection is concerned was 12 nautical miles.  There the matter lies.  The Opposition are now eager and ready to jump on the bandwagon and support the very legitimate objective of 50 nautical miles laid down by the Irish Fishermen's Organisation and others and with which the Government readily and fundamentally agree.  The Opposition's attitude is to try to place the Government in the position of not being in favour of this laudable result. We are in favour of that result.</P>

      <P>That was what was left by the outgoing Government in 1972.  We were left with 12 nautical miles at a maximum.  In the period from the postponement of unilateral action up to the day before yesterday there were high level meetings of officials from this country and the other countries of the Nine to see if a solution could be found.  There were moves forward in that time.  The <Col N="1515" /> prohibition of factory ships was a move forward and there were other moves forward as well.</P>
      <P>The day before yesterday in Brussels two fundamental steps forward for the Irish fishing industry were taken verbally.  The Commission undertook to put to the Council of Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries before the middle of April proposals for a permanent fishing regime and laid down a deadline for reaching a Council decision&mdash;30th June, 1977.  That was never there before.  We regard that as a very serious step forward so far as our relations with the EEC are concerned.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered that our unilateral decision was temporary in as much as it was to have been in force until the end of this year.  I have already mentioned the offer made in Brussels the day before yesterday.  The position is that not only would there be quotas but the number and size of boats must be indicated and boats will be shown by name and by number. Anybody not licensed, whose name and number are not available to this country, would be a poacher and could be arrested or reported to the Commission as breaking the agreement. The length of his stay in Irish waters must be specified and could be reduced.  The actual fish stocks to be caught were to be determined. This range of protection measures was to apply solely and specifically to Irish coastal waters.</P>

      <P>Community countries. In relation to Irish coastal waters there is offered to us now the restriction on other countries fishing not in the Irish box but in a smaller area.  This means that around our coast we will have this total restriction. There is the advantage that if you have a large area and impose a restriction on the number of boats or the fish they may catch, there could be a larger number of boats and <Col N="1516" /> bigger quotas. They could all fish in our waters for their quotas and denude our stocks.  Therefore there is a fundamental advantage in having the size of the Irish box reduced.  This means that the reduction in fishing and the taking of catches would apply to the areas around our coast.  This is what we want.  This would refer to zone 7.  There is at the moment in abeyance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will give Deputies a map as soon as I have finished.  In abeyance at this moment and not offered to us are the subzones 6A6 and 6A7.  This was indicated by me to the chairman and secretary of the Irish Fishermen's Organisation before I went to the negotiations in Brussels. In the course of the negotiations I did not succeed in getting subzones 6A6 and 6A7, which are largely the areas off the Donegal coast, included.  It will be for our high level officials to argue the importance of these zones to us and to say that we want them included.</P>
      <P>This is another indication that we are coming from the position of the 12-mile limit which we had in 1972&mdash; there is no criticism of the previous Government intended here&mdash;to our final target of a 50-mile limit, step by step.  I will be delighted to give the Opposition copies of a French map which will give them the position of subzones 6A6 and 6A7.  That matter is to be argued in the ten day period up to Thursday week when I will be back in Brussels trying to get all I can, or we can invoke our unilateral measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unilateral measure is subject of an order which I have made and signed.  We are ready to invoke that unilateral measure by Government decision, not by my decision, if we are not satisfied with what we are getting from the EEC.  I want the Opposition to understand completely that this is <Col N="1517" /> not a matter that can be finalised in a moment or even in a week.  It can only be finalised in meetings of the Council of Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries while, at the same time, having high level meetings with our officials who can bring their successes into the political and larger forum of the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>I now want to deal with the matter raised by the Opposition in relation to who is handling fisheries.  When fisheries are discussed in the Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs, the relevant Minister to discuss these matters at that Council is the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  When they are discussed at the Council of Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries, the relevant Minister is the Minister for Fisheries.  There is complete confidence between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and myself at all times, but we both accept responsibility for fishery negotiations at these forums.  It is not our choice that these matters are discussed at the Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs.  Any Minister for Foreign Affairs at the Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs may raise a fishery measure as it applies to foreign affairs.  Having so raised it, the relevant Minister to put forward our case is the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  If these matters are raised at the Council of Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries, the relevant Minister is myself.</P>
    <P>I note that in all debates on fisheries over the past few years we heard from the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Kennedy, and their spokesman on Fisheries, Deputy Gallagher.  The objections of the Opposition could be termed political playacting.  The Opposition spokesman for Foreign Affairs knows that it is his duty to discuss the matter as it is discussed in the Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Deputy Gallagher knows it is his duty to do the same thing.</P>

      <P>I will be replying to any other points which arise during the debate.  As Minister for Fisheries, the House may take it that I will not be a political lollipop-man, merely standing in the way.  I will be working as hard as I can to secure the interests of our fisheries.  There have been newspaper comments in the past few days which undoubtedly will be taken up by the Opposition like a peach thrown into their after dinner sweet.  I will deal with such criticisms when I come to reply.</P>

      <P>I move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;condemns the Government for the inconsistent and confused manner in which they have mismanaged the EEC fishery negotiations to the detriment of the Irish fishing industry.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has to look at the whole question of fisheries and the manner in which the matter has been dealt with by the Government since they took office when speaking on this amendment. Membership of the EEC conferred certain benefits on the Government which should have enabled them to plan for the future expansion of the industry, but the Government have not <Col N="1519" /> made any effort to get any such plan under way.</P>
    <P>By way of parliamentary question and debate we have tried to impress on the Government the necessity for such planning, and the IFO have gone to the trouble and expenses of producing a plan for the industry, realising that EEC funds are available, help that heretofore has not been available. However, the Government have ignored all suggestions and efforts made in relation to our fisheries.</P>
    <P>We realise that the derogation clause in the EEC fisheries agreement, which will be valid until 1982, was put there to give the Irish Government a breathing space in which to take a look at the whole question of fisheries so that at the end of that time we could find ourselves in a competitive position <i>vis-á-vis</i> other member states when it comes to fishing and the development of the industry.  The Government have not taken advantage of this, and as an example of how serious the situation has become, in 1974 grants for boatbuilding were insufficient and notice of it had to be given to the Government by this side of the House.  As a result, the Government increased the grants at that time to keep the boatyards moving. A similar situation developed recently in a boatyard in the south of the country and workers there were notified that 30 per cent of them would be laid off.</P>
    <P>Last week in the Dáil, in reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister for Fisheries told us he was not satisfied with the amount of money being made available for the purchase of secondhand boats.  We have been accused of playacting and political&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Call it what you like.  All our efforts have been constructive. I will quote from a speech I made at the 1976 Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fishing industry may now be sufficiently large to justify a large <Col N="1520" /> scale development plan, including the training of more fishermen and skippers, the building of substantially more and bigger boats, more protection vessels, better harbours, greater marketing, etc. These developments would in my opinion represent a desirable form of economic and regional development based on a local natural resource, giving substantial employment in just those areas most in need of it.</P>
    <P>Later, I said:</P>
    <P>This type of development plan could and should be part of any real regional policy.  The EEC aid as at present administered is given to schemes already in preparation rather than in providing a framework for new exciting developments in the underdeveloped regions of the country which could transform them as is the intention.</P>
    <P>In November last I said at a debate in UCG:</P>
    <P>The terms of the agreement negotiated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs recently suggest the necessity for a huge injection of capital in the industry over the next two years, i.e., building of 300 boats, creation of extra jobs on shore and the improvement of harbour facilities and improved protection for our fleet.  Allied to this is the need to improve our research educational and marketing facilities.</P>
    <P>If our EEC partners are serious in their claim that they are treating Ireland as a special case&mdash;although one would question this in view of what has been happening with the non-payment of FEOGA grants to fishermen&mdash;let us hope that the Government will provide the necessary structures, leadership, impetus and finance to make these projections a reality.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting to the House that from the beginning we have been constructive and have tried to play a positive role in regard to our fishing industry. During the debate on the Maritime Jurisdiction Bill the Minister for Foreign Affairs accused us of hindering <Col N="1521" /> the EEC negotiations, a charge which was unwarranted and unnecessary. It is typical of the Government that when things do not go to their liking they look for some scapegoat to cover for their mismanagement.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to The Hague meeting when the hopes of our fishermen were raised as a result of the wonderful guarantees given to them by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. All the projects we had at that time in relation to providing an extra 300 boats by 1977, expansion of harbours, improved processing facilities, were forecast to yield extra employment on shore and in fishing in general of up to 1,800 jobs.</P>
    <P>Again one has to relate this to what has been happening in the Dáil and the amount of money made available for fisheries.  On 11th November, 1976, I asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the number of boats over 80 feet now on order by Irish fishermen and the reply was:</P>
    <P>Ten boats of over 80 feet in length are at present on order and all are due to be completed by September, 1977.</P>
    <P>On 23rd February the Minister for Fisheries in reply to a question asking the sum available to BIM for administrative purposes and for development in the current Estimate for fisheries said that the sum of £1,790,000 was available.  In reply to a question on 9th March, 1977, regarding the amount available for loans we were given the figure of £6,319,000.  When one realises that the last large fishing boats in the Irish fleet cost £1,100,000 we can see that the projections given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in relation to the expansion of the whole fisheries question are indeed very far removed from the amount of money that has been provided in the budget.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday, 1st December, 1976, I asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries what plans his Department had for the provision of further major harbours and if he would state where these are to be developed.  The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>Five harbours are scheduled for development as fishery harbour <Col N="1522" /> centres under the Fishery Harbour Centres Act, 1968.  I do not propose to add to the list of such harbours.</P>
    <P>Where are the famous promises made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs as a result of The Hague meeting?  On Thursday, 4th March, 1976, I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the number of research vessels being used by his Department.  There was none.  A similar reply was given by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries on 10th March, 1976, that at that time we had no research vessel operating.  Fishing is a resource that has to be managed and controlled and we have to understand that the only way that the fisheries can be controlled here is by the provision of a 50-mile coastal band.  The position in relation to quotas which has been suggested by the EEC is not at all suitable when the Irish situation is being considered and we have to be able to control the fisheries ourselves.  We cannot expect the EEC, who have plundered their own areas, to try to preserve or conserve our stocks.  We have to have research facilities.  We have to be able to tell what stocks are there and the amount and type of fish that can be taken out at any time.  Unless we are successful in securing the 50-mile coastal band we can forget about developing the fishing industry.  I am sure our EEC partners are well aware of this situation.</P>
    <P>Since March, 1976, the IFO have had constant talks with the Minister for Foreign Affairs in relation to the importance of providing the 50-mile coastal band and they have tried to impress on him how important it is for the future of the industry.  While the Minister seemed to accept the suggestion, he has always been trying more or less to emphasise the importance of having a fall-back position.  In other words, he is going into battle without being fully convinced himself that 50 miles should be sought.  This has been proved by the way he has come into this House on a number of occasions and voted against motions from this side of the House in relation to having the 50 miles provided.</P>

      <P>At the same time he keeps telling the fishermen and the public&mdash;and we have the Minister today telling the House once again&mdash; that the Government are pursuing this objective of getting a 50-mile band. We have had so much coming and going that at this time we do not know exactly what the Government are proposing or what they intend doing in relation to this very important question.</P>
      <P>I have been dealing with the fisheries end of matters and I hope that some of my colleagues will deal in greater detail with the actual negotiations and the handling of them.  One has to have sympathy with the fishermen at this time because of the manner in which they have been treated by the Government in their handling of this business. The organisation have given a great deal of time and thought to these matters and going back and forward to Brussels has cost them a good deal. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has taken them into his confidence and the Minister for Fisheries has been acting in the same manner up to recently, until just a few weeks ago, when it was obvious the Government were backing down once more on the question of unilateral action they were told they would be kept informed of developments.  Unfortunately, they have not been kept informed as to what the Government proposals are or as to the specific proposals from the EEC and we are at a disadvantage today in not knowing exactly what proposals have come to the Government in regard to the future of the industry.</P>

      <P>We will continue to fight on this side of the House for a 50-mile coastal band.  We cannot move one inch from that position.  There is no other way whereby we can expand and develop the industry.  We have here a map which was given to us as we came into the House.  This map does not mean a thing to me and I am sure that our fishermen, if they were provided with this map, would not be happy with the situation either.  The Minister said some of the boxes were free to us and other boxes could be fished by foreigners.  It is all just one big muddle.  The situation is getting worse from day to day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EEC have had plenty of time to come forward with positive proposals. This matter has been under debate for at least six months.  One day there is talk of quotas and, when we refuse to accept that suggestion, they take it back, rephrase it and present it to us in another way.  It is quite obvious the EEC have done no real thinking and have no real plan in mind for the future of the fishing industry. It is up to us then as a member state to ensure that some positive thinking is brought to bear on the matter.  At the moment, as far as I can see, all the Commission are interested in is catching as much fish as they can for themselves. The whole underlying principle of the EEC and its foundation is being forgotton.  Unless we are able to come forward with positive thinking and planning we will not get the results we <Col N="1525" /> should get from the EEC.</P>
    <P>Take this map, for instance.  The Minister has told us it is a French map.  Where, I wonder, is the Irish map?  Can the Minister produce it?  Can he tell us what exactly we have presented to the EEC?  If he has brought anything positive to the EEC we are entitled to be told about that.</P>

As I said earlier, we now have advantages that were never available to us before for the development and financing of the industry. We must draw up plans.  We must be positive in our approach.

      <P>I want to say a few words about one <Col N="1526" /> aspect of this matter.  It is an aspect which has got more attention than any other aspect in the last few weeks.  I refer to the confusion about the role of different Ministers and different arms of the Government.  There is no confusion except that which the Opposition are diligently trying to create and that which the media which report what the Opposition say spread among the people.  Government is a collective authority and it is in the nature of things that in a large number of matters, particularly new matters which have not arisen before, something is bound to entrench on the jurisdiction of two or, perhaps, even three different Ministers.  It is quite easy to draw up a theoretical distinction, as I will now do, between the function of the Department of Foreign Affairs, on the one side, and the Department of Fisheries on the other.  It is easy to say&mdash;it is the truth&mdash;that the responsibility of the former Department is largely a negotiating one and the responsibility of the latter largely a technical and economic one but that statement of principle will not prevent a large number of issues arising on which the constant co-operation and consultation and mutual replacement substitution at one juncture or another by the two Ministers concerned will not be necessary.  No Government that ever existed has found it possible so to define and delimit the area of activity of a Minister so that no Minister was ever in any doubt or the public ever in any doubt as to into whose responsibility a particular matter fell.  There is no confusion that I can see, no difficulty, no overlapping or conflict of rules that I can see, and the only confusion is that which the Opposition have been doing their best over the last couple of weeks to propagate. There was one single incident in which I must agree there was room for misunderstanding.  There was a misunderstanding, but it was a very simple matter, namely, whether a particular telephone call was made before or after the Minister for Fisheries and I had been in Brussels interviewing Mr. Gundelach.  That telephone call was before that interview.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the overriding need to reserve available capital resources for the provision of essential classroom and laboratory accommodation in post-primary schools, it has been found necessary to suspend for the present the scheme of grants towards the cost of sports halls or gymnasia in post-primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that it was an ill-conceived scheme to reduce the standard of schools for the sake of saving money? The schools will cater for the post-primary education of children in a large area for generations to come.  I am interested particulary in the proposed building scheme for Donegal. Why has the Minister reduced the standard of the schools there to a non-acceptable level?  This has created much animosity in the area because people have been waiting for the provision of schools for many years.  The Minister had a letter from parents with regard to this matter, a copy of which I have here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the concern of parents throughout the country that the facilities available in post-primary schools should be as comprehensive as possible.  However, there is the necessity for making choices and <Col N="1531" /> establishing priorities within the amount available for capital purposes to my Department.  At the moment I think the correct decision is that the money should be devoted to classrooms and laboratories rather than towards sports halls.  Perhaps I might give the Deputy a figure of the cost involved: the amount of applications for post-primary schools would cost £170 million.  This is a measure of the demand for new resources for post-primary schools.</P>

      <P>I know that the Minister can work out a figure as easily as that.  I am asking about schools which have been sanctioned for many years.  In relation to the Donegal building programme generally and a Donegal school in particular, will the Minister state why he and his predecessor refused to meet a delegation from the Donegal Vocational Education Committee to discuss this but behind their backs he met the CEO and a Fine Gael councillor and had a political discussion about the same problem?  They were furnished with a report which they brought back to the meeting of the vocational education committee and this created acrimony in the committee.  This is relevant to the building of Donegal schools to which this question refers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education the number of vocational education committees that insist that their staff members sign release forms in June of each year on the commencement of summer holidays; the purpose of having such forms signed; why the committees concerned refuse to continue paying the salaries throughout the summer holidays until the signed documents are submitted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter within the competence of the vocational education committees.  My Department do not intervene in relation to it and do not have the information sought by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Have a vocational education committee the right to withhold salaries during the summer holidays?  If so, what is the statutory condition?  Where is it backed by statute?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that this will satisfy the Deputy because neither I nor any of the officials in my Department could understand the point the Deputy was trying to make. If he has a particular case, I would like to hear what is involved.  I will quote from memorandum V7 relating to this if that is any help to the Deputy. <Col N="1536" /> It says that a permanent whole-time teacher shall be granted a minimum of six weeks summer vacation each year, provided he has satisfactorily completed the duties normally required of teachers immediately after the conclusion of class work for the session and subject to the condition that he may be required to attend a course of instruction during portion of the vacation period.  That is the section relating to holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that unless the teachers sign forms before the holidays they are liable to be without salaries during the holidays.  I want to know from the Minister if a vocational committee have a statutory right to withhold the salary and leave the teacher without salary during the six weeks summer recess to which the Minister referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what release forms the Deputy is referring to.  We have checked with the 38 VECs and they have no information about the point raised by the Deputy and they do not know to what he is referring.  Is this in relation to a particular teacher in a particular school?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in relation to teachers generally employed by vocational education committees.  I put down the question on a general basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister finds out that this is the position, would he, realising that teachers may be inconvenienced if forms are not supplied to them before they start their holidays and they will have to do without their salaries, take steps to get rid of this unnecessary condition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly be very concerned if through some clerical mix-up people were deprived of their salaries during the summer period.  I will take steps to see that that position does not arise.  The Deputy will have to give me specific information about what he wants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not.  The only figures I have here are those the Deputy asked me for, those who applied to sit for the examinations in 1977.  I do not know how many of those will pass the examinations. Those are presumably the people the Deputy is referring to as coming out without any credits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>

      <P>The Industrial Development Authority use a number of criteria to identify the centres which can, from an industrial development viewpoint, derive the greatest benefit from the provision of an advance factory.  The authority do not consider that the situation at Charleville warrants the construction of an advance factory at present, but the situation there will be kept under review.</P>
      <P>There is of course a whole range of other incentives available to the authority in their promotion of suitable industrial development in Charleville.</P>
      <P>I understand that there were three inquiries from industrialists considering the possibility of establishing an industry in the town in the past two years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is perhaps aware that the Charleville Development Association made representations on this matter in October last. <Col N="1539" /> They were met by a representative of the IDA in January this year. Following that meeting the special working group of the IDA concerned with advance factories held a special meeting for the purpose of discussing the situation in Charleville.  It was decided subsequently that, in the light of the evidence available and given the limited amount of resources available for advance factories, an advance factory was not warranted in so far as Charleville was concerned.  They had in mind in particular the trend in unemployment in the area which is covered by the Killmallock exchange. I might add that there is some evidence of an improvement in the situation in Golden Vale.</P>

      <P>It can be said that one can anticipate increases being sought in respect of a number of products even before application has been made by the producer.  In that sense the Department in their normal surveillance of the general situation in relation to prices might be said to be aware of the product in respect of which increases are likely to be sought. However I do not think it would be accurate to say that the Department were aware specifically of the increases in this case at the time of the budget.

To the extent that the targets in the Green Paper are based on projections of the growth in the labour force and take account of the numbers leaving full-time education each year, the IDA's job targets also take account of the need for employment opportunities for school-leavers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is satisfied that the strength of the Garda Síochána in the docks area of Dublin is adequate to meet the particular situation existing there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>Both of these questions suggest that an insufficient number of gardaí is assigned to the particular areas to which the questions relate.  The Commissioner of the Garda Síochána has informed me that the present allocation of gardaí to each of the areas is the maximum that can be provided at present having regard to the overall demands on the available resources. No decision has yet been taken in regard to the allocation of the extra gardaí authorised by the Government but the Deputies may take it that a proportion of them will be allocated to the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to recent publicity which suggests that a special crime unit operating in the docks area has been disbanded and has been replaced by what has been called two gardaí on bicycles.  The fact is that there has been no diminution in the number of gardaí on duty in the docks area.  Six gardaí&mdash;not seven gardaí and a sergeant as has been suggested &mdash;operating a patrol car on a 24-hour basis have been replaced by six gardaí on cycle patrol on the same basis.  The Garda authorities expect that the new arrangement will provide better police coverage of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, in any case, surprised that the change should have been the subject <Col N="1554" /> of criticism&mdash;some of it from quarters from which a fairly constant demand is for more emphasis on foot patrolling.  I might add that the area patrolled by the gardaí in question is also patrolled by members of the harbour police.</P>

      <P>Arising from the part of the answer that applies to Question No. 13, would the Minister say how many men, including officers, are involved in the policing of the Ballyfermot area, and how many cars and bicycles are available for these men?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The strength in Ballyfermot is one superintendent, four inspectors, 13 sergeants and 48 gardaí. There is one patrol car and one motor cycle operating around the clock, and one other car which operates up to 2 a.m. nightly, that is about 17 hours per day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that in a part of Dublin city where there is a population in the region of 70,000 to 80,000 we are depending entirely on about 65 people to provide 24-hours service? We have only one motor car and one motor cycle to service the area on a 24-hour seven-day-week basis, and the Commissioner says he is not satisfied from the resources available to him that the area is properly policed.  Is the Minister aware that at public meetings held in the area senior members of the Garda force, ranking superintendent and possibly higher, have admitted that they are very disturbed with the inadequate policing given to the area, that they are very short of manpower, and that they need more policing hours there even to keep up with the increasing crime there?  Would the Minister not agree that some crash programme should be introduced to see to it that a large area of Dublin, an area much bigger than Limerick city and almost as big as Cork city, will be adequately policed?  We have only 50 men for three eight-hour shifts.</P>

In addition portion of the Ballyfermot area is policed from the Kilmainham station which has a total of 51 men. From time to time Ballyfermot has had assistance from the Crime Task Force which has been available at evening time and early night to supplement Garda strength in Ballyfermot.

As I have told this House on numerous occasions we have increased the Garda force by 950 since we came into office, and we propose to increase it by a further 500.  This is indicative of the Government's intention to answer the request for further Garda strength in different parts of the country.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 to 19, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Last October my Department received from the Garda Síochána information to the effect that a fingerprint discovered on a helmet that had been found near the scene of the murder of the British Ambassador and Miss Judith Cooke had been linked with a particular person.  The Garda stated that the identification was not conclusive and needed to be further checked when better samples or copies of the fingerprints of the person concerned would become available.</P>
      <P>It would be contrary to practice to say whether or not information to this effect was conveyed to the British authorities as any such communication would be confidential.</P>
      <P>No more definite identification than that which I have indicated was at any time subsequently communicated to my Department and I understand that the better copies or samples of the fingerprints of the person concerned which were being awaited had not in fact been obtained before the issue was otherwise resolved by the discovery that the fingerprint on the helmet was a fingerprint of a member of the Technical Bureau.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that, before the fingerprint was identified as that of a member of the bureau, the view had already been expressed by two members <Col N="1561" /> of the bureau that the earlier, qualified, identification was not correct.  A difference of opinion amongst fingerprint experts does not of itself appear to me to be significant, especially in relation to prints of poor quality, though obviously the position would be otherwise if an identification had been positively made and put forward as conclusive in court proceedings. In this case, however, the officer in charge had decided that the matter was to be left in abeyance until the better quality copies or samples to which I referred earlier were obtained. Before that happened, as I have said, the issue was otherwise resolved.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, there are various aspects of the matter that require to be fully gone into and evaluated and a comprehensive investigation is in train under the direction of a senior Garda officer.  This investigation will cover, amongst other things, any possibility that there may be implications for other cases in which fingerprint evidence has in the past been given. I am informed that for various reasons, including some of a technical nature, the investigation is likely to take at least another month or so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be normal practice to keep me informed, particularly in a matter such as this, but as I have pointed out it was made clear that the indentification was not conclusive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister would agree, if anybody is talking to him or his Department in a case such as this, the evidence would have to be properly checked out before it would be given to the Minister, as otherwise it must be regarded as hearsay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  The investigation of crime involves the following of a number of lines of inquiry and it is only right and proper that I would be kept informed of the various stages of the lines of inquiry from time to time.  One of these lines of inquiry may be following a fingerprint which would not be conclusive at an early stage.  I think it is quite proper that I would be informed that a fingerprint has been identified and that I would also be informed as to the hardness, so to speak, of the identification.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state the regulations that govern the conduct of visits by relatives to prisoners in Portlaoise prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Visits to prisoners are the subject of statutory regulations, namely, the Rules for the Government of Prisons, 1947 (Statutory Rules and Orders 1947 No. 320).</P>
      <P>However, I assume that the Deputy's question is concerned with the practical application of the regulations in relation to Portlaoise Prison and, accordingly, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate with the Official Report a memorandum giving details of the arrangements as this affects relatives visiting prisoners in that prison.</P>
      <P>Following is the memorandum:</P>
      <P Just="Center">
        <i>Visits by relatives to prisoners at Portlaoise Prison</i>
      </P>
      <P>1.  Prisoners in Portlaoise Prison are allowed to receive visits from relatives (and reputable friends) as frequently as are prisoners in any other prison in the State.  One visit of half an hour's duration is allowed every week and three visitors may be present during the visit.  Occasional special visits are also allowed.  Visits from relatives and friends take place in the sight and in the hearing of prison officers.  This supervision is a feature of visits in all prisons, to ensure that &ldquo;contraband&rdquo; or information of a kind which would endanger security, safe custody and good order are not exchanged during the visit.  [Professional (legal) visits take place in the sight of but not in the hearing of prison officers.]  Visits may take place on any weekday from 10 to 12 in the morning and from 2 to 4 in the afternoon.  There is no visiting on Sundays or on Christmas Day.  A prisoner may forfeit the privilege of receiving visits for a period for unsatisfactory conduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  When visits were allowed in Portlaoise in the comparatively relaxed way in which they are still allowed in other prisons, the privilege was abused. <Col N="1564" /> Information and material&mdash;including explosives&mdash;were exchanged during visits and were subsequently used to disrupt the good order of the prison and to facilitate escapes and attempts to escape.  In consequence, certain additional precautions have been taken in Portlaoise.</P>
    <P>3.  Visits are allowed to no more than 15 prisoners every morning and 15 every afternoon.  This ensures that the visits can be adequately supervised and that supervision is not impeded by having a number of visits taking place simultaneously in a crowded situation.  This spacing of visits need not reduce the number of visits which prisoners can have, if they co-operate in having visits spread over the week and in arranging the days and the times in advance with their visitors.  Such an agreement was offered to the prisoners and, had they co-operated in putting it into effect, the spacing of visits over the week that would have resulted would have resolved the problem created by too many visitors seeking to visit on Saturdays and the disappointment which some of them experience when it is not possible to allow visits in excess of the number already stated.</P>
    <P>4.  Prior to a first visit, visitors must give notification in advance of their intention to seek to visit a prisoner. They have to give sufficient information about themselves to enable their identity and relationship to the prisoner to be checked and an assessment made as to whether a visit can be allowed without danger to the security and good order of the prison. A visit is authorised as soon as these matters are verified.  Visitors are searched, on arrival at the prison, prior to the visit.  This usually consists of an immediate examination of any articles in their possession and a subsequent rub-down body search in the modern&mdash;but badly vandalised&mdash; visitors' waiting-room, just outside the gate of the prison.  (Everybody entering the prison, including the Governor, is subject to similar rub-down searching).</P>
    <P>5.  Visits&mdash;apart from professional (legal) visits&mdash;take place in rooms in <Col N="1565" /> which the section occupied by the visitors is divided from the section occupied by the prisoner by a double wire mesh screen.  This screen extends from the table top to the ceiling and a transparent perspex barrier about eighteen inches high rises from the table top between the two wire meshes.  This physical division, which had been discontinued in the prisons many years, had to be reintroduced in Portlaoise because dangerous &ldquo;contraband&rdquo;&mdash;sophisticated cutting appliances, money and explosives&mdash; was being brought in by visitors, sometimes intimately concealed, and was being passed surreptitiously to prisoners.</P>
    <P>6.  The purpose of visits is to enable family contacts to be maintained and to enable necessary family and personal business to be arranged.  Discussion of internal prison matters or the affairs of other prisoners is not allowed.  If it occurs, the supervising prison officer intervenes and cautions the prisoner or the visitor.  If it persists, the visit is terminated.  Conversation during the visit must be audible. Neither the prisoner nor a visitor is allowed to behave in an unruly or abusive fashion towards prison officers.</P>
    <P>7.  During the period of approximately 7 weeks from 1st January to 16th February, 1977, 411 visits (involving 540 visitors) were allowed to prisoners at Portlaoise Prison.  With effect from 17th February, the majority of the prisoners have been refusing visits, but from 17th February to 12th March last, 75 visits (involving 85 visitors) have been allowed to the prisoners who continue to accept visits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful to the Minister for providing the memorandum which I hope to see at some stage but not knowing what is in it, may I ask the Minister whether it is a fact that any slight infringement of these rules or regulations in regard to visits&mdash;for instance, if a mother asks her son how he is getting on and if the son replies&mdash;the interview is immediately broken up, the relative <Col N="1566" /> is asked to leave and the prisoner is then put into solitary confinement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is an exaggeration.  That is not the position. The Deputy will see the memorandum in which the position is set out very fully.  Normal conversations or normal inquiries of that nature would be quite in order.  What would not be in order would be discussion of the prison and what is taking place in the prison.  That is not permitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that two months prior to Christmas visitors were not allowed to visit the prison nor were they allowed to write letters, that each prisoner was limited to six Christmas cards, and that a parcel of sweets in the possession of a 17 months old child who was being brought to see his father was taken from the child? Was that done in the interests of security?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there was such a ban as stated by the Deputy in general operation.  It is possible that individual prisoners, for reasons of internal prison discipline, had forfeited the privilege of letters or visits or both.  That can happen because the prison population in this prison do not conduct themselves so as to observe the rules.  Their objective is to make life as difficult as possible for the prison staff, to try to breach the security of the prison and to do as much harm as possible to the State.  Because that is their attitude discipline must be enforced and enforced strictly.  Sometimes in enforcing discipline prisoners forfeit privileges but it is the prisoners own fault if privileges are so forfeited.  No goods are allowed in for security reasons.  In the past contraband was attempted to be smuggled in under the guise of goods from visitors.  Consequently, any goods that are required by the prisoners can be purchased by them and visitors can make the money available to the prison shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say whether he is aware that many <Col N="1567" /> relatives have gone to Portlaoise in the hope of seeing members of their family who were imprisoned there but have not been able to get access to the prison or to meet their relatives?  There is seemingly no order whatsoever.  People, having come long distances, do not know whether they will get into the prison.  Many families have been left standing in the cold for hours, particularly in the last couple of months, and then were not admitted.  Can the Minister say further whether there is any truth in the allegation that is made that there is a lack of warm clothing in the prison, that items like overcoats, which would be necessary in winter months, and shoes and so on are not being given to the prisoners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is totally untrue to suggest that there is any lack of warm clothing for prisoners.  I regret that visiting conditions are not as comfortable for visitors as they might be.  This is due to the fact that there is a crowding of visits on certain days of the week.  I have offered on numerous occasions to the prisoners the operation of an appointments system whereby visitors could come by appointment on a fixed day at a fixed time and would be admitted without any delay whatsoever.  The prisoners, because of their policy of non-cooperation with the prison authorities are not prepared to work such a system, and it is on their visitors that the hardship which ensues from that falls, not on the prisoners themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any right of appeal against the sentence pronounced by the governors of these prisons which, according to their relatives, are very severe?  Has the prisoner a right to appeal against what appears to be an extra sentence to what has been decided by the judge in the courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that a high measure of discipline has to be preserved. However, I did not say that severe punishments are meted out.  In fact, severe punishments are not meted out.  Any punishments or disciplinary measures which are imposed are what are adequate to meet the <Col N="1568" /> offence in question.  If the Deputy puts down a specific question with regard to the governor's rights and the rights of prisoners to appeal, I will answer it. I have not got that information here, and I do not wish to talk off the top of my head on that point.</P>

      <P>It would be contrary to well-established practice to give details of the personnel or equipment involved in a particular security operation or to disclose information which could be used to quantify the deployment of manpower and resources in such an operation.</P>
      <P>As regards the cost of the trial, it would be extremely difficult and time-consuming to ascertain this, having regard to the wide variety of the elements of expenditure that would need to be assessed.  It can safely be assumed, however, that by far the biggest item in the cost was the cost of the necessary security measures and, accordingly, even if there were no practical problem in ascertaining those costs, it would I believe be invidious and inappropriate for me to publish them.  The Deputy may take it that the security measures were those which in the professional judgment of those charged with responsibility for operational security were judged to be necessary to discharge our clear obligations in the particular circumstances that had arisen.</P>

      <P>The overall strength of the Army is a matter of public knowledge, but what I am asked is the number of troops, type of vehicles and so on used in that operation.

      <P>The fact that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said the Irish Army could not hold the town of Newry for any longer than a couple of hours is something the people have not forgotten.  However, may I say that the Minister's argument is still not valid, because any of us who were on the dual carriageway on any one of the days on which these SAS people were being brought to the court could easily counts for himself the number of trucks on the road.  Therefore it would be better for the Minister to give a more accurate picture of what is involved rather than to have people guessing.</P>

      <P>Before Question Time I was coming to deal with the matter of the telephone call which caused confusion two weeks ago, confusion which was unnecessary but which deserves, I suppose, to be cleared up, although the matter in question is relatively unimportant.  The fact is that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was in telephone communication with Commissioner Gundelach about two days before the Minister for Fisheries and myself went to visit the Commissioner in Brussels.  I visited the Minister at his home&mdash;he was in bed ill as everybody knows&mdash;the day before we went, in other words on the Sunday. The Minister told me then that he had been speaking to the Commissioner. He gave me an outline of what he thought was in the Commissioner's mind and said that he would not exclude the possibility that the Commissioner's proposals in their result would be as good as or better than what we could get from the application of our own unilateral measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there was no further communication between the Minister and the Commissioner.  But when the Minister for Foreign Affairs was in touch with the media from his home in Dublin, while the Minister for Fisheries and myself were flying back from Brussels, he said that he had heard from Mr. Gundelach outlines of proposals which suggested to him that we were going to get something as good as or better than the unilateral measures. <Col N="1578" /> He was referring not to something which had just come across the wire as we were in the air; he was referring to an impression which he had gathered &mdash;I believe correctly&mdash;from a conversation which he had before we left Dublin.  That is how the conclusion arose.  I think the Minister for Foreign Affairs might have been wiser perhaps to put out a statement in writing rather than to offer an opinion over the telephone.  One always risks the possibility of being misunderstood or misrepresented. I am not entirely sure that the blame for this misunderstanding does not rest with those who reported what the Minister said.  Of course, it was an innocent mistake.</P>

      <P>I am not suggesting that this was anything other than a completely innocent misunderstanding on the part of those who published what the Minister said.  The Minister may well have been to blame in not making it clear that he was speaking about a conversation that antedated our visit to Brussels.  There is nothing more to it than that.  I never heard a greater bottle of smoke being booted around this House in my four years here than <Col N="1579" /> this matter of the Minister's telephone call with the Commissioner.  I knew that even before I heard the Minister's explanations, because that expression &ldquo;as good as or better than our own unilateral measure&rdquo; was used by the Minister to me 24 hours before the Minister for Fisheries and myself went to Brussels.  There was nothing new in it as far as I was concerned.  I knew immediately that he was referring to an earlier telephone call.  It is regrettable that he did not make that sufficiently clear.</P>

      <P>I am trying to explain a misunderstanding.  The Deputy is trying to prevent me from clearing up the confusion about this relatively simple matter which has generated far more smoke than the nature of the confusion deserves.  It is what I call a superficial or communication confusion for which&mdash;I must say it on the Minister's behalf&mdash;it would be wrong to blame others because I suppose he should have been a bit more careful in making sure that those to whom he spoke understood clearly what he meant.</P>
      <P>I very often criticise the media but I must compliment the media, at any rate on the editorial level, on a very balanced and sane approach to this whole thing.  The media have not let themselves be stampeded into making or subscribing to or countenancing exaggerated demands or claims or ideas.  However, I attach blame to the Opposition and to some of their outside contacts who have, I believe, deliberately attempted to make the Irish public believe and to give them the impression that it is a matter for a motion in this House, or for a three-section Bill which could pass in Private Members' Time, to declare and have legally upheld a unilateral 50-mile exclusive zone.  That is false.</P>

      <P>Some of them perhaps do not understand the issue.  Let me say, as I have said before, that we are not in the same position as Iceland. I saw a bit of the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; about three weeks ago during which a very valiant Icelandic gunboat skipper was a guest.  The part of the programme which I saw did not contain any hint or suggestion of any understanding by the compere, the studio audience or the skipper himself that we are in a different legal situation to that of the Icelanders. That is not the fault of the Opposition. They cannot be held responsible for what goes on in a television programme any more than the Government can.  But I do pin on them the responsibility for the misapprehension and misunderstanding which was quite evident in the TV studio in the most widely regarded and looked at programme put out by our national station.  The people in the studio, the compere and the wretched Icelander clearly thought that we were in the same situation as the Icelanders, that if our sailors had the degree of valour which he had, that if our boats could carry out the same kind of naval operations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we would be legally in the clear.  That is not so.  We are obliged and always were obliged to share our fishing waters with our partners in the EEC.  To suggest, as does a correspondent in the letters section of today's <i>Irish Press,</i> that we can copy the Icelanders is absolutely dishonest and I call on Deputy O'Kennedy or whoever may be speaking at 3.45 p.m. expressly to disclaim any similarity between our situation and that of the Icelanders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going back to recriminations about what we failed to do in 1972.  Let the responsibility for that lie where it may.  It may be that the Opposition at the time were not <Col N="1581" /> watching carefully enough to make sure that we did not leave ourselves in this situation.  I do not say that the blame was all on the side of the Government at the time.  Having found ourselves in that situation we had, and have, a clear moral right to seek a renegotiation, a rearrangement, of the regime of 1972.  That is what we are in the process of doing.  But I want to distinguish between negotiation and wild shouting from the shore.</P>
    <P>This Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs are trying, if I may use a figure of speech, in stormy water to bring the ship of the Irish fishery regime safely to port.  They are being distracted by strident screaming and yelling from the shore from people who do not have this responsibility, who do not believe that these Ministers are doing their best, who expect that in the middle of the storm these Ministers are going to turn aside from their task and show them their charts, that they are going to give them a lecture on navigation over the gunwhale of the boat.  That is not reasonable.  One cannot negotiate like that.  One cannot continue in this way with eight other Governments.  Because, although we are dealing with a Community, it is the interests of other member states that are stopping us from getting what we want.  We cannot continue negotiations while being forced at every hand's turn to explain to an Opposition spokesman who, although I have the same regard for him as every other Member of the House, is on the radio at the drop of a hat telling us that we are stabbing the fishing industry in the back, that we are selling them out. Hand in glove with that we have fishermen who are in a difficult situation, in which they have the entire sympathy of the Government but whose reactions to everything the Government do seem to me to be based on the assumption that a negotiation should be a matter of a single meeting, some of whom do not seem to understand that what is important is the end result.  What we are looking for, when the smoke here has cleared away, is a fisheries regime which will give to our fishermen the substance of what they <Col N="1582" /> seek, which will guarantee the industry's future and make sure that the plundering, exploitation and lack of conservation under which neighbouring Irish waters have suffered will cease. That is what we want to end the day with.  A negotiation is not like casting out a net and bringing in a draught of fishes.  It is not like that; a negotiation requires footwork.  Footwork means that one does not merely set one's eye in one direction and march steadily towards it with a placard saying &ldquo;50 miles or nothing&rdquo;, like the placards I have seen being carried around the city.  Negotiation requires footwork, it requires a stepping from one side to another and perhaps even occasionally stepping backwards.  Anybody who does not understand that is not fit to have an opinion of any kind about foreign affairs.</P>
    <P>One could not negotiate anything, let alone a serious matter like a fisheries regime, if one just made a demand and refused to discuss it, qualify it or hear what others had to say about it. One could not do it that way.  While the Government consist of men who are paid to take abusive criticism&mdash; and we do not complain about it; nobody in his senses would complain about it&mdash;I do not say that the wild, strident shouting we hear every Monday or Tuesday after a meeting in Brussels, added to and amplified by the Opposition, who are hoping to fool the people, with a considerable degree of success in the sense that they have led many of them to believe that we are in the same position as the Icelanders, helps anybody.  Most certainly it does not help the fishing industry.  It does not help this Minister and it does not help his colleague in Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>That is not supposed to be a plea for being let off criticism; no politician expects that.  But it is a poor substitute for a serious Opposition policy on this matter.  I listened very carefully to Deputy Gallagher before Questions and I did not hear a single constructive suggestion, let alone a single argument as to what the Government were neglecting in their search for an exclusive band and for a regime which will satisfy the legitimate wishes of the fishing industry.  I ask <Col N="1583" /> the House to accept the Minister's motion and reject the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the terms of our amendment to the motion which reads:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for the inconsistent and confused manner in which they have mismanaged the EEC fishery negotiations to the detriment of the Irish fishing industry.</P>
      <P>In so far as that motion refers to inconsistency and confusion I should begin by specifying precisely where that inconsistency has been and outline, to the extent I can in the time allocated to me, the confusion that has arisen.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's impassioned plea for responsibility from this side of the House, from the public and from the media was taken to be not merely a criticism but, in a sense, an expression of the irritation the Government must feel&mdash;which certainly he feels&mdash;at the fact that we have not all responded satisfactorily to the manner in which negotiations have been conducted heretofore by whomsoever they have been conducted. That is quite correct.  When he speaks about the absent Minister, who indeed is a very significant agent in all of these discussions, some important things emerge.</P>
      <P>The interesting thing is that we should find ourselves discussing this at all this afternoon.  Yesterday the Taoiseach quite clearly said that he would have no discussion, not today, not tomorrow, not on any day.  There would not be a discussion&mdash;that from the Taoiseach, the head of the Government. That was as of yesterday.  Things change very quickly; in a matter of hours suddenly there was to be a discussion. We welcome the change because we sought the debate at all times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We did.  I want to point out the inconsistency in the attitude even of the Leader of the Government who very firmly, three <Col N="1584" /> times yesterday, said &ldquo;no&rdquo; in the emphatic, monosyllabic style which is particularly a characteristic of his.  Today that &ldquo;no&rdquo; of yesterday becomes a &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is then the issue as to which of these two Ministers is responsible for the negotiations and who is answerable to this House&mdash;no matter where the question comes from&mdash;for an explanation of the negotiations.  That issue has not yet been resolved by any means.  I ask the Minister present in the House, in the absence of the other Minister&mdash;who indeed has a rather central role somehow even during his illness, a rather shadowy background type of role to play in all of this&mdash;to clarify this matter.  I shall now put to him some very precise questions.  I shall illustrate these from some Order Papers of this House over the last five or six weeks.  I think the present Minister was appointed Minister for Fisheries around 7th or 8th of last month.  On the Order Paper at that time there was a question down to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Question No. 61 on the Order Paper for 10th February read:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs the unilateral conservation measures he proposes to take to protect Ireland's fishing industry pending agreement on the European Community's internal fishery regions.</P>
      <P>At that time obviously the Government had decided that that was the responsibility of Foreign Affairs.  Now I want to clarify something that some of the media appear to have misunderstood. It is not Deputy Gallagher or I who decide to which Minister a question is directed.  We simply ask the question and leave it, as we have had to do over the past five weeks.  In the General Office we are told that they are not quite sure which it is but to leave it with them and whichever Minister is responsible will take it. Therefore, the decision as to which Minister will appear on the Order Paper answering which question is entirely a matter for the Government. Sometimes questions we have submitted to Foreign Affairs have turned up under Fisheries and sometimes <i>vice versa.</i> That is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1585" /> It would appear, as of 10th February, 1977&mdash;judging from the Order Paper for that day&mdash;that it was determined by one or other of these Ministers, not by the General Office, because they have at all times said it was not their function, that Question No. 61 which I had put down on the unilateral conservation measures which Ireland would take pending agreement on the European Community's internal fishery regions was appropriate to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the record is there to show it.</P>
    <P>On 15th February, 1977, note Question No. 68.  Again I had put this question down to the Minister for Foreign Affairs but where did it turn up?  The same question to which I have already referred as being down to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on Thursday, 10th February, 1977, which was not reached, appeared on the Order Paper of Tuesday, 15th February, 1977, this time down to the Minister for Fisheries.  Obviously a decision had been taken that, as of that time henceforth, the Minister for Fisheries was the Minister who would be responsible for the unilateral measures we would take in our negotiations. Nothing could be clearer than that decision to transfer the question remaining on the Order Paper from one Minister to another.  That is not the end of it.</P>
    <P>On 16th February, 1977 Deputy Gallagher put down a question&mdash;again to whichever Minister was responsible, because we have no way of knowing&mdash; and this time it appears on the Order Paper to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as Question No. 11, reading:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he has been advised by the EEC regarding the number of boats from non-member States being allowed to fish inside this country's 200-mile fishing limit.</P>
    <P>Surely a matter of our fisheries negotiations, the internal regime, and it turns up to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Two days later that one turns up again, this time to the Minister for Fisheries.</P>
    <P>I shall go briefly through these because <Col N="1586" /> they illustrate a very important point in regard to the confusion to which we refer in our amendment. On the 16th February, 1977 that same question remained on the Order Paper to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, this time as Question No. 70.</P>
    <P>On the same day I addressed a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and it was put down to the Minister for Fisheries, asking him the unilateral conservation measures he proposed to take to protect Ireland's fishing industry pending agreement on the European Communities internal fishery regions.  How are we supposed to know, how are the public supposed to know, how is anybody supposed to know who is responsible?  Hence the questions I asked as to who was responsible for the negotiations on our fishing interests in the EEC.</P>
    <P>On 2nd March, Deputy Gallagher and I asked the Minister for Fisheries, the reply, if any, the Government had given to the request of the Commission of the European Communities to postpone unilateral conservation measures until 15th March and if he would make a statement on the matter. The House will note that question was addressed to the Minister for Fisheries, not by us although in some instances we may have taken a chance to see what way it would come down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister disclosed this morning, Commissioner Gundelach had written to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  On Wednesday, 2nd March, the position appeared to be that the Minister for Fisheries was responsible.  I hope Question No. 18 of 9th March has been answered today by way of written answer and I should like to have a copy of the answer before I sit down, if possible. When I put down that question the Minister for Foreign Affairs was known to be ill but still it appeared on the Order Paper addressed to him.  If that is not a clear indication of a change of responsibility on the same precise issue I cannot imagine what is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1587" /> We have no way of knowing who is responsible for this precise issue.  It occurs to me that, from time to time, because of some dissatisfaction on the part of one Minister with the other, or because there is not a proper definition of responsibility, each time it is decided by way of reaction to the events of that week or that day that this Minister or that Minister will take the questions and deal with them.  There is no consistency in the manner in which the Government have dealt with these queries.  To the extent that we need consistency to guarantee that there will be an informed discussion in the House, we have been denied it.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately we are not about to get great details of the telephone communications between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the newspapers. When I put down my questions over two weeks ago I did not know the Minister for Foreign Affairs had been in touch with any newspaper.  I had information which suggested he had been in touch with the news desk of RTE.  Casually in the reaction of the newspapers in reporting the questions asked here on 2nd March, it became clear to me that he had telephoned not one but all the daily newspapers from his sick bed at home.</P>
    <P>One has to ask why should the Minister for Foreign Affairs think it necessary to telephone all the daily newspapers and the RTE news desk when the other Minister who is responsible sometimes had issued a statement in Brussels and apparently was about to issue another one at home.  When he was obviously out of action why should the Minister for Foreign Affairs take it on himself to intervene to explain to the newspapers what apparently the other Minister could not explain?  That is a question the Government must answer.  It is not something Deputy Gallagher and I dreamed up.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the individual news desks knew the Minister was giving exactly the same &ldquo;service&rdquo; to the other papers as he was giving them, in other words, taking them into his confidence.  Every news desk would be flattered that the Minister for Foreign <Col N="1588" /> Affairs should telephone them to give them the real story.  I am not sure whether he told them the real story was also being given to four or five other news desks.  He left those news desks and the RTE news desk with the impression that Commissioner Gundelach had been in contact with him by telephone on that date, or he with Commissioner Gundelach.  Each one of them, with one possible exception, presented it as if Commissioner Gundelach had been in contact with the Minister for Foreign Affairs as of that date, or <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>It all very fine for the Parliamentary Secretary to say they got that impression because of an unfortunate misunderstanding. That might be understandable if only one newspaper had been telephoned but, when all of them and RTE had the same impression, one has to come to the conclusion that the impression they were intended to get from these telephone calls was that on that date the Minister for Foreign Affairs had been in communication by telephone with Commissioner Gundelach, and not three or four days earlier as the Parliamentary Secretary knows from his own knowledge. If you telephone a newspaper and say: &ldquo;I have telephoned Commissioner Gundelach or he has telephoned me&rdquo;. it is open to the interpretation that it happened on that day.</P>
    <P>It is pointless to blame this side of the House for an intervention by a Minister in what appears to have been on that occasion the responsibility of another Minister.  The Minister has been ill.  I am glad to note he is back in action again.  I have not been able to get a reply to my question about his communication with Commissioner Gundelach because only he can give that reply.  I have had to postpone the question several times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>He may have been in touch with him subsequently. These are matters we can clarify later.  How could the Minister say to <Col N="1589" /> the news editors it was likely that what would emerge subsequently would be better than what the Government were proposing?  That seemed to me not just to be an implied criticism of the Minister for Fisheries but an express criticism.  That is not just my opinion, That is what the general public believe.</P>
      <P>If confusion has been created it has not been created by us.  We are entitled to answers to our questions. Our motion is specifically directed at confusion and inconsistency.  We cannot be criticised for pointing to this confusion and this inconsistency. That is our function in relation to a vital matter of national interest, our fishing industry.</P>
      <P>Glowing terms of praise were used in regard to the Minister for Fisheries after his appointment and it was said by representatives of the Irish Fishermen's Organisation&mdash;who now apparently are charged with being in our camp or in cahoots with us or something of that sort&mdash;that for a man who has actually been flung in at the deep end he had made a major achievement.  Apparently, that was acceptable then, but any criticism they make subsequently, of course, is an indication that they are less than objective or fair.  We hear the Parliamentary Secretary imply that these people express these views because somehow we have got at them.  That is quite wrong.  In the nature of things they will communicate with us as they will communicate with the Minister&mdash;and quite rightly.  What seems to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that they are in cahoots with us is that yesterday he saw a representative of the fishermen's organisation quite rightly and legitimately in the company of Deputy Gallagher and myself, as we have seen him some time later or earlier in the company of the Minister.  We would not have seen him in the same gleeful mood as the Minister appears when both of them appeared in an <i>Irish Times</i> photograph of Thursday, February 10th.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are they to be denied the right to communicate with us or, if they do <Col N="1590" /> are they to be accused of being somehow in cahoots with us?  I do not suppose the Minister here would suggest that, but that is why the Parliamentary Secretary made that implied criticism of the fishermen, that these people were somehow&mdash;I forget the expression he used&mdash;in cahoots with us outside the House.  I asked him to define them and he said &ldquo;some representatives of the fishermen&rdquo;.  That is a very unwarranted criticism of them which I think the Minister here would not accept, because he would acknowledge that they have a right to communicate with us as they have to consult with the Minister.  Their consultations with him would be more important because he is the Minister, but he would not and could not deny them the right to consult with us.  That in fact is all that has happened.</P>
    <P>In regard to the conduct of negotiations, it was this Minister in the House who decided with a great flourish and determination that he was going to introduce unilateral conservation measures. The press reaction to that was one of almost unanimous endorsement at the courage, capacity and determination of the Minister.  I have no time to go through all the details but this emerged quite clearly from the report in the newspapers in the period around Thursday, 10th February.  All have the same high commendation for the Minister who announced what he intended to do.  He was the one quoted for instance in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 16th February telling any foreign boats to get out of the area.  He was the one quoted as saying that any boats infringing the zone would be forced out by our Naval Service.  Those are the terms used by the Minister.  He was the one quoted as saying he doubted if the measures he was adopting would be lifted at the end of the year.  It comes rather strange then when you have heard a Minister making pronouncements in such strong terms, &ldquo;forcing them out by the Naval Service&rdquo; and so on, with the great response there was from the fishermen's organisation and the newspapers, to hear the Parliamentary Secretary tell us that the essential capacity needed in negotiation is delicate footwork.  If that is delicate footwork the nation would not like to <Col N="1591" /> see some heavy plodding.  Certainly, we would be all the more damaged if this is taken to be delicate footwork.</P>
    <P>Eventually, there was a letter of 22nd February from Commissioner Gundelach to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, which we now see for the first time today.  That was long before the meeting at which the Minister was present and from which the Minister for Foreign Affairs was absent, long before the end of the phone-around by the latter.  That letter says that they regret they have not been able to meet the Irish Government in all of this, that they need some further time to find a solution on behalf of the Commission and so they ask the Irish Government to postpone their action until 15th March.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs had that letter on 22nd February.  It gave no details of the proposals, no guarantee and no commitment except to say that difficulties were there.  Significantly, this is the first time we have been told about this letter, that the public have been told.  It comes as a surprise to us. We did not know it before.  Was it around this time that apparently the Minister for Foreign Affairs was in telephone communication with Commissioner Gundelach.  Was it then that Commissioner Gundelach made his further proposals that do not emerge here, because all this says is that they would like us to postpone our action until 15th March so that they could see if they could get further agreement?  It was all hanging in the air as of that date and there was no evidence of any firm proposals.</P>
    <P>This morning we see the kind of proposals.  We get a document, mark you, prepared and formulated not by the Commission but by the French Government.  We do not know to what extent this represents any proposal from the Commission.  The document was formulated by the French Government and the Minister tells us that under it boxes 6A, 6 and 7, which seem to me to be perilously close to the rocks off the Donegal coast never mind the area outside it, have not been included in the conservation boxes&mdash;<Col N="1592" /> if I read it correctly&mdash;which are to be exclusively for Ireland, but that he would hope&mdash;and I quote him&mdash;that the experts who would be meeting after this may be able to succeed in doing what he has not succeeded in doing and have them included.</P>
    <P>What does this document represent? What is the point in producing it? Is it a Commission document or is it not?  Is there some suggestion that proposals from the French Government represent something more significant than proposals from our Government?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

      <P>I am well aware of that.  I had only a half hour and one cannot solve the whole fishery problem in that time.  Therefore I concentrated on pinpointing the confusion and the inconsistency which are the subject of our motion.  The real issues are bigger and deeper but I had to pinpoint the inconsistency and confusion.  Had I more time I would have been able to outline it clearly with all the statements which appeared in the newspapers of those dates from February 10th up to this week.  There is nothing clearer than this inconsistency and the impressions created in the public mind.  It is not enough to blame the media for all of this because, if so, all the media are <Col N="1593" /> wrong.  As regards the issue itself which the Government entrusted to whichever Minister is expected to act on their behalf, we recognise on this side of the House that this is a difficult task.  Let that be stated as a first principle.</P>
      <P>Because it is difficult, we recognise that if there are to be two Ministers concerned in consultations, they should at least have an understanding with and a confidence in each other.  We believe there is not such understanding and confidence between the two men concerned and that their conduct in public indicates that that is so.  If such understanding and confidence existed, our negotiations would be in better hands.  Unfortunately, we are losing because of the jockeying between two Ministers who are trying to vindicate their positions.</P>
      <P>It was the Minister for Fisheries who made the statement about the unilateral conservation measures.  The other Minister gave the impression that he would not lose the kudos he had painstakingly established over a long period to any other Minister.  He got back into the act by commenting on what happened.  If I could be convinced that there was confidence between the two Ministers, I would be much happier.  The public do not believe that this exists and neither do we.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I still say the Taoiseach should clarify who is responsible for negotiations on this issue and who is answerable to this House.  As I said, we do not know, the Taoiseach did not tell us and the Ministers apparently change from day to day.  This Minister said he would announce tough measures to get foreign boats out of Irish waters.  They are not soft words; they were deliberately chosen.  Had he been told by Commissioner Gundelach that they would contemplate action at the European Court?  Did he tell his colleagues in the Council that they proposed to do this in the way he announced this in the newspapers later?  This seems to be the real issue because his colleagues in the Council were amazed to read in the public Press that the Minister for Fisheries was determined to take these conservation <Col N="1594" /> measures.  Commissioner Gundelach then said that this might have to be referred to the European Court. It appears that this was not even mentioned at the meeting.  That is hardly the way to win goodwill in negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Government will have our support to the extent that we realise the difficulties facing them.  The position taken already has helped them to achieve something clear and consistent. We never thought these quotas were workable; we never thought conservation measures announced by the Minister were workable because it was clear they were not.  The Minister made a big show of announcing them, although everybody must have known that they were not workable.  He now knows that himself.  The only workable way is to have an exclusive band subject to licensing arrangements of designated areas for traditional fishing fleets.  We believe that all the Governments concerned, notably the French Government, would take due regard of such positive proposals and that agreement could be reached on that basis.  We believe the Commission would support this as being workable, fair and reasonable and it could be subject to review each year.</P>
    <P>The Government have been jumping from one thing to another, from unilateral conservation to something else.  Eventually they were cut off from their own determined track by a request &ldquo;Will you postpone it again?&rdquo; They blame the House, the public and the fishermen if they are frustrated and confused.  If the Minister can dissipate some of this confusion and frustration, this motion will have done a little good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Minister for Fisheries (Mr. Donegan) Patrick S. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries (Mr. Donegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Gallagher this morning and there is very little I could comment on because he seemed to be confused.  There is no confusion on the part of the Government and it would be a great pity if there was confusion on the part of the nation and the fishermen.  The position is this.  When fisheries are raised at the Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs, then it is the responsibility of <Col N="1595" /> the Minister for Foreign Affairs to state Ireland's case.  The alternative would be for that Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary to absent himself and leave Ireland's case unstated.</P>
      <P>When fisheries is raised by way of resolution, letter or communication from the Commission at the Council of Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries the responsibility falls on the Minister for Fisheries to argue Ireland's case as best he can.  Again, the alternative is to absent himself and leave Ireland's case unstated.  That is the position.  There is no other way in which we can negotiate in the EEC but the Opposition seem determined to spread confusion about this matter. There is no confusion in our minds about this matter.</P>
      <P>If it were a fact that this Government were to be defeated&mdash;but they will not be defeated&mdash;at the forthcoming general election and if Deputy O'Kennedy were Minister for Foreign Affairs and Deputy Gallagher were Minister for Fisheries, they would have to act in like manner.  I, as Minister for Fisheries, cannot go into the meeting of the Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs and make our case there.  That falls to the Minister for Foreign Affairs or his Parliamentary Secretary.  Similarly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs does not come into the Council of Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries and make our case, I do. Ireland will be served by us as best we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having got rid of all that confusion, I now want to refer to a couple of specific matters raised by Deputy Gallagher.  He suggested that the Government were not availing of grants available for the fishing industry from the EEC.  Since 1973 grants totalling £2,750,000 were approved for Irish fishery projects, that is, fishing boats, fish processing and harbour works, from the EEC.  That shows that Deputy Gallagher's statement is entirely incorrect. In 1976 a new development occurred which also has reference to our conduct of EEC negotiations.  In 1976 nearly £300,000 were received by way of compensation for fish withdrawn from the market.  The EEC also agreed to meet part of the cost of <Col N="1596" /> patrolling the new 200-mile fishing limit.  This was the subject of the inclusion of £1.2 million by the Minister for Finance in his budget this year. The fact is that we are conducting our negotiations with the EEC, both on the Foreign Affairs and Fisheries fronts, with success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

      <P>The money will be provided as long as people want to buy the boats.  I am not God Almighty and I cannot transport myself into the year 1979 and back again.  The position at present is that we wish to increase our fleet by 300 boats and double our catch from 75,000 tons to 150,000 tons.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Gallagher's complaint about the research vessel, the <i>Cú Feasa</i> is no longer suitable for use as a research vessel.  During Fianna Fáil days it lingered long and was allowed to get into a state of disrepair.  It spent all its time at the docks as a result of inactivity in Fianna Fáil days.  That is all we can say about the <i>Cú Feasa.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is Fianna Fáil's fault and they were there for a long time.  Provision for a new vessel of 100 feet in beam design at a sum of £300,000 has been included in the Fisheries Vote in this year. Deputy Gallagher is a great man to complain, but he can be assured that the funds available for building new boats this year are adequate and that any suitable fisherman coming to BIM for a grant or loan for a new boat will be accommodated.  In relation to harbours, the Deputy can be assured that almost £2 million will be available for fishery harbour works this year as compared with £850,000 last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in the House last week that I am not satisfied in this regard but that the question is one of loan finance from the Irish banks to BIM for this purpose.  I went on to say that the process of scrutiny in relation to applications of all kinds is slow.  I added that I am making representations to have this process speeded up.  This slowness existed before I came on the scene and it is a feature of the situation.  That is what I said last week and the Deputies opposite can chew on it as long as they like.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Opposition asked for a debate and we carried the fish war, if you like, into their camp by giving it to them today.  They postponed two questions yesterday which, if they were not satisfied, they could have raised on the Adjournment.  However, through the intervention of the Leader of the Opposition, they sought this debate today without going to the Whips' Office to indicate that they wanted it.  Having heard gossip in the corridors to the effect that they would do this, I gave 15 seconds notice to the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would point out that I did not come here to conduct a debate on the basis of question and answer but to reply to the points made.  I have spoken about the step forward we have arranged with the Council of Ministers and the Commission.  We have got a guarantee from the Commission that they will produce a permanent regime policy before 15th April and they have indicated to the Council of Ministers an ultimate deadline for 30th June.  That is of importance and it should be put on record.  We have got to a position whereby the numbers and names of boats will be indicated. This whole matter of protective measures will apply solely to Irish waters.  These matters are difficult&mdash; communication and so on&mdash;and one cannot have them on a plate.  We are not satisfied with the position off the Donegal coast and it will be the duty of our senior officers at two meetings or more with the Council of Ministers, meeting again on Thursday, to try to get subzones 6A, 6 and 7 included&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The nearest they come would be in the order of 20 to 30 miles.  I want to deal with why all this flurry arose among the dovecotes and why we had all this hoohah yesterday about having a debate at all.  I refer to press comment on my relations with the Irish Fishermen's Organisation and I quote from <i>The Irish Independent</i> of March 15th, 1977:</P>
      <P>Unprintable exchanges flew between Fisheries Minister Patrick Donegan and furious fishermen's leaders in Brussels last night.</P>
      <P>I deny categorically that there were any unprintable exchanges or any exchanges at all on my part.  It takes two to make an exchange.  I did not in any way indulge in exchanges.  I now tell the House and the press what occurred in Brussels.  I went to Brussels and before going into the Council of Ministers I had a request from the Irish Fishermen's Organisation to consult with them.  I went downstairs and I met the Chairman, Mr. Joe Murrin, and the Secretary, Mr. Frank Doyle.  I indicated to them what was probably to be gained.  I indicated to them also that at that time before the meeting we were dissatisfied with the position with relation to boxes 6a, 6 and 7.  Mr. Murrin, who is a Donegal man from Killybegs, agreed that he would be very dissatisfied in relation to those boxes, and I went up to do my negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1600" /> It is not possible in Brussels, in the Council of Ministers where there is constant speaking one after another, as we have here on Committee Stage of Bills, by all the member states, to come out and consult with an organisation of fishermen or anybody else involved from the outside, go back in and speak again and come out again. I did my job that day in Brussels over four or five hours as well as I could. Having emerged from that meeting I was informed by a representative of the Government Information Service that a press conference was arranged and that Telefís Éireann required me to give an interview in time for the 1.30 p.m. news.  I immediately gave that press conference and spoke to the interviewer for the 1.30 p.m. news. The interview was brought across to Dublin by wire and put on the news at that time.  Without one moment's delay I then called in the Irish Fishermen's Organisation members, namely Mr. Murrin and Mr. Doyle, who came into the room and I proceeded to indicate to them what had occurred.</P>
    <P>I want the House to understand what the position was then.  From that time on, which was possibly five minutes after I had given my interview to Telefís Éireann and the press, Mr. Murrin and Mr. Doyle were in the position of consulting with me and making representations to me, which representations could be considered by me and transferred immediately to the high level officials who would be dealing with them at meetings before the meeting of Thursday week next.  They had that opportunity to consult with me and they have it from now until next Thursday week.  I am ready, willing and available to consult with the Irish Fishermen's Organisation, the Irish Fish Producers' Organisation, who wrote to me as well yesterday, and with any other group who are genuinely involved in the fishing industry. Having done that and weighed up their representations to me, I am ready to consult with my own officials who will be at the high level meetings and then to bear into the Council of Ministers in Brussels on Thursday week the information given and the representations made to me.  Happily, <Col N="1601" /> the situation today is that Mr. Murrin has been on the phone to my Department, because I was to have been on next Thursday week in Donegal meeting the fishermen.  As far as I know, diplomatic relations are now restored.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear it.  I hope the Minister is not going to be accused of not having contacted outside organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seven minutes in which to make my case.  In relation to outside organisations I will not treat with the Carrigavallen Hop Scotch Society because they have nothing to do with fisheries.  I will deal with any proper fishery body, such as the Irish Fish Producers' Organisation, the Irish Fishermen's Organisation or any body which has an interest in the present negotiations.  If the Opposition want to come to me with their representations and views between now and tomorrow week, I am ready to meet them.  If I feel that those views have helped me and brought this thing a stage further, I will talk to my high level officials who will be at two meetings between this and tomorrow week and if the Opposition's views are worth a hoot I will bring them to the Council of Ministers.  As far as I can see, they are not worth a hoot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to clear the air and to say that the Irish Fishermen's Organisation have just now been on the phone talking to my secretary about the fact that I cannot be in two places at the same time on tomorrow week.  I take it that diplomatic relations are now restored.  I want to refer to the press comment on whether or not there was a certain coldness going out in the plane.  To my knowledge there was no certain coldness at all going out on the plane.  There was a strike in Aer Lingus and we were all heaved into a Monarch aeroplane at Dublin Airport. We got on after long delays and happily set forth for Brussels.  We were scattered all over the plane.  I had no opportunity to talk to Mr. Murrin or Mr. Doyle.  I do not know if any of my officials had.  I have nothing but the hand of friendship to extend to them at all times.  Having arrived in Brussels, as I described, I interviewed <Col N="1602" /> the two gentlemen before I went into the Council of Ministers, indicated my position, did my bargaining for the day, and as soon as was possible for me, because the GIS had organised these press conferences and the interview for the 1.30 p.m. news, gave the up-to-date situation to Mr. Murrin and Mr. Doyle.  That they were frustrated there is no doubt, and they were annoyed.  But I was not and I did not make any exchanges and it takes two to make a heated exchange and to make it unprintable.  Anything I heard&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>After this occurred, and the fishermen were frustrated, I did not see Mr. Murrin or Mr. Doyle until we reached the airport.  When we reached the airport we had a long delay again because of the strike in Aer Lingus.  We had to get a Conair plane to bring us home. It had to be flown from Paris. While we were waiting the duty officer indicated to me, to the Minister for Finance, who was also there, and to the two groups from the Department of Industry and Comalso that we could go into the VIP glass-fronted lounge.  We went in and <Col N="1604" /> sat down and we were served with coffee.  Mr. Murrin and Mr. Doyle came along the passage and I got up and said: &ldquo;Joey, Mr. Doyle, come on into the VIP lounge&rdquo; and they did not come in.  That meant simply that they were frustrated and they had to queue up and get into the plane in the normal way.  But I did succeed in buying myself a few cigars in the duty free shop.  I met Mr. Murrin there and I explained to him that the best value in the duty free shop was a large bottle of White Label Scotch, which was about three bottles full and cost £7.50. Mr. Murrin indicated to me that he wanted for his household some brandy and he was not buying White Label Scotch and we came home on the plane and there were no further words, no heated exchanges, and diplomatic relations are restored today.</P>

      <P>The Commission yesterday put forward to the Council of Ministers <Col N="1571" /> interim proposals designed to limit the intensity of fishing effort in the waters around the Irish coast in the period to 30th June.  The main feature of these proposals is that member states would submit advance fishing plans which would have to be approved by the Commission in consultation with Ireland.  The proposals also provide for quotas in the statistical zones around Ireland: These would permit of an increase of 30 per cent in catches by Ireland while catches by all other countries would be reduced by an estimated 41 per cent in the aggregate compared to 1975.</P>
      <P>We originally refused to consider such a scheme unless the limitation of fishing was applied separately to the subzones contiguous to the Irish coast, and this is now provided for in the proposals.</P>
      <P>Ireland has indicated that for the fishing plans to be acceptable to us they must provide for a substantial reduction of fishing effort by other member states and must be capable of effective enforcement.</P>
      <P>Details of the proposals are to be worked out by the high level working group and the Minister for Fisheries indicated that meantime we would suspend our unilateral measures for restriction of boat sizes until the next Council of Agriculture Ministers which takes place on 25th March.</P>
      <P>Our agreement to consider the revised interim proposals was influenced by the fact that the Commissioner in charge of Fisheries, Vice-President Gundelach gave a firm undertaking to bring forward by mid-April proposals for the definitive revised common fisheries policy with the understanding that the target date for agreement by the Council would be 30th June.  The Minister for Fisheries reiterated in this connection that in the view of the Irish Government this must provide for a coastal band in accordance with our consistent demand.</P>

    <P>It would not generally be appropriate to relate overtime working to potential posts.  Normally, overtime is only undertaken when it is seen as the most effective method of coping with peaks of work and where it would be impractical to take on extra staff.  In the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, for example, where the incidence of overtime is high, substantial regular overtime is required to cater for the sorting of the evening mail which is concentrated within a limited period each day; similar, though smaller peaks, arise daily at other offices of the Department.  Where overtime arises because of vacancies, all reasonable steps are taken to fill such vacancies as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>As a general rule, overtime working is closely monitored to ensure that its cost is kept as low as possible consistent with the need to discharge urgent and necessary work.  Every effort is made to reduce the incidence of overtime where appropriate.</P>
