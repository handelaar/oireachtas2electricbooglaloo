    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The current situation in relation to regional aids in Ireland is as outlined in the statement which I recently made to the Confederation of Irish Industry.  Copies of this statement are available to Deputies. Discussions are continuing between the Commission and member States concerning the establishment of new arrangements to co-ordinate the regional aids of all member States including Ireland.  We are working vigorously to ensure that whatever arrangements are drawn up will take fully into account our special development needs as recognised in Protocol 30 of the Accession Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;technical difficulties&rdquo; relating to export sales relief are twofold. Firstly, the relief applies solely to exports. As I mentioned in my statement, <Col N="1006" /> it has been argued that export aids are not compatible with the EEC Treaty. The argument is that within a common market there can be no exports as such and that it is wrong to apply export sales relief to such trade.  The second difficulty is that export sales relief is not readily measurable.  This is a characteristic that it shares with some of the aids of other member States.  The Commission consider that in order to co-ordinate the regional aids of all member State&mdash;so as to prevent outbidding and to facilitate in particular the less-endowed regions&mdash;it is important to be able to compare these aids.  This is possible only where aids can be measured by reference to a common standard.  Hence the Commission, in consultation with member States, are endeavouring to develop methods of measuring these aids.  While not denying the relevance of these technical considerations, I am anxious to ensure that in our case they do not overshadow what must be our primary focus of attention, that is, our need to promote and attract employment-creating investment.</P>
    <P>Following is the Minister's statement:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Address by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Desmond O'Malley, TD, at the Monthly Council Luncheon Meeting of the Confederation of Irish Industry in Dublin, September 22nd, 1977</i>.</P>
    <P>There has been so much alarm about our State aids system in general and export tax relief in particular over the last few days that I would like to straighten this matter out and make the position as clear to you as I possibly can.</P>
    <P>The main rumours coming out of Brussels were to the effect that the EEC Commission had now decided that export tax relief would have to come to an end from the beginning of next year.  I am pleased to be able to tell you that there is no foundation whatever for that story.  Unfortunately, and I regret very much having to say this, a considerable amount of damage has probably been done already arising out of the mere circulation of these rumours and it would be foolish to <Col N="1007" /> expect that all of this damage will be undone by simply establishing that they were without foundation.  One may speculate about the origin of these stories, but they are clearly not unrelated to the fact that any harm done to us may redound to the advantage of other countries.  I am afraid that this is a factor which has been assuming increasing relevance in recent times especially in view of the disimproved employment situation in Europe and the consequent competition between all countries for mobile industrial projects.</P>
    <P>As you know, I have just seen the two Commissioners mostly concerned with these matters, Commissioner Vouel, who has charge of competition matters and Commissioner Davignon, who is responsible for industrial affairs.  I was glad to find that they were quite taken aback at the alleged &ldquo;leak&rdquo; which had occurred in Brussels and were at pains to assure me that no action of the kind envisaged in that leak would or could be contemplated.  As regards the reference to people having seen a document, they informed me in the clearest terms that not only was there no document of which they were aware but that such a proposal had not even been considered.  The official denial issued yesterday in the name of the Commission is, I think, a good indication of their great anxiety to put matters right.</P>
    <P>In negotiating the Treaty of Accession to the European Communities we went to considerable trouble to get as many safeguards as we could, and particularly provisions designed to ensure that in the working of the Treaty due regard will be had to the weak state of our economy in comparison with other member countries and our great need to press on with our industrial development programme.  One of the most important provisions in this category was Protocol 30 and the associated Declarations which are printed in the Official documentation relating to the Accession Treaty.  I think most of you are familiar with the terms of the Protocol and the Declarations.</P>
    <P>There may be some debate about their juridical effect but so far as we <Col N="1008" /> are concerned they were put there for a purpose and we intend to ensure that they are not ignored.  One of our main objects was to ensure that our system of State aids, including the export tax relief, would persist with the minimum interference so that we could continue to be an attractive location for new industry whether coming from outside the Community or within it.  We were also anxious to ensure that the industries already established in Ireland which were enjoying export tax relief and other aids could continue to make full use of them so that they could expand and prosper.  There are, it is true, certain difficulties of a technical kind relating to export tax relief in as much as it can be argued that export aids are not compatible with the Treaty. A number of people, generally speaking competitors of ours had been drawing attention to this even before we joined the Community.  There is some recognition of this problem in the Protocol and related declarations and it was always understood that export tax relief as well as other aids would continue to be reviewed by the Commission and that at some stage it might be necessary to devise a change which would dispose of the technical difficulty to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear at this stage, however, that there is no question of anyone who, either in the past or in the future, has qualified for export tax relief, losing that right as a result of any change in the system which we may introduce.  It is our intention that these enterprises will continue to qualify for export tax relief up to the expiry date of 1990 which is specified in Irish legislation. Another point I would like to make is that if changes are made, then those who qualify for the new aid system can expect to do as well, and to get as much support, as they do under the present system.  This is something which is recognised in the declarations to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>As required by the provisions of the Treaty of Rome, the examination of the State aid systems of member countries has been going on now for <Col N="1009" /> very many years.  When the Community was expanded to include Ireland, the UK, and Denmark in 1973 this examination system was necessarily extended to us and there have been continuing exchanges on this subject since the date of our accession.  The object which the Commission have in mind is to bring about what they call a &ldquo;co-ordination&rdquo; of State aids throughout the Community.  There was a limited co-ordination in 1971 which, of course, applied to the original six member States.  This was followed by new arrangements drawn up in 1975 for the enlarged Community.  We were satisfied at the time with the 1975 solution in as much as it allowed us to continue with all our State aids, including export tax relief, without any restraint and without having any ceiling imposed upon us.  In the meantime, however, a number of loopholes have lessened its effectiveness considerably.  This has become painfully obvious in more recent times as a number of better-off countries of Europe have exploited the 1975 formula in a way which has involved the process of outbidding to which the Commission strongly objects.</P>
    <P>The 1975 co-ordination was to last for a period of three years and almost a year ago now the negotiations commenced amongst the member States and the Community in order to establish the system which would apply from 1978 onwards.</P>
    <P>These discussions gave rise to quite an amount of difficult technical work as it has not proved easy to find acceptable mechanisms for measuring certain forms of State aid.  This question of measuring and transparency is something to which the Commission attaches great importance as without it, it is extremely difficult to have a meaningful co-ordination with ceilings which can be effectively enforced. These discussions have been going on now for a considerable time and it is to be expected that quite an amount of additional hard work will have to be done at the level of officials before proposals can be submitted to Commissioners and to Ministers.  There can, therefore, be no support for the suggestion <Col N="1010" /> that we were late in tackling the Commission about so-called decisions which were in the pipeline. There was nothing to be late for.</P>
    <P>I would not like to try to establish a precise timetable for the discussions which are to take place from this point onwards.  I think it no harm to say, however, that whatever may have been our position in 1975 we now have a much greater interest in seeing that any co-ordination exercise upon which we may agree will be effective in two respects.  First of all, it must give recognition to the principles enshrined in Protocol 30 by making a clear distinction between the things which the central regions of Europe can do and those which the more disadvantaged areas can do.  We must have a great deal more scope and latitude than the development authorities within the golden triangle of Europe and, indeed, I myself am strongly of the view that the limits which have been agreed for these central regions are altogether too generous.  We will also want to make sure that the loopholes in the 1975 co-ordination solution are fully closed off since it is essential that unfair competition for worth-while industrial projects should not be created by the development agencies in the better-off countries who up to now have had no trouble in putting forward bids which effectively go well beyond the EEC ceilings imposed upon them.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to emphasise that in any negotiations in which we are involved for a 1978 co-ordination we will be taking a very strong line in respect of certain aids provided by other countries which have given rise to strong protests from Irish manufacturers, as they involve unfair competition and appear to be in breach of the Rome Treaty.</P>

      <P>The only economically exploitable deposit of natural gas discovered so far in Irish waters is that off Kinsale.  I am having an investigation carried out into the economic feasibility of making an allocation from this deposit to Dublin and possibly some other centres. Pending consideration in due course of the outcome of this investigation and the possible discovery of further deposits of natural gas, consideration of the question of whether the gas industry in Dublin and other centres should be brought under public ownership would be premature.

      <P>No.  I am fully aware of what the Deputy has mentioned.  In regard to the ESB, gas has been allocated in the Cork area. An official of this Department and an official from the Department of <Col N="1014" /> Finance, with a firm of consultants were asked by the Minister at the end of September to study the use of natural gas in Dublin and to report back to him within two months.  The longer term question of dealing with future finds of natural gas has been deferred until such time as the Dublin aspect has been fully considered.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>The Nuclear Energy Board whose function it is to advise me on nuclear energy matters and who maintain a close surveillance of the radioactivity levels in the Irish Sea, state that the current levels do not represent a hazard to the public in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that liquid effluents containing very small quantities of radioactivity are discharged into the Irish Sea from Britain, principally from the Windscale plant, but I have been assured by the Nuclear Energy Board that no highly radioactive liquid wastes or solid radioactive wastes are discharged. Furthermore, no dumping of <Col N="1016" /> radioactive material from ships is carried out in the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>I am further advised that radioactivity levels in the Irish Sea are constantly monitored by the United Kingdom authorities.  In addition, a limited monitoring programme undertaken by the Irish National Radiation Monitoring Service in recent years has now been taken over and expanded by the Nuclear Energy Board to include not only radioactivity measurements of the water of the Irish Sea but also of the fish and other possible food chains. The board have the co-operation of the Department of Fisheries in the latter activity.</P>
    <P>My Department are fully aware of the press publicity and various comments on the potential effects of radiation on fish in the Irish Sea, but I have been advised by the Nuclear Energy Board that preliminary results of radioactivity measurements on samples of fish recently obtained by the board from catches in the Irish Sea confirm the data obtained from the United Kingdom authorities from similar fish samples landed in the United Kingdom. The board have assured me that these results show that the dose rate arising from current radioactivity in the Irish Sea is well within the safe limits recommended by the International Commission for Radiation Protection and does not therefore present a hazard to the public.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to advert to the fact that all releases of radioactivity into the environment are subject to regulations conforming to recognised international standards, for example the recommendations of the International Commission for Radiation Protection and an EEC Directive for the protection of members of the public from the dangers of radiation.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 19 together.  The present price control arrangement for petroleum products is suited to this country in the short term because we benefit from the results of competition between oil companies in Britain.  It will be recalled that in July last as a result of developments in Britain petroleum prices here were reduced. For the time being, I do not propose, therefore, to change the arrangement but I am continuing to keep it under review.</P>

As part of the terms of reference the consultants engaged in the study have been requested to <Col N="1027" /> examine the prices of a representative sample of motor vehicle models in the Republic and Northern Ireland and to identify and report on the reasons for differences in price levels where these are found to exist.  Arrangements are also being made for a study of comparative prices of a wide range of grocery products in Dublin, Belfast and Liverpool.

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals for informal consumer tribunals can best be considered in the context of the recommendations made in Chapter IV of the National Consumer Advisory Council Report of December, 1974 for consumer arbitration and consumer complaints boards.  As the Deputy is aware, two Bills giving effect respectively to certain recommendations in Chapters I and II of the report have been in the House, and in one of them provision is made for the office of Director of Consumer Affairs.  Both because I would first wish to see exactly what powers and functions will be given to the director <Col N="1036" /> by the Consumer Information Bill in its final form, and because the office resources at my disposal would not permit of my advancing the two Bills as rapidly as I would wish if I were simultaneously to attempt to deal with a further chapter of the report, I must defer for some time yet decisions in relation to Chapter IV and the related question of informal consumer tribunals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question refers to the informal consumer tribunals to deal with consumer complaints.  I assume the Deputy has in mind some kind of an honest broker body which would attempt to achieve voluntary settlements of disputes between consumers and traders but whose rulings would have no legal force whatever but merely such persuasive powers as the standing of the informal tribunal would give them.  If such bodies were thought useful, and if the Department of Finance would provide the necessary money, it would be comparatively easy to set them up, no legislation being necessary.  It would have to be shown first, however, that voluntary bodies with no power to find in law would be sufficiently effective to justify the expenditure of the time and money they could entail.  Furthermore, presumably there would be no question of setting them up if statutorily constituted bodies with legal powers were to be established.  It is necessary, therefore, to consider the NCAC proposals before thinking of setting up informal consumer tribunals.</P>

While the IDA are aware of the need for further industrial development in this area they consider the employment situation in these towns to be relatively satisfactory and have not therefore included them in their current factory programme. However, the IDA are negotiating the purchase of an additional site of approximately 23 acres at Mallow which will be promoted for industrial development.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary agreed, in response to an earlier question, that the reason there had been reductions in petrol prices here was because of active competition existing in the United Kingdom would she not agree that a retail display order would, as it has done in the United Kingdom, give more information to consumers as to the relevant prices at different outlets? Would she not agree that consumers would then be encouraged to shop around?  Would she not agree to introducing a similar order here?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, at present we have a Maximum Prices Petrol (No. 3) Order, 1977, which came into operation on 15th July.  I agree we have no prices display order but in the United Kingdom maximum retail prices for petrol were fixed up to 19th December, 1974, when the order in force then was revoked.  Therefore, it became necessary for the United Kingdom to operate a prices display order.  As we still have the Maximum Prices Petrol Order it is not the intention of the Minister at present to make a petrol prices display order.</P>

      <P>In January, 1972, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards were asked for their observations on the recommendation of the National Prices Commission that a consumer research and testing unit be established within the institute.  In August, 1973, the institute indicated that as a body primarily serving industry they had been at considerable pains to build up an image of service to the industrial sector which they thought might be undermined by their taking on the role of watchdog for the consumer.  The then Minister endorsed that view in anticipation of the institute putting it forward.  The testing facilities of the institute are for the most part primarily intended as a service to manufacturers. However, for a number of years a successful consumer complaint service has been operated by the institute using these facilities.  The Deputy will realise that the institute are autonomous and, therefore, there can be no question of the Government formally directing the institute to set up such a centre.  It can be taken that if the Minister was to tell the institute that he wanted such a centre set up it would be done.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Thursday evening I said I had certain reservations about the effectiveness of this Bill which appears to be more of a cosmetic device than a real attempt to contribute to the solution of our problems. The setting up of this new Department by itself makes it appear at <Col N="1068" /> first sight as if this Government are dynamic and are about to do something about our economic problems. Looking deeper, this Bill appears to set out to establish a Ministry which can act as a launching pad for the current incumbent of the office to involve himself in almost any activity in the area of Government.</P>
      <P>The aims and functions of the new Department as set out in the Bill are at very best very vague and at worst meaningless.  They read like a list of platitudes which any politician would not wish to spell out.  As I said, this Department looks as if it could turn out to be merely a public relations exercise rather than a Department that can achieve any real meaning in economic planning and development. I admit the Minister may argue at the Cabinet table to make his point and might get reasonable agreement there, but when these matters are referred back to the heads of Departments, changes may be made.  This is a weakness in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister should be given a great deal more power.  Again, it will be left to the Department of Finance to chart the economic course and the ideas of the new Department may or may not be implemented.  This worries me and most people on this side of the House.  Over the past few years I have called for an economic plan because such a plan is very important.  However, in itself a plan does not solve these problems.  If we expect that a White or Green Paper brought out by this Department will have any effect on solving our problems, we will be in for a bitter disappointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Department were given more powers they could and would be a useful weapon in tackling our economic problems.  They could be even more useful if Ministers did not rely solely on the advice of their civil servants but had their own experts for developing specific policies.  That is not saying that what civil servants have to contribute is wrong or bad but I believe if we are to make progress Ministers should have impartial advisers. These experts could be a liaison group within all Departments and would help in the formulation of <Col N="1069" /> policy.  As I said last Thursday, the Minister could find himself in a very isolated position, something I am sure he does not wish to happen.  That is why I believe outside advisers would be the best means for transmitting ideas into this new Department.</P>
    <P>I hope this Department will be successful.  I always advocated forward economic planning to ensure job creation and the development of our resources in an orderly way.  This can be done only by a Department such as this.  The pitfalls here are great because of its lack of power.  Time will tell whether the Minister can cope with this or not.  On reading this Bill, its powers appear to be rather nebulous with no real authority.  It has been said that it will be a vehicle for the Department of Finance to operate and manipulate. It has also come to my notice that some of the staff required for this Department from the Department of Finance were not forthcoming.  Does this signal the future of this Department? Will it be in the strangle-hold of the Department of Finance?  If it is, it will not succeed.  This is where the character of the Minister will manifest itself.  If the Minister is a man of strong will and character, he can make a real Department of this.  It would be a pity if the Minister failed because basically this is a good idea but, as I said earlier, this Bill appears to be a sort of a cosmetic or public relations exercise to create the impression that the new Government will be dynamic and will solve all our problems by a wave of the proverbial magic wand.  It will take tenacity and the best brains available to this Department to make it work and the Minister should not settle for less.  If second best is being offered, the Minister should go outside the ambit of the Civil Service to recruit staff which he believes can do the job.</P>
    <P>I have very strong reservations regarding this Bill but I wish the Minister and his new Department well.  The Bill should be drastically improved to give this Department more authority. I hope the reform in the public service will not stop with the establishment of this new Department.  I hope to see fairly radical reform in the public service <Col N="1070" /> over the next number of years. In any organisation reform should be an on-going process to ensure that we get the best value for money spent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is necessity for more Ministers because of the amount of work that has to be done.  There are many things a Minister can do that nobody else can whether it is attending the opening of a factory or work of a more serious nature.</P>
      <P>We are all hidebound by the Department of Finance.  That is the Department with the purse strings whether we like it or not.  No matter what Minister we have in this position, we must negotiate first with the Department of Finance which will decide whether or not a project we want to develop is sound and how it should be developed. If the Minister for Finance is dissatisfied, he can go to the Cabinet and let the Cabinet decide by majority whether or not the business that is to be done will be done and whether the money that is to be spent shall or shall not be spent.  That is not to say that the Department of Finance is like Mr. Micawber except that instead of always waiting for something to turn up they are waiting for something to turn down. The Department of Finance has to be of that nature.</P>
      <P>We must be progressive and we must look to the future.  There is a need for this new Department although I have my misgivings.  About 10 or 15 years ago Deputy Blaney is said to have refused such a Department because he felt that it had no teeth.  Deputy Blaney did not want the sort of Department we are now talking about. I feel that this Department is necessary but we will have to wait and see how the new Minister will deal with it.  We will see whether or not it knits into the whole fabric of Government as covered by the other Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him and his staff every success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years, as a relatively junior member of the Dáil, I have repeatedly called for the reform not only of our Parliamentary structures but of our Governmental structures.  I have felt <Col N="1071" /> that no man is capable of the kind of mental gymnastics required in the isolated role of the Taoiseach in relation to the other Cabinet members, but particularly in relation to his capacity, no matter how competent he or she may be, no matter how good he or she may be in the general economic sphere, to assimilate the multifarious strategies and dilemmas which the Cabinet may frequently face.  There-fore, if the Taoiseach wants to have a Minister who can take a longer view and can evaluate the respective merits of the different strategies put forward by competing Ministers for the common breadbasket held by the Minister for Finance, he is perfectly entitled to have such a Minister.</P>
    <P>Was this ministerial portfolio shaped for Deputy O'Donoghue or did the Minister finish up with a portfolio specifically here for him?  One is not quite sure which part of the egg comes first but we can rest assured that in Ireland, no matter what part comes first, we politicians tend to predict gloom and failure and we almost relish the prospect that some Department particularly a new Department will not succeed.  I hope none of us in the Opposition or in the media will fall into that trap in relation to this Department. It is a national <i>malaise</i>; many of our people almost relish the prospect of failure.</P>
    <P>In the long term it remains to be seen whether the Department will prove to be an innovative and dynamic segment of Cabinet strategy.  We do not know and we can only hope that the decision taken has been the correct one.  In the remainder of this year and as the budget strategy unfolds it will become evident what real muscle or influence the new Department will exert on its shaping. That will be the first criteria of assessment of the Department's role and influence.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that there has obviously been a desire for a change and an improvement in parliamentary structures.  When one considers this Department, together with the proposed Ministers of State, one can see an effort being made to restructure the framework of Cabinet decision-making. <Col N="1072" /> However, some people seem to be of the impression, particularly those in the media, that the act of restructuring of itself brings about dynamic policies.  One has to distinguish sharply between structure and its purpose.</P>
    <P>I remember in 1965 being at a function with the new Minister when the question of investment in education was being discussed.  I remember well some of the points made then for a restructuring of education.  Somebody asked: what was the very purpose of education, when many of us had to sit back and think precisely what we were talking about.  There-fore, one has to ask: precisely what is the purpose of the change proposed?  As yet it is rather vague. One can only hope&mdash;and one can do so with goodwill and with a sense of co-operation from the Opposition&mdash; that that sense of purpose will become evident.  Anybody can create a sense of change by running round the country making speeches.  I have been doing that for approximately eight or nine years and I have seen nothing very much happen or change in terms of my influence.  Indeed, one could imagine the new Minister spending the rest of his portfolio time analysing the state of the nation in various parts of the country but it is the reality or actual degree of change that counts.  Therefore, I sound that cautionary note.  Likewise, I would urge it in relation to the obsession or pre-occupied concern of the Tánaiste in relation to the concept of the Aireacht.</P>
    <P>One can swallow Devlin and re-gurgitate it in half a dozen forms.  Yet one might not necessarily succeed in changing anything because what matters are the actual decisions taken by the Cabinet in the framework of policy.  That brings me back to a man who did not have very much time for the concept of the Aireacht or for the concept of a new Department for Economic Planning and Development, a former Taoiseach, Seán Lemass.  He got things done in no uncertain manner.  He transformed our economic and social structures without having to resort to a paraphernalia of structures many politicians seem to <Col N="1073" /> regard as a panacea for actual decisions in relation to alternatives open to them.</P>
    <P>I congratulate my constituency colleague on his elevation.  I can assure him that we welcome the decision of the Government in that respect.  We were not then quite sure of the precise strategy in terms of the functions and role of the Department.  However, as an act of good faith and goodwill we were quite prepared to see the new Department emerge.  There is no doubt that any politician looking through the detailed functions of the new Department in the Bill will find it evident that there has been some interesting by-play, power play and political shenanigans between the various Departments as to the precise formulation of the chapters and sections of the Bill.  That is inevitable; in the long term I do not think it is that important. For example, a lot might depend on the extent to which one might draw one analogy.</P>
    <P>The new Minister for Economic Planning and Development spoke recently about the cost of the health services.  If I know the Minister for Health and Social Welfare he will have his hands full influencing the strategy of the delivery of the health care of this country.  The Minister for Finance is not a man who brooks being told about the strategy he should follow in relation to Government expenditure. As such one can only wish the Minister well in term of, say, influencing the cost/benefit of our health expenditure.  Likewise I can imagine other Ministers having battles royal with the Minister, in the future, in his evaluation of their respective performances.  This is the stuff of Government. It is the function of a Cabinet.  At least the new Minister has one important asset, one I notice he has already committed to the Tánaiste in relation to the future leadership of the party&mdash;he has got his vote in the Cabinet and in the Parliamentary Party.  Perhaps that is more important than structure in terms of the Bill itself because he is one of 15 members of the Cabinet who will take final decisions and, in that respect, I wish him well also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1074" /> The Bill, of itself, is not very enlightening. We must await the emergence of the precise role of the new Department in the future.  We must also await the extent to which they will recruit staff within other Departments or indeed from outside and the emergence of outline plans in the New Year.  Then in a more sober, rational and objective sense we will be able to come to a conclusion as to whether this much thought of exercise is producing the goods.  As the changes in economic investment and social policy unfold we will be in a better position to ascertain whether this exercise has been one of cosmetic politics, which I sincerely hope will not be the case.  I am not suggesting it will be.  But we must let time determine whether it will constitute a real contribution to the quality of our lives.</P>

      <P>I have listened to a couple of speakers already.  I am delighted to note the way this Bill has been received by the Opposition.  I have always had the feeling that, when something good is done for our people, the attitude taken is that it does not much matter who does it.  I have been very pleased to hear the good wishes extended to the new Minister and his Department.  However, I can sympathise with the Minister also because his will be an enormous task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my four years in this House the biggest fault I had to find with the former Government was that there was insufficient forward planning in their day-to-day decision-making, something which is absolutely essential today.  That will be the job of the new Minister.  I heard remarks passed here some evenings ago about their being too many Ministers.  There is a certain amount of work that any man can undertake.  I have said this about previous as well as present Ministers&mdash; any Minister holding a certain ministerial post has an enormous task to perform.  A man cannot be expected to look after everything.  He will not be able to do his job if he has too much on his plate.  Since we entered the EEC the Ministers who are involved <Col N="1075" /> in Community work have too much on their plate.  They cannot give enough time to solving problems which the ordinary man who is not so much involved can see some way of solving.</P>
    <P>The Department for Economic Planning and Development will have the most important task, namely, they will have to see what can be done to solve the huge unemployment problem. They will have to see where we are going in Europe and they will have total responsibility in matters of economic planning.  All of us should wish the person in charge of this work all the luck in the world.  Some people have commented on the back-up services. The important thing here is that the person in charge of the Department is a Minister of State.  He is not a faceless man, the Department are not a faceless Department.  They are being set up to do a certain job and if the person in charge does not do it, he puts his head on the block in this House.  It is a big challenge for any person and I am glad to see that it has been received very well here.</P>
    <P>I have confidence in the future.  I know it is important that those in charge should not be over-loaded with work.  Since I became a Member of this House, and especially in the short time that my party have been in government, I have realised that Ministers are overloaded with work.  No matter how talented or good a person may be, only a certain amount of work can be done.  Everyone in this House should give the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and his Department every encouragement and help in their important work.  I was glad to hear Deputy Desmond say that people should not prophesy failure.  Let us look to the future and let us hope that the Department will not be a failure.  Let us hope they will get employment for young people and that they will be able to tell us where we are going.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an enormous task facing him and there must be complete co-operation between him and the Minister of Finance.  I have no doubt that co-operation exists and with goodwill between them I have no <Col N="1076" /> doubt that we will produce the goods which we promised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few comments on this legislation arising from my personal experience as a Minister during a very short but also a very difficult period and at a time when I believe almost every Minister was overloaded with work. I welcome this legislation on two counts.  First, I welcome the idea of a planning and development unit of some kind and, secondly, I welcome the proposal to provide sufficient people to do the job that has to be done.</P>
      <P>It is not generally understood that an enormous extra load has been placed on the backs of certain Ministers as a result of EEC membership. It is just not possible to do the job as it should be done and carry that extra load.  The Government are right in providing relief.  I think it would have been done during our period in office were it not for the fact that we were asking all the people to tighten their belts and to work harder during a very difficult period and there was a danger that it might be misunderstood if we provided extra help for our Ministers.  However, that was not a good enough reason not to have done what is being done now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to wish the new Minister every success in his important Department.  It is vital that we plan ahead.  As a former Minister, I want to make it clear that there was no shortage of plans in my Department.  I worked very hard to produce plans and I was aware that the industry had reached only 50 per cent or 60 per cent of its potential.  I brought in all the people who could advise me.  A Minister cannot be inspired himself, he cannot do the job of planning and deciding what should be done in the interests of the industry for which he is responsible, unless he brings in people who are in a position to help him.  I did just that.  I had all the plans in the world and the best advice available in an area where we knew there was an enormous development potential but there was simply no money to <Col N="1077" /> do it.  There was a limited amount of money and that had to be spent in the best way possible in the interests of the country as a whole.  No matter what we say, that will be the limiting factor in this instance also.</P>
    <P>If I were asked what was the right thing to do, if I would do as the Government are doing, namely, setting up a new Department, quite frankly, I would not do that.  Recently we set up an extra Department that has been shown to be a further road block to development.  I am referring to the Department of the Public Service.  The Minister for Finance in his statement on the legislation before the House said this will give him more time to spend on the task of reforming the public service.  If I had that task in mind, the first thing I would do is abolish the Department of the Public Service.  It was just setting up another expensive unit and it never appeared to me to be anything but a further road block, interfering in the work of other Departments.  A Minister should not be in charge of a Department if he is not capable of managing it.  By managing a Department I mean he should be capable of assessing the information coming to him from his officials and he should be able to decide on the best and most appropriate action to take.</P>
    <P>With regard to reforming the public service, there is a further point I should like to make.  A certain amount of money is provided for a Department when the Estimates are discussed and when the budget is decided and there should be no further discussion or interference from the Department of Finance, the Department of the Public Service or any other Department in relation to the way that money is disposed of subsequently.  There are experienced officials in Departments and it should be left to the Minister in charge to decide how the money should be spent.  There should not be the kind of frustrating interference that all of us experience in government from officials who have no direct connection with the Department.  I fear the new Minister will suffer the same frustration. He will go to endless trouble planning our economic development, <Col N="1078" /> he will have discussions with all the Ministers, and all this will meet with quite a lot of opposition mainly from the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I believe the right thing to have done would have been to set up such a unit directly under the Taoiseach's Department.  Every Minister in Government fights his own corner for limited resources.  The Taoiseach, more than any Minister, is concerned with the overall Government.  He should be very close to this business.  I believe the proposals for economic development should come to the Government with the Taoiseach's full knowledge of what is to be proposed.  It then has a much better prospect of survival and of getting the necessary finance to implement those plans than it is likely to get if the person in charge of that Department is just another Minister.</P>
    <P>There will be many restrictions when all this planning and research is done, and they are not financial restrictions alone.  We are now restricted in what we can do because of our membership of the EEC.  We have to be careful not to give a false impression that we can set out on our own, make all the economic decisions, provide all the assistance we consider is desirable and get away with this under the EEC rules and regulations.  We cannot do this.  Before the election I heard some of the Ministers telling the electorate all the subsidisation they would provide and all the things they would do about various sectors of the economy when the Government was changed. They cannot do those things under EEC rules.  This is election time stuff and one can understand that extravagant statements are made at times like that.</P>
    <P>One can have the best plans in the world but if one does not get the wholehearted co-operation of various groups in the country&mdash;I put the trade union movement at the head of the league&mdash;there is no hope of bringing those plans to fruition.  If there is not general agreement that things like unofficial strikes can be abolished there is very little hope for the sort of development all of us want to see.  I know this is the responsibility of Government. I do not want to stray too far <Col N="1079" /> from what we are directly considering, the setting up of a separate Department for Economic Planning and Development. Every Department should have a planning section.  There should be people engaged on that work all the time, and perhaps there might be a way of co-ordinating this.  My belief having had a short experience in Government, is that the best way to do this is not to separate this into a new Government Department and under a separate Minister but under a Junior Minister attached to the Taoiseach's Department.</P>
    <P>The setting up of this new Department is a very significant move.  We should all be concerned about the outcome of it.  We want to see it succeeding.  We have limited resources which must be spent in the best possible way in the national interest.  I hope the approach made by the Government is the correct one.  It is not my approach but I think it is a better one than not setting up such a unit in Government because there is a great need for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This, as everybody says, is a very important Bill in many ways.  I am disappointed that the Minister has not taken this opportunity to review the very complicated question of the dynamics of power in a Cabinet and in a working democracy. I do not think anybody will deny&mdash; it does not matter which party are in power&mdash;that whatever was true of my time 30 years ago about the efficiency of a Cabinet, it has become much more complicated now.  Ministers have such greatly increased responsibility dealing with all the problems which the EEC has brought, trying to watch developments in Europe and trying to keep domestic policy in accord with European policy, that it must be a very difficult job for any person to be a Minister in a modern Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My impression of Cabinet work is that it was extremely efficient then.  It is beyond my imagination what it must be like now.  As Deputy Clinton says, if there are ten, 15 or 20 members in a Cabinet, each of them will naturally be concerned about the way <Col N="1080" /> he does his job.  A Minister will not easily leave aside his ambitions in the interest of some other Department.  In theory this is what we are meant to do in this kind of situation but it is very hard if one is in Education or Health or Social Welfare to admit that one's Department is not quite as important as the other Department and that how it operates is not quite as important to society, to the State or to the community one is trying to serve as a politician.  Consequently this is an extraordinarily stressful situation for any member of any Cabinet and this is where the head of the Cabinet, the Taoiseach, has such a particularly difficult job.</P>
    <P>While that is all true, very much more important is the extraordinary inefficiency of the process of Cabinet Government.  It is wonderfully conscientious and careful to see that everybody's point of view is considered and discussed but I recall occasions when we discussed an issue for a fortnight or three weeks and sometimes even for a month or longer because everybody had to be heard and, as far as possible, everybody was to be satisfied.  While that is a wonderful theory of the process of democracy in action, it must become an extremely inefficient process. Looking at it as it then was, I was particularly impressed by its inefficiency.  I was particularly fortunate in that because of the moneys in the Sweep fund I was my own Minister for Finance and, therefore, made relatively little reference to the Minister for Finance, certainly in the early years.  I had the greatest sympathy for some of my collegues in their attempts to get anything through in the face of opposition&mdash;conscientious opposition most of the time, I think.</P>
    <P>There were the additional stresses of which the present Minister would not be conscious to anything like the same extent and this is something that has exercised my mind over the years.  I refer to the multi-party situation in Cabinet.  This adds enormously to these conflicting aspirations and ambitions, not only of individuals but of the different groups, again adding to the inefficiency.  I would have thought that all of this would have occurred to the <Col N="1081" /> Minister, who has very much longer service than I had as a working member of a Cabinet, because there is no doubt that the whole idea of western democracy is very hard pressed at present and is very much under question, not simply because it is predominantly concerned with the attempt to operate monopoly-capitalist type private enterprise systems of government.  I do not think that is entirely the reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Browne, this is a very limited Bill dealing with the establishment of a new Department of Economic Planning and Development.  I am afraid the Deputy is going very wide of the purpose of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not develop that point but I still think it is important that the Minister who is to be given charge of this Department should be given a reasonable chance of success and should be in a position to influence policy and do so speedily.  My case is that I feel a certain sympathy for the Minister because they have left the whole Cabinet process much as it is, not changed in any fundamental way. We have to bear in mind that this is a new Minister who is in Cabinet for the first time and someone who has had this experience should put it at his disposal, so that he can be given the optimum chance of making a success of his Department.  This is important background information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the Minister's speech, we learned very little.  To me it was like looking at the old thimble-rigging people on a racecourse.  One could look at a man's face and listen to what he said and watch his hands but nine times out of ten one would be wrong in one's decision as to under which thimble the pea was.  I think that that is necessarily so in this kind of situation, taking the politics of it into consideration. Deputy O'Donoghue, who is to be the man in charge, has given us a fair indication that he is an independent-minded individual, extremely ambitious, able&mdash;if I am not being presumptuous&mdash;in his own sphere of activity.  I do not agree with his basic political philosophies but he is a determined person.  The struggle for the kind of Bill we have here must have <Col N="1082" /> been a formidable one between the Minister for Finance and the proposed Minister and between the Departments, particularly the Department of Finance.  All of us who have had anything to do with that Department know it to be a notoriously power-loving, power-hugging Department.  It must have been a very difficult thing for the Department of Finance, not to mention the Minister, to contemplate a serious rival in the whole Cabinet process.</P>
    <P>Most people will want to know whether Deputy O'Donoghue is to become a new bottleneck.  Is he to become an extension to the bottleneck we all knew in Government but which we considered the Department of Finance to be during attempts to get anything through?  Is that to be his function?</P>
    <P>In regard to the terms of the Bill, you cannot honestly say that they have avoided what the Minister said in his speech, &ldquo;... the creation of an extra layer or layers of Government should be avoided because it would in all probability exacerbate the existing problems.&rdquo; This, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, is what I was talking about &mdash;the existing problems which were not dealt with at all by the Minister, the problems of the conflict of opinions, ambitions, aspirations and policy attitudes, which must go on even in a single-party Cabinet.</P>
    <P>What will the new Minister's position be?  Has he, like so many people in the past, got office without power?  If he has office without power &mdash;and I find this difficult to believe considering the kind of person we are talking about&mdash;then what is the purpose of the exercise?  Is this simply a compromise by the Minister for Finance because this individual was elected and promises were made about the introduction of planning, or will he insist on being a man who has office and power?  If the Department of Finance are successfully challenged for some of the enormous power that they have, what will the repercussions be within the Cabinet?  To what extent will the new Minister be able to insist on the solutions he seeks to put forward to the Government?  It is impossible to be quite certain from the <Col N="1083" /> introduction to the Minister's speech which reads:</P>
    <P> First of all, their general remit will be to promote and co-ordinate economic and social planning for the development of the economy including the co-ordination of plans for the different sectors and regions. </P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton spoke about the difficulty of serious planning in a society such as ours where one has annual budgets, where one has elections at irregular intervals, where one is not sure if one will have five years in office.  They are reasonably sure on this occasion but in the past that has not been so.  Deputy Clinton mentioned the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention the farmers.  To what extent can the Minister plan with our kind of socially unstructured farming community except by price incentives?  What hope has the Minister with industries? Unless the money is right they will not greatly concern themselves as they have no social interest in society.  How is the Minister going to make realistic plans in that sort of situation? He cannot redirect the needs of society.  Whether there is a need for tractors or agricultural implements he cannot do anything about it.  I recall that that happened during the first Coalition.  Marshall Aid money came in and we wanted it to be spent on practical things such as ploughs.  Unfortunately, the only things on which it could be spent were consumer goods of one kind or another.  At that time the great thing was nylon stockings, lipsticks and so on, a terrible waste of money.  The idea that you can plan in this kind of economy is sheer fantasy.  The Minister is not even able to say for how long he is planning because he will not be the Minister then.  In my own case I was able to plan for a five-to eight-year period and spent accordingly&mdash;£30 million.  That seems to be the only way in which you can have realistic planning except where public spending is concerned, and we find that these Governments do not want to indulge in public spending.</P>
    <P>Whatever real power the Minister <Col N="1084" /> has, he is the only one that knows it.  He may not have as much as he thinks.  A couple of years, from now he will know how much power he has in this kind of free enterprise society.  It may not be worth more than the paper on which it is written.  Is the planning to be carried out in consultation with each of the other Ministers in Government as a preliminary to submission to the Minister for Finance or is it to be submitted to the Minister for Finance simultaneously by this subordinate Minister? Do the Departments of Finance and of Economic Planning and Development consider the questions together?  If the Minister meets his Cabinet colleagues, considers their programmes and attempts to slot them into an overall scheme, does he then submit the scheme to the Department of Finance for consideration or does it go straight to the Government? Is there consultation between the Ministers for Finance and for Economic Planning and Development all the time when the latter is trying to hammer out a concerted plan with his Cabinet colleagues?  You could envisage a position where the Minister for Economic Planning and Development worked extremely hard to create a plan which the Minister for Finance could veto.  Has the Minister for Finance power to veto such a plan or has the Minister for Economic Planning and Development power to go straight to the Cabinet? Must he have the authority of the Minister for Finance to present his ideas to the Government?</P>
    <P>Has the Minister any real executive power?  What is the process whereby each Minister submits his proposals and at what stage, as Truman said, does the buck stop?  Does it stop with the Minister for Finance or does it stop with the Minister for Economic Planning and Development?  Will the Minister for Economic Planning and Development be planning within a great overall figure?  This is something that will have to be decided, but where and by whom will it be decided?  What kind of submissions will be involved in reaching this decision?  Is economic planning a broad blueprint of the kind <Col N="1085" /> of programme which the community should adopt and send back along the line or is it more haphazard?  Do the subordinate members of the Cabinet submit proposals involving local government, communications, roads, education, public spending, industry and commerce and so on?  How can decisions be arrived at unless the broad blueprint is submitted within a fixed global figure?  These are intricacies of planning which I do not understand, but it would be interesting to hear from the Minister what conclusions may have been reached in regard to these kinds of considerations.</P>
    <P>Personally, I was once in the wonderful position of being in complete charge, of knowing everything that was going on in the sphere in which I was involved but my involvement then was with what would be only a tiny proportion of the type of financial problem being faced now.  There are now more than 20 people involved each of whom will be presenting what he or she believes to be the ideal plan for the relevant Departments. These plans have to be analysed and costed before decisions are reached. Obviously, the Department controlling the money make the final decision about planning.  We want to hear from the Minister whether it will be the Department of Finance or the Department of Economic Planning and Development who will have the final say.</P>
    <P>I have considerable respect for Deputy O'Donoghue, for his determination and his self assurance.  He must be quite a tough customer in negotiations at Cabinet level.  But for a long time the Department of Finance have been in control of the purse strings and they have defeated most of their protagonists through the years.  Has the new Minister any reason to believe that he will succeed in this very important job?</P>
    <P>Will it be his responsibility to tell a Minister that his scheme cannot go ahead?  Will he be the one to have to say to various Ministers that their schemes might be accepted next year or the year after but not this year? Such unpleasant tasks would not help him very much in the popularity stakes <Col N="1086" /> in the Cabinet and certainly would not help him very much in regard to the possible leadership of the party.  These considerations are all involved in this question.  We are all politicians and that is why the background information would be fascinating.  However, one will not be given such information. What is at stake here is the leadership of a great political party.  If Deputy O'Donoghue is successful, obviously his position within the party will be tremendously powerful, but if he fails he will be dismissed.  However, that is none of my business.  My only interest in this question is which of the two Ministers concerned I would prefer to see succeeding as the decision-maker. That is something about which each of us reaches a private decision. I do not know enough about the Minister for Economic Planning and Development to hope that he might be the one to win this great argument which undoubtedly has taken place in the various Departments and in the Cabinet and which, in addition, has been at the centre of the Taoiseach's mind in relation to the years ahead.</P>

      <P>On this Bill I am asking which of the Ministers will undertake the decisions in relation to planning?  This planning will influence what happens in respect of unemployment, in respect of the health service and of education and so on.  It involves questions of what will happen to the whole status of our people.  That is why that struggle is so important to us.  Although the question is not one of who heads Fianna Fáil, all of that is implicit in the enigmatic few words which the Minister gave us by way of his introductory speech, a speech which, as I have said already, was very much lacking in regard to the kind of discussion into which the <Col N="1087" /> House should have been led on this very important subject.</P>
      <P>The question before us concerns the whole democratic idea in our society and of societies in most of western Europe because at the heart of all this is the success or failure of the Ministers in the Cabinet.  If, ultimately, this Bill is merely the raw material of a continuing and increasingly bitter civil war between two powerful opponents at the centre of the Cabinet, it will stultify all the activity of the entire Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Therefore, personalities are unimportant but the success or failure of this Ministry will determine the economic policies of the Government and may determine the success or failure of whether young people will continue to concern themselves with this tedious, prolonged but very wonderful process of parliamentary government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to congratulate those Deputies who made their maiden speeches in the course of this debate, not least of whom was my colleague, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>I have been very interested in and to some extent impressed with the debate, particularly with the rather shorter contributions we had today which gave some interesting and revealing views from former Ministers of different previous Governments.  I shall come to those later, but first I should deal with what seems to be the main point of criticism in so far as the Bill is concerned.  While the setting up of this Department was welcomed by almost every Deputy who spoke, it was said that it should have control in regard to the allocation of expenditure if it were to have teeth.  In most cases the definition of whether it would have teeth or power lay in the question of whether it would have control over expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fascinated by this argument which is merely a reflection, particularly so far as the Fine Gael Deputies are concerned, of a view put forward fairly trenchantly by the Leader of Fine Gael when he announced the <Col N="1088" /> names of the Fine Gael front bench as reported in <i>The Irish Press</i> on Thursday, 15th September, 1977.  I quote:</P>
    <P> He did not believe that economic planning and finance could be separated successfully, and already he had heard that this division in Government Departments was causing &ldquo;great tension and difficulties&rdquo;. After studying the British arrangements some years ago he had come to the conclusion that the planning section which did not control finance did not work. </P>
    <P>That theme in one way or another was put forward by quite a number of Deputies.  If one accepts that view there is no logical way in which one can support this Bill.  I wonder why the Fine Gael spokesman, Deputy P. Barry, announced earlier on that they were not opposing the Bill.  Indeed a number of his colleagues were even stronger in their welcome of the Bill. If one believes that we cannot successfully separate the two functions of planning and control of expenditure then this Bill is totally wrong and is going to do great damage to this country.  Let us examine that.</P>
    <P>If you are saying, as many Deputies did, that control of expenditure should be given to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development if he is to have any power, what you are saying is either that we should abolish the Department of Finance and transfer all of their functions to the Department of Economic Planning and Development, or that we should not have a Department of Economic Planning and Development and all of these powers should be vested in the Department of Finance.  Either way you are saying that they should be in one Department under one Minister.</P>
    <P>It has been found from experience and under a number of Governments that it is not possible effectively to produce the kind of economic planning that is needed and at the same time to operate all the other functions that are required of the Minister for Finance, who is by law necessarily the same person as the Minister for the Public Service.  On a <Col N="1089" /> technical point, if the argument were that we should abolish the Department of Finance and transfer all their functions to the Department of Economic Planning and Development a lot of people might wonder why we go to all that trouble.  If that were to be the argument there would be some constitutional difficulties because the Constitution states at Article 28.7.1º:</P>
    <P> The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the member of the Government who is in charge of the Department of Finance must be members of Dáil Éireann. </P>
    <P>It would appear, therefore, that transfer of the functions of the Minister for Finance as they were at the adoption of the Constitution to another Minister would probably require a constitutional amendment. However, that is merely a technical point.  That is not what is proposed to be done.  What is proposed to be done is to transfer to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development functions of the Minister for Finance which were not conferred on him by law but were assumed by him over the years and which no Minister for Finance, I think, has ever effectively exercised and which, given the complexity of the functions of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Public Service and the sheer work-load involved, could not be exercised effectively by any one man.</P>
    <P>It seems therefore that the basic criticism made of this proposal in the debate falls and lacks logic unless one says &ldquo;We are opposing this Bill&rdquo;. There would be logic in that.  There is, I suggest, no logic in looking at the Bill and then saying that we should transfer control of the allocation of expenditure to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, which takes us back to square one again and to the present set-up of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Not alone would I freely acknowledge but I would urge very strongly that the success of this arrangement depends on two basic requirements, both of which I believe are being met <Col N="1090" /> in the arrangements we are making. The first is that the two Departments, the Department of Economic Planning and Development and the Department of Finance, should be so structured that they can mesh together at the right points.  Arrangements are being made precisely to ensure that.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should explain in a little more detail what I mean.  Firstly, the preparation and bringing forward of the budget is of course a function of the Department of Finance, but arrangements are being made whereby the Department of Economic Planning and Development can be kept informed and can make their own contribution in that regard.  Similarly arrangements are being made whereby the Department of Finance will, to use a jargon phrase, plug-in the Department of Economic Planning and Development in relation to the latter Department's preparation of longer-term plans so that the Department of Finance can be kept informed of the trend in that regard and can make their input to the preparation of such plans.  Without that kind of structure this arrangement would not have much hope of success.</P>
    <P>There is another and perhaps in some sense more important requirement and that is that the two political heads of the Departments concerned should be working in close co-operation and ensuring that the structure that is set up works.  Despite various things that have been said in the course of this debate I am not only content but determined to ensure the success of the operation of the Department of Economic Planning and Development. I know that my colleague is equally determined to ensure this success and to ensure this success in co-operation with the Department of Finance.  Of course the structure we are setting here is not related only to individuals; nevertheless in its first years it is relevant to consider the people who will be responsible for ensuring the success of the new Department in the way that I have been outlining.</P>
    <P>In that context I can say that my colleague and I have worked very closely together over quite a number of years and sometimes in very difficult <Col N="1091" /> circumstances.  We have never had the slightest difficulty in co-operating together. Sometimes we have perhaps a different approach, a different assessment of certain problems.  It would be very strange if we did not, but this is not something that means we cannot resolve such differences of opinion and work together as rational people can do.  We have demonstrated we can do it, and there is no reason why we should not be able to do it in relation to the operation of these two Departments.</P>
    <P>There seems to be, however, a number of mythological tales which we have heard in the course of this debate and, indeed, read in comment outside this House.  One of the myths we seem to have to live with is the idea that the Department of Finance is a super Department.  I suppose the main reason for the origin of that tale is that for many years the Department of Finance was the only Department, that is, outside the Department of the Taoiseach, which is in a different category, which had a kind of supervisory role in regard to other Departments. Certainly it had to operate specifically to the other Departments. There were people in each Department who dealt with the Department of Finance and people in the Department of Finance who dealt specifically with certain other Departments.  Then the Department of the Public Service was set up.  It has the same role and structure and it has to operate on the same basis.  However, as I mentioned earlier, that Department, by law, has to be under the control of the Minister who is also Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The new Department of Economic Planning and Development will be the third Department which will be in that central role.  It may be that, because of this and because of the old treasury tradition and how it was exercised, this idea grew up of a super Department. There is no such thing as a super Department.  Perhaps I might say at this stage that listening to Deputy Clinton, and I listened with great interest, and even more so to Deputy Browne, I was reminded of some of <Col N="1092" /> Seán O'Casey's later plays where he was tilting very fiercely at a society which did not exist, one that had existed perhaps when he was in Ireland. His great efforts seemed to be directed at a society I did not recognise, because I grew up after he had shaken the dust of this country from his feet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to the power struggle, this other myth we have.  The fact is that Deputy Browne was describing a structure and an operation of government which certainly does not exist today.  I suspect from what Deputy Clinton said that there is some resemblance between the picture painted by Deputy Browne and the situation that existed in the Government that went out in the last election.  It may not be exactly the same, but from the description it seems there is a good deal of similarity.  I do not want to be misunderstood on this.  I think the picture painted by Deputy Browne, while it was exacerbated in multi-party or Coalition Governments, was probably reasonably accurate of Fianna Fáil Governments of those times, too.  But it is a long time ago.  Things have changed, and the system of government operated by this Government is one that answers the description we heard from Deputy Browne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Browne asked specifically how this planning system would operate.  I think the Minister for Economic Planning and Development outlined this in his speech, but very briefly let me say it is planned to have a planning unit in each Department which will work in close consultation with the Department of Economic Planning and Development and will be the contact point for the work of each Department both in relation to what it is doing at the moment, its costings and so on, and its projections for the future.  The Department of Economic Planning and Development, working with each of these, will attempt to formulate a longer-term plan, as I <Col N="1093" /> indicated earlier, and will, in the process, be consulting specifically with the Department of Finance.  It will be a two-way process.  It will be consulting with each Department through its planning unit, but eventually it will produce a plan.</P>
    <P>Deputy's Browne's question was, what happens then?  The plan is then put to the Government, and the Government will either accept it or reject it or modify it.  But this is the key to the whole thing.  The decisions on matters of this kind are made by the Government, not by the Minister for Finance, not by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, not by any one Minister but by the Government working as a team.  That is the only way it can work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne interjected a moment ago about the power play.  I am fascinated by the various things I am hearing and reading about the power struggle that is going on.  I would like to expatiate for a moment or two on this whole concept of political power. It may be that some of my predecessors as Minister for Finance exercised their powers in such a way as to try to dominate their colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>They certainly all did not.  It may be even that some officials of the Department of Finance on occasions operated on a similar basis in relation to officials in other Departments. There may be some people who are interested in political power or any other power for its own sake. Such people need psychiatric treatment. In any properly run Government, major decisions are not made by individual Ministers and they are not made by the Taoiseach.  They are made by the Government acting as a team.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one can grasp that fact&mdash;it was outlined by my colleague in his speech &mdash;one realises that all this talk about power play, about one Minister controlling everything and keeping the other Minister out, does not make any sense.  Neither Minister is vested with that kind of power under the system <Col N="1094" /> of Government operating today, literally today.</P>
    <P>All sorts of contradictory allegations were made, one of them being that if the Fianna Fáil target for job creation is achieved the credit for that will go to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, and if it is not he will be the one to be blamed for it&mdash;Deputy Noel Browne said he would be dismissed.  I have every confidence those targets will be achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows what we set out in the manifesto.  It is in writing.  Let us not digress.  That is only a red herring.  I believe we will achieve it but now, before we know positively whether it will be achieved, I want to put something on record: if we achieve that, the credit will be due to the Fianna Fáil Government acting as a team, and if we do not, the blame will not lie on the Minister for Economic Planning and Development or any other Minister, but on the Government as a whole.  I am putting that on record now before anyone says it will be one way or the other.  That is the basis on which this Government operate and intend to operate.</P>
      <P>In the course of his interesting remarks, Deputy Clinton referred to the Department of the Public Service as a road-block.  I found his comments interesting in the context of what they were revealing about what had been happening in the previous Government in this respect.  In all fairness to that Department, I should like to make three points.  The first is that that Department officially were set up under the previous Government, at least the basic nucleus was there during the previous Government.  Number two, for a good deal of the time that Department have been operating they have been obliged to enforce an embargo on the creation of new posts in the public service, a decision of the previous Minister for Finance presumably backed by his colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is no help to any Department of the Public Service trying to do their job.  I am not talking about the merits <Col N="1095" /> of the embargo but operating in that context one could not expect the Department would be described by a Minister who was looking for extra staff as anything but a road-block. One of the main jobs of such a Department is to push ahead with reforms but the Department of the Public Service could not do that because the political will did not exist in the previous Government.  There were differences of opinion as to whether it should be done or how it should be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking of the Government.  There was either a disagreement within the Government on the idea or at least on how it should be done.  The Deputy is speaking about the Department of which he was in charge, but it is a matter of public record, in the recently published Public Service Advisory Committee Report, that the former Minister for Industry and Commerce did not agree with the concept as put forward and prevented the operation of what had been intended to be a trial operation of the aireacht concept in his Department. That is on record.</P>

      <P>Without Government decision to go ahead with this nothing can happen.  The present Government have taken the necessary decision and the work is going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy J. O'Leary spoke about the functions of the new Department and said no real powers were being conferred by the Bill.  I set out in the last page and a half of the speech with which I introduced the Bill that the functions being conferred are all <Col N="1096" /> that are required to enable the new Department to do what they are being set up to do, basically to produce for the Government integrated national plans for the economy and to review the implementation of those plans.  The functions set out in section 2 are ample for the effective working of the Department by reference to the Minister and Secretaries Acts for other Departments.  When functions are specified in those Acts they are always specified in broad terms.  There are Departments who do not have anything like as extensive or as precise a definition of functions as are set out in this Bill for the Department of Economic Planning and Development.</P>
    <P>A point was made by a Deputy about a reply given to a parliamentary question and he said that the functions of this Department had not yet been settled.  He seemed to think that indicated some contradiction of what is in the Bill.  Functions for which legislation is required are set out in this Bill but this does not preclude the assumption of further functions by the Department, as has happened in the case of quite a number of Departments&mdash;they assumed certain functions though they were not set out in the Acts setting them up.</P>
    <P>When introducing the Bill I said that although the final details have not been settled, our general design is clear.  What I said in reply to the parliamentary question referred to is not a contradiction of what is set out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating spoke about the lack of reference to social planning in the title of the Minister and the Department.  It may be a point but the fact is the title is already fairly long &mdash;Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  What is really important are the functions in relation to the social planning vested in the Minister.  Of course, they are important and I refer the Deputy in that regard to section 2 (2) (a) and (2) (e).  He will see there that they are clearly vested in the Minister.  In that connection I support strongely a point made by Deputy de Valera that it is quite ridiculous to try to talk about social planning divorced from <Col N="1097" /> economic planning.  Indeed, Deputy Keating went very close to that proposition.  The truth is you will make little or no progress on the social front if you do not make progress on the economic front.  The two are necessarily closely interwoven.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion from some Deputies as to the role of the Department of Finance being a negative one.  Now, whatever may have been the position 20 or 30 years ago, the record shows that a great deal of the initiative for economic advance since then has come from the Department of Finance.  While it is true that the Department of Finance has to exercise a certain amount of control&mdash; it is, if you like, an inheritance from the old Treasury control&mdash;that control is not exercised at all in the way it was exercised many years ago.</P>
    <P>I have always taken the view that it is quite wrong, subject to certain necessary safeguards, when decisions have been taken on expenditure, on the lines of the expenditure and the amount of it, that the Department of Finance should interfere with other Departments in that expenditure, subject, as I say, to the necessary safeguards to ensure that what is agreed is what is carried out and that new items of expenditure, particularly those leading to enormously costly expenditure in subsequent years, is not embarked on unknown to the Department of Finance.  Subject to that kind of constraint I do not think it is a proper function of the Department of Finance to interfere in other Departments.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Finance before I achieved some progress in eliminating that kind of control and I intend to achieve even more progress. It is, in my opinion inefficient and time wasting.  It is a situation, as Deputy Browne suggested, in which you have people with no particular expertise in a certain area endeavouring to control or assess policies in areas in which they have no particular expertise.  I do not think that is at all the function or role of the Department of Finance.  I do not know if Deputy Browne is surprised to hear me say this but, if he is, he will realise now <Col N="1098" /> there is some truth in what I am saying; the Department of Finance today is not quite the same as the one he was talking about.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. Barry was to some extent, I think, fighting certain aspects of the last election in his contribution.  It is, I suppose, an understandable temptation, but it is one I want to resist. However, there were a few things he said to which I simply cannot resist replying.  He will understand that.  I do not wish to give any bad example but I cannot let all that he said go unremarked. He said Fianna Fáil had planned for widespread emigration. The fact is we stopped emigration. When did it start up again?  We got rid of the haemorrhage of emigration after centuries but it started up again under the Government of which the Deputy was a member.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It has no actual connection. It is the ESRI.  I know the Deputy and particularly the former Ministers must be in an embarrassing position on this Bill because we all recall the fact that my predecessor as Minister for Finance refused point blank for quite some time to engage in planning.  He said it could not be done.  Eventually, after considerable pressure from the Opposition and from other quarters, he agreed a plan would be produced and with great gusto his colleagues told the House there was a plan on the way.  We were given dates. I am sure we all remember the mid-summer promise.  The fact is no plan was produced by those people who are now talking on this Bill about the necessity for planning.  When they had the opportunity to plan they did not produce one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is of some significance because, although we certainly would not claim and never did claim that our manifesto represents a complete economic and social plan, nevertheless the fact is we <Col N="1099" /> produced it in Opposition.  Indeed, we produced the bones of it last September in Opposition.  Good as it was, I believe we should be able to improve on it very considerably now with the resources of Government available to us.</P>
    <P>There have been references to the question of obtaining a consensus to any plan that is produced to enable it to work.  Deputy O'Leary made it clear in his references to me that in his view &mdash;a not incorrect view, I may add&mdash; a consensus is vitally important.  I have consistently maintained that a consensus must be sought and, if one does not get a consensus, a Government has no right to abdicate.  That was one of my major criticisms of the former Government&mdash;that they did abdicate. In most cases I believe that if a Government produces reasonable proposals it will get a consensus from the interested parties.  We are in the unusual and somewhat happy position that we have not just got a consensus for the proposals in our manifesto from this sector, that sector or the other sector, but we have a consensus from the people and we have that consensus in an unprecedented way.  I do not think anybody need worry unduly about the obtaining of a consensus in regard to the implementation of our manifesto proposals.</P>
    <P>One Deputy&mdash;possibly more than one&mdash;made reference to an individual civil servant.  The references were laudatory.  The man was identified in the public eye with the effort to get reform in the public service.  The point was made that he was taken out of that job.  I have as great a regard for that man's ability and commitments as anybody but, as I said earlier, virtually no progress was made on public service reform.  That is not criticism of that particular civil servant or of any of his colleagues.  The basic cause was the one I mentioned earlier, the lack of political will and decision to achieve it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry and others referred to Fianna Fáil buying votes in the last election.  I can understand the effort by Fine Gael in particular and the Labour Party, to some extent, to <Col N="1100" /> try to convince themselves in the first instance and the public in the second instance that the reason for their defeat was dirty tricks by Fianna Fáil going out buying votes in this way or that.  But before this becomes part of the alleged history of this time let me point out that I and a number of my colleagues repeatedly during the election campaign, in speeches and in radio and television interviews and even in party political broadcasts, stressed that the Fianna Fáil manifesto was not just a list of goodies, that it was an integrated plan containing things that were not at all easy for people to accept, as well as those which were attractive.  One of the obvious difficult areas is in relation to moderation in wage demands.  Certainly, I&mdash;and I think some of my colleagues&mdash;was very closely questioned on radio and television during the election campaign on that aspect of our manifesto.  We made it clear in addition that there were three major problems that we had to tackle, unemployment, inflation and the state of the public finances.  We said that even Fianna Fáil could not tackle all three together but that all three had to be tackled, that our priorities had to be unemployment and inflation but that the manifesto proposals also involved tackling the state of our public finances.  The beginning in that regard would be made a year after the beginning of our attack on unemployment and inflation.  We intend to adhere to that.</P>

      <P>The people voted for it and they will get what they voted for and Deputies opposite can interpret that as they like.  Deputy Barry claims that the Coalition handed over a booming economy to the Government and quoted the latest ESRI quarterly economic commentary in support of his argument. It is true that growth rate this year is encouraging although I have some doubts as to whether it will be quite as high as ESRI have projected.  When this Government took over the economy was pulling out of a recession.  Deputy Barry seems to regard this pick-up as a boom, rather like saying a man has become richer <Col N="1102" /> simply because he found £100 which he had lost.  The fact is that if no action were taken by us, even with the growth Deputy Barry talked about, our employment situation would become considerably worse and it is necessary for us to take very substantial action substantially to increase growth, almost double it in order to make any real impact on unemployment.</P>

      <Col N="1103" /> In relation to the booming economy of which Deputy Barry spoke, I should say that our unemployment rate is at 9½ per cent which is the highest in the EEC: our inflation rate is still very well into double figures and for the benefit of Deputy Harte, I should say that the ESRI drew attention in their June bulletin to the possibility that net emigration has resumed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harte might look at the figures available for the movement of passengers and see if he still contends that there is no possibility that net emigration has resumed.  We have very serious unemployment, very substantial inflation.  We have a resumption of emigration and if these are the features of a booming economy our economic textbooks will have to be rewritten to conform with the Fine Gael definition of a boom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister should read what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard it.  I do not think I am misrepresenting the Deputy &mdash;and I do not think I am misrepresenting Deputy Barry&mdash;by saying he also was claiming for the former Government of which he was a member credit for the recent strong growth in industrial exports.  It is true, as I think he was pretending, that recent national wage agreements have led to slower growth in unit wage costs here than in Britain which is still our principal single export market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it would be fairer in allotting credit for the achievement of increased industrial exports if Deputy Barry were to grant honours shared to the trade unions and the employers rather than the Coalition Government. I do not say that just as a smart debating point, but because the Coalition Government's lack of any coherent anti-inflation policy did very <Col N="1104" /> much to complicate the wage settlements eventually reached.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to interrupt the Minister but, in fact, the reverse is what happened.  As I pointed out when I was speaking, unit wage costs here were ahead of Britain when we took office, and that interfered not only with our exports to Britain but also with our competitiveness in international markets where we were competing with Britain.  When we left office our unit wage costs were below those of Britain which facilitated our exports to Britain and also made us competitive with English goods on world markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will be aware of the factors which went into that situation&mdash;I am referring to the unit wage cost situation&mdash;factors which were to some extent a product of the downturn in the economy and in what was happening as it began to come up.  It is true to say that, in regard to the negotiation of wage agreements&mdash;and this is not something new for me to say; as the Deputy knows I said it repeatedly from the benches on which he is now sitting&mdash;the previous Government had no coherent anti-inflation policy and they did a great deal to complicate wage negotiations.</P>
      <P>However, comparative unit wage cost trends do not fully explain what has happened.  There is no doubt at all that our exports have been helped by the decline in the value of sterling which is important, of course, given the very great diversification which occurred in relatively recent years in our export market.  I presume the Deputy would not claim credit for, or influence over, the decline in the sterling exchange rate.  Most people recognise it as being true that much of the recent growth in industrial exports is due to new firms coming on stream, firms which were attracted here by the industrial promotion agency.  Indeed, the ESRI tend to agree with that view which is supported, to some extent, objectively by the fact that until very recent months the increase in industrial exports was not accompanied by a corresponding increase in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> Deputy Barry claimed he and his colleagues in the Coalition Government brought down the rate of inflation. He gave us a number of statistics. The record in this regard should speak for itself.  The previous Government came to power in March, 1973.  The rate of inflation in 1973 was 11.4 per cent.  Progressively under that Government it soared.  In 1974 the figure was 17 per cent.  In 1975 it reached almost 21 per cent.  The Irish record for inflation was reached in the May, 1975, quarter at almost 25 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that the rate fell subsequently but this is the point&mdash; and this was in the boom situation Deputy Barry was talking about.  When the Coalition left office it was still 14 per cent.  I do not think Deputy Barry can claim the Coalition brought down inflation.</P>

      <P>I am talking in the context of the lack of any coherent policy by the Coalition on the question of inflation and the damage this did to wage negotiations.  It will be remembered that in the January, 1976, budget there was another about turn involving, among other things, about a 70 per cent increase in motor tax.  That budget added about 4 per cent to the consumer price index.  It is true that a little of this was knocked off in the January, 1977, budget but the damage had been done at that time.</P>

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate should be about whether economic planning is desirable or necessary and, if so, whether the approach outlined in this Bill is the right one in order to achieve it.  I have tried to demonstrate that it seems to us to be the best way to do it. I do not say we have positively the final definitive wisdom on this.  I do say that, with the situation we are faced with, given the kind of resources we have, and given the kind of structure of Government we have, this is the best way to tackle it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic problem adverted to from the Opposition benches about the lack of control over finances is really another way of saying : &ldquo;You should not have this Department at all.  It should all be done by the Department of Finance.&rdquo; We have had that situation and there is general agreement that there is room for improvement. This Bill is an effort to achieve that improvement by providing a Department and a Minister most of whose efforts will be concentrated <Col N="1108" /> on the question of economic and social planning and development.</P>
    <P>The question was raised about executive functions vested in this new Department.  Some Deputies felt no executive function should be vested in it while others felt that if it did not have substantial executive functions it would not count as a Department.  The truth lies between those two extremes. If it has no executive functions what-ever, there is a danger it will lose touch with reality.  I am speaking of all the people involved in it.  We are all in that danger if we do not, as Ministers, have executive functions.  On the other hand, if it has a load of executive functions, then it will be so engaged and engrossed in them that it will be unable to do the job which it is primarily being set up to do, to stand back from the loading of executive functions and do some long term thinking in regard to the development of our economy and our whole social structure.</P>
    <P>The new Department has been given a relatively small amount of executive functions but not such as to overload it.  We tried to approach this problem on the basis of common sense, on the basis of our experience in Government, on the basis of the kind of structures we have.  I am hopeful, and confident, that it will work.  Certainly, as one Deputy remarked today, it is better to do this than nothing.  We cannot go on as we have been with a virtually unplanned economy.  This is the right way to do it but it is not necessarily the last word.  If we find that this does not work as effectively as we would like and we think we can improve it, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, and myself, would be the first to want to change the system.  However, that has not been demonstrated yet.  The setting up of this Department could well mark a vitally important development in the evolution of our structures of Government and, perhaps, a very important development in the achievement of economic advancement which is more important.  Certainly, it is designed to achieve that situation.  On all the evidence available, it is the best method available to us for tackling the <Col N="1109" /> problem and on that basis I enthusiastically commend this Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is in essence an agreed measure in that it proposes to implement policy decisions taken by the previous Government to which I and my colleagues in the present Government fully subscribe.  It is an agreed measure also in the sense that it reflects an agreement reached earlier this year with two of the Garda representative bodies following negotiations between the Department of Justice and the bodies initiated by my predecessor.</P>
      <P>As will be fairly clear to Deputies, the main purpose of the Bill is to make certain amendments in the existing law governing the establishment and functioning of the Garda representative bodies.  The amendments proposed are those which are necessary to enable effect to be given to an agreement with the Representative Body for Inspectors, Station Sergeants and Sergeants and the Representative Body for Guards.  That agreement, as I have said, was concluded during my predecessor's term of office, and I would like to pay tribute to the role which he played in bringing about the agreement.</P>
      <P>I should add that discussions have also taken place with the Representative Bodies for Chief Superintendents and Superintendents and I expect that agreement will soon be reached with them as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill gives me the opportunity to place on record my appreciation of the valuable work done by all the representative bodies, and by their elected representatives at the various levels, in attending to and promoting the interests of their members. The bodies play an important role in the maintenance of good relations <Col N="1110" /> and understanding between the members of the various ranks and their authorities.  Indeed, this kind of link is important not alone for the members that the bodies represent but also for Garda management.  The present agreement and the understanding reached between the parties following the negotiations during the past year are indicative of the constructive approach that was adopted by all concerned.</P>
    <P>The amendments that are necessary to give effect to the agreement fall to be made in section 13 of the Garda Síochána Act, 1924, which at present provides for the establishment in accordance with ministerial regulations of representative bodies elected by the members of the various ranks&mdash;and here I quote&mdash;&ldquo;for the purpose of enabling the members of the Garda Síochána to consider and bring to the notice of the Commissioner and the Minister matters affecting their welfare and efficiency, other than questions of discipline and promotion affecting individuals&rdquo;. Section 13 as it stands prohibits the bodies from associating with any body or person outside the Force. Under the existing regulations the affairs of the bodies are controlled to a considerable degree by the Commissioner. The controls extend to such matters as the dates, frequency and duration of meetings at the various levels.  Furthermore, it is the Garda authorities rather than the members who conduct elections.  All members are entitled to vote, or to be nominated for office, irrespective of whether they are subscribers to representative body funds.</P>
    <P>These arrangements have for some time past been a source of growing dissatisfaction among members of the Garda Síochána and, in response to pressure from members, the representative bodies sought freedom from the present restrictions.  The bodies initially sought full trade union status, with freedom to strike, which is prohibited by section 14 of the 1924 Act. My predecessor made it clear at the outset, in a preliminary meeting with the bodies, that he could not agree to concede trade union status or the right to strike, as he saw these matters as <Col N="1111" /> incompatible with the functions and responsibilities that are discharged by members of the force.  That is a view with which the present Government are in full agreement.  My predecessor did, however, agree that there should be a relaxation of the existing controls to the extent necessary to enable the bodies to reconstitute themselves into the equivalent of an independent staff association, with freedom to draw up their own constitution, conduct their own elections and generally manage their own affairs.</P>
    <P>That is the essence of the agreement that was subsequently reached with the bodies.  It is possible to provide some of the necessary changes in new regulations.  There are, however, other changes which require the amendment of section 13 of the 1924 Act.  It is necessary, firstly, to amend the section to enable the new bodies to represent their members generally in all matters affecting their welfare and efficiency and not just to bring such matters &ldquo;to the notice of the Commissioner and of the Minister&rdquo;. Secondly, the existing provision which prohibits the bodies from making representations on behalf of individual members in matters affecting discipline and promotion needs to be repealed. Thirdly, the wording of section 13 needs to be amended so as to enable participation in the election of representative bodies to be confined to those who pay their subscriptions to representative body funds.  It has been agreed with the bodies, however, that, in the first elections to take place under the new arrangement, every member will have a vote.</P>
    <P>The amended section will modify the prohibition which is there at present on representative bodies associating with bodies or persons outside the force.  In future it will be possible for the Minister for Justice to authorise the bodies to associate with outside persons and associations subject to such conditions and restrictions as he may specify.  Agreement has already been reached with the bodies as to the kinds of outside organisations with whom they may reasonably expect to be allowed to <Col N="1112" /> associate.  The bodies may, for example, wish to employ outside consultants to assist them in the preparation of claims or otherwise advise them on matters connected with the discharge of their functions.</P>
    <P>They may also wish to liaise with international associations of police organisations whose functions is to exchange information on matters of common interest.</P>
    <P>Finally, the term &ldquo;representative body&rdquo; is being dropped in favour of the term &ldquo;association&rdquo; as the present bodies wish to depart from the old terminology to help to improve their status and image.</P>
    <P>For the convenience of those who will subsequently be concerned with the interpretation and application of section 13 of the 1924 Act as amended, the text of the section is re-enacted in full with the various amendments incorporated in it.  The substantive amendments are confined to sub-section (1) and subsection (5), which is a new subsection.  Subsections (2) and (3) each show only one minor textual amendment as compared with the original and subsection (4) is unchanged.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill proposes a simplification of the procedure for the bringing into operation of Garda Síochána pensions orders.  What is proposed is the introduction of the procedure that has already been agreed to by the Oireachtas in relation to pension schemes elsewhere in the public service, including the Army.  At present, before a Garda pensions order can come into operation it must be confirmed by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The new procedure would enable the order to come into operation immediately it is made.  The order, would, however, be laid before each House and could be annulled by resolution of either House within 21 sitting days.  These pensions orders do not arise very frequently but when they do I am sure the House will agree that it is fitting that they should be dealt with in the same way as comparable orders in relation to other groups in the public service.</P>
    <P>I think that it is unnecessary for me <Col N="1113" /> to say any more about the Bill other than to make the point that I believe in all sincerity that the changes in role and status which have been agreed with the Garda representative bodies constitute a fair and reasonable compromise between their present situation and the claim which they originally made for full trade union status.  As in all matters of this kind, the working out of an agreed package has involved give-and-take on both sides and I am happy that negotiations were successfully concluded to the satisfaction of all concerned.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and I would ask that it be given favourable and speedy consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>My first duty is to congratulate the Minister on his appointment to the office of Minister for Justice and to wish him well during his term of office.  I do so because I recognise that possibly above all other portfolios in the Cabinet the office of Minister for Justice bears very heavy responsibilities and onerous duties.  I take this opportunity of wishing the Minister good health and strength to carry out his duties.</P>
      <P>We will co-operate with him and assist him in every way possible in what is our common concern for the maintenance of law and order.  We will attempt to be fair in our comments and be constructive and helpful in our criticism.  We hope the Minister will respond in a practical and meaningful way to our arguments and the attitudes we express from time to time.  Our contribution will be aimed at improving the standard of security and the fair but firm application of law and order. For that reason we welcome the Bill.</P>
      <P>I want to put on record that this Bill was the work of the former Minister, Senator Cooney.  I would also like to put on record, and I would hope the House would join with me, in paying a tribute to the former Minister for Justice for the manner in which he carried out his duties in those four very difficult years.  This Bill is but a very small part of the work he did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recognition being given here, while welcome and desirable, leaves a lot more to be done.  The purpose is to <Col N="1114" /> ensure that the force have a proper negotiating basis and that their grievances are listened to.  The changes proposed were negotiated while the Coalition Government were in office and I hope this leaves the way open for speedy settlement of outstanding claims, which include rent allowances, pensions and equal pay, night duty allowances, meal breaks and the special position of Garda clerks.  These are matters of such importance to members of the Garda that to delay a decision on them would undoubtedly have a detrimental effect on the general morale of the force.</P>
    <P>If we in public life, in the greater interest of all our citizens and institutions, are serious about law enforcement, then it is imperative that we have a good and constantly improving relationship with the Garda through this representative body.  I appreciate that it is a little soon for a new Minister to come to terms with all the things that are required, but I hope delays will be avoided.</P>
    <P>The fact that this Act has not been changed since 1924 gives an indication of the foresight of the men who drew up the Act to govern the relationship between the Government and the police force in those trying days.  It is also to be noted that there had never been a survey of the Garda force until Senator Cooney, as Minister for Justice, commissioned such a report. I understand that report is now available and perhaps the Minister might circulate it soon.</P>
    <P>It is a tribute to the then Minister that in four terrible years of trying times he found time to attend to the matters I have mentioned.  I believe we should show our appreciation of the work being done by our Garda and not delay in granting basic claims and improving conditions.</P>
    <P>We must never lose sight of the fact that our police force are at the foundation of our society and the manner in which the officers and men carry out their duties determines the kind of society we can have.  A dissatisfied force cannot be expected to be as efficient or as effective as one which is content and appreciated.  The duties they carry out and the sacrifices they <Col N="1115" /> make must receive the proper recognition and support of Parliament and people.</P>
    <P>One point I believe should be made in this debate is that the relationship between the Garda and the people must always be good and working in both directions, but the relationship between Parliament and the Garda is vital, both for the members of the force and the State itself.  All political parties should have stronger links with the Garda Representative Body on a more open basis.  It must never be seen that the Garda force serve only the Government or are loyal only to the Cabinet: they must be seen to serve the people.  The representatives of all the people in Dáil Éireann must have an open and healthy relationship with the force.</P>
    <P>It will be said that this is the case&mdash; and I agree that it is to an extent&mdash; but the ordinary people are often left thinking that because the political head of the Department of Justice is a Cabinet Minister and because the ranks above that of superintendent are Government appointments, the officers and ambitious men in the ranks are often more inclined to the Government in power than to any other political party.</P>
    <P>Without confusing both positions, but for a moment reflecting on what happened in Northern Ireland, one can see the horrible dangers of the Government and not the Parliament getting too close to the police force. I might add that it is on record that on a number of occasions the Northern police force expressed a very strong desire to be independent and free from party politics.  It is correct to say that our Garda force have never as a body become involved in party politics. With the police force in Great Britain, our force are the only other unarmed police force in Europe.</P>
    <P>One point which can be overlooked by the casual observer and, indeed by administrators, is the fact that an unarmed police force needs more men and women to maintain law and order and, even more important and more desirable, to prevent crime.  The people who are police bashing at the moment <Col N="1116" /> might consider this point.  If any single individual breaks ranks and draws criticism to the police force, the specific should not be made the general and any isolated case of alleged police brutality should be seen as perhaps a human error or as an individual taking onto himself the right to use more physical force than is justified.</P>
    <P>That should not be used as criticism of our police force.  It is openly acknowledged by all police authorities in the world that the presence of a policeman and the fear of being caught prevent crime more than anything else. Therefore, the Minister should step up the recruiting drive which was undertaken by the National Coalition and which is necessary if law and order and the smooth running of society is to be maintained.  There are plenty of young men and women leaving colleges and universities with literally no job prospects and the number of applicants for admission to the force is such that all places could be filled literally within hours.  The Department should consider setting up an academy for young men below the age limit to be received into the police force much the same as the cadet school which now attracts bright young men into the Army.  If such an institution were organised by the Minister, young boys and girls leaving post-primary schools wishing to join the police force would be given an opportunity to train as members of the force and would be ready as qualified people when they reached the age limit.  This is something which many police forces in the world have and, perhaps, the Minister would consider this.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the police force, not alone the police force of today, but to the police force as it was formed 55 years ago.  George Bernard Shaw once said that doctors should be valued not on the amount of disease they cured but according to the absence of disease.  Unfortunately, a doctor's work is only valued when people are ill.  Likewise it can be said that the Garda Síochána exist for the smooth running of public order and secondly to enforce the law where and when it is broken.  Their services and commitment to duty are often not noticed <Col N="1117" /> or appreciated until they are needed. At the birth of the Garda Síochána the world were astonished that out of the ruin, chaos and insurrection, at a time of immense internal disquiet, an unarmed force emerged.  It was said that the idea of an unarmed police force for that period was, for practical purposes, too idealistic.  Looking back after 55 years, one can say with pride that the decision was not alone courageous but a successful experiment. When we consider that the Irish people for generations before that time had the tradition of being against the Government and against the agents of government, and that in the immediate decade prior to that the rule of law and order had broken down, and where some people had still little regard for property, we see in some small way the major contribution the young, often inexperienced men, of that period made to the creation of this nation.</P>
    <P>It should also be remembered that they were replacing a police force which had been famed as a vigorous and efficient military machine, which was anything but popular with the people.  Their duties also brought them face to face with the wave of national enthusiasm which was sweeping the country and in many cases they were trying to subdue old comrades and high emotional friends of the past.  In the face of all this challenge the Garda Síochána emerged as a mature well-disciplined and proud body of men.  Their path has been challenged at different times since then and with pride of purpose their officers and men, with few exceptions, have met those challenges determined to succeed.  I am confident that the challenge they have before them now will be dealt with in a proper and successful manner.  One thing above all else which has made our police force the success that it is as an unarmed force is that its members come from the people.  They are part of the people whom they serve.  In its ranks there are men from all classes and creeds in the community, with professional commercial and farming backgrounds.  Their past record of service to this nation has been astounding. <Col N="1118" /> I salute those who had the task of forming the force, some of whom I have known personally and the present membership.</P>
    <P>I have one small criticism.  It happens that when people come into our community, either as strangers or as people returning home, the first people they meet, at sea ports, airports or land frontiers are members of the Garda Síochána.  It has been brought to my attention that gardaí are sometimes less courteous and too casual in their attention to simple requests.  This could leave a long and lasting wrong impression in the minds of these people when they return to their homes.  I know the men I refer to do not create that impression intentionally.  Perhaps the Minister would bring to the attention of the senior officers of the Garda Síochána that more emphasis be put on public relations and stress to the gardaí on these duties that they are our ambassadors at a time when Ireland needs to regain her pride and when the Irish people are fighting to be a part of western society against odds where bad propaganda and wrong reports have painted a picture that all of the Irish are fighting.  The Commissioner of the Garda Síochána should take note that when young gardaí are put on duty for the first time this point is emphasised.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is one which was negotiated during the term of the National Coalition Government.  We are supporting this Bill.  In my capacity as spokesman for security, I believe that there is a wrong impression throughout the country, that the Garda can be the limb of the law, as far as the Government in power is concerned.  I suggest that the Minister seriously consider setting up a police authority comprised of members of all parties, together with professional people, who could advise on the manner in which the police force would be well conducted.  It goes without saying that if the political head of the Department of Justice is a Cabinet Minister and if it is accepted that the Government take decisions which directly affect the promotion of officers in the Garda, members within <Col N="1119" /> the force might feel that it would be better for them to be part of a political machine.  I am not suggesting that they would all be Fianna Fáil supporters, I admit that members might want to be associated with the Fine Gael Party.  This is wrong and the Garda do not want to be associated with any political movement but the system as it works dictates the position. The Minister should consider changing that system so that the police authority I have suggested could be organised and the police force would relate to parliament and in that way no matter what party was in power, or no matter what the political scene was, the Garda Síochána would be seen as the arm of the law which upholds the wish of the people and will be responsible to the representatives of the people irrespective of what party they belong to.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that, so far as this party are concerned, we will be as responsible as he would expect and will co-operate in every way possible in the common aim of maintaining law and order and ensuring that the institutions of the State are not threatened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcomed the Minister to his new office on another occasion and I do so again now.  I am in full agreement with the Minister and the Fine Gael spokesman on the merits of this Bill.  I know it has emanated as a result of protracted discussions between the representatives of the Garda and the Department of Justice, indeed between them and the former and present Minister.  While I am aware it does not meet all the requirements of the representative body I am mindful also that the Garda are very anxious that the Bill be enacted and that elections be proceeded with.  This party will not impede its passage.  I am aware that the right to apply for affiliation to the Congress of Trade Unions has not been ceded to the Garda.  I can envisage reasons.  Nonetheless, I would ask the Minister not to look upon this as a final settlement but rather to envisage a situation in which more <Col N="1120" /> freedom would be afforded the Garda force to recognise&mdash;as he does&mdash;that they are human beings with families and problems having an even greater need than most other workers to protect their terms of employment. Therefore they must be afforded the maximum of freedom consistent with their role which has become increasingly difficult with the passage of the years.</P>
      <P>Indeed, I speak as one who called for an investigation into various allegations made recently.  Nonetheless I want to place on record this evening as our party spokesman, that we are very keenly aware of the debt that we, as a people, owe them.  I speak being aware of that debt and of their high reputation which necessitates still further that their image remains untarnished.  It was for that purpose that I called for an investigation, in an endeavour to ascertain whether or not the allegations made were justified, least there were any members of the force who deviated in any way from the high standard maintained by the vast majority of their number.  I felt such an investigation was justified, again in an endeavour to maintain their good name.  Such would be in their best interest and in the interest  also of any possible victims.  We must all be aware that their task has become very difficult.  In 1976 it was estimated that some £3,100,000 were paid out on malicious injuries claims in Dublin alone, which indicates the level and increase in violence of that nature.</P>
      <P>There is also the other type of violence and lawlessness which cannot be measured in pounds, shillings and pence.  That also is tremendous burden on the force.  I know there are members of the force who have committed themselves to duty beyond the norm, members who have gone back after hours to assist victims of personal injury and so on and we should place on record our indebtedness to them.  We should ensure that anything we can willingly do by way of making their lot an easier one, by way of raising their morale or of improving their conditions is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> Reference was made recently to arming the force and to the introduction on the streets of dog patrols.  I totally abhor that proposition.  I believe it would merely increase the level of violence.  If I know the men themselves at all, I do not believe that they wish this to be done.  I do not think the Minister is contemplating anything of the kind.  The image of the Garda Síochána as a peaceful force is the one we must maintain even in the face of the increased lawlessness of recent times.  In a debate on law and order in this House almost a year ago the Minister estimated that it would take 2,000 to 3,000 extra gardaí to meet the needs of the time.  Perhaps he has in mind increasing the force; I do not know.  Certainly in the interests of the old, infirm and those most in need of help an increase of Garda patrols is vital.</P>
    <P>However, there is another aspect of violence the roots of which go far deeper into society and which no number of Garda personnel on the ground will solve.  I refer to people from broken homes, the victims of child battering, people who could not make their way to school, who cannot now get employment but rather are almost forced into a life of violence. We must endeavour to get at the roots of these evils in society.  We must remember also that violence and crimes of violence are not peculiar to areas of deprivation alone.  They are to be found amongst the products of the homes of the better-off classes in our society.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it might be as well for us to pay some attention to a comment made in <i>The Irish Times</i> of yesterday, the type of comment frequently made. We all tend to blame lack of housing, of adequate recreational facilities, employment opportunities and so on as contributing factors.  However, at a recent conference in Galway run by the Medical Union, a juvenile liaison officer&mdash;somebody who might be said to have a very keen insight into these problems&mdash;in the Dublin area attributed a lot of this violence to those factors and reminded us also that teenage crime was by no means limited to the city centre or to deprived areas. He contended that much of the <Col N="1122" /> problem lay in suburbia.  He invited the doctors he was addressing to consider the difference between the application of the law to young people from deprived areas and to wealthy offenders and university students.  Indeed, such discrimination in the application of the law might create frustration within the members of the force if they feel that such a difference in application is applied to various people they apprehend and bring before the courts.  Any provision of this Bill that might tend to lower the morale of the Garda warrants comment. I welcome the Bill as a step forward.  I can envisage greater freedom of association for the Garda Síochána in the future but in so far as it represents the burden of their requirements and in so far as they need speedy passage of the Bill, on behalf of the Labour Party I intend to afford that passage to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with other Members, I welcome the opportunity of congratulating the Minister on introducing this Bill.  I have no doubt that already he is determined to make an impact on his portfolio as Minister for Justice.  In the few short months he has been in office he has created a considerable impact and has improved the image of his Department beyond recognition.  For that I welcome his appointment.</P>
      <P>This Bill goes a long way towards restoring the morale of the Garda Síochána.  During the years they have had an increasingly difficult and frustrating job.  They deserve and must receive the support necessary to combat the evil that is causing so much distress on our streets and within our community.  In South County Dublin and in Dublin itself vandalism has reached a peak the likes of which I can assure the House nobody has seen before.  The destruction of schools and property and the destruction of people's lives because of robberies and housebreakings have caused much distress in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy to be able to say that the Garda Síochána in South County Dublin have shown tremendous restraint and great goodwill towards the <Col N="1123" /> community generally and they have the respect of the community.  We are fortunate to belong to a society where there is a virtually no class distinction. There is very little class consciousness and there is little or no polarisation of authority.  However, in our cities we have the growing problems of vandalism and deliquency. Whatever the sociologists may say about the root causes of such problems, of inadequate homes and overcrowded schools, one thing is certain. We must rely on the Garda Síochána to protect us from the thugs and criminal elements who are increasingly evident on the streets.</P>
    <P>This Bill goes a long way towards providing status for the Garda Síochána, status that is long overdue.  The members of the force are men and women drawn from the community.  I suppose next to the clergy they are as closely in touch with the people as any other professional group.  They live among them and many of them are involved at all levels with the young people as well as with the older citizens in the youth and community associations.  It would be nice to see the Garda Síochána encouraged to become even more closely involved in the affairs of the community.  Their role in the community should be a positive one.  They should aim to be regarded by the young especially as not merely people dealing with offenders but as protectors of the people. They should be encouraged to visit schools and to talk to the children as friends so that the children will look up to them as such.  They should develop close relationships with teachers, with the leaders of the community generally and with parents' associations.  During the years the Garda Síochána have gained great prestige.  It can be fairly said that the vast majority of people look to the force with respect for their authority. They are the symbol of authority but it is an authority that is correctly administered with compassion and understanding and that is something all of us welcome.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that there is an adequate replacement for the local <Col N="1124" /> foot patrol, and I know most urban Deputies would agree with me.  A few months ago the practice was to send one guard in a car to cover an area but this was totally inadequate.  If he got out of his car and left it, it was stolen.  That happened on one occasion, not in my constituency.  It is good that the Minister has brought back the two-man squad car.  I would encourage him, if possible, to introduce the community policeman, the garda who is in touch with the local community.  When I was young I remember we played on the streets in Dundrum.  Sometimes we were chased by the gardaí and other times they joined us.  There is very little in the modern-day scheme of things that can provide for that kind of levity.</P>
    <P>All of us know the Garda Síochána are under extreme pressure.  There is no point in undermining their confidence any more than has been done. We owe it to them to give them the funds and equipment they need but above all respect and understanding so that they can get on with the job. In turn we can expect from them true professionalism, something that for one reason or another is sometimes found wanting.  They are not perfect. They are like the rest of us; they have their problems and faults.  As I pointed out, they are drawn from the people of this land, they are of us and for us and they certainly deserve our support.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to the bravery of the Garda Síochána, and in particular of two gardaí in our area, in the recent armed robbery at Cornelscourt.  They provided a fine example of service to the community when, at risk to life and limb, they apprehended armed criminals who had stolen or had attempted to steal from a premises in the area.  They were shot at but they brought the criminals to justice.  I should like to pay a special tribute to the members concerned on behalf of the people of the area.  It has been mentioned more than once that these two gentlemen showed tremendous courage.</P>
    <P>Now that the Minister has taken the initiative in introducing this Bill he might like to have a look at the system <Col N="1125" /> of promotion within the Garda Síochána so that the more dedicated and able garda will feel there is a future for him in the force.  The Minister might have a look at some of the top posts from the point of view of service, dedication and ability.</P>
    <P>I would like to speak about the type of co-operation provided by the Garda Síochána to the community associations in my constituency of South County Dublin.  Senior Garda officers frequently attend meetings of community associations and residents' associations.  We hear criticism that the gardaí do not create a sense of public awareness.  They create it in South County Dublin.  I welcome it. The Garda Síochána have got to try to restore confidence and pride within the force.  That cannot be done without a political will.  I believe the Minister has that and has the strength and courage to bring about the changes the people were asking for during the last few years.  This Bill is evidence of that. I congratulate the Minister in introducing this Bill, I look forward to many more measures which will rebuild the morale of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): As has been said by the Minister and confirmed by Deputy Harte, this is largely an agreed measure between the Government and the Opposition parties in the House. The Bill was put together by the Minister's predecessor and has been accepted by the Minister.  It is also acceptable to the Garda Síochána whom it will facilitate.  They accept it as something that will enable them to negotiate with the Minister and with the Commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill amends an Act which was put on the Statute Book in 1924 to set up machinery under which the Garda Síochána could negotiate with the Department of Justice.  As the Minister said, the 1924 Act has stood the test of time well.  Last week the Minister for Health introduced a Bill to replace an Act of 1927 which was enacted to provide machinery which enabled the medical profession to regulate that profession.  The Minister for Health last week spoke in complimentary <Col N="1126" /> terms of the 1927 Act and said that it also had stood the test of time well.</P>
    <P>I will never cease to be amazed how the first Government in the 1920s, in those difficult times when the infant State was finding its feet, finding its way out of bondage and into freedom in a limited way, setting up its own institutions of State with our people, found time to introduce these enlightened Acts.  The two Acts I have spoken of are only two of the dozens of Acts, from the Wildlife Act of the 1930s, the Vocational Education Act of 1926 and the measure which set up the Local Appointments Commission to the two Bills we are dealing with now.  It is not at all inappropriate at times like this to put on record the work that was done by the first Government of the State and the Opposition of the time.  I am proud to look back at the work which was done then and also glad to see tribute being paid now by Ministers of a different party to the Ministers and Government of those days.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to compliment the Garda Síochána who have served this State since its foundation in 1922 for the manner in which they discharged their duties under different Governments, the Government which set them up, the Government which took over in 1932 and various Governments that have governed the country since then.  The Garda have discharged their duty to the nation in a fearless, courageous and impartial way.  As an unarmed police force, they have tackled armed men. It is noteworthy that even today they do not wish to be armed.  They wish to remain an unarmed force and are prepared to hunt down crime in any shape or form.  The monument in the Phoenix Park, which contains the tablet of honour with the names of the gallant men of the Garda Síochána who gave their lives when as unarmed men they took on armed people, speaks louder and more eloquently than could any words of mine or of anybody else.</P>
    <P>At a time like this we should put on record the appreciation that the nation has for the Garda.  This Bill <Col N="1127" /> has been largely agreed between all concerned.  It proposes to change the name of the Garda Representative Body, calling it instead an association, so that the negotiators may get off to a new start.  It is proposed to give wider negotiating powers to the new association.  Up to now the Garda Representative Body has authorisation merely to bring to the attention of the Commissioner or the Minister their complaints, suggestions or requirements.  It was not a properly organised or constituted negotiating body.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the association may get assistance from and consult outside bodies and associations, within certain limits, so that their case may be better put forward. I agree with this change and feel that it is a move in the right direction. Although the existing measure of 1924 may not have provided for or permitted the representative body to seek outside advice and assistance, to the credit of the Ministers for Justice and Commissioners concerned it was known that the Garda did, in fact, avail of specialist advice and services. It is proper that this should now be regularised and that we should not have written into the regulations that the representative body should not be permitted to do this or that, while at the same time turning a blind eye to their doing what was reasonable, although not provided for in the regulations.</P>
    <P>It is also provided that only paidup members of the association shall have the right to vote in elections for membership of the association to be set up.  Up to now, apparently, every member of the Garda Síochána was entitled to vote, whether he subscribed to the funds of the association or not. That was not desirable.  If people are to avail of the machinery of a representative body or association they should subscribe to it.  That is being provided for here.  The pension scheme is being brought into line with other pension schemes, including the Army pension scheme.  That is also a move in the right direction and something <Col N="1128" /> that can be supported.</P>
    <P>At present gardaí are called upon to administer unlimited numbers of Acts of Parliament.  They are called upon to enforce these Acts and to deal with sophisticated crimes unheard of in past years.  They are also expected to be familiar with the laws of evidence, court procedure and various other related matters.  I believe that the time devoted to the instruction of young gardaí is totally inadequate.  I do not want to be taken as criticising the Garda or the work they do.  They are brought into the depot with leaving certificate standard or its equivalent or perhaps even less and they are given a comparatively short period of training in Templemore.  I am not sure whether the training period lasts for three or six months.  I will not have time to conclude my remarks now and I will ascertain exactly what the training period is.  In my opinion the best teachers and the most receptive students in the world could not teach and learn respectively all that gardaí would require to learn before they would be qualified to do and discharge all the duties demanded of them.</P>
    <P>Many people, including judges, district justices, those involved in the media and others, are quick to criticise the members of the Garda, young and old, if they put a foot wrong.  I am not dealing with matters which are the subject of public attention at the moment.  I propose to deal with that later on.  Do these people who make such criticism think of the amount of instruction that the gardaí have received or the amount of time that has been given to them, either in their initial instruction course or in refresher courses later on, to perfect them in their jobs?</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business: Third Level Education Grants: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls upon the Government to raise immediately third level education grants and the eligibility limits which govern the award of such grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" /> Initially, I should like to welcome the new Minister for Education and to congratulate him upon his appointment. The next few years will be an important time in education and I can promise the Minister that he will have continuing vigilance over his activities from these benches and that we will support any of his attempts to get more money for the educational services, which are so important today, while at the same time insisting on the continuing need for radical reform and change within the system so that the money spent will not be wasted.</P>
    <P>The next few years are also going to be important because whether we like it or not they are going to be years of growth in education, especially in higher education.  The latest OECD tables do not show this country in a particularly happy place with regard to the participation rates in higher education.  In 1974, the latest year for which the full OECD figures are available, we had only 11 per cent of the appropriate age group in third level education.  This is little more than half the number in third level education in other European countries. There is going to be pressure for growth and we want to ensure that the pressure for growth is accompanied by pressure for change.</P>
    <P>We also have the very real point that there is at the moment, moving up through the second level educational system, a substantial number of young people who will, over the next few years, increasingly be demanding third level education.  So that even if we were only to plan for an increase of 1 per cent in those participation rates, that 1 per cent would strain our already overcrowded institutions of higher education well beyond their present levels.  If we are to raise our participation rates in higher education to anything like a realistic figure the changes that will have to be made are truly staggering.  At present there are about 33,000 students in higher education.  If we were to achieve parity of participation rates overnight with our European neighbours we would require between 70,000 and 90,000 places almost immediately to double <Col N="1130" /> the present number of places in our system.</P>
    <P>The argument about how many places should be provided in higher education is one for another time and I do not propose to go into it here. We are talking about who should get the places that are available, but I mentioned these figures in order to point out the enormity of the task faced by the Minister for Education and to indicate the extent of the financing which he will have to find to meet it.  It also underlines the importance of allocating the places that are available in the fairest and most democratic way possible.  The pressures that are on the existing places are already almost beyond belief.  There is a new central applications office servicing the universities. This year it received 14,000 applications for 5,000 first-year places.  The NIHE in Limerick received 2,400 applications for 360 places.  Some of the technological institutions in Dublin are receiving applications at the rate of 20 for each place.  When you consider that in Britain, where even now people complain about the difficulty of getting into higher education, there are only two people for each place in the universities, you will see how much worse off we are and how important it is that we allocate our available places fairly.</P>
    <P>It will not have escaped the notice of Members of this House that in the fairly recent past we had a general election.  In that general election, perhaps for the first time, education at all levels became very much an issue.  I believe that this is a change in Irish politics which we must welcome, a change for which the Labour Party, through their involvement in education at all levels, have been at least partly responsible.  In response to this new interest in education at a political issue and not just something related to the Church or county council or whatever, the then Opposition made a number of specific promises and gave specific undertakings to the electorate.  Some of them were made in their election manifesto and some of them were made before hand.  In the Fianna Fáil research and <Col N="1131" /> support services document on educational policy, which was published in 1977, there occurs the sentence &ldquo;Fianna Fáil will review and increase third level grants and scholarships using the consumer price index as a guideline.  En route grants will be provided where the appropriate conditions are fulfilled&rdquo;.  In the election manifesto itself we read the words, &ldquo;Fianna Fáil will immediately raise the third-level grants and mindful of the fact that eligibility limits have not been raised during a period of over 100 per cent inflation, will raise the limits realistically&rdquo;.  Ignoring the fact that this sentence was published after the grants and eligibility levels had been raised, we can say that this represents a clear commitment.  On page 22 of the same manifesto there is the sentence &ldquo;People in need have a right to income maintenance&rdquo;.  This particular pledge from the Fianna Fáil Party was underlined by the leader of that party, the present Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, when he visited the constituency of the present Minister for Education during the election campaign.  In <i>The Irish Press</i> of 6th June, 1977, in an article by the paper's education correspondent Pat Holmes, we read:</P>
    <P> As the Union of Students in Ireland awaits response from the parties on the main issues affecting their members, the Opposition Leader, Mr. Lynch, last night pledged that Fianna Fáil would raise third-level grants and eligibility limits to realistic levels in line with inflation. </P>
    <P>There are a couple of words here that are important and that is why the Parliamentary Labour Party put down this motion.  They are the words &ldquo;pledge&rdquo;, &ldquo;immediately&rdquo;, &ldquo;raise&rdquo;, &ldquo;realistically&rdquo;.  The Oxford English Dictionary, a copy of which is in our excellent Library, has a splendid definition of &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; which I would refer to the attention of the Minister.  It defines &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; as &ldquo;without any delay or lapse of time, instantly, directly, straight away, at once&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are now more than the celebrated <Col N="1132" /> 100 days into the new Government and we have not heard of any action on this pledge.  The students who might have voted on the strength of it are now in colleges or technological institutions on the grants which they, perhaps over-confidently, hoped would be raised.  This is the proper time to ask the new Government when they intend to implement this pledge and what their definition of &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; is because the redemption of that pledge is already overdue for the thousands of students who have gone into college for the first time this Autumn.  We do not want a situation in which the fulfilment of election promises is delayed to the point where the redemption of them becomes not the fulfilment of the original promise but a bribe to be forgotten after the election for which the promises were made.  This totally devalues political rhetoric and goodness knows it has been devalued enough already.</P>
    <P>I should like to talk about the background to the scheme.  It is a scheme which was launched by the party of the present Minister in 1967-68.  It is one of my contentions that many of the inadequacies of the present scheme stem from the fact that at its very introduction in 1968 it was under-financed, ill-conceived and wrongly structured.  My colleague, Deputy Eileen Desmond who was education spokesman for this party at that time pointed out many of these short-comings as also did Deputy Michael O'Leary.  To read their speeches to-day is to read something about the situation we are witnessing now in our third level institutions.</P>
    <P>One of the main defects of the original scheme, for example, and a defect that has been carried through to the present, is that it focussed primarily on the universities when all sensible educational thinking of the time was pointing to the need to develop a countervailing entrance to the universities, to help in particular students who were going to institutions other than university institutions.  The then Minister for Education, Deputy Lenihan said, as reported at columns 326-7 of the Official Report for April 24, 1968:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1133" />  The whole purpose of student grants is to equip the child for higher education and logically the only subjects that should count as regards the standard should be subjects to which the child will be devoting himself or herself in the university. </P>
    <P>Note the logical leap, the instant closing of the gap&mdash;higher education equals university education.  I am convinced this was the basic thinking behind the scheme.  That thinking, unfortunately, is with us to-day and has to be challenged.  The only way in which it can be challenged is to change the scheme, to incorporate in it the appropriate structural changes.  This is something we shall be looking to the Minister to undertake.</P>
    <P>The other main defeat in the scheme as it was introduced by the then Fianna Fáil Government was that it skated over some of the most horrific gaps in our education system.  At column 273 of the Official Report of the same date as that to which I have referred already, the then Minister for Education said:</P>
    <P>... the introduction of free post-primary education in September, 1967, has rendered unnecessary the provision of scholarships to second level education, so that we may now tackle the problem of enabling deserving students to proceed to third level studies at universities and comparable institutions. </P>
    <P>That sentence reads very hollow to-day because we all know that just as the grant system is not what we would wish it to be, so also the free education scheme which was introduced by the same Government at that time has become increasingly less free.  We know that the sham of pretending that a free post-primary education exists is the only possible foundation on which can be built an equally inadequate third level grant system.</P>
    <P>There is a poverty gap in the education system of which most educationalists and virtually all economists are aware.  I refer to the gap between the ending of compulsory education at 15 and the beginning, at 17 or 18, of third level education.  You can have all the third-level grants in the world <Col N="1134" /> but so long as you have people who cannot cross that gap, the grants will be of no use to them.  The costs of reaching the point at which one might or might not qualify for a third-level education grant are much heavier than many people suppose.  A couple of professors have calculated for the ESRI that for the average couple the cost of maintaining a child in education up to third level is about £700 a year, including basically the wages they would have had into the household had the child gone to work.  This is the poverty gap in education and it was the failure of the then Government to tackle that gap that has made the present third level system so much of a sham.</P>
    <P>Sometimes I think that the grants scheme at third level as devised in 1967-68 and as introduced to, unfortunately, an uncritical public, was almost one devised for people who did not exist.  It was almost as if the Minister of the time looked around at the possible entrants to third level education, identified a small single group of such entrants and then devised a grant scheme that would cater for them alone.  The scheme was a total Catch 22 situation.  It catered only for people of certain income levels or people whose farms were of a certain rateable valuation.  In so far as the majority of people were concerned their incomes were too high to enable them to avail of the grants while the very poor were too poor to allow their children to remain at school up to 17 so that in their case the grant was irrelevant anyway.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, therefore, that most people would not be in a position to avail of the grant and that the people for whom allegedly it was intended were too poor to meet the basic costs of keeping their children at school until such time as they might be able to avail of the grant.  This situation has long been recognised by educationalists and economists.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with the question of the several inadequacies of the present scheme.  They relate, first, to the levels of the scheme and, secondly, to the elegibility criteria.  I <Col N="1135" /> have argued already that the levels of the scheme in 1968 were not sufficient. Nine years have elapsed since then&mdash; some of them under Fianna Fáil administration and some under the National Coalition&mdash;and in all of this time inflation has taken place so that the grants have been progressively eroded.</P>
    <P>We can attempt now to put a figure on what the grant might be.  If we were to calculate it solely on the basis of inflation the present grant at the maximum level would be about £768. The Union of Students in Ireland, on criteria which I consider modest enough on all counts, say that it costs about £862 to support a student for the 32 weeks of the academic year and that is at a comparatively modest level of existence.  The present level of the grant, despite being increased during the term of office of the last Government, is now £350.  Obviously, there is a substantial gap, a gap which means that for some students agonising choices have to be made as, for instance, between buying food and buying books.  All this sounds as if one is asking for a monumental increase in the current level of the grant but it may be looked at in this way: one can say that if the Fianna Fáil grant in 1968 was inadequate it was at least somewhere in the region of what might have been expected.  In fact, the figure that has been suggested as the figure to which the grant might be increased, represents an increase of only 12 per cent on the real value in 1968.  That is the extent of the Fianna Fáil promise.  We are entitled to ask whether they now consider this 12 per cent to be too high.</P>
    <P>Again, on the question of levels, comparisons can be made with Northern Ireland, although I hesitate to make such comparisons on many occasions because of the substantial differences between the two jurisdictions. However, some of the differences are so substantial as to merit special comment.  In Northern Ireland, for instance, a student gets a bigger grant if he is married and the level of the extra grant he will get for one dependant is higher than the largest <Col N="1136" /> grant any student can get down here. Why?  Because of the difference between £350 and £470.  We have to ask whether this scheme is not operating simply as pocket-money for some people or forcing some students into serious situations in which they have to make the agonising choice between eating or study.  There is a school of thought which says that, given the existence of higher education grants and the fact that they have been increased on several occasions since 1968, it is very surprising that there are not as many students in college from the poorer sections of the population as one might expect.  This thesis is surprisingly fashionable, not least because it helps to underwrite suspicion in the minds of the otherwise well-meaning that people who are the more disadvantaged in our society are less interested in education.  A classic example of this occurs in a recent survey carried out by a member of the administration staff in University College, Dublin, and published in the <i>UCD News</i> of July-September, 1976, the staff organ of the college.  Miss Burns who wrote this article based it on a survey she carried out of the social background of students entering the college over a ten-year period.  Her figures are fascinating and I have no quarrel with them.  What I do quarrel with is her interpretation.  I quote:</P>
    <P>... over the last ten years, student representation from the &ldquo;working class&rdquo; grouping has increased by about 6%.  The drop in the upper middle class plus group is about 4%.  During this ten year period, in 1968, the government made a large increase in university grants, this provision might lead one to expect that even after only 7 years the socio-economic background of university students would have grown more rapidly, than indicated in the present survey, to be more representative of the population as a whole.  However, as Dr. Nevin pointed out in her report, after comparison with several European countries where third level education is more heavily subsidised, money is not the problem to be overcome, but <Col N="1137" /> the lack of &ldquo;family motivation and aspiration&rdquo; in the &ldquo;lower social groupings&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>This is a myth and it is about time that this myth was nailed in this House if not in the mind of the Minister for Education.  It is all very well for people to say that higher education grants are not taken up because disadvantaged people are not interested in education.  In recent years there have been substantial proportions of moneys voted for higher education which have not been taken up.  People will always say that disadvantaged students will not take up grants because they are not interested in education. The only possible answer to that is to ask how many of the people who make this accusation and this analysis of the situation have ever tried to live on £350 a year.  You have to throw into the balance either an awful lot of cash or an awful lot of idealism.  You cannot eat idealism, you cannot spread it on bread.  This is a fundamental misconception.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of argument, if it were true that the reason that grants are not taken up is that people are not interested in education, the grants could be increased immediately to a realistic figure; you can double them, you can make them £1,000 and you would save your money because people still would not apply for them. I bet they would be applying for them if they were £1,000 because then they would represent more nearly what the most disadvantaged people need for study at a university institution. Our party have always insisted that both the levels of grants and eligibility criteria should be reviewed appropriately to ensure that students who get places in institutions of higher education should not be unfairly discriminated against.</P>
    <P>On the question of the eligibility criteria several points can be made. Even though I was glad at the time that the upward revision was made, I must say that the present income limits are probably still too low.  It is now time for the Minister to look at them again.  He has promised to do so and he has promised action on them immediately.  We want to know <Col N="1138" /> when &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; will be.  Something has to be done to ensure an appropriate balance between the eligibility criteria for people who are wage and salary earners or self-employed in urban and rural areas.  It may be argued that this will never happen satisfactorily until we have greater horizontal equity in the taxation system but things can still be done.</P>
    <P>The Union of Students in Ireland have suggested a scheme whereby full grants will be given to students with a claw-back on the parental income tax system.  I would be interested to know what the Minister thinks about it.  I would also be interested to know whether, instead of allocating a grant as at present on a person's gross income, the Minister will be prepared to allocate it on the nett income. This, would have to be accompanied by some appropriate provision of tax allowances for dependent children in third level education, but it would at least create a situation in which any ambiguity about the eligibility of any child for any grant could be resolved by a certificate from the Revenue Commissioners.  The more people who come within the general ambit of the Revenue Commissioners the better.</P>
    <P>The inequity of the present system is shown in that it does not subsidise large numbers of people who have got places in educational institutions and whose means may be comparatively limited.  The Minister should consider, not subsidising individuals <i>per se</i>, but subsidising the places in these third level institutions so that people who are accepted by third level institutions will have an automatic entitlement, depending on the means test that I am talking about, to a grant which will enable them to complete their education without any undue hardship.</P>
    <P>The present scheme has a number of anomalies some of which have emerged only comparatively recently. For example, there is an anomaly that a person who fails to qualify for a grant for his child this year and may qualify in a subsequent year after a change or an upward revision of the grants will not come under the scheme unless his income actually falls below <Col N="1139" /> the level which would have entitled him to a grant in the year in which he first applied.  This can cause extra-ordinary hardship in families where the income may have fallen dramatically, for example through a parent going on pension, and where the outgoings have remained almost constant.</P>
    <P>Another problem relates to the level of the fee subsidy.  In broad terms fee subsidies cover all fees in institutions in this jurisdiction, but because of recent policy changes in Britain fees being charged by Northern Ireland educational institutions, at which these grants are also tenable, are now going up year by year.  Next year they will be of the order of £500 or £600 in some of the institutions in Northern Ireland to which grant-aided students from the Republic will go.  Very often too they will go to these institutions not because they want to be there but because the courses which those institutions offer are not available in the Republic.  A very active action committee in County Donegal, including, I am sure, many members of the Minister's own party, are very vocal on this point.  I urge the Minister to listen to them.  In the new university at Coleraine a certain four-year degree course has its first year as a certificate course and because it is regarded as a certificate course it is not eligible for a grant from the Department of Education here.  These are matters which the Minister might not be aware of and which I am glad to bring to his attention.  I will be anxious to see that he does something about them.</P>
    <P>It is still possible for students of comparatively insignificant means to get a place in a university with three honours, which will not entitle them to a grant, while a neighbour who may be considered to be better off will squeak into a university place with two honours.  In other words, the student with two honours will benefit from the ongoing subsidy of about £1,000 per student per year which the State pays in indirect and direct grants to the universities.  The other student who has a higher academic standard cannot receive the subsidy from the State because he is one honour short <Col N="1140" /> of the particular level.  It is also theoretically possible, I believe, for a student to qualify for a grant but not to be able to get a place in the institution of his choice or in the course of his choice within a particular institution. What is the point of that?  This is the sort of anomaly the Minister should be looking at.</P>
    <P>There is a particularly urgent anomaly in the whole Cork area where, owing to a disagreement about the definition of distance, large numbers of students already in their first year in college have not been given grants to which they are certainly entitled.  The dispute relates to whether or not these students are living close to a university.  The Department's response to this dispute has been, as I understand it correctly, to freeze grants to all students affected, so that there are students coming from Roscarbery, Skibbereen, Baltimore and probably from Hare Island who are not being given the grant at the higher level because of the dispute about the eligibility of students who live closer to Cork city.  Some of these places in west Cork are probably as far from Cork as Cork is from Dublin. A former Minister for Education, Deputy Lenihan, once gave it as his interpretation that a student would get the grant at the higher level if he lived further than a reasonable journey in the morning from his third level institution.  I would put it to the Minister that west Cork is considerably more than a reasonable morning's journey from any institution in Cork city and that the failure to resolve this dispute is causing severe hardship to many students, especially those in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Another anomaly relates to the question of students who are following a full-time course for professional musicianship.  There is no such course in Ireland or Northern Ireland at the moment.  Students have to go to England.  There are only about 20 of them in the country.  Can the Minister not see his way to making people like this eligible for grants pending the suitable reintegration of music into our third level education system.</P>
    <P>The final and perhaps the greatest <Col N="1141" /> anomaly is simply the fact that parental income alone is the income that counts for the definition of the grant.  There is no grant for married students.  There is no grant&mdash;and this is an even harder case&mdash;for a girl who may be half-way through her career at college, who becomes pregnant and has a baby, is thrown out of the house&mdash;this happens still in holy Ireland today&mdash;and wants to continue with her course to achieve a qualification so that she can keep and look after her baby.  There is no grant for her because her grant is dependent on her parents' income.  Worse still, even if she were entitled to a grant on her parents' income, any miserable pittance of an income which she might have to try to keep body and soul together would be added to her parents' income and might exclude her from a grant on that basis.</P>
    <P>There is an enormous discrimination in the operation of this grants system against people who are not school leavers.  Various local authorities operate schemes whereby it is possible for people to defer the grants for two years, but that it all.  This is quite unfair.  It discriminates not just against a minority but against a huge number of people whose educational experience, through no fault of their own, has been drastically curtailed. According to the 1971 census there are living in Ireland at the moment about one million people whose education ended at primary school.  These are the people for whom the scheme was not conceived.  These are the people who are left high and dry by this scheme.  I would argue very strongly that that is a lot of people and we should be doing something more about them.  The universities themselves have not been conspicious in granting educational facilities to these people.  If they are not going to do it, it is about time the Government were firm and did something about it.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the absence of an annual review, and not only that, but the absense of a review which was promised by the last Government and which the last Government promised would be in operation by the autumn <Col N="1142" /> of this year.  I want to ask the Minister now what has happened to that review, what the result of it has been, and are we going to see the result of the work that was done in the Department on a fundamental review on the basis of this scheme, a review which I would argue is long overdue? I appreciate that not all the anomalies in the original scheme have been cured in four years of government by the National Coalition, despite the fact that when the National Coalition left office the grants were 45 per cent higher than the inadequate basis on which they had been presented to the incoming Fianna Fáil Government. We are now in a new situation.  The Government have made promises and the electorate and particularly the young people in that electorate are looking to the Government to keep those promises.</P>
    <P>The new Minister for Education, with that roundness of phrase for which he is justly famous, apparently told some students who went to see him recently and complained about the inefficiencies of the scheme : &ldquo;I will be not like the puck goat in the Bible, sent out into the desert for the sins of the Coalition&rdquo;.  If the Minister is sent out into the desert it will not be for the sins of the National Coalition but for the sins of Fianna Fáil.  Fianna Fáil have four years to commit those sins.  They may or may not take pleasure in them, but I suspect that if they do it will be the last pleasure they will have for a long time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to be here tonight to witness this extra-ordinary change of attitude on behalf of the Labour Party.  We were told by the previous speaker that we face a new situation, and a completely new situation exists tonight as against the situation that existed among the Labour Party members in February last when a motion similar to this was tabled by the then Opposition spokesman on behalf of our party and now Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to see the upsurge of interest in educational matters among Labour Party members.  It is <Col N="1143" /> hardly a coincidence that a new man has been chosen for the position of spokesman on Education, and I must compliment him on his genuine interest in education and the very broad spectrum he covered in education, and the reluctance he showed to deal with the specific motion before us because it must have been an embarrassment to a man such as himself.  The word &ldquo;sham&rdquo; has been used tonight and I think this motion is the greatest sham we have had from the Opposition benches since they resumed their natural role in opposition.  On 9th February last the Minister, then Deputy John Wilson, tabled the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to increase the money value of third level grants and scholarships and to update eligibility limits.</P>
    <P>The wording of this motion is remarkably like that.  When that motion came before the House, no Labour Member contributed.  There were 20 Deputies in the House and it is extra-ordinary that the 14 Labour Deputies of the present 18 signatories did not feel it worth their while to contribute or even to grace the House with their presence on that occasion.  The only one of them who was here was Deputy Treacy, the then Ceann Comhairle, and one could say he could not help being here when it came to his turn to take the Chair.</P>
    <P>The proposer of this motion spoke of ensuring continuing vigilance.  I consider that to be an unfortunate expression, an empty cliché, because we found no evidence of any vigilance whatever.  I trust their new-found vigilance will be continued now.</P>
    <P>Let me say at this stage that we agree with the motion and that we will even vote for it, if necessary.  We agree with it in essence, and we wish to show our agreement, but we should like to use this opportunity to expose the sham behind the motion.  What change has happened to render vocal 18 just men when 14 of them were silent a few months ago?  Some of them were dons, the products of third level <Col N="1144" /> education, who would have been well able to contribute on matters such as this.  Others of them, I am sure, would be referred to as the horny-handed sons of labour who might have been excused from contributing.  However, they were all dumb and glum.  Deputy Horgan wound up with some biblical quotations.  Perhaps I should continue and note that Saint Paul, when he had a fall on his way to Damascus, saw the light.  It is good to see that the Opposition on their fall in the election and on their way to those benches also saw the light.</P>

Ní dhein siad fhéin faic nuair a bhí an seans acu, agus bhí ceithre bliain acu.</P>
      <P>This is a cheeky motion, an admission of the failure of the Opposition to do anything in the past four years. What they are saying is &ldquo;We did not do anything in the past four years. What have you done and why have you not done it in the past four months?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I agree with the motion.  We are committed to a proper system of grants and income limits.  We have been innovators in this.  We have been consistent in our policy.  I do not know the Minister's mind but I have every confidence that he will keep his promises just as other Fianna Fáil Ministers have kept their promises.  I refer to the promises which we have kept immediately, such as road tax and housing grants and loans.  The impossible may take some time and it is impossible immediately to redress the wrongs of the Coalition Government and to make up for their omissions during four years of misrule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter has been discussed at county council level.  We are the party who gave the poor man's child a chance of second and third level education. <Col N="1145" /> We were pioneers in it.  Our record is one of continuing progress and we have always identified the real needs in education.  When previous Ministers for Education brought proposals before the House they got very little support from Fine Gael and Labour speakers who pointed out that certain of our innovations which since have been appreciated were impossible to implement.</P>
    <P>What have the Coalition done in this field?  The previous Minister, Deputy P. Barry, gave us a last gasp measure, to increase the university grants, but not the allowances, at the top from £300 to £350 and at the bottom by about £4.  He was not long in that office and perhaps we may be thankful for that.  Previously he had responsibility for tourism and said in the House that we should be very careful not to attract too many tourists lest we would ruin the quality of life here.  It was pointed out to him that numbers in regard to tourism was the problem and that that was the time to worry about the quality of life.  He did not see any dilution in the quality of the intake to our universities because of the recommendations he made as Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>The result of the neglect for four years and the pittances granted during that time was that dreadful sacrifices have had to be made by parents to send bright children to universities. Those who were unfortunate enough to qualify for university education in the past four years were categorised in their leaving certificate year.  Pupils who qualified in 1976 and whose parents approached me when we came into office to see if the position could be improved had no provision made for them at all in the 1977 scheme.  I could cite four cases of hardship in my constituency as a result of this. They had hoped, because of the publicity given to the increases, that they would qualify, but there was an instruction leaflet issued to county councils pointing out that the category in which the regulation placed the children in the year in which they did their exam is still maintained.  That was in small print and did not get the publicity it merited.  Lack of money <Col N="1146" /> has been instrumental in keeping pupils from third level education which they would have otherwise enjoyed.</P>
    <P>Yesterday Kildare County Council, at my instance, passed a resolution asking the Minister if it were possible to change this system of categorising pupils in the year they do their examination and to endeavour to backdate any future improvements in university grants.  It will be awkward for the Minister to do this because he will have enough trouble trying to look after present pupils without trying to undo the wrongs of the previous regime.</P>
    <P>Now that I have the opportunity, I would point out to the Minister that in a country whose economy is based very much on agriculture, and when we hear that any improvement in agriculture must be based on our food processing industry, it has come to my notice that a pupil who wished to pursue third level education in food processing, particularly meat marketing, found that not only were grants not available to him but that no such course existed here and he had to go abroad.  If we are serious about meat marketing, which has a big bearing on our economy, this is something that should occupy our attention.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to the previous speaker harping on the word &ldquo;immediately&rdquo;.  It might be well for him to read what Deputy P. Barry, the then Minister for Education, said in February last.  He said that February was not the time to look for changes for the next academic year.  I want to quote now what the former Minister for Education said on 8th February last:</P>
    <P>From the Opposition's point of view the timing of this motion is wrong.  If they had put this motion down prior to 10th September, 1976, I would see some merit in it or some reason for putting it down, or if they put it down next autumn if the Government did not act on the basis of the report to which I will refer later on again there would be some merit in it.  Knowing as they must that this investigation is being conducted at the moment, and knowing the results are not available <Col N="1147" /> yet, and knowing that on the basis of those results and the conclusions drawn from that report any changes in the eligibility level will be made, I cannot see any point in the Opposition putting this motion down now.  To prod my predecessor last autumn into conducting this report, or to prod me to act on the basis of that report would be more understandable than choosing this twilight period to put down a motion and have it debated in this House. For that reason I will be confidently asking supporters of the Government to reject this motion. </P>

The only difference is that we will carry out what we requested in February last. The Minister in that quotation referred to a &ldquo;twilight period&rdquo;.  That is a euphemism because that Minister's and his predecessor's time could be referred to as the dark ages of education and the return of Fianna Fáil has signalled a new dawn in education at all levels.  During that debate in February last Deputy Barry, the Minister for Education in February, referred to Deputy Wilson, by way of interjection when Deputy Briscoe was speaking, as an inhuman Opposition spokesman.  &ldquo;Inhuman&rdquo; was the word he used.  The people made their choice recently and they would have referred to the former Ministers as indifferent, inept and ineffective&mdash;so ineffective that they removed them from office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have every confidence our Minister will approach this matter with a humane point of view and improve the lot of the third level student.  Our manifesto committed us to that and we will carry out our promise.  We will need no prodding from Labour to do so.  We have nailed our colours to the mast.  We did that last February and they are still there.  In marked contrast to February last the Deputies now occupying the Opposition benches <Col N="1148" /> have become vocal on this subject. Absent friends have come in and occupied the benches behind.  The Leader of the Labour Party and 61 Coalition Deputies voted against this motion last February while 55 Fianna Fáil Deputies voted for it.  The country must be glad the balance has been redressed and that we are now in a position to carry out our promises.  We backed the horse of our choice.  The electorate backed us.  Labour backed down.  They had nothing to contribute last February.  They are like the people who would like to back a horse when the race is over.  Fianna Fáil are now in power and we will help the student, the student the Coalition Government did not help.  The attitude behind this motion is like that of the man who asks &ldquo;Which way did the mob go? I am supposed to be leading it&rdquo;.  Your motion is saying: &ldquo;Which way are Fianna Fáil going?  We pretend to be leading them.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to make a few comments with regard to my attitude on this motion. This is the first opportunity I have had of expressing my good wishes for the new Minister for Education.  I do so sincerely because education is of fundamental importance to the welfare of the State.  I wish the Minister well. He was a vociferous fighter for education in Opposition and I trust the success of the election campaign has not dented that enthusiasm.  The previous speaker tempts me to veer away a little from a pledge I gave during the election, which was not to look back too often, not to indulge in personal attacks and not to be petty about important issues with which this House is expected to concern itself. In all fairness, however, it must be said that the empty talk by the previous speaker does nothing to help us to tackle the problem that exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1149" /> The only reason why this motion is tabled is that people are concerned. The previous speaker was concerned about the use of the word &ldquo;immediately&rdquo;.  The motion demands immediate action from the Government and the reason why it does so is that Fianna Fáil won the election on the basis of promises many of which, it was alleged, would be implemented immediately.  It is the manifesto which uses the word &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; and not anybody on this side of the House.  This manifesto, in my opinion, may easily become the albatross of the present Government because too many &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; promises are not being implemented.  Indeed, only today I was astonished to hear a Parliamentary Secretary state that, despite the pledge given in the election campaign, new information had come to light which indicated that the pledge might not now be fulfilled. In other words, the sheer thrust of Fianna Fáil during the election campaign and the way in which they sold their promises with regard to education and other issues now makes us concerned when we see time passing and nothing being done and anything that has been done in the educational sphere so far done rather badly and without consultation and in a way which is likely to set progress back a considerable distance.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the whole concept of the grants system needs reviewing. The idea of the grant basically is the allocation of a resource from one section to another section to assist that latter section in obtaining a right to education which presumably those who are doing the assisting already have. What is really needed now is an in-depth study of the system.  This ideal philosophical basis of trying to ensure and encourage equality of educational participation has not been achieved.  I have a very real interest in education and the reports I have read so far indicate to me that the grant system, however well intentioned, is probably doing little more than compounding an educational elite.  I believe it needs basic rethinking and I am not afraid to say so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan made a very thorough and comprehensive survey of <Col N="1150" /> the existing anomalies, of the need for reforms.  His was a very well balanced statistical approach.  All the points he made were worthy of being made and I trust the Minister will take full account of them.  There is not now a great deal left to be said. The question of how we apply our grants system, those who fund it and those who benefit, is of vital importance if we are to talk in the future about ensuring equality of educational opportunity and participation.  I suggest it would be socially unacceptable if the fact were to be underlined, shall we say, that there was little more at present in the grants system than a siphoning off of moneys from one part of the community to comprehend a section of the community which perhaps does not need it all that badly because the real hardship being done by the inadequacies of the present system has not been truly monitored.  What we are really talking about is third level education, grants to help people who have already decided that there is an intrinsic value in education, who are not culturally or socially deprived to the extent that they do not see the merit of education.  We are talking about people who are, so to speak, already educationally motivated and concerned about their welfare as human beings.  But there are large segments of the community, who are also taxpayers and ratepayers and contribute to the State coffers, who do not benefit and are never likely to benefit from third level education and whose attitude to education is that it is something far removed from them, something related to classes and a part of the social spectrum with which they have little in common, something for the other man's child.  It is about those I would express the greatest concern.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the records of the House, which I also have before me but I shall not quote them.  I do not believe it is quite fair to go through the records and extract comments, asides, and interjections, some said in jest, some seriously and some in the heat of the moment, and try to hang them around people's necks.  I would not like to proceed in <Col N="1151" /> that way in any contribution it may be my honour and privilege to make in this House.  However, I think it reasonable to say without quoting that it is evident to me, having read the comments and contributions of the new Minister for Education and his Parliamentary Secretary, that they were both very vehement and concerned about the level of higher education grants&mdash; and rightly so.  They expressed their concern passionately and with conviction. They based it on a well-thoughtout  philosophical foundation of concern for all the young people.  At present, I would not quibble unduly with the fact that all promises are not immediately put into effect but I would be concerned if some evidence about implementing this particular pledge was not to be seen soon because I think it is not one that involves a great deal of confrontation with outside bodies.  If education has problems at all, one of them is the many minefields of vested interests littering the whole horizon of education.  It does not need confrontation with these people.  Essentially it needs a political decision based on a well-thought-out social philosophy that more money is needed and will be allocated even if it has to be taken from some other part of the public purse.</P>
    <P>I presume that this document which we are discussing was thought out before it was put in black and white and that it was produced in the knowledge and expectation that the situation would come about where it would be implemented.  Presumably, if the will was there, there was also at least the glimmer of the way.  The evidence is not there at present.  I gather that the new Minister has a reputation as a classical scholar and I heard a number of references to that tonight.  The number of classical scholars and of people referring to the classics appears to be growing.  I cannot resist one biblical reference.  I know the Minister is concerned and I should hate to think that he would be classified by lack of action at any stage as a whited sepulchre.  I feel sure that would not be his wish.  I am willing to wait and see but not indefinitely, because the <Col N="1152" /> kind of move we are considering is not one requiring a great deal of ruminating and thinking out.  The thinking has already been done and the commitment given but the political decision is still awaited.  It should come soon.</P>
    <P>The reason why I am unhappy with the grants system is because we are dealing with people who are already involved in the educational mainstream and are on their way to third level education and benefiting from the knowledge, the family background, the cultural and educational environment which says: &ldquo;It is a good thing for you to be educated.&rdquo; They appreciate this and are striving to obtain access but any objective survey shows that children, particularly, for example, in urban areas, have been and are being deprived and will continue to be deprived whatever titivation is administered to the scheme of third level grants.  Would-be students in our city communities have a much slimmer opportunity of ever seeing third level institutions than anybody from either the towns or suburbs.  Anybody who wishes to know more about that will find it in a very good survey done by an tAthair Mícheál MacGréil called &ldquo;Educational Opportunity in Dublin&rdquo;, where it is quite clear that people living in cities are not alone deprived in terms of amenity and environment but most fundamentally and perhaps most vitally in educational terms.  That is the sad part of it because educational deprivation begets so much other deprivation.  That situation exists and nothing has been, or is being done about it.</P>
    <P>What is the purpose of this debate? What should be our goal?  I suggest it is to try to ensure that all young people have the greatest degree of educational opportunity possible, and not just opportunity but that they be allowed and encouraged to participate. We have many miles to go before anything arising at that stage has to be done.  In the future it may be necessary for the Government to consider&mdash;I should be interested if the Minister has any thoughts on it&mdash;whether it may be desirable not only to give a student a grant to encourage him to pay in a meagre fashion the expenses of being <Col N="1153" /> at third level institutions but whether it is necessary to encourage the type of participation we are all presumably concerned about by grant-aiding the parents in respect of loss of income involved. We might have to extend that thinking also to primary and secondary level.  There is always a difficulty about these matters but if there is at least a political will and aspiration there, it is a first step.</P>
    <P>Our primary schools are affected by absenteeism and truancy of all kinds, as are our secondary schools through volition and the attraction of short-term local employment in badly-paid jobs in poor conditions.  This proves a distraction for some people and an economic necessity for some parents, so that effectively third level institutions are sealed off for all time from most of the young people in our cities and from very many on a national basis.  A certain range of our social spectrum&mdash; more power to them&mdash;continue to benefit from public funds in relation to third level education and it is their children who will benefit in the next generation also unless radical rethinking is applied in this whole area.  That is why I am concerned that some sort of temporary or occasional adjustment to the level of grants for third level education might distract us from the basic need while it might satisfy us in some psychological way that we are doing our job in relation to helping third level education.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing to have grants.  It may also be necessary to consider other measures such as loans to students which are not uncommon in other countries, which can be repaid eventually, if necessary.  That may be open to consideration.  Unquestionably it is a sad situation that many of our students embark on a career in education without knowing what costs are likely to fall on their heads within the following year or two years because of sporadic increases in fees, the unprojected and unplanned upping of costs of all kinds, particularly fees for courses, fees for residential students, and so on.</P>
    <P>At the very least the Minister might consider&mdash;and it would be a major breakthrough in the context, narrow <Col N="1154" /> though I believe it to be, of the grants system&mdash;as he has indicated in the manifesto or certainly I have heard it somewhere; perhaps in the debate in last February's motion&mdash;that such grants should be linked to the consumer price index.  If these grants are to be meaningful, if they are to be socially just&mdash;and we are concerned about social justice&mdash;they should be linked to the consumer price index. If we decide today that £300 or £400 is the figure appropriate to the cost of a student in today's economic climate, it is morally wrong for us to allow that figure to stand over a period of two or three years if all other costs have gone up.  Therefore, some annual reassessment of grants is necessary and essential if we are to honour the moral obligations implicit in saying : &ldquo;Grants are a good thing and this is a good scheme in itself.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has a difficulty, as indeed his predecessors had, because education has always had a relatively low political profile.  I am not sure why that is.  I assume it has something to do with two reasons.  The first is that massive investment in education, if such ever happens, will tend not to show immediate results.  Essentially education is about investment in the future.  Certainly it is a generation away.  It is an effort to mould our future society in a way which we see to be right and proper.  Investment in education, therefore, has that kind of thinking behind it.  Unfortunately with the cyclical nature of politics and the need to show results in the immediate short term, sometimes Ministers for Education will come under political pressure and be distracted from investing large sums in education because the results will not be shown in the immediate near future.  I think I picked up the words &ldquo;the immediate near future&rdquo; over the past few days.  I have a feeling it was the Minister for Fisheries who coined the phrase.  I hope it is not contagious but I suspect it is beginning to be.</P>
    <P>The other reason possibly is that&mdash;I do not really think this, but it is worth saying just in case there might be an element of truth in it&mdash;an educated <Col N="1155" /> people are an enlightened people and an enlightened people are politically choosey and politically perceptive people.  They will not long indulge poor standards of public politics.  Unfortunately part of the problem in certain areas of educational deprivation is that there is not merely little educational participation but far too little political participation, even in the minimum terms of voting.  Sadly, but inevitably perhaps in the present political situation and within the confines of human nature, people will tend obviously to be attracted to and listen to those who are more articulate in society, those who can vocalise their problems and their difficulties more than those who do not place a great deal of credence in the political system.  Therefore, people who are educationally deprived also become low on the list of political priorities.  That can happen.  I am not saying it does happen.  It may be something that might be considered.</P>
    <P>The present grant system, therefore, is to an extent a bit of a masquerade. It is insidious if you like in that to a degree it continues to compound the present situation.  It continues to give to people who may not, in fact, be the most needy while, as Deputy Horgan has pointed out, it tends to make it unrealistic for people who genuinely want access and who cannot get it.  I stress particularly the income limits which are totally unrealistic as, indeed, they always were.  This is perhaps exacerbated to a degree at present, and was particularly so in the past number of years, by virtue of the earning power of people in professions in areas of work which were not considered to be all that attractive but whose earning power is now very substantial which, of course, puts them outside the limit. In many cases, these are precisely the individuals who could benefit and should benefit educationally from a rethinking of our whole approach to investment in education.</P>
    <P>Because it relates to the whole kernel of the scheme, I should like also to refer to the question of access.  That is what we are talking about&mdash;access to third level and access to university, and not just university but other <Col N="1156" /> institutions, colleges of technology, and so on.  Personally I am very unhappy indeed with the criteria operating in relation to access for young people to third level institutions.  After all, education is a process.  It is a continuum and sometimes I fear those involved in education perhaps do not consider that as often as they should.</P>
    <P>For the child there is no real differentiation between primary, secondary, vocational or third level education. It is part of a long process.  Unfortunately, therefore, what happens in the early years is that the school children go to the classes into which they may be put, the temporary distractions of puberty, or the temporary failing of children in classes in primary or secondary schools, may dictate their future or their non future in the third level situation.  Therefore there should be a reconsideration of the question of access to third level education.</P>
    <P>I do not accept as educationally sound or socially just a system which dictates that alleged honours or grades as they may be called, in a specific number of subjects are appropriate for entry.  That process, that attitude is outmoded.  I can understand it, of course, because of the huge numbers of students looking for the very small number of places available.  There are two worries about that.  One is what I would call the almost Orwellian attitude it typifies.  This selection process can, to some degree, compound the social situation in our society.  We are choosing on values we believe to be right and therefore we are further adding to that type of judgment and that values system.  Essentially this is undemocratic.  I will not say any more about that at the moment.</P>
    <P>These usually autonomous institutions cream off, in a way which some would allege as being almost nepotistic, the so-called educational achiever.  I do not think that is wise. I do not think it is right for our young people.  I do not think it is right for the health of the nation.  I do not think it is in accordance with the constitutional declaration of the right of all young people to be cherished equally. Obviously it would take a great deal of time to develop that in detail <Col N="1157" /> but I just mention the point in passing as I believe it to be important.</P>
    <P>At the same time anyone who says that has, I suppose, an obligation to confront the resources problem which exists.  How do you fit thousands of students into lecture theatres which are too small?  In my own time I recall sitting on the floor during lectures because there were no places.  I would be interested to hear if the Minister has a view on this.  I believe a new attitude to resources in education is necessary.  The facts are that our educational resources are under-utilised in many cases with the possible exception of the vocational system.  Our schools and our colleges are closed more often than they are open.  We have not tended to integrate into the educational process modern technological aids.  Inevitably, economic and social pressures, due to the need to democratise education, will bring about a situation where the media, television and radio, will be utilised to a far greater degree than they have been traditionally here.  A new look will have to be taken at the role which correspondence courses, the concept of the university and, indeed, secondary school of the air should play in our educational system of the future.</P>
    <P>I envisage a situation where, with the continuing growth in the number of teachers, it may be desirable that instead of students going to the teacher into classrooms which do not exist at present and which the Minister will not be able to build because the infrastructure is not there, it will be necessary for teachers to go to groups of students.  There is nothing educationally unsound about that.  It stood us in good stead years ago.  Flexibility and the willingness to grasp all opportunities to use technology and available resources should be looked at.  I recognise the problems.  The management of schools will not particularly relish the idea of schools being open longer than they are at present.  Teaching staffs, of which I was one up to June last, may not, obviously be too happy with the idea of having extended hours but it does not mean that.  It does not mean infringement on management; it does <Col N="1158" /> not mean the extension of teaching hours.  It means, firstly, the political will to say that there are options open to us rather than the mad dash to build more schools all of which will remain closed every evening after 4 p.m. and for three or four months of the year. Such a process must obviously be done &mdash;I am sure the Minister is particularly keen about this in the light of his recent experience&mdash;with adequate and full consultations with all the interests involved.</P>
    <P>There is a resources problem but I suggest that thinking in terms of it being merely one of providing more money is simplistic and unjust.  It is much deeper than that and the healthy educational system would take into account the way we use our existing resources.  In my view we will hear a great deal more about the way we use our resources not just in education but right across the board.  In education a study should be undertaken rapidly of educational resources with recommendations on how to improve the present usage of such resources.  There is room for radical improvement in that area.  I wish to underline the great need for a new approach to education in the urban areas.  I ask the Minister to sympathetically consider&mdash;I say this in the spirit of hopefully trying to be helpful and constructive&mdash;one of the difficulties a young child has in the urban situation.  It is that the urban environment is hostile from the educational point of view.  A child living in an over-crowded flat cannot study and, therefore, he or she does badly at school with the result that his or her access to university and, indeed, secondary education in a meaningful sense, is blocked.  In effect, he or she becomes a drop out.  The other point I wish to draw the Minister's attention to is the question of the social cost of neglecting a basic review of resources, not just in the third level system.  I am chairman of the visiting committee of what used be called a borstal and I learned that the educational and demographic facts are clear.  There is a correlation between crime, juvenile delinquency and social deviation of all kinds and educational deprivation.  Any work the Minister undertakes to bring <Col N="1159" /> about at third level, or at any level, a change in educational deprivation would have a wonderful spin-off right across the whole social spectrum.  It would be a marvellous contribution to the welfare of our community.  I would be grateful if the Minister would consider the points I raised and I wish to thank him for listening to me with courtesy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I should like to say how much I appreciate the kind wishes of the spokesman on Education of the Labour Party as he expressed them at the outset of his contribution.  I also welcome him from the rarefied atmosphere of the Upper House to the Dáil chamber. I did not precede him all that long ago into it but I am sure he will find it a rougher kind of place and will find us not so cultured as the little section of the Seanad which he used haunt, even after he had taken the Labour Party Whip.  I am grateful to him also for his guarantee of vigilance during the period of this Government's holding office.  It is a form of a tribute if a <Col N="1160" /> person indulges in vigils in one's honour.  I am sure Deputy Horgan will see, in the course of this vigil, much that will enlighten him and much that will draw from him respect for a party which is and always has been dedicated to educational progress.  He knows in his heart that what I am saying is true and the very format of his speech indicated that he understood which party made real progress at any stage in the history of the State.</P>
      <P>I should also like to think Deputy Keating for his kind words and good wishes to me.  He obviously spoke from experience in his own educational field.  Although he wandered quite a lot away from the theme of this motion, his sincerity was evident from his words and general demeanour. I am sure he, too, will take part in the vigil and he, too, will have contributions to make which will be helpful to us in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>Following the provision of moneys <Col N="1048" /> earlier this year by my Department for schemes of improvement in the maintenance services of health boards the Midland Health Board engaged a number of maintenance staff in direct employment on a temporary basis on schemes of maintenance work throughout the region.</P>
      <P>Fourteen of these temporary staff were employed in St. Loman's Hospital, Mullingar, and St. Peter's Hospital, Castlepollard.  Some of these staff were employed in connection with the provision of a temporary kitchen and staff dining hall at St. Loman's.  The temporary kitchen and staff dining hall were required to facilitate the commencement of a contract for a new kitchen and staff dining hall.</P>
      <P>Because of a work-to-rule and strike action by maintenance staff and the pressing nature of the contract for a new kitchen and staff dining hall, the board were obliged to make alternative arrangements to finish off the temporary facilities.  During the period of the strike the appointments of the temporary maintenance staff expired.</P>
      <P>As alternative arrangements had been made for the provision of the temporary facilities the board were not in a position to offer employment to nine of the maintenance workers in question.  Since then, however, the board have offered employment to one of the nine involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in respect of the years 1976 and 1977, what assisance from the bilateral official aid programme has been (a) allocated to and (b) spent through private firms or organisations, specifying in the case of each project (i) the nature of the project, (ii) the firm or organisation involved, (iii) the total cost, (iv) the share of the cost borne by the bilateral programme, by the firm in question and by other sources, (v) the organisation or project-holder involved in the developing country, (vi) whether the Irish firm or organisation is involved on a commercial or on a non-profit basis, and (vii) what benefits are judged to accrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) In 1976 no bilateral aid funds were spent through privately owned firms or organisations.  Since it is important that all sectors of Irish society should participate in the aid programme, it was decided that strenuous efforts should be made in 1977 to use private firms to execute projects valued at £100,000 or slightly over 10 per cent of the total programme expenditure of £975,000.  The response to this initiative has been slow and despite great efforts by my Department, and also by the Confederation of Irish Industry and Coras Trachtala it has proved possible to allocate to private firms the execution of projects involving expenditure of only £61,848 in 1977.</P>
      <P>(b) £3,052 has been disbursed to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c) In reply to parts (iv) and (vi), each project stands on its own as a project fully funded by bilateral aid, employing an Irish firm on a commercial basis in its execution.  The projects are, however, integral parts of larger projects, not funded by Ireland, <Col N="1062" /> whose costs are not available. Local costs incurred in the execution of the projects by the beneficiaries are neither calculated nor included in the cost to Ireland of the projects.</P>
    <P>(d) Replies to parts (i), (ii), (iii), (v) and (vii) for each project are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  (i) Technical assistance in the commissioning of a sisal carpet factory; (ii) Irish Ropes Ltd.; (iii) £12,848; (v) Tanzania Carpet Co.; (vii) The technical assistance will enable the Tanzania Carpet Co to produce sisal carpet, thereby increasing the country's processing of sisal fibre into finished products and reducing Tanzania's dependence on fluctuating prices for raw fibre.  At the same time, Tanzania's dependence on imports of carpet will be reduced.</P>
    <P>2.  (i) Feasibility Study on Pyrethrum Extract Refinery; (ii) Dalgety-Kenny Associates; (iii) £8,000; (v) Tanganyika Pyrethrum Board; (vii) The study will enable the Tanganyika Pyrethrum Board to decide whether to undertake the refining of crude Pyrethrum extract.  If the extract can be refined economically, Tanzania will increase the added value of the product and will be less dependent on outside agents in marketing the refined product that it is in selling the crude extract.</P>
    <P>3.  (i) Feasibility study on molasses by-products processing; (ii) Delgety-Kenny Associates; (iii) £18,000; (v) Tanzania Investment Bank; (vii) Tanzania currently produces a large quantity of sugar which has molasses as a by-product and which is either used as animal feed or wasted.  The study will investigate the feasibility of manufacturing alternative useful products from molasses.</P>
    <P>4.  (i) Feasibility study of a maltings; (ii) Dalgety-Kenny Associates; (iii) £14,000; (v) Tanzania National Development Corporation; (vii) all malt used in Tanzania is imported.  The study will assist Tanzania in the production of its own barley and malt and will contribute to savings in foreign exchange, to increased employment and to the prosperity of farmers.</P>
    <P>5.  (i) Technical assistance in the <Col N="1063" /> establishment of a National Construction unit; (ii) Nicholas O'Dwyer and Partners in association with Coopers and Lybrand Associates Ltd.; (iii) £9,000; (v) Ministry of Works, Lesotho; (viii) the establishment of a national construction unit, which will have responsibility for the implementation of medium to large scale construction projects in the building and civil engineering sectors, will contribute to the solution of a severe housing problem in Lesotho and of a problem of general lack of capacity in these sectors.</P>
