    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the number of people that have been detained under section 2 of the Emergency Powers Act, 1976; the number that have been charged; the number that have been convicted; the number of cases in which a plea of <i>nolle prosequi</i> has been applied; the number that have been discharged for other reasons; and the number that have been found not guilty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that in the period up to the end of February, 401 persons were arrested under section 2 of the Emergency Powers Act, 1976, 39 of these persons were subsequently charged, 6 were convicted, 6 were found not guilty, 3 were discharged by the courts for other reasons, but have since been rearrested and charged <Col N="422" /> again and 24, not including the three I have just mentioned, are still before the courts.</P>
      <P>These figures relate to persons, not charges, and there was no case in which a <i>nolle prosequi</i> was entered in respect of all charges against any of the persons charged.  The Garda do not keep statistics of cases where a <i>nolle</i> is entered in respect of some but not all charges against a person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say what the increase in the rate of detection was as the result of the introduction by him of the so-called emergency package of legislation last September?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information as to that.  That is not something that can be quantified because the rate of detection must, obviously, relate to the rate of commission of crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Garda are being effective and successful in combating subversive crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>My question is whether the number of successful prosecutions has increased as a result of this legislation at present in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot say whether the number has increased or not unless one compares that with the preceding number.  If the Deputy would give me some comparison to set it against, then we could assess it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say how many people were not charged who were arrested under this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy does a calculation, there were 401 persons arrested and 39 were subsequently charged, so the difference would be reached by subtracting one figure from the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying whether it is satisfactory or unsatisfactory. The Garda arrested these persons under section 2 which restates section 30 of the 1939 Act, so under section 2 they did merely what they previously had been doing under the 1939 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley  Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. O'Malley</b> asked the Minister for Justice if he has received any communications from different bodies in Limerick expressing their dissatisfaction at the dramatic increase in crime in the city; and the proposals he has for strengthening the Garda force in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received communications from the president of the chamber of commerce, the director of the Limerick Arch-Confraternity and an individual trader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strength of the Garda force in Limerick city has been increased from 215 on 1st March, 1973 to 247 on 1st March this year and the number of police vehicles has been increased in the same period from nine to 15.  The policing of any area is kept under <Col N="424" /> constant review to deploy the maximum number possible having regard to the overall demands on available resources. Deputies will be glad to know that the provisional crime figures for January and February, 1977, as compared with the same months last year show a substantial decrease, namely, 411 as against 659.  I am sure we all hope this trend will continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the number of gardaí available for ordinary crime duty in Limerick now is substantially less than it was four years ago, in view of the fact that there are 56 gardaí full-time on prison duty alone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the number on prison duty and even if I were I would not make the information available to the House for long-standing security reasons.  I am not aware that there are fewer gardaí available to combat crime in Limerick than there were four years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister take my word that that is so and that there is a most serious crime situation in Limerick which is causing grave concern to all citizens there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The crime situation in Limerick is, indeed, a matter of concern but, as the Deputy heard in my reply to the question, the provisional crime figures for the first two months of this year show a substantial decrease over the same two months of last year. This is a very favourable trend and I am sure the Deputy shares with me the hope that it will continue.  One has to be careful to make sure that that fact is emphasised lest the reputation of Limerick would be unduly damaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the citizens of Limerick have to live with the situation irrespective of what reputation the city might have.  Is the Minister aware that in 14 days at the end of February and beginning of March this year there were 14 major break-ins in the centre of the city alone apart from dozens of burglaries and break-ins in housing estates in the city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware and without casting doubt on the Deputy's <Col N="425" /> figures I prefer to wait until the official Garda statistics are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Garda have informed people who have complained and inquired regarding the crime situation in Limerick that they are so under strength there that they are frequently not able to investigate a crime for perhaps seven days after it has occurred? In the circumstances, would the Minister increase considerably the number of gardaí available in Limerick for ordinary duty as opposed to prison duty because the numbers have decreased considerably over the past four years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand that there might be occasions when guards would not be able to respond immediately to a crime and that more urgent matters might intervene in the meantime from the time the crime is reported. The Garda in so far as they can will attend to any report as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I know they will but is the Minister aware that gardaí and their senior officers in Limerick have stated that they, due to shortage of manpower and to the absence of overtime, are unable even to commence the investigation of a number of serious crimes for, perhaps, as long as seven days after the crimes took place?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state the reasons for the arrest of a person (name supplied) in Dublin on 18th February 1977 and the person's detention in a cell at the Bridewell Garda station, in view of the fact that her only activity appears to have been the handling of leaflets entitled <i>Know Your Rights</i> (copy supplied); and if he will state the supervision he exercises and the criteria he applies to ensure that the Emergency Powers Act, 1976 is not used as an instrument of harassment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree to specify publicly&mdash;or for that matter at all&mdash;why any particular person may have been arrested by the Garda Síochána and, as far as I am aware, it has never been the practice of the Minister for Justice to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grounds on which an arrest can be made under section 2 of the Emergency Powers Act, 1976 are set <Col N="427" /> out in the section.  It is scarcely necessary to point out that the fact that a person is arrested while handing out leaflets does not mean that he or she was arrested for handing out such leaflets.</P>
    <P>As regards the reference to supervision, the position is that the Garda Síochána have, under various enactments, wide powers of arrest and, as the Deputy is aware, the powers of arrest conferred by section 2 of the Emergency Powers Act are no different from those conferred by section 30 of the 1939 Act, though, of course, the permitted period of custody is longer.  The long established constraints on the Garda Síochána in exercising any power of arrest, whether under section 2 or section 30 or otherwise, are, firstly, that they are members of a disciplined force who are expected as a matter of course to adhere to the relevant legal provisions; secondly, that if any arrested person believes that he or she has been unlawfully arrested, that person is free to complain about it to the Garda authorities and the complaint will be investigated; and, thirdly, if an aggrieved person is not satisfied to have the matter dealt with by the Garda authorities, he or she can take an action in the courts for damages for wrongful arrest.  In this connection, I would point out that neither section 2 of the 1976 Act nor section 30 of the 1939 Act on which it was modelled, permits arbitrary arrest but only arrest where the garda concerned suspects with reasonable cause&mdash;I emphasise the words &ldquo;with reasonable cause&rdquo;&mdash;that one of the situations envisaged in the section has come into existence.  I reject and repudiate the Deputy's implication that the Garda Síochána use the Act in question as an instrument of harassment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that the Garda checkpoint on the Donegal-Clady road has been discontinued and that this has caused anxiety in the local community; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that following a recent review by senior Garda officers of the operation of checkpoints in the Castlefin sub-district it was decided, in the light of various security considerations, to discontinue the checkpoint on the Castlefin-Clady road.</P>
      <P>I can well understand the anxiety of communities living in border counties, particularly those living in close proximity to the border, to ensure that all possible security precautions are taken for their safety, but at the same time I am sure that it will be appreciated that Garda and Army resources could not be made available to provide checkpoints on all roads leading from the Border.  It just would not be possible to have as many checkpoints as local communities would wish.</P>
      <P>The Garda, in deciding on the locations of checkpoints, must have regard to the prevailing conditions from the security point of view and checkpoints are sited accordingly.  This matter is kept under continuing review to ensure maximum security in accordance with available resources.</P>

We must leave it to the professional people on the ground to decide the location of the various checkpoints.  The Deputy can be satisfied that the Garda are aware of the considerations appropriate to every area and will alter the situation as the need arises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will consider extending the medical services available to the families of serving soldiers on the Curragh Camp to the families of serving soldiers at Naas, Kildare and Athy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. O.J. Flanagan) Oliver J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. O.J. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The medical services provided for soldiers' dependants in the Curragh Camp are available to the families of serving soldiers residing at Naas, Kildare and Athy if they present themselves at the Curragh General Military Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this would impose a serious hardship on the people living a long distance from the Curragh? These people feel that they are not getting similar service, for soldiers' families.  Is the Minister aware that in Naas there is a special service from a local doctor, available for soldiers? Could this be extended to the families of soldiers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the position in the Curragh in relation to medical services for soldiers' dependants is unique and long standing because of the fact that the camp is a military town with no civilian doctor in the area.  There is a families section, in the Curragh General Military Hospital where soldiers' families from inside and outside the camp are treated.  The services afforded by army medical officers include, attendance on such families living within the camp limits.  Medicines prescribed for patients so attended, or under treatment at the family section, are dispensed free of charge in the hospital pharmacy.  Patients of the family section who are referred to specialists or to other institutions may <Col N="433" /> also have their prescriptions dispensed free of charge at the hospital pharmacy. The Deputy is aware, too, that soldiers are insured under the Social Welfare Acts and that by virtue of such insurance, they and their dependants are entitled to certain services and benefits.  These services include free in-patient and out-patient treatment and maintenance at health board hospitals or at hospitals approved by health boards.  They are entitled too, to a refund of portion of the cost of having prescriptions compounded. Having regard to these facilities, there is no change contemplated in the present arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the services available to soldiers who may be serving at the Curragh but not living there are different from the services available to those soldiers who live on the camp?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>For those soldiers serving on the Curragh and living there, medical facilities are readily available at the Curragh military hospital.  The same facilities are available to any soldier living away from the camp but who wishes to avail of the medical services at the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not unsound medically to suggest to a person living in, say, Athy, Naas or Newbridge that he travel to the Curragh for medical help?  Normally only people who are unwell seek medical help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the very high standard of medical care and skills available at the Curragh, soldiers who are ill may wish to be treated there but they have the option of availing of the services provided in their health board areas.  However, those who present themselves at the Curragh are extremely welcome.  They can be assured of every care and attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>I am calling Question No. 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The position regarding those soldiers or their familes who seek treatment outside the military hospital is that, in the event of their not holding <Col N="434" /> medical cards, they must pay for these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say in that regard is that any soldier who may be financially embarrassed in this way can go to the Curragh military hospital where he will be treated free of charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of someone being advised by his doctor to remain in bed, would it not be unwise medically for that patient to travel to the Curragh from, say, Naas, Athy or Kildare town?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated already, the situation at the Curragh is unique.  This is because of of its being a military area with a general military hospital but with no civilian doctors.  Consequently, those members of the force residing outside the Curragh area and wishing to avail of the services of a civilian doctor are entitled to do so but they are entitled also to avail of the free services at the Curragh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We were told at school that Belgium was the cockpit of Europe.  Perhaps it still is.  However, if these vehicles are fit for the Belgian army, might one not conclude that they would be fit, also, for the Irish Army especially when they are Irish designed and Irish made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that in 1972 arrangements were made with Dr. Timoney for the production of three armed personnel carriers for the Department of Defence at an estimated cost of £90,000.  Of the three vehicles produced, the first was regarded as being uneconomic and, consequently, it was decided to use it for spare parts for the other two.  The second proved to be free of major trouble while the third proved to be suitable.  The cost amounted to approximately £179,000 plus incidental expenses by way of duty and VAT.  I am aware also that Dr. Timoney has entered into a joint venture for the provision of these armed cars for Belgium.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a <Col N="436" /> position to know the nature of whatever negotiations have taken place between Dr. Timoney and the Belgian authorities.  In these circumstances I have no knowledge of the cost involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the failure of the Irish authorities to place an order for the purchase of one of these APCs produced by Dr. Timoney's company prejudiced seriously and was in danger of defeating the possibility of obtaining this very prestigious export order for Belgium?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the exhaustive tests carried out on the last personnel carrier show that it has acquitted itself excellently on all types of terrain and even in an amphibious fashion and that it has proved to be trouble free for up to 10,000 miles? Does he not think that what is suitable for the Belgian authorities should have appealed to the Government and that they should have decided to give employment at home and provide the Army with a cheaper carrier than any imported carrier?  How does one construe silence in that case?</P>

      <P>There is no essential difference between the two cases.  The parent Act under which Defence Forces pension schemes are made is the Defence Forces (Pensions) Act, 1932.  Section 2 (1) of the Act provides as follows:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Defence may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, prepare a scheme (in this Act referred to as a pension scheme) with the object of providing&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  retired pay, pensions and gratuities for or in respect of officers of the Forces to whom such scheme applies; and</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the experience of the Naval Service that the most reliable source of intelligence in respect of illegal fishing is the Irish fishermen at sea and these fishermen are constantly in contact with patrol vessels.  The pattern of patrols is based on such intelligence and on the patrol vessels' observations.  Many of the complaints received from sources ashore are found to be either inaccurate or misleading however wellmeaning and for this reason the Naval Service normally request that such reports be processed through the Garda Síochána.  Recently it was alleged that a number of French boats were fishing in Liscannor Bay, Aran Islands and Galway Bay areas.  The patrol vessel <i>Banba</i>, on Monday night, 21st March, 1977 under cover of darkness saw no evidence of illegal fishing.  The <i>Banba</i> contacted the Irish vessel <i>Arkin Castle</i> which reported that it had seen no infringement by foreign trawlers.  On Wednesday, 23rd, Thursday, 24th, Friday, 25th and Monday 28th March, patrols were carried out in the Aran Islands area and the naval observer on board the aircraft reported no signs of illegal fishing activity by foreign vessels. Position reports by Spanish fishing vessels have been received daily on a voluntary basis.  They were not fishing illegally.  I may add that within the past hour an aircraft has been in the area and reports that there are no illegal fishing activities in progress. That is the very latest information.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not answer the question I asked&mdash;how many patrol boats are operating? How many are on active service? Would the Minister expect that Spanish or French boats which were reported to be fishing illegally would be there this week for the patrol boats to arrest them?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that the presence of the French <Col N="439" /> fishermen is due to the fact that this is the annual prawn fishing season which runs from the end of March to the beginning of May.  The fishermen usually operate at dawn and at dusk and between these fishing periods the fleets usually lie up off the Aran Islands.  The patrol activities and investigations which were carried out up to Monday, 28th March, indicate that about 20 French trawlers were spotted within a 20 square mile area fishing outside the six-mile limit.  Local fishery vessels were spotted inside the French trawlers in an area from four to six miles out.  I most confidently assure the Deputy and the House that there has been no illegal fishing by these boats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>The criteria for determining eligibility for medical cards are laid down by the chief executive officers of the health boards.  In assessing eligibility, no special allowance is made <Col N="440" /> for social welfare contributions.  The income guidelines which are used by the chief executive officers to assist in deciding eligibility for medical cards have been fixed with due regard to the fact that no such allowance is made for this or other statutory payments.</P>
      <P>The position concerning what is included or excluded in assessing eligibility for medical cards is explained in a statement which I made in reply to a question from Deputy Fahey on 27th October, 1976, Official Report, Volume 293, No. 4, column 487.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that before the guidelines were changed the cost of the stamp was taken away from gross salary.  My information is that the guidelines were put up and that the stamp is not now taken off the salary.  The guidelines have gone from £25 to £34 for a man and his wife.  Perhaps that is because of the way income is being estimated.  If the Minister tells me that the cost of the stamp is taken out when arriving at the income I am satisfied but my information is that it is not and that it was deducted before the guidelines were changed.</P>

While discussions had taken place between officers of my Department and officers of the health board on the future hospital services, including maternity services, for the health board area, it will be necessary to await the outcome of the comhairle/health board discussions before any final decision can be taken in relation to maternity services in County Clare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputies is not available in my Department.  Having regard to the fact that there is no employer content in health contributions save to the limited extent of medical card holders, it is estimated that the amount payable by CIE in respect of such contributions would not be significant.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a considerable amount of confusion in the public mind about who should and who should not pay these health contributions?  Is he also aware that, while they are primarily a Department of Health matter, they are collected by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The annual payment of the health contribution is collected by the Revenue Commissioners.  This situation gives rise to considerable difficulty for many people who are not too clear, if they have a doubt or a question, to whom they should apply?  Would the Minister avail of this opportunity to give some explanation in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners collect in respect of those who are self-employed.  The health contribution is automatically taken up by the employer and included in the social welfare stamp.  All we are concerned about here are those who are in possession of medical cards.  If they make known to their employers that they have a medical card, from 1st April he is bound to pay the 39p.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the other categories of people who pay their health contributions on an annual basis and not by means of a stamp.  In the case of such a person who has a doubt as to his liability to make the health contribution, to whom should <Col N="456" /> he apply to have that matter cleared up?  At the moment, it seems the Revenue Commissioners refer him to the Department of Health and the Department of Health say it is the Revenue Commissioners' job to collect this money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>What became of the various proposals published a considerable time ago, which at different stages suggested Buncrana, Carndonagh, or Moville?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As I told the Deputy, there are no proposals in my Department for the provision of an old people's home in Inishowen peninsula, that is in Buncrana.  I believe some investigations are being made with regard to Buncrana because they have a site but it is not regarded as a priority in this year.  The priority notified to my Department was the building of such a home in Ramelton and Falcarragh.  There is no proposal from the health board to the effect that the building of an old people's home in Buncrana will go ahead this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any proposal, imminent or distant, for the provision of a home or homes in the Inishowen peninsula?  I understand from the Minister's original reply that there is none and then he mentioned Buncrana. Is there such a proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>What is being done in Buncrana is on the initiative of the board themselves.  They have purchased a site but they do not seem to have done anything about it.  As far as the other places are concerned, they <Col N="457" /> are the priority of the North Western Health Board and the board are going ahead with those two projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking about Ramelton and Falcarragh.  What I am asking about is an area which contains about one-quarter to one-fifth of the total population in a county which is isolated from the rest of the country and which is not being catered for, although there were varying proposals in the public Press over the past two or three years about the possible building of a home in Carndonagh and Moville.  In fact, premises was bought in Moville not so long ago, but were sold again.  It now appears that Buncrana is the most likely place.  I would like the Minister to find out and let me have the information as to whether the site purchased in Buncrana is the last word so far as servicing the Inishowen Peninsula is concerned or whether there is any ground for the suggestion that appeared in the paper some time back?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is recognised Buncrana needs such a home and it will be built, not this year and I cannot say when exactly because there is no proposal from the Health Board, but there are definite proposals in respect of the places I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>However, work permits are not required for nationals of the United Kingdom as an alien is defined under the Aliens Orders as not including a person born in Great Britain or in Northern Ireland.

Would the Minister take up with the health board the question of providing a dispensary in or around the Curransport area in view of the fact that the board are not proposing to provide free transport for a dispensary service and will he take up the question in these circumstances of the very long distance these people are removed from the nearest dispensary and the provision of dispensary premises in the area where the doctor can visit so that people will not have to travel long distances?</P>

    <Title>European Council Meeting: - Statement by Taoiseach.</Title>
    <Col N="500" />
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to make a statement.</P>
      <P>The meeting of the European Council of Heads of Government, accompanied by Ministers for Foreign Affairs, held in Rome on Friday and Saturday of last week, was notable in that it coincided with the anniversary of the signing of the Rome Treaties 20 years ago.  Though we have in this country reason to be dissatisfied with the operation of Community policies in some respects, we have also reason to appreciate the ways in which membership has helped us.  I do not think, however, that this is the occasion to review the benefits and costs.  It is sufficient to note the economic and social development of the past 20 years in Europe and nationally, and to bear in mind that the membership of the Community has for us and the other countries much more than a material significance.</P>
      <P>The discussions at the Council in Rome were concerned with the world economic and monetary situation, with the external relations of the Community and with internal Community affairs.</P>
      <P>On the world economic situation, ways of ensuring an acceleration, or at least a continuance, of recovery from recession were discussed.  This country has more than a usual interest in world trade.  Our imports are equivalent in value to about half of all we produce or earn.  This means that the prices we pay for a large proportion of the goods we use are largely determined abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, our merchandise exports are equivalent to something over 40 per cent of gross national product, with invisible exports like tourism, dividends from abroad, emigrants remittances and so forth helping us to pay our way by making up the balance between total imports and total exports. The price which exports fetch on world markets also helps to determine prices in this counry, which, for the purpose, is part of a single market. <Col N="501" /> A producer does not mind whether he sells abroad or at home so long as he gets his price.</P>
    <P>Both import and export prices have up to recently been rising more rapidly than consumer prices here.  Between 1972 and 1973 import prices went up by 13 per cent and export prices by 22 per cent but the consumer price index went up by only 11 per cent.  Between 1973 and 1974 import prices rose by between 45 per cent and 50 per cent.  In contrast the consumer price index rose by 17 per cent.  Between 1974 and 1975 the difference was less marked, with many domestic influences like the level of pay settlements starting to become more significant.  Import and export prices rose by about 20 per cent but the consumer price index went up by 21 per cent.  Between 1975 and 1976 the same influences were evident.  Consumer prices rose by 18 per cent, import prices by about the same percentage and export prices by an estimated 22 per cent.</P>
    <P>The rise in the price of commodities caused by sterling devaluation may still be playing a significant part in our inflation. Import and export prices do not feed immediately into domestic prices.  There are leads and lags which differ according to season and product. The general picture is that we have been both importing and manufacturing price rises.  The remedy, if we wish to attain stability, lies both in what we can do in this country and in what happens abroad.  Of late, in fact, the emphasis must be much more on the degree of restraint we can exercise at home.</P>
    <P>In Rome we were concerned with the international aspects.  Trade, inflation and unemployment were among the most important concerns of the meeting.  If international trade does not develop then no economy can expand for long and employment and growth must suffer.  For many countries, including ours, the development of trade is dependent on a reduction in inflation. Trade, growth, inflation and unemployment are all inextricably linked.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the last OECD <i>Economic Outlook</i> forecast for member countries&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="502" />  (1)  an increase of GNP of 3¾ per cent in 1977 compared with an estimated 5 per cent in 1976;</P>
    <P>(2)  a growth of trade of about 6 per cent or about half the percentage growth of 1976;</P>
    <P>(3)  unemployment of 5¼ per cent as against 5 per cent in 1976. </P>
    <P>European Commission forecasts for the countries of the Community are similarly disturbing.  They say that growth may well be slower in 1977 than in 1976 and unemployment higher.  In fact, in their view, Ireland, the Netherlands and Germany are the only countries in the Community where unemployment is not likely to get worse this year.</P>
    <P>At the Rome meeting I said that our first priority must be to maintain our democratic institutions which are obviously threatened by a continuation of unemployment on the present scale.  In the past it was a question of whether unemployment or inflation imposed the greater threat.  Now both must be tackled if economic freedom is not to be put in serious jeopardy.</P>
    <P>The number of young people potentially seeking employment in the entire Community, particularly in Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ireland, is the greatest single employment problem facing us today and is the one which is fraught with the greatest political and social danger.  I drew particular attention to the fact that these new entrants to the Community's labour force are more highly educated than those in the older age groups and have higher income and job expectations.  It will not be possible to alleviate this problem unless we are prepared to take special measures at Community level, specifically aimed at increasing employment. I indicated particular interest in the suggestion by the President of the Commission for a new type of Community investment more or less analogous to the action taken by the Community to help the coal and steel industries with their restructuring problems.</P>
    <P>In emphasising the objective of getting the world economy back to a satisfactory growth path, I also said that any attempt to restore growth <Col N="503" /> to the pace of the 1960s carries with it the danger of rekindling inflation.  I said, however, that this danger may well have been exaggerated, and emphasised in particular the need not to confuse inflation with reflation.</P>
    <P>Other Heads of Government spoke at some length and with great concern on their analysis of the problems.  The Council generally recognised that action must in large part be undertaken on a world scale and that the Community itself has an important role to play. They agreed to seek action at Community level in three directions.  : first, to promote measures to help resolve specific labour market problems, and especially in improving training and employment opportunities for young people and women; secondly, to encourage higher levels of investment in the member states; and, thirdly, to halt divergence and promote convergence in their economic performance.  To this end the European Council invited the Commission, in particular by the better use of Community instruments, and, on the other hand, the board of governors of the European Investment Bank, to seek ways of improving the effectiveness of their activities.</P>
    <P>The Council also emphasised the importance of co-operation between the social partners and agreed to the holding of a further tripartite conference in the first half of this year, at a date to be agreed, at which progress and possibilities could be reviewed. The Council agreed to reconsider progress on this range of problems at their own projected meeting in June.  They agreed to conduct a further examination of the results obtained in the fields of growth, unemployment and the fight against inflation at their meeting at the end of the year, and to assess then the Community's prospects of making progress towards economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, the North/ South dialogue is concerned with:</P>
    <P> (1)  the treatment of the massive debts which have been accumulated by developing countries, and</P>
    <P>(2)  ways and means of ensuring a price for basic commodities which <Col N="504" /> is fair to producers and consumers, and can perhaps help developing countries and avoid the wide fluctuations in prices which are a characteristic of markets in these materials.</P>
    <P>The commodities concerned are diverse in nature and economic importance.  They could include coffee, tea, sugar, and other agricultural products as well as lead, zinc, copper and bauxite and other minerals.  The price of oil is also germane.</P>
    <P>Before the Rome meeting there were wide divergences of principle.  However, at the meeting we agreed on a common position.  We agreed that there should be commodity price stabilisation agreements where appropriate and that there should be a common fund.  There would also be a study of export earnings stabilisation measures for developing countries and of special action for the CIEC on aid.</P>
    <P>This will now be worked up in detail at the Foreign Ministers Council on 5th April and will be brought forward in the preparations for the CIEC ministerial meeting in Paris, in which the Community will co-ordinate its position with the other industrialised countries in the group of eight.  This will be followed by detailed negotiations at the UNCTAD conference.</P>
    <P>The Community will call on other countries, for instance, in Eastern Europe and oil-producing countries, to make an adequate contribution in the development field.</P>
    <P>It is too soon yet to estimate the sort of expenditure to which the arrangements could commit this country.  On present appearances, the figure could be of the order of some £ millions, spread over a number of years.  If what is achieved brings about a better life in the developing countries, with some stabilisation in the price and security of supply of basic commodities, including oil, the investment will have been well worth while.</P>
    <P>The Council discussed the steel industry, which in a recent year employed <Col N="505" /> just under 800,000 people in the Community.  The situation in the industry has been deteriorating steadily for three years.  It is well for us to bear in mind just how badly the recent recession and its aftermath are affecting essential industries in Europe. The steel industry there is working at about 60 per cent of capacity and order books are measured in weeks rather than in months.  The council took note of the efforts being made by the Commission to put forward at an early date practical proposals for short-term remedial measures to stabilise the market, for longer term structural reorganisation and for measures in the social field to assist workers adversely affected by reorganisation.</P>
    <P>Japanese penetration of European markets, and the difficulties of European exporters in finding corresponding markets in Japan, were another subject of concern to the council. Between 1972 and 1976 Japanese imports to Europe rose by more than 320 per cent to about 7,000 million dollars&mdash;as against an increase in Community exports to Japan of only 130 per cent approximately.  Discussions between the Community and Japan have been reasonably productive, so far, of understandings to establish a balance.  All are anxious to avoid resort to protectionism, except as a last resort.  This could stunt world trade on which we all depend for economic growth.  The essential problem for Europe is to step up exports to Japanese markets.  These discussions are being continued.</P>
    <P>With so much emphasis on economic issues, it is hardly surprising that one of the most controversial subjects at the Rome meeting was the question of the representation of the Community at the Downing Street Summit to be held in London in May.  As Deputies know, this summit is in the tradition of Rambouillet and Puerto Rico.  It will be attended by the major industrialised nations of the free world and will discuss reflation, protectionism and unemployment, and international trade generally.</P>
    <P>The attendance of the Community, as such, at the meeting to speak on <Col N="506" /> matters within its remit had been resisted.  In Rome, the argument on the point was long and, at times, heated.  In the end, the council agreed that the President of the Council of Ministers and the President of the Commission would be invited to take part in those sessions of the summit at which items which are within the competence of the Community are discussed.  Examples of such items are negotiations about international trade and the North/South dialogue.</P>
    <P>Part of the meeting was taken up with an account by Mr. Callaghan of his recent visit to the United States. There was also some discussion on human rights questions and on the preparations for the review of the Conference on Security and Co-operation provisions to take place later this year in Belgrade.  Problems in relation to the enlargement of the Community were also discussed.  Difficulties here are apparent.  The Foreign Ministers are being asked to study the question in greater depth at their meeting in Leeds Castle in May.</P>
    <P>There was discussion on the form and organisation of European councils. General agreement was reached that councils should have&mdash;</P>
    <P> (1)  informal exchanges of view of a wide-ranging nature held in the greatest privacy and not designed to lead to formal decisions or statements; and</P>
    <P>(2)  discussions which are designed to produce decisions, settle guidelines for future action, or issue public statements expressing the agreed view of the council. </P>
    <P>There was recognition also that the European Council will sometime need to fulfil a third function, namely, to settle issues outstanding from discussions at a lower level.  But there was some concern that the council should not become a court of appeal whose role might undermine the authority and efficiency of the Community institutions. This concern related both to the frequency with which the council might assume this role and also the need, when it does, for the council to conform to the appropriate procedures laid down in the Community <Col N="507" /> treaties and other agreements.  These questions are to be considered in more detail later.</P>
    <P>The Rome meeting was useful.  The range of subjects was wide.  It covered economic growth, inflation, unemployment, international trade, the difficulties in the steel industry, relations with Japan, America and the developing countries, the forthcoming economic summit in London, the organisation of future European councils, the enlargement of the Community and many other issues of fundamental importance to this country and to the world today. Indeed, perhaps, the very breadth of discussion will illustrate the essential nature of these councils.  They can give directions and formalise consensus&mdash; and this in itself is extremely valuable &mdash;but only exceptionally, I think, are they suited for reaching positive decisions. The issues here must obviously be of really major importance and ripe for decision.</P>
    <P>The discussions I had with Mr. Callaghan on Northern Ireland, outside the framework of the meeting, illustrate a useful attribute of these meetings.  Our discussion, though short because of the pressure of other business, was friendly and, for me, reassuring in emphasising again our joint commitment to a settlement acceptable to both sections of the community in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The council issued texts on (1) growth, inflation and employment, (2) Japan, (3) steel and (4) the Downing Street Summit, which, in accordance with normal practice, I am arranging to have laid before the House.</P>

      <P>Once again the European Summit of the Heads of Government of the Members of the EEC countries has not come up with any tangible results.  The unusual length of this post-Summit statement by the Taoiseach appears to me to be in inverse ratio to the results achieved at it.  The woolliness and largely irrelevant content of the statement gives way to the conclusion that many people had already reached, and that was, that <Col N="508" /> little was achieved at this European Council meeting.  Whether the purpose of these meetings is to hold formal or informal exchanges between the parties concerned, they have not succeeded in giving the European Economic Community the political direction it requires to overcome the present economic crisis.  It is obvious that this Government do not adequately avail of these meetings to impress upon the eight other Governments the need to arrive at satisfactory solutions to problems of vital interest to this country, for instance, the fishery question.</P>
      <P>As the Community celebrates its twentieth anniversary, it is clear that economic growth has not eliminated social disparities and that while Europe has assumed responsibility for the poorer countries of the world, areas of extreme poverty still persist within its own frontiers.  Unless the EEC makes a more serious effort to tackle the social and economic disparities that exist within its own frontiers, then disillusionment with our membership of the EEC will naturally arise, and that applies to other countries as well as this one.  On the other hand, it is evident from the Government's handling of our Economic Community affairs that no serious effort has been made to approach the problems arising within the Community in any planned way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past three years there have been specific problems which will illustrate what I mean by that assertion.  In the shoe industry for example, the equal pay problem, fisheries, to which I have already referred, and the Green £, it is clear even to the most uninitiated student of government that problems were going to arise in these areas.  These were problem areas where our Government could legitimately look to the Community for help and advice.  This was not done and belated action caused to some extent a deterioriation between the Irish Government and the other members of the Community. On several occasions the European Commission themselves have recognised the sorry state of the Irish economy and have urged the Government to adopt corrective measures.  I <Col N="509" /> need refer only to the shoe industry as an illustration of that assertion.</P>
    <P>Following the budget speech of the Minister for Finance we were told from Brussels that the Commission never heard that the recession was over.  In fact, the economic forecast published by the Commission predicts a rise in unemployment and inflation for the Irish economy in 1977-78.  Recent statistics from the EEC show that we are again at the top of the league as regards unemployment.  For example, registered unemployment as a percentage of civilian working population is over 10.3 in Ireland, 6.6 in Denmark and 4.9 in France.  The Government have not convinced the other eight EEC Governments that they are seriously capable of managing this country's affairs.  They have not the ability to convince the Council of Ministers that Ireland's problems are serious and require immediate and urgent attention from our EEC partners. Once again, the common agricultural policy, which is the only comprehensive policy fully under super-national control, starts 1977 with a bigger question than ever hanging over it.  Both Mr. Jenkins and the British President of the Council of Ministers have recently given disquieting priority to agricultural questions and there is an uneasiness that a radical overhaul of the common agricultural policy may be proposed.  As an illustration of that assertion, I need only refer to recent happenings, the fisheries débâcle earlier this week and this morning the failure of the Council of Ministers for Agriculture to agree on a review of agricultural prices for the coming year.  The Minister for Agriculture at the conclusion of that meeting, according to a radio broadcast which I have heard, had no hesitation in laying the blame for that failure squarely at the door of the British.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to some specific things that may have come from the recent summit meeting.  I welcome the Community representation at the western economic summit conference.  The Taoiseach referred to it as the Downing Street conference. I hope the Government will press home their views in good time on the British President of the Council of <Col N="510" /> Ministers who, as well as Mr. Jenkins, will be representing the Community, including us, at that meeting.  This conference we would hope will lead to some upturn in the world economy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision about the tripartite conference.  The convening of this conference should lead to concrete proposals for a reduction in unemployment and inflation within the EEC.  Some progress was made, at least decision-wise, in coming to the aid of the under-developed regions. The special community fund which I called for after the last European Council meeting in accordance with the objectives of Protocol 30 of the Treaty of Accession is apparently now under consideration.  I welcome, too, the Commission's proposals to reform both the social and regional fund regulations to allow for greater concentration of these funds in areas of greatest need.</P>
    <P>I want to say on behalf of this party that we remain committed to the ideal of European unity.  We support any moves within the EEC that will bring the citizens of Europe closer together and make the European Community a better and more prosperous place in which to live.  This is fundamental to the whole notion of European integration.  When returned to Government we will have to inform our European partners that we are not at all happy with the direction which the Community appears to be taking.  For example, no serious effort is being made to correct regional imbalance within the Community. Monetary disorder is still there imposing heavy burdens through the MCAs on Irish agricultural producers. We still have a regional fund which allows member governments like the Irish Government to subsume the money given to them directly into the national Exchequer instead of assigning it specifically to projects in areas of need.  The social fund must concentrate more on relieving unemployment, particularly among the young, than on training people for jobs which do not exist.  There is not sufficient co-ordination between FEOGA and the social and regional funds so that areas like the west of Ireland could benefit from a greater <Col N="511" /> concentration of EEC resources.  Areas of vital interest like our fishing limits seem to give way to the less vital but more powerful interests of the bigger member states.  There must be a more serious effort by the EEC to tackle what is fundamental to the progress of the Community, that is, economic and monetary union.  This is a basic pre-condition to progress and prosperity within the European Economic Community and demands greater co-ordination by the EEC countries when planning their own national economic programme.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach took about six lines of his script out of about 250 or 260 lines to refer to his conversations with the British Prime Minister about Northern Ireland.  That would be about 2 per cent of the content of his statement to the House this afternoon. It is obvious from what he has said that he got no indication whatever of any new initiative by the British Government in relation to the Northern Ireland problem.  It seems clear also that the Irish Government had no suggestion as to any kind of initiative that the British might take or we and they might jointly take in that connection.</P>
    <P>It is now almost 18 months since the failure of the last political effort by the British Government, admirable though it was, to find some form of political solution to the administrative problem in the North. At that time the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced that it was the intention of the Government to adopt a low profile and it appeared from what he said that it was the intention of the British Government as well to do nothing but to see if somehow the dust would settle on the Northern Ireland problem.  If the British Government fail to take initiative, it is the duty of the Irish Government to press some initiative and to come up with some initiatives themselves instead of keeping their heads down hoping the problem will go away or that it will become less acute.  We know that in the intervening 18 months the situation is getting worse <Col N="512" /> and worse and the communities in the North are being driven wider and wider apart by the inaction of this Government and the British Government. I say that deliberately.  No attempt has been made in these 18 months to do anything at least overtly that we can recognise to help relieve the situation in the North of Ireland.  The summit seems to have produced very little and still less if that is possible in relation to the burning problem of the Northern Ireland situation in this country.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  Though most people would assume that Friendly Societies cover all societies registered under the Friendly Societies Acts there is a specific definition in those Acts of a friendly society.  This definition classifies one group as friendly societies for the purpose of the Act.  There are <Col N="513" /> four other groups variously described, benevolent societies, special authorised loans societies and so on.  To enable regulations to cover all of those societies it is necessary to delete the word &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; in section 3 (2).</P>

      <P>The Seanad made a mistake.  It made other amendments later on.  The next two amendments were made because we had gone into 1977 and the references to the 1st January, 1977, in the Bill as passed by the Dáil were no longer appropriate. As I understand it, unfortunately, the Seanad overlooked making this amendment.  It should be made here and now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That applies to the short title but not to anything else. What I am referring to is actually in the Bill in section 1 and it is wrong. I have seen these dates having to be changed before by amendment and this one will have to be changed.  The printers have no authority to change that 1976 to 1977.  They have authority in regard to the short title when they are printing it as an Act.  When they are printing it as a Bill as passed by both Houses they will still describe it as the Friendly Societies (Amendment) Bill, 1976, as passed on such a date.  When it becomes printed as the Friendly Societies (Amendment) Act, 1977, that is all right.  The date I am referring to is in the body of the Bill.</P>

    <P>An amendment made by the Seanad to a Bill initiated in the Dáil may be accepted by the Dáil with or without amendment or be rejected.  No amendment shall be moved to an amendment made by the Seanad that is not strictly relevant thereto, nor can any other <Col N="515" /> amendment be moved to the Bill unless it be consequential upon the acceptance, amendment or rejection of a Seanad amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is consequential on deliberations which took place in the Seanad during 1977.  Because the Bill was not enacted in 1976 it was necessary to have those discussions in the Seanad.  In that sense, the amendment is consequential on the Seanad deliberations.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not give that assurance but, as I have said, the change is consequential on the fact that the Bill had to be considered in the Seanad and that, consequently, there was a delay which resulted in an overlap from one year to the next. This Bill will be a 1977 and not a 1976 Act.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Clerk of the Dáil agreed in private discussions to an amendment of a similar nature and in relation to a similar matter in respect of section 5 where there is reference to the Friendly Societies Act, 1936 whereas the correct title of the Act in question is the Registry of Friendly Societies Act, 1936.  I understand it was agreed by the Clerk in that case that if the matter was mentioned at this stage and if agreement was reached, there would be no problem in relation to amending the title.  By analogy the Chair would be in a position to agree to the amendment suggested by Deputy O'Malley.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>All that can be said at this stage is that the matter will be looked at in the Clerk's office to see whether it is possible to deal with it in the way suggested. In the instance referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary there was a correction involved whereas what is proposed here is claimed to be a change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>To say the least the position is not satisfactory.  There is an error in each of the sections 1 and 5. There are five errors in section 6 and two in section 9.  The errors in section 9 are of lesser importance than the others because they may change automatically with the change in Title. In section 6 there is reference on five occasions to the Friendly Societies Acts, 1896 to 1976.  There is also the error in section 5 to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred and there is the error in section 1 which is the same essentially as the five errors in section 6.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made by the Parliamentary Secretary to some private discussions with the Clerk as to what changes might or might not be made by the printers.  This is a dangerous field.  Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann amend Bills.  This is not a power that lies in the hands of anybody else. Private discussion with the Clerk of either House is not the way to amend Bills.  Neither is it a matter for the printers to juggle with Bills when they find mistakes in them.</P>

The suggestion appears to have extended only to the error in section 5 but not to the error to which I drew attention in section 1 or to the five errors in section 6.  In all there are seven errors in the Bill.  We appear to be precluded by Standing Orders, which are very tight in this regard, from rectifying those errors.  However, I would not consider it proper to pass a Bill in which there are seven errors of which we are aware.  Consequently, the best course might be to withdraw it now and to send it back to the Seanad in order to have the errors rectified there.</P>

      <P>With the greatest respect to the Parliamentary Secretary, I did not and do not suggest that every time a Deputy, whether a Minister or not, seeks advice from the Ceann Comhairle's office that that advice should be made public.  The advice sought in this case was whether or not the wording of a subsection of a Bill which was about to be passed by the House could be changed.  That advice should have been conveyed at least to the Opposition Whip.  Here we are really talking only about one of the errors.  There are six others.  I shall not be party to passing a Bill with seven errors in it.  The Bill should now be withdrawn and returned to the Seanad for rectification.  We can then deal with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could seek the guidance of the Chair in the matter.  We are discussing amendments that have been made by the Seanad and it seems to me that it should be possible to consider these amendments and adjourn consideration of the other matter as to the changes that have to be made, to discover whether or not it is necessary to go back to the Seanad or whether the fact that we are agreed here on the necessity for making these changes is sufficient.  That would be a more expeditious way of dealing with the matter.  However, I am as anxious as the Deputy to ensure that the Bill has no technical defects when it becomes an Act and I am prepared to make whatever arrangements are necessary. It would be more convenient if it is procedurally possible to deal with the amendments now before us and to come back with the other matters if this is necessary.  The outcome of whatever discussions take place on the matter, whether they indicate the necessity to come back or not can be communicated to the House.  I am not in a position to say, obviously, <Col N="520" /> whether what I have suggested is procedurally possible and I seek guidance thereon.</P>

      <P>Before the Chair decides might I submit to him that the position is that if the suggestion of the Parliamentary Secretary were accepted and these amendments were dealt with now and assuming the House agreed to each of them, that would end consideration of the Bill by both Houses and it would not be possible when these six amendments have been disposed of to introduce any further amendment here because the Bill would then have to go to the President tonight for signature within the prescribed period.  I know of no procedure under Standing Orders whereby a Bill that has been passed by both Houses can then be amended again before it is signed by the President.  It would entail amending legislation which would be messy, to say the least of it, particularly as we are now aware of the seven errors which this Bill contains.</P>

      <P>In page 4, after line 3, to add a subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  In this section the word `false' and `misleading to a material degree' shall be construed to mean `likely to mislead members of the public to whom it is directed' &rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This relates to the definition of a false trade description which appears in the 1887 Act and extends it to mean that the reference will be to false in a material degree as if references to a material degree were false to a material degree and excluded references as misleading to a material <Col N="525" /> degree.  Something could be false in a material respect or false to a material degree or misleading to a material degree to some people and the point I am trying to make is that, even if it is misleading to some people, that should not be the basis of a false trade description for the purposes of this section or section 3 of the 1887 Act provided it is not false or misleading to a material or significant degree to those at whom the advertisement or description is aimed.  For example, one can think of medical advertisements in no sense misleading to doctors or pharmacists to whom they are directed or aimed but which might well be misleading to the public at large who may not understand the advertisements or maybe even not be intended to understand them.  One can envisage that would apply also to broader matters than just medical matters.  It could apply to various matters where the trade description is not aimed at the community at large or at consumers generally but is aimed at a very specific, specialised or élite group of consumers who are not and could not be misled.  But the public at large might well be misled and in those circumstances it would be unfair, if it were liable to mislead the public at large, to regard such a trade description as a false one with the various consequences that would flow from that and, for that reason, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to limit the application to this extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Act stands, I think the interpretation of misleading to a material degree means likely to be taken as such an indication as any of the matters specified in the definition of trade description under section 2 of the Principal Act that would be false to a material degree.  The relevant words are likely to be taken for such an indication.  The courts in interpreting this would apply the principle of the effect this would have on a reasonable man and, obviously, there might be individuals who would be incapable, for instance, of reading the writing on a particular advertisement and who, because they were illiterate, might be misled by something that appeared in a picture in <Col N="526" /> the advertisement.  The fact that some members of the community might be misled by a particular advertisement would not necessarily invalidate the advertisement and it is, therefore, necessary to have the general provision that it be misleading to the general public.</P>
      <P>There would be a problem in putting the amendment in the form suggested by Deputy O'Malley as it would be very difficult indeed to prove precisely to which members of the public a particular advertisement was directed if it were published in a particular manner. There might be a wide range of people who might see it and be influenced by it.  I believe it is better to allow the courts to decide whether or not a particular advertisement is misleading in a material respect rather than require the State, in order to have a successful prosecution, specify the class of persons to whom the advertisement was directed and prove that that particular class rather than the generality or the reasonable man would be misled by the terms of the advertisement.  If the burden suggested by Deputy O'Malley were imposed on the State of having to go into the degree of knowledge of individuals in a particular class, possibly an advertisement about a medical preparation, which was blatantly false, might not be considered to be misleading because it might be argued that a sensible medical person would know from his previous training that it was so and he would not be misled.  If the firm were to argue that it was medical people to whom the advertisement was directed, they might be able to evade prosecution even though there might be many other people who would act on the advertisement because it came to their knowledge as well as to the knowledge of members of the medical profession.  I feel it is better to leave the section as it stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary spoke about the possibility that 1 per cent of the people in the country might not understand the advertisement because they are illiterate. This is not the kind of case I am talking about.  I am thinking about the case where the advertisement or <Col N="527" /> the trade description, as the case may be, is directed at a very small section of the community, perhaps a lot less than 1 per cent and where 99 per cent of the community might be misled. The trade description is not directed at them anyway so it does not matter there.  They will not purchase the goods, presumably, either.</P>

The materiality here would meet the point made by Deputy O'Malley.</P>

      <P>Some people are concerned about the provisions of this section which terminates certain defences.  I suppose it does not matter a lot in a small case but it could matter a lot in a serious case that it shall not be a defence for a person charged with an offence.  Should section 2 (1) refer to section 3 (1) of <Col N="529" /> the Principal Act?  In any event, it shall not be a defence for the person to prove that he acted without intent to defraud.  If something is done by a genuine error, which is corrected at the earliest possible moment, nonetheless the person is guilty of an offence. I know this is a tendency, which is growing in our legislation and, perhaps to some extent, in matters of this kind it has to.  In a serious charge it could create quite a difficulty for a defendant who is <i>bona fide</i> and who simply made an error which he corrected at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the section is to substitute the defences contained in section 22 of this Bill for the defences which existed in section 2 (1) and (2) of the original Merchandise Marks Act, 1887.  In section 2 (1) a number of matters are itemised which may be offences.  It is stated that:</P>
      <P>These shall, subject to the provisions of this Act and unless he proved that he acted without intent to defraud be guilty of an offence under the Act.</P>
      <P>Section 2 (2) states:</P>
      <P>Every person who sells or exposes for or has in his possession for sale or any purpose of trade or manufacture any goods or things to which any forged trade mark or false trade description is applied or to which any trade mark or mark so nearly resembling a trade mark as to be calculated to deceive is falsely applied as the case may be, shall, unless he proves&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  that having taken all reasonable precautions against committing an offence against this Act, he had at the time of the commission of the alleged offence no reason to suspect the genuineness of the trade mark, mark or trade description; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  that on demand made by or on behalf of the prosecutor, he gave all the information in his power with respect to the persons <Col N="530" /> from whom he obtained such goods or things; or</P>
    <P>(c)  that otherwise he had acted innocently; </P>
    <P>It is considered that in practice it may be relatively easy for people to prove within the terms of those defences that he acted innocently; in fact, in practice it probably would fall on the prosecution to prove the existence of a guilty intent.  It is proposed to substitute for the defences which I have just outlined, which necessitate, if one may speak generally, an intent to defraud, the defences contained in section 22 (1) and these defences are to the effect that:</P>
    <P>In any proceedings for an offence under section 2 of the Principal Act involving a false trade description or an offence under this Act it shall, subject to subsection (2) of this section, be a defence for the person charged to prove&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that the commission of the offence was due to a mistake or the reliance on information supplied to him or to the act or default of another person, an accident or some other cause beyond his control; and</P>
    <P>(b)  that he took all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence to avoid the commission of such an offence by himself or any other person under his control. </P>
    <P>The present Bill would lose its effectiveness if the original provisions were retained and careless application of false descriptions without intent to defraud were permitted.  Accordingly, the provision has been removed and the defences in section 22 which require a more positive proof by the defendant that the offence was due to a mistake or the reliance on information supplied to him by another person and that he took all reasonable precautions. I am advised that the new form of defences are more appropriate to modern legislative and court practices and will be more effective.</P>

      <P>In page 4, after line 52, to add a subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Notwithstanding any provisions of the Acts or of the three foregoing subsections of this section, this Act shall apply to sales of land by private treaty and to sales of vehicles otherwise than by ways of trade.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill and the Acts seem to apply to sales in the course of trade and not, generally speaking, so far as one can see to private non-trading sales.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, exclusively. There are two particular areas that are referred to here in which difficulties can be created where there are sales otherwise than in the course of trade, and they are in the sale of land privately or, as I described it in the amendment, by private treaty, and in the sale of vehicles, particularly motor vehicles, and in the main I would have in mind there, generally speaking, secondhand vehicles.</P>
      <P>There is probably more litigation arising out of alleged misdescriptions of motor vehicles sold privately than there is probably in relation to any other single category of goods which are sold.  Such protection as this Bill gives&mdash;and it is limited to the criminal side of things; it is not a civil Bill at all&mdash;should be extended to the private sale of motor vehicles, in particular, and to the private sale of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, I drafted these amendments in the middle of last November, that is, four-and-a-half months ago.  All these matters were very much on the tip of my tongue at that time and I studied the matter in some detail.  I did not know until this morning that this Bill was being ordered for today, and had to come in and take it without being able to go back and read all my notes, because I already had to deal with the Friendly Societies Bill.  I would like to expand <Col N="532" /> this somewhat more if I had the opportunity to do it.  I presume the sale of land by an auctioneer at an auction is a sale in the course of trade, and that, therefore, the auctioneer would be liable to prosecution for a false trade description of that land, and I am assuming that land is, in fact included. The description of goods in section 1 covers ships, vehicles and aircraft, land, things attached to land and growing crops, and the description of land, as the Parliamentary Secretary will know, includes houses and all types of property, not just agricultural land.  Therefore, if an auctioneer at a public auction gives a description of land in its widest generic sense which proves to be false and if he is going to be prosecuted for that, that is fair enough, but the person who, say, inserts his own advertisement or does his own selling orally should be liable to the same penalties as somebody who is carrying on trade.  We come to the second half of the amendment, motor vehicles.  If they are sold by a garage proprietor in the course of his trade and he gives a false trade description of some car he is selling, he is liable to prosecution, but if the owner of the car does the same thing or something even more serious and gives a more serious misdescription, he is not liable at all. I find it difficult to be satisfied in my mind as to why it should apply only to sales in the course of trade when you have, for example, in the secondhand car market extensive non-trade purchasing and sale often giving rise to difficulties and to litigation.  Regarding the sale of land, I cannot give an exact figure but I estimate from my experience of it that about 90 per cent of land and houses are sold otherwise than by public auction or, perhaps, more than 90 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purpose of argument I am assuming that 50 per cent of property is not sold by auctioneers.  The Parliamentary Secretary would then appear to be applying two standards.  He would make the auctioneer liable criminally for a false trade description but not make the private vendor liable.  According to him, the auctioneer is liable where the vendor as likely as not gave a false description to the auctioneer who only passed it on.  That vendor would not be liable and the auctioneer who had, possibly in good faith, passed it on would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy but in relation to the point he made the auctioneer would have the defence which is contained in section 22 of the Bill.  If he could prove that the commission of the offence was due to a mistake or a reliance on information supplied to him or to the active default of another person, if the private vendor gave the auctioneer wrong information, the defence contained in section 22 (1) would apply to the auctioneer so long as adequate or reasonable precautions are taken and due diligence is exercised to avoid commission of such offence by himself or any other person under his control.  If he exercised all due diligence and having exercised all due diligence he still found he gave wrong information because he got the wrong information, <Col N="534" /> and had taken all necessary measures to check it and it was still wrong, he would have a good defence.</P>
      <P>The danger in Deputy O'Malley's amendment is that we are in this Bill extending the area of criminal law to certain statements made in the course of trade or business and we are extending it quite widely.  We are spreading the net of criminal liability. The justification for this in jurisprudence would be that one party is selling in the course of trade or business and the other party is buying as a consumer and not in the course of trade or business so that there is unequal bargaining between the two, and, therefore, it is necessary for the criminal law to step in and protect the consumer who is in the weaker bargaining position as against the trader who is in the stronger bargaining position in relation to the possession of information and so forth.  To bring criminal liability as far as Deputy O'Malley's amendment envisages and extend it to private sales of land between two individuals who are presumably in a perfectly equal situation would be bringing the criminal law right into the heart of civil law.  If misrepresentations are made&mdash;they would be termed misrepresentations in the context of civil law&mdash;if there is a false trade description in the context of criminal law, if misdescriptions are given it is best if they are private proceedings and not in the course of trade or business, to allow them to be dealt with in the normal way, through civil law.  I would not without reason favour this extension, though I agree that if one did have to select two areas where there might be necessity for some extra protection, land and vehicles would probably be a prime consideration. However, it would be better not to get into the area of private deals at all but to confine the Bill to dealing with sales made in the course of trade or business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said a minute ago that the vendor was selling in the course of his trade and that it was an unequal relationship because the consumer, as he put it, was not buying in the <Col N="535" /> course of trade.  I think they are the words he used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that very frequently that may not be so.  Surely every purchase from a trader is trade from the point of view of both the purchaser and the vendor.  Many purchases from, say, a wholesaler by a retailer are purchases by a trader from a trader and the relationship would appear to be equal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>To clarify it, the Bill applies to sales in the course of trade or business and it is not necessarily confined solely, as my initial contribution might have given the House to believe, to purchases made by consumers, but the necessary criterion is that it be a sale in the course of trade or business and it does not matter who is buying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect, my illustration may not have been very apt in that the distinction is between a person who is selling in the course of trade or business and a person who is selling purely as a private individual on a once-off basis; he is selling something of his own, he is not selling on a continuing basis.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  This could give rise to a lot of litigation and is it not appropriate that that area might be covered by such protection as this Bill would give?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very difficult in practice to do that.  If a <Col N="536" /> person holding himself out in course of trade or business to sell a particular thing, is consistently making a misstatement, one has the opportunity of identifying him, because he is a known individual, and of getting evidence against him because he will continue to be in business making similar sales. If one cannot get sufficient information to catch him out in relation to the first sale the information can be obtained in relation to a subsequent sale.</P>
      <P>The practical difficulties involved in policing what one individual says to another in a purely private capacity are enormous.  If I were to sell another Deputy a motor car the deal could be conducted orally and words could be spoken about what the car could or could not do.  The idea that the Director of Consumer Affairs would have the duty to investigate what I said to a Deputy about the car that I had agreed to sell on a particular day, would impose a very heavy burden of enforcement on the director and on the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The hardship imposed by the failure to make such a provision is not very great.  If people want to buy secondhand cars in relation to which they can be sure there is enforcement of the truth of the statements, by virtue of this Bill they can go to somebody selling secondhand cars in the course of business rather than buy a car from an individual who is not doing so.  If this were to be extended to land and to vehicles one would open the way to having it extended still further, to bicycles, or to a land rental situation.  If one once enters the area where one is dealing with sales made by private individuals not in the course of trade or business the list could be extended indefinitely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1887 Act was amended many times and was amended as recently as 1970.  I have not all those amending Acts and unfortunately one cannot get a version of the original <Col N="537" /> Act as it stands amended today without going through all of those amendments. I have not the time to do that, nor anybody to do it for me.</P>
      <P>It would appear from 2 (1) (d) of the 1887 Act that the prohibition on false trade descriptions applied to every person.  That is the beginning of subsection (1) to section 2&mdash;any person who (a), (b), (c), (d), applies any false trade description to goods.  There was no concept of its having to be applied in the course of trade or in the course of a sale by somebody whose trade or profession it was to do it.  Is this concept of trade being introduced now for the first time, or is it in one of the other amending Acts between 1887 and 1970?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that in the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887, it is confined to trade or business.  The expression &ldquo;goods&rdquo; means anything which is the subject of trade, manufacture or merchandise.  The Deputy's point may have validity.  I cannot to my own satisfaction answer the Deputy's point so far as the applicability of the 1887 Act is concerned outside the area of trade, business or profession. It is clear from the terms of this Act that the provisions of this Act will be applied solely to trade, business or profession by virtue of the fourth and fifth lines of section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is of some importance because it may be that this concept of confining the Merchandise Marks Acts generally, of which this is one, to sales in the course of trade may be a new concept that was not there in 1887.  If this is so it would seem strange that it was found possible in 1887 to extend it to all sales and purchases but in 1977 it is confined simply to sales which are made in the course of trade.  It would seem to be a retrograde step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the answer.  The word &ldquo;person&rdquo; is defined as manufacturer, dealer or trader so that referring back to section 2(1) the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; is confined to manufacturer, dealer or trader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest <Col N="538" /> respect, the Parliamentary Secretary is wrong.  Section (3) says:</P>
      <P>The expressions &ldquo;person&rdquo;, &ldquo;manufacturer&rdquo;, &ldquo;dealer&rdquo; or &ldquo;trader&rdquo;, and &ldquo;proprietor&rdquo; include any body of persons, corporate or unincorporate.</P>
      <P>That does not define &ldquo;person&rdquo; as manufacturer, dealer or trader but it defines manufacturer, dealer or trader, as including any body or person, corporate or unincorporate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  I must fall back then on the definition of &ldquo;goods&rdquo; which means anything that is the subject of trade, manufacture or merchandise.  Presumably trading, manufacturing or merchandising would occur only in the course of trade or business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;goods&rdquo; refers to anything that is the subject of manufacture.  For instance, a secondhand motor car would be the subject of manufacture since it was made at sometime.  It should not be merely a question of the Parliamentary Secretary trying to find something in section 3 which would enable him to say that the 1887 Act applied only to trade.  It is important that we would know the position exactly and that if that position applied to all sales from 1887 we should not now in 1977 be confining these Acts to a limited category of sales and to be excluding, for example, what I am trying to have included by way of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that in practice the Merchandise Marks Acts have applied only in the area of trade or business.  They have not been applied in the area of private sales.  It is implicit in the understanding of the word &ldquo;merchandise&rdquo; and of the very essence of the words &ldquo;trade description&rdquo; that we are dealing with trade descriptions legislation.  The word &ldquo;trade&rdquo; in that sense indicates that the legislation is confined to trade or business.  I assure the House, too, that there is no confining of the application of the legislation to areas in which it applied previously under the terms of the <Col N="539" /> Merchandise Marks Act, 1887.  I regret that I cannot put forward a definition from the 1887 Act which would make it clear that this is the case but I assure the House that in practice this is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so why is it necessary to include in this Bill numerous specific statements to the effect that only in the course of any trade, business or profession is this question of false trade descriptions to apply?  This statement appears in subsection (1) of section 4 and it appears further in subsections (2) and (3) of the same section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the discussion we have had answers the Deputy's point in the sense that there is not sufficient clarity in this regard. Certainly, the cursory reading of the section that has been possible here would not indicate clearly what has been the practical position since the enacting of the 1887 Act.  Since this Bill is extending the scope of the concept of &ldquo;trade description&rdquo; from the narrow area of trade marks to which it applied in the merchandise marks legislation it is necessary to indicate more clearly than was the case previously that the term is confined to sales that take place in the course of trade or business.</P>
      <P>It is possible also that in the context in which the Merchandise Marks Acts were drafted the distinction between private and public sales was not as specific as is the case now having regard to the nature of the economy at that time.  In practice and with the evolution of enforcement of the legislation down through the years the provision has been confined to what we know now as trade or business.  Perhaps it is for that reason that the distinction is being made.  It is possible that in 1887 there was a much greater number of transactions on a private basis than is the case now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps that is so but is this not the aspect of the matter that causes concern?  Although for consumption purposes on the part of <Col N="540" /> the public this legislation is referred to as consumer information legislation in effect it is merely another amendment to the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887 which has been amended many times.  The difficulty is that it appears that this 1887 legislation was applied to private sales but that we are now excluding all such transactions from the legislation in this area.  This is a regressive step.  Consumer protection should be extended as a principle rather than to be remote or withdrawn or made narrower in its application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree to this section.  I have made an important point.  It is not my wish unnecessarily to prolong this discussion but the Parliamentary Secretary should not come here without having available to him the provisions of the Merchandise Marks Acts.  He should not come to the House on Committee Stage seeking to have the law amended unless he knows what the law is.  He is floundering here because he does not know the position.  Admittedly this area of the law is not one about which many of us know a great deal but anybody bringing a Bill before the House seeking amendment of existing legislation should know what that legislation is and if he does not know it he should have people available who are in a position to apprise him of the situation.  Unfortunately that is not the position in the present case.  The Parliamentary Secretary is not aware of the effect of section 3 of the 1887 Act. It would appear to me that that section included all sales since it contains nothing that would confine it specifically to trade sales.  Section 4 here makes it very clear that from now on only trade sales will be covered.  That is regressive in the sense that where we had everything covered before, we now only have a limited percentage of transactions covered.  That is not moving in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole point here is to recall what the Merchandise Marks Acts were about.  They were about trade marks, a very confined <Col N="541" /> area of the use of certain symbols to indicate a certain quality or a connection with a particular firm.  One would use that sort of symbol only if one were selling things in the course of trade or business because the trade mark is, in effect, an abbreviation to indicate that a particular thing is part of a particular series.  Therefore by implication, by the very essence of the sort of matter we are dealing with, a trade mark implies that it is confined to trade or business.  A trade mark is a symbol with this purpose.</P>
      <P>What we are doing in this Bill is extending very greatly the scope of what was originally envisaged in the merchandise marks legislation, namely, a statement in relation to goods which if false is criminally actionable.  In the original legislation, that was confined to a very limited category of matters, namely, trade marks which of their very essence would be confined to trade. We are now extending the scope of this concept of a statement made in relation to a sale which if false is criminally actionable to a wide range of matters including fitness for purpose, and in effect any material information about the goods, not just the narrow use of a trade mark and the relationship of that trade mark to other types of goods being produced by the same manufacturer.  In sum, my submission is that the very essence of the merchandise marks legislation was such that it would be confined to transactions in the course of trade or business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is apparently correct in saying that the Merchandise Marks Act of 1887 applied only to trade marks.  If he looks for example, at <Col N="542" /> section 3 (1) and sees the definition of trade description, he will find that it covers many things that are certainly not trade marks.  That list has been considerably extended by section 2 (1) of this Bill and it includes things like &ldquo;(k) as to the contents of books or films or as to their authors or producers&rdquo;.  It has gone a long way from just trade marks.  The things listed there from (a) to (e) in the definition of trade description are much wider.  I do not want to delay the matter unduly but it is unsatisfactory that the Parliamentary Secretary is not able to tell us with any certainty, other than his belief which no doubt is <i>bona fide</i> but is still only his belief, that the 1887-1970 Acts applied only to trade.  If it was so certain that they applied only to trade &mdash;they have been in operation for 90 years&mdash;why should it be necessary to bring in all the amendments contained here in section 4?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is designed to cover a situation where an advertising campaign might be launched in relation to a particular range of goods and it would be stated at the outset that company X will be making available to the public goods which have the following qualities; that advertisement might appear on 30th April and the goods, or some quantity of them, might be manufactured on 1st May and made available to the public on 6th May.  Quite clearly, the public would understand the advertising to relate to these goods because the same brand name would be used and the advertisement would be in relation to a particular set of goods clearly identifiable and the mere action that advertisement appeared, and that a particular number happened to have been manufactured the day after the <Col N="545" /> particular set of goods might not appear in the shops until a week after the advertisement appeared, should not invalidate a prosecution against the person who had put forward a misleading advertisement in relation to the goods.  Otherwise it would be necessary to prove the individual manufacturing dates of individual items on a shelf and one might have been manufactured before the advertisement and another after the advertisement appeared and one could say the advertisement was misleading in respect of A but not in respect of B if one did not have a provision like this.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1) (b) (ii), line 21, after &ldquo;nature&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, effect or fitness for purpose&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment extends the effect of the subsection so that a false or reckless statement made about the fitness for purpose of the service or accommodation or facility would be an offence in the same way as a statement about its nature.  The change was recommended by the National Consumers' Advisory Council and it is desirable as it will cover situations where services or facilities clearly could not fulfil their purpose.  The concept of fitness for purpose is already included in relation to goods in section <Col N="546" /> 2 (1) (g).  When one is introducing the concept of extending the protection of services one is entering a new area and it was not realised in the original draft that there could be a distinct concept of the fitness for purpose of a particular service in addition to its actual nature and people might be interested in whether a service, apart from being of a particular nature, went on to produce a further effect and for the purpose of definition and comprehensiveness this amendment is, therefore, necessary.  It also brings the provision in relation to services in line with the provision in respect of goods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to amend (v) because this relates to the place in which the service, facility or accommodation is provided.  Place of its essence is singular and, therefore, the service would be singular in so far as it is provided in a particular place.  Service is plural if it is provided in a number of places but I do not think it is necessary to have the plural in (v).</P>

      <P>Section 6 (1) (b) (v) would be interpreted here in the sense that it would be applied to each of the cases in which the bus service was provided.  If one were arguing it was a service provided in a particular place the bus service provided in that particular place would be singular but if one wished to deal with a number of of locations one would use that subsection a number of times in respect of each of those places.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (2) (b), lines 41 to 43, to delete &ldquo;, whether or not the person making it had reasons for believing that it might be false&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;unless the person making it had adequate reasons for believing that it was true&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 6 (2) (b) sets out to define the word &ldquo;recklessly&rdquo; used in subsection (1) (b).  It may be argued against the existing draft that if a person making it had reason to believe that it might be false he would be making a false statement and not a reckless statement.  The effect of the amendment is to ensure that any statement made, without positive reasons for believing it to be true, would be a reckless statement.  In addition, the point has been made that proving knowledge by a person in section 6 (1) (a) could be too onerous a burden on the prosecution in which case the prosecution can fall back on the offence in section 6 (1) (b) in respect of which the definition now proposed in this amendment is clearer.</P>

      <P>It is more or less a shifting of the onus.  The onus will now be on the defence to produce the reasons whereas if it is left &ldquo;recklessly&rdquo; the onus is on the prosecution to prove that he was reckless.  He will have to come up with reasons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Adequate&rdquo; was not in the original draft.  The subsection stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="548" /> Whether or not the person making it had reasons for believing that it might be false.</P>
    <P>Now it states:</P>
    <P>Unless the person making it had adequate reasons for believing that it was true.</P>
    <P>Who decides how adequate is adequate?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The court.  In fact the idea of adequacy is necessary because the situation created by the amendment is that the defendant will now have to produce the reasons on which he based his judgment.  It will be for the court to decide if those reasons are adequate.  The emphasis in the Bill, as it was originally drafted, was on the recklessness of the defendant and whether or not he had reasons was subsidiary to the understanding that it was reckless.  When one shifts the emphasis on to the reasons, as we are proposing to do in the amendment, it is necessary to define those reasons as being adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking here about services in general.  Deputy O'Malley spoke about bus services, when we were talking about a service being singular or plural.  CIE produce a Dublin city bus guide which says that the 19A bus leaves Rialto at certain times.  I do not believe that any day in the year the service claimed in the bus timetable is provided.  I do not believe CIE could establish that the bus leaving the Rialto terminus leaves at the times mentioned in the bus time-table. Can it be claimed that they are in breach of section 6?  I do not believe that CIE can now issue that type of timetable.  Our experience up to now indicates that the person making the claim against that bus timetable would have adequate reasons for believing that CIE could not stand over the service. Does that mean that under subsection (2) of this section CIE cannot produce such a time-table because they would not be able to stand over the claim that they are able to stick to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that a bus service is not a service within the meaning of the Act and that a time-table <Col N="549" /> is only a convenient indicator and is not a trade description within the meaning of the Act.  CIE, therefore, would not be subject to prosecution in view of the purpose for which the timetable is made available.  It is a guide rather than a promise.  However, I believe it probably would be accepted, even if that were not the case, that CIE had adequate grounds for believing that the service stated in their timetable would be provided because they would have made all the arrangements to ensure that the bus would turn up in time, and any individual departure from the timetable would not be considered to take from the adequate grounds for believing their statements to be true.  In any event I do not think, as I said at the outset, the timetable ties them down in every case to having the bus turning up at precisely 10.43 at a particular stop. The purpose of the timetable is not understood to have that binding connotation but merely to act as a guide in general to the consumer, and the purpose of the Bill would therefore not apply to CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary saying that the Bill does not apply to CIE?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not apply to the timetable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that this Bill was to protect the public from misleading information.  We are dealing here with a section which is headed &ldquo;False or misleading statements as to services, etc&rdquo;, and the subsection we are dealing with says that for the purpose of this section a statement made regardless of whether it is true or false shall be deemed to be made recklessly unless the person making it had adequate reasons for believing it was true.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce suggesting here that timetables are promises of service which are only a guide and not something to be taken seriously? That is exactly what the Parliamentary Secretary has just said, that if the timetable I get from CIE indicates that a bus will be leaving Store Street station at 8 o'clock I am not to <Col N="550" /> depend upon that, that that is not covered under section 6, that the Minister is specifically leaving out CIE and that CIE can continue, if they so desire, to make false or misleading statements as to the service they are providing.  It is only the private company, the people who tell you there are so many ounces of peas in a can whom we are getting after, not the State-sponsored boards.  They can still supply a haphazard service and make misleading statements for which they will not be accountable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing here with the timetable, which is issued as a guide as to the provision of services by CIE.  I cannot quote from what it states in the timetable or any of the clauses which CIE may have inserted in the timetable to save themselves from being tied down to particular times in respect of buses.  If we had a timetable here we possibly would see that CIE have stated there that they cannot guarantee necessarily that every bus will turn up at a particular time at every stop precisely as it appears on the timetable.  In that sense they have, if you like, saved themselves and have not attempted to mislead the consumer in relation to the service they are providing.</P>
      <P>However, it is certainly the case that CIE are not exempt from the legislation in so far as the essence of a transport service being provided is concerned.  If they cease to provide a transport service altogether and yet are holding themselves out as doing so, or if they said they would provide a particular type of service with certain facilities in the bus and the bus turned up without having these facilities and on a continuing basis, and they had not excluded their liability in this situation by some clause indicating that they could not guarantee that the particular service would be provided in the manner specified in the statement, then the provisions of the Bill would apply. However, the essence of the matter is that the timetable must be read in the context of whatever accompanying statement CIE made about their liability to provide the particular services precisely as indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="551" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that the Parliamentary Secretary should go on to refer to some other type of service. Again in relation to the 19A Rialto bus, does that mean that if CIE advertise that there will be music upstairs on that bus, which is one of the things they do boast about and which has nothing to do with the timetable, and if the music is not played upstairs on that bus, they will be prosecuted under this section?  That is a service which CIE claim to provide, and the Parliamentary Secretary has just said that if they claim they will do something and they do not carry it out and if they have no escape clause&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously a practical view would be taken of these matters in the case of a criminal prosecution. If, for instance, anybody providing a particular service makes a mistake on one occasion or fails to live up to his promise on one occasion, that will not necessarily be the subject of a prosecution. It is only where there is a systematic breach of the law that prosecution will occur.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 6, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The concept of reckless statements constituting an offence is new and may disturb some people, particularly in the light of the amendment which has been made to the definition of what could be regarded as reckless.  Before amendment 9 was made the word &ldquo;false&rdquo; was used: &ldquo;whether or not the person making it had reason for believing that it might be false, and then &ldquo;false&rdquo; was defined in subsection (4) as being &ldquo;false to a material degree&rdquo;.  The degree of recklessness, if you like to put it that way, has been decreased somewhat perhaps by the amendment. It may be difficult for somebody to prove that he was not reckless within the meaning of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, in this whole matter it is a question of changing the onus of proof all the time.  It is very hard to forget that the people who are so anxious to change the onus of proof now, used nearly to go into orbit four <Col N="552" /> years ago if there was the faintest suggestion in any Bill that such a heinous thing might be done.  I am glad to see they have changed their view in that respect.  However, this whole concept of change of onus of proof and making the defendant prove his own innocence is fairly widespread in this Bill, particularly in this section.</P>
    <P>I know the topic we are dealing with is one where the average consumer is presumably at something of a disadvantage most of the time as against the person who might mislead him, but nonetheless the trader has rights too which should not be forgotten. We should be careful not to make it virtually impossible for traders in certain circumstances to sell certain products of theirs without running into very considerable difficulties.  The Parliamentary Secretary is no doubt aware of the difficulties created in the USA under the concept of product liability where a lot of firms have gone out of business because of impositions placed on them by legislation.  We may be tending to go in that direction. It is hard to know where to stop.  You have to go a certain distance in order to protect the consumer but if you go too far at all you may put perfectly legitimate and law-abiding traders and manufacturers in an impossible position. One instance of where they could possibly get into this situation is this concept of recklessness in their statements. One almost takes for granted a certain exaggeration about the value or efficacy of a manufacturer's product and one learns and tends to diminish somewhat the encouragement one gets in an advertisement or a trade description of those goods.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to the section, but I am pointing out that there could be some problems and that some perfectly legitimate and law-abiding traders feel that there could be problems, particularly in regard to this concept of recklessness which is a step beyond the concept of falsity.  One can be caught and prosecuted and, presumably, convicted criminally for recklessness in relation to a description of goods or services.  It is right to draw attention to this because this is one of the sections that does not get very much attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This section applies in the first place to statements made voluntarily by the trader.  He does not have to make the statements.  Secondly, those statements must be either false or misleading in a material degree, and the court decides that.  In so far as this section applies to services, the person making the statement must either know that the statement was a false statement which he made voluntarily and the falseness of which will have been determined by the court, or he must have made this voluntary statement recklessly.  The section as it now stands defines &ldquo;recklessly&rdquo; as not having adequate grounds for believing that it was true.  We must look at this section from the point of view of the consumer who is likely to be misled by this statement and we must bear in mind that the trader did not have to make the statement in the first place; and if he is a proper trader in any event, if he did make the statement he has and should have the means to satisfy himself that it was true.  If he has not adequate grounds for being sure it is true and still goes ahead and makes the statement he is behaving recklessly and should be prosecuted if he causes consumers to lose money as a result.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (2) (a), line 14, before &ldquo;within&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;at the same place&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this amendment is to ensure that it will not be possible to evade the requirement by pointing to a lower price in the previous three months at another branch of the same firm which might be the result of a different pricing policy in another area or town while the price at the premises showing a claimed reduction was not reduced.  This change was suggested by the National Consumers' <Col N="554" /> Advisory Council and it is sensible when one bears in mind that we have the growth nowadays of chain stores. It should not be enough to validate a claim that a reduction in a particular commodity has been made, that at some other branch of the same chain perhaps 100 miles away for 28 days the price was lower, although it was never any lower than it is now in the branch where the person in question is buying the goods.</P>
    <P>Regarding amendment No. 13, a suggestion by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce would have substituted the words &ldquo;on the premises where the indication is displayed&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;in every place in the State&rdquo;.  As, however, the indication might be given not on the premises but in a newspaper advertisement, the amendment proposed has been worded so as to limit its application to notices on a sales premises.  The effect of the amendment, therefore, is that a price notice in a shop will be taken as referring only to that shop unless it states otherwise, whereas a notice or advertisement elsewhere will be taken as referring to all branches unless it is stated otherwise. This is to clarify the situation in relation to a notice which is displayed in a particular shop and to limit more clearly its area of application.</P>

It has been suggested rather strongly to me that there are many items which are seasonal items which would not have been on sale within the previous three months because it was not the appropriate season for them but which would have been on sale within the previous six months.  It seems reasonable, therefore, that in relation to items of that kind traders should be allowed to show them as being marked down. I presume that in practice nowadays <Col N="555" /> this really relates only to sales because with the price of everything going up most of the time the question of marking down does not normally apply, particularly since seasonal items tend to be included in sales where firms are trying to move stock that may now have gone out of date in order to replace it by modern stock.  It seems reasonable that they should be allowed an opportunity of showing what the price was within the previous six months which would, generally speaking, include the season concerned but which three months might be too short to include.</P>

      <P>The difficulty in Deputy O'Malley's amendment is that it would impose a very great burden to go back and get information on the tendered prices over a period of six months. This has been the experience in Britain where they tried to operate on a six-months basis and the committee of the office of fair trading which went into the matter recommended that from a practical point of view it would be much more effective and sensible to confine this to a period of three months. In any event, the statement about reduced prices does not have to be made or if made it can be clarified as to the precise date on which it was sold at the higher price.  For instance, in relation to seasonal goods they can say &ldquo;this is lower than the last season's price&rdquo;.  That would presumably meet the case.</P>

      <P>It is but the difficulty with the Deputy's amendment is that it would not just apply to seasonal goods.  It would apply to all goods and if one were to extend the period of six months in relation to groceries, for instance, which are not seasonal, the problems of enforcement would be very great indeed.  I see some merit in the argument so far as it applies to seasonal goods but then you would have the problem of defining seasonal goods.</P>

      <P>On section 7 (2) (f), in relation to the number of items which one could purchase, it must be obvious that there would have to be a charge for installing goods.  Does it not seem a bit harsh that an offence could be committed by not indicating the charge or the fact of the charge when the average person would take it for granted that there would be a charge?  For example, in the purchase of carpets one assumes that there would be a charge for laying a carpet. If one purchases a kitchen sink or washhand basin one cannot expect that that will be installed for nothing <Col N="557" /> because plumbing and a certain amount of skilled installation is required.  There are electrical appliances of various kinds that would have to be installed by more than just putting a plug into a wall, where wiring is needed, where one would clearly anticipate that some charge would be made.  In these circumstances is (2) (f) going a bit too far, if one does not specify what the charge will be in relation to the installation of a bath for instance?  The supplier might have no idea how much it would cost to install a bath.  It could cost very little if all the necessary plumbing and facilities were already there but if it is being installed in a house which never had a bath that would be a fairly costly installation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy has said is undoubtedly true in most cases, but the fact still remains that a person could be misled into thinking that a price attached in relation to a commodity was intended to cover the full costs of acquiring it.  That person might be misled, if, having bought the commodity on the strength of the price quoted, he discovered that there were other goods or services which had to be purchased at further additional cost to enable him to make any use at all of the commodity he had bought on the strength of the original price quoted.  Paragraph (f) is different from the others in that it requires that particular information be given in relation to the price as well as requiring that information be not false.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a good thing.  It improves consumer information in an area such as this where people buying this sort of equipment would probably not make the same kind of purchase again and they could not necessarily be expected to know the precise additional services they would have to buy to get a gadget into a condition in which they could use it.  It is material information which should be made available to people.  If people are going to make an issue of their price by displaying it in this manner, they should also be required to make available the additional information either <Col N="558" /> by giving the price for the additional services or by indicating the existence of further charges which the consumer could on further inquiry gain knowledge of before he entered into a contract on the basis of the original statement by the trader as to price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has not dealt with the precise type of example I gave.  It would be impossible for a supplier of a bath to know the cost of installation without first surveying the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>But the trader can meet the requirements by stipulating that the price quoted does not include the cost of installation.  Therefore, he would not need to know at that stage what the installation would cost but he is putting the consumer on notice. At that stage the consumer would be able to make a rational decision on the basis of the best information available to the trader.  That is reasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that where it is obvious that there would be a fair amount of expense involved in installation or connection, it should hardly be necessary for a trader to specify that the price does not include the cost of installation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If, for example, one is selling baths in the course of his trade, under paragraph (f) of subsection (2) he would be obliged either to state the cost of installation, although this would be very difficult to estimate as the cost would vary from house to house, or he would have to place on every bath a legible statement to the effect that the price did not include the cost of installation. No ordinary consumer would be under the impression that the cost of installation was included in the price.</P>

      <P>I understand that the subsection would not apply in cases such as those mentioned by the Deputy but only in cases in which a price was displayed in such a manner that one would assume in normal <Col N="559" /> trading practice that it covered all ancillary costs.  The subsection would not be invoked in respect of a case such as that mentioned by the Deputy because it would not be normal to expect that the price would include both the cost of the item and the cost of installation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to prepare and implement a national energy policy based on the maximum use of the country's natural resources and making adequate provision for the protection of the natural environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="560" /> It is not our intention in moving this motion to make a political football out of the energy situation&mdash;a motive of which we were accused twice recently in regard to Private Members' motions.  Our purpose is to highlight the absence of an energy policy and to highlight also the importance of an energy policy to the welfare of the country.  We all know that a stable supply of energy at an acceptable price is a prerequisite for all economic development without which social progress would be impossible.</P>
    <P>During the last months of 1973 international economic relations were disrupted as a result of new policies pursued by the oil producing countries, better known as the OPEC countries.  At first, the OPEC countries introduced restrictions on the output and distribution of oil and oil products.  They then increased the prices of their oil exports by successive stages.  This had its effect on the prospects for employment.  At first, employment appeared to be threatened by cuts in production resulting from material shortages.  From 1974 the threat came mainly from the impact of oil price increases and the threat to the balance of payments came from oil price increases.  There was also the threat to domestic inflation and the threat to the pattern of internal demands throughout the entire country.  The major consequence of these changes has been a substantial threat to the growth of real income in the short-term and a marked change in the pattern of world trade.  The initial effect of higher oil prices is to reduce the purchasing power of any country and it happened in this country.  It creates a substantial deterioration in the terms of trade which means that more real resources must be exported to pay for the same amount of imports. It created substantial change in the structure of internal prices which has resulted directly or indirectly in changes in the pattern of activities and employment within the country.</P>
    <P>These basic elements of economic reality were capable of recognition in the first half of 1974&mdash;I repeat in the first half of 1974.  It should have been realised that a reduction in the rate <Col N="561" /> of growth of real income and price increases would have to be absorbed at a time when inflation had already reached serious proportions.  Inflation was at that time disrupting the pattern of income distribution mostly to the detriment of the weaker sections of our society.  Efforts by the stronger groups to maintain past rates of growth of real income by demanding higher money incomes could only lead directly or indirectly to higher unemployment. One thing is certain: there is a close link between economic growth and energy consumption.  This became very obvious at that time and it was apparent to everyone in 1974. It follows, therefore, that an essential element in any economic policy should be a well-thought-out energy policy. Since 1974 we have awaited the production of an energy or an economic policy.  We have not yet had either one or the other.  Instead, we have had an example of somebody listening to the superficial statements expounded during those months of price increases between October, 1973, and April, 1974, and influencing Government policies of attempting to reduce consumption of oil and oil products by endeavouring to price consumers away from the necessary usage of these products.</P>
    <P>No regard was paid to the particular situation of the Irish consumer, to the fragmentation of our population density, or to the essential factors in the amount of energy consumed in Ireland.  If we take note of EEC and OECD exchanges in the energy field, we see in a world context and in the context of energy how necessary an energy policy is.  Otherwise, the very means of sustaining life may be in jeopardy for the next generation.</P>
    <P>The cost of energy input into the production and consumption structure has grown from £120 million in 1972 to between £700 million and £800 million today.  That is the consumer cost.  The escalation in cost input has not only contributed to the number of unemployed but has so affected production and consumption cost structures that the consequent aid to inflation has triggered off very significant influences, all of which in turn have affected the standards of everyone.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="562" /> The Coalition Government, instead of responding to what was apparent in 1974, succeeded in fuelling the inflationary effects of the energy cost increase by imposing further tax on petrol, as we remember at the end of 1974 when they put 15p on petrol.  We remember also the reasons given for this imposition&mdash;that so much of our petrol was going over the Border it was interfering with our balance of payments was the main one. The Government further extended the range of taxes over all oil products in the 1976 budget which added greatly to industrial costs and must have had a very serious effect on employment. That is the kernel of our criticism, the cost imposed by our own Government adding to the cost imposed by the OPEC countries in their various increases.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government ignored the need that became evident to all during 1974 and then compounded the problem created for the economy and the industrial and social structure as a whole by utilising oil products as a medium to finance current expenditure incurred by themselves in an effort to buy political peace or support during that period.</P>
    <P>For three years we have been exposed to the myth of Coalition ability.  Here is one classic example&mdash; one of many&mdash;where the problem, having been exposed so clearly that even a child could diagnose the cause of it, the Coalition did not attempt to remedy it but proceeded to add further complications to an already serious problem.  The lack of understanding has meant that industrial production has not responded to the need for change.  Our production costs are causing us to be priced not only out of the export market but even out of the home market.  It is no use for the Government to say that we built a few houses without fireplaces&mdash;that was a decision made on the basis of facts prevailing at the time.  The changed circumstances applying since 1973 should have encouraged action on costs since then.  What are the facts since that time?  The IIRS have been encouraged to assist in energy saving schemes&mdash;a very worth-while exercise in our opinion.  The problem for <Col N="563" /> Ireland is not just to save 1 per cent or 2 per cent, but to get the consumers' cost of central energy utilisation down by very much greater percentages.</P>
    <P>The economy is to be motivated so that the aspirations of our people for an increased standard of living will be achieved.  The Government should and must initiate policies which will substantially lower the cost of energy consumption across the board.  We propose the establishment of an energy authority which will examine and report on the entire energy needs of the nation.  Such an authority will be encouraged to recommend measures to achieve self-sufficiency in refining capacity.  We are all aware of the importance of refining capacity and we stressed this at the time of the oil crisis in October, 1973 and have continued to do so.  We have the capacity to refine 50 per cent of our oil requirement.  The remainder, about 2.5 million tons, has to be imported by way of products from other countries and other refineries.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the former Minister for Transport and Power here tonight.  He told us in 1973 that we were in the hands of the multi-national oil companies.  This party maintain that we are still in the hands of those multi-national oil companies.  We have no more control over our oil and energy supplies now than we had in October, 1973.  We still have the refinery at Whitegate.  Even though it does a good job supplying 50 per cent of our oil needs, we are still dependent on the multi-nationals and outside influences for the remainder of our oil requirements.</P>
    <P>If we were self-sufficient in refining capacity, we would at least have control over supply and cost.  Without adequate refining capacity we cannot have this control.  This means that we are still in the same position as we were in October, 1973&mdash;almost three-and-a-half years ago.  It takes approximately three years to build a refinery and have it on-stream.  This means that we have lost three further years in gaining self-sufficiency.  We continue to have no control over supply and cost. If an oil refinery was about to become operational here we would have control <Col N="564" /> over supply.  We could buy direct from the OPEC countries as other countries are doing.  Tankers, tied up around the world at the moment, are two a penny and can be chartered very cheaply.  We could be importing crude oil and refining it here.  We could have Government participation in the said refinery and have control of cost.</P>
    <P>By having control of cost and endeavouring and succeeding in bringing down present costs of products we would create an atmosphere where the people supplying the remaining 50 per cent of our oil requirements would be forced to compete with the second refinery. They in turn would have to bring down their costs.  This happened in Britain.  The multi-national companies operating there had to get involved in price cutting because a French company bought out the interests of an existing British company's distribution interest and started supplying oil on the British market.  This brought down the costs and the big companies had to compete.  The result is that at present a gallon of petrol is about 10 per cent&mdash;approximately 10p&mdash;cheaper in the United Kingdom than here.  This is a sizeable amount.</P>
    <P>No attempt has been made to try to deal with this problem which has been with us since October 1973.  We in this House are within our rights to highlight the importance of the failure of the Government to initiate any form of an energy policy and more particularly to get a second refinery under way with some Government participation thereby leading to control of supply and cost.  I do not know of any active proposal to erect such a refinery or of any encouragement being given to any group to do so or to get involved in such a project at present.  Nothing has happened since 1973.  I fail to see where we have an energy policy in any form.</P>
    <P>Our industrialists, petrol users and so on, are still exposed to the same influences.  This has had a detrimental effect on our industrial output and industrial operations.  The increases not only by the OPEC suppliers but also by the taxation imposed in the 1976 budget on heavy fuel oil for industry have added greatly to industrial costs. This has made industrialists less competitive <Col N="565" /> not only on the home market but also in world markets.  This in turn has led to more unemployment here. Nothing has been done about this.  The taxes still exist.  The extra costs imposed by the Government are still with us.  While this Government remain in office it appears that these taxes and extra charges will remain.</P>
    <P>As we said during the debate on An Bord Gáis, this party would not permit the waste which has occurred or is about to occur with the discovery of natural gas.  The Government decided to give half of the gas to the ESB to create more electricity thereby effectively wasting close on 75 per cent of its thermal value. At that time we advocated that a gas grid should be set up whereby the natural gas could be fed into areas which already have a gas mains structure in different towns and cities, such as Dublin.  In that way cheaper domestic fuel would be available to users than that which they now have. We also maintain that it should be utilised to supply low cost energy to industry in some areas.  These ideas were unacceptable to the Coalition when we put them forward and we still find ourselves about to waste a large percentage of this natural gas. In Britain they have utilised it for low-cost energy and they are so competitive that the Coal Board and the Electricity Authority cannot compete. Here there was a golden opportunity for this Government and the country to start on the right foot with its first strike of natural gas or oil and utilise it properly, maximising it for the benefit of consumers and thereby helping industry and those dependent on gas for domestic use.  Despite what we advocated, the Government continue on the course of wasting this natural resource which we were so fortunate to find.</P>
    <P>The EEC have failed to a great extent in establishing a realistic energy policy.  They have had meetings and the only thing we can ascertain from these meetings is their failure to come up with a realistic energy policy.  In the period up to 1973 the Community adopted a series of measures in the energy field.  These were however, too specific and too <Col N="566" /> limited in their scope to constitute an effective basis for a Community energy policy.  The 1960s and early 1970s were years of economic expansion not only here but in the EEC countries as well.  People believed there were adequate energy supplies available and such optimism was hardly calculated to induce the member states to work out the principles on which a Community energy policy could be based.  Not until 1973, when faced with the energy crisis, was an attempt made at such a policy and not until then did such a policy become an urgent priority.</P>
    <P>In so far as there is a policy it would appear to be one of guaranteeing security of supply by reducing dependence on imported energy, an import which amounted to 61.4 per cent in June, 1975.  Secondly, in so far as there is a policy, it would appear to be one of preserving the Community and the Common Market in the event of a crisis in oil supplies. On the negative side it appears unlikely that even the latest optimistic figures mentioned in the Council's resolution of 17th December, 1974, namely, a reduction of dependence on imported energy, will be achieved by 1980 and recent OECD estimates indicate that at best the Community's nuclear capacity will reach only 85.8 gw by the beginning of 1985, little more than half the objective set in 1974.  Even if new policy measures permit an acceleration in the installation of nuclear equipment within the EEC targets will not obviously be achieved by 1985.  At the same time, the cost of imported oil has increased sharply within all these countries with adverse effects on the balance of payments of all the member states.</P>
    <P>It is by no means sure that the availability of oil supplies from outside the Community can be guaranteed if world consumption is maintained at its present level.  Oil reserves in some of the major oil producing countries will not last more than 40 years at the present rate of exploitation. Producing countries with large reserves not in need of additional revenue may be unwilling to increase production.  Any growth in world demand, such as might come from <Col N="567" /> outside the Community, could lead to a further increase in the price of oil reinforcing the need for an overall Community policy aimed at reducing dependence on imported hydrocarbons and the development of alternative sources of energy.  This would include the development of North Sea oil.</P>
    <P>On the positive side, the Community's record since the 1973 oil crisis has not been entirely satisfactory. The Community consumed 2½ per cent less energy in 1976 than 1973.  Imports were reduced by 7½ per cent.  In this the Community is helped by such factors as a relatively low level of economic activity in certain energy intensive industry.  The Community has made some progress, but that is not enough, by the reduction of its dependence on imported energy and that reduction becomes more pressing with each successive increase in oil prices.  The year 1985 is the target year.  The European Parliament and particularly the Committee on Energy and Research have stressed the need for positive action.  The European Parliament is convinced that the adoption and implementation of a comprehensive energy policy by the Community is the only way to guarantee energy supplies.  Like this party, it is convinced that a suitable supply of energy at an acceptable price is a prerequisite for all economic development on which social progress will be based.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Community have failed to a great extent to initiate a comprehensive energy policy and we have failed as a nation to initiate such a policy.  We tabled this motion to highlight that fact and to stress again the importance of a realistic energy policy.  Since we will go on being dependent on oil and oil products for years to come the first essential is to ensure self-sufficiency in refining capacity with some control over supply and costs.  We are fortunate in having some natural sources of energy but they are only a percentage of total requirements and we are faced with the fact that we will continue to import oil for quite some years.  Even if we are fortunate enough to find oil off our south or west coast, it will still be <Col N="568" /> some years before that oil can be brought ashore.  That is particularly true in the case of the west coast because of the depth at which the oil is and the problem will be to make it a commercially viable proposition.  Nobody has so far discovered a means by which to take out oil at a greater depth than 580 feet.  That is the depth in the North Sea.  Some of the deposits off the west coast are at a lower depth than 600 feet.  If we find it, and hopefully we will, it will not be coming ashore for quite some years and, in the meantime, it is obvious, as it has been for the last three-and-a-half years, that the first essential is to become self-sufficient in refining capacity.</P>
    <P>Until we find our own oil we can buy it direct from the OPEC countries and from the Arab countries.  They are quite willing to do business with us and to sell direct to us.  We have much to offer in exchange, in technology, agriculture and many fields, which could be utilised for the importation of crude oil from some of those underdeveloped countries.  When we are fortunate enough to find our own oil, we will be able to refine it with the least possible delay and get the full benefit of being so lucky which will be of great benefit for the domestic consumer and the motorist but more important still, for the industrialist who has been faced with such costs in recent years that his competitiveness in the foreign markets and in the home market has been interfered with.</P>
    <P>We maintain that we must have a realistic policy and that we have not had such a policy.  We believe it is past time for initiating such a policy.  This side of the House will have no hesitation in initiating an energy policy when returned to Government after the next election.  We intend to get to the base of the massive energy problem which we will have to face for some time to come.  We intend to do something realistic about the energy question in order to benefit the economic welfare of the country and to give some element of security to all the users of energy in the country.</P>

      <Col N="569" /> To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;approves of the energy policy of the Government which is aimed at optimum development of the country's natural resources, ensuring adequate and secure supplies of energy at reasonable cost and promoting rational and efficient use of energy, while making adequate provision for the protection of the natural environment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett opened the debate on this motion by saying that he did not intend to make a political football out of an energy policy and then proceeded to do that.  He has been trying to kick this ball, which he says is not politics, around this House and the country in the last four years.  It is a punctured ball now.  He has not changed in the slightest nor has he kept up to date in any one of these matters since he first started speaking on behalf of the Opposition on Transport and Power more than four years ago.</P>
    <P>He used exactly the same argument tonight as he used four years ago in the various speeches he then made. He used the same arguments as he used in a number of Private Members' motions, on two Estimates I took when I was Minister for Transport and Power and in a motion before the House to approve our membership of the International Energy Agency.  The only change in his speech tonight is that he never mentioned the IEA.  I presume he has now learned the facts of life, that we should be a member of this, and he no longer disapproves of that part of our policy, which is an essential part of the Government's energy policy.  He also made the same speech in the debate on the Gas Bill last year.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's statements are without foundation.  They are full of false data, misquotations and insularity. The only set of figures he used in his speech are inaccurate.  He said that the cost of energy has gone from £120 million to between £700 and £800 million in the last four years.  This is wrong.  It could easily have been <Col N="570" /> checked and found out to be wrong if Deputy Barrett had done so.</P>
    <P>The latest authoritative and possibly the deepest study on energy done in this country is the Dr. Henry Report which was published in late November or early December last year.  If the Deputy cares to refer to Table 45, page 29, of that report he will see that it is estimated that the cost has gone up from £281 million to £555 million, a big difference in percentage increase between £120 million to the £700 to £800 million that Deputy Barrett gave. I am using that to point out the false basis on which Deputy Barrett has been arguing here for the last four years.</P>
    <P>The Government have an energy policy.  I presume Deputy Barrett really means that he cannot go into Eason's. Stanley's or any other bookshop and ask if he can have a copy of the Coalition's energy policy, put his 25p or 30p on the counter and get a bound volume.  I accept that one cannot do that.  However, there is an energy policy in the country.  It has been built on and readjusted continuously as any good policy should be.  There should not be a policy for all time in this regard. It is composed of about six headings, which I have named in the House on many occasions.  He will see two speeches by me when I was Minister for Transport and Power which are long and comprehensive regarding the Government's energy policy, one of which I delivered to the gas conference in Kilkenny in 1975 and a further one which I delivered to the Fine Gael Branch in University College Cork about 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>They are long, exhaustive and comprehensive reviews of the energy situation and spell out in great detail the Government's energy policy.  The main elements of that policy are the optimum development of indigenous energy resources, access to the cheapest markets for imported energy sources and diversification of sources of energy supply, promotion of the economy in the use of fuels, stockpiling against emergency situations and participation in research aimed at discovery and development of new energy sources. These are the main strands of our energy policy and of them there are <Col N="571" /> a number of various threads which feed these strands and which are adjusted from time to time in a changing situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett said that the Government have neither an energy nor an economic policy.  We have spelt out endlessly in the Dáil the necessity for an economic policy that is realistic and geared to the situation at the time.  We have been spelling out this in the most difficult circumstances any democratic Government have ever been through, not just in Ireland.  Democracies all over the world have met the most difficult times in this century since October, 1973, when the oil crisis unexpectedly erupted on the economic scene.  This had devestating effects not alone on what is called the western world.</P>
    <P>Even though this is a poor country it is a developed one and had a certain amount of resilience to the effects of the oil crisis.  It had a certain amount of basic resources which it could use to offset the worst effects of it.  It had appalling effects on the developing world.  The quadrupling of the price of energy for the developing world has had shattering effects on their economy. If we choose to ignore the damage that has been done to the developing countries in order to ensure that the countries in the western world can return to the growth path of the 1960s and the early 1970s this will give us a certain amount of comfort in the short term but in the long term we will pay a very dear price for that.</P>
    <P>Earlier today, when the Taoiseach reported on the summit conference in Rome he said something which has not been commented on yet, but it is quite significant.  He said:</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the last OECD <i>Economic Outlook</i> forecast for member countries&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  an increase of GNP of 3¾ per cent in 1977 compared with an estimated 5 per cent in 1976;</P>
    <P>(2)  a growth of trade of about 6 per cent or about half the percentage growth of 1976;</P>
    <P>(3)  unemployed of 5¼ per cent in 1976.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="572" /> European Commission forecasts for the countries of the Community are similarly disturbing.  They say that growth may well be slower in 1977 than in 1976 and unemployment higher.</P>
    <P>In fact, in their view Ireland, the Netherlands and Germany are the only countries in the Community where unemployment is not likely to get worse this year.  That is the company we are keeping&mdash;the Netherlands and Germany two of the very strong, highly developed countries in the EEC.  While I would not take that as a final proof that the policies adopted by this Government in the last four years to deal with the recession have shown to have borne fruit, I think it is an indication that what we have done has now proved to be correct, in spite of the continual harassment and bombardment not only from Deputies opposite who for legitimate political reasons will criticise the Government &mdash;indeed many people in a democracy will say that is their first duty&mdash;but from people outside this House who should know better.  However, these deliberately chose to misinterpret what the Government were doing, although knowing in their hearts and souls that the course being adopted by the Government was the only sane course if we were to try to minimise the effects on the economy of the recession and at the same time avoid the very real threat to the social fabric of this and other countries in Europe.</P>
    <P>This is something which is now beginning to be realised, that besides the effect of recession on the economies of countries there has also been an effect on their social fabric, through the high rate of unemployment all over the world and particularly in some of the strongest countries in Europe, and the extraordinary problem that is posed to democracies rather than other forms of Government by the fact that there are now large numbers of school leavers, young people who are highly educated, very intelligent, and who find their prospects of securing employment which they think should equate to the education they have received diminishing. These are things we cannot walk away from.  These are problems which <Col N="573" /> this Government must tackle internally but which we must also tackle and try to solve in the context of the EEC and in the broader context of democracies throughout the world.  Bad and all as democracy is the alternative is appalling and it is something that nobody with a vote or with the right to use that vote freely in any country in the world should wish or probably would wish to see taken from them.</P>
    <P>There are other instances in which democracy makes it difficult&mdash;the energy field is one of them, and I shall come to that in a moment&mdash;to obtain solutions which are desirable to ensure that those democracies continue to exist and that the citizens of those democracies continue to enjoy freedom and the right to work and live at the standard they now enjoy.  This is one of the points I want to make tonight and on which I would like Deputy Barrett to say where his party stand when he comes to reply to this debate, that is, their attitude towards nuclear energy. Are they for it or against it?  Deputy O'Leary, the Fianna Fáil spokesman on the environment, is here and he must have an attitude on this.  What side will they take when this argument comes, as it inevitably must come in this country, about nuclear energy?</P>
    <P>It may have been seen that to establish nuclear energy stations in Germany troops, uniformed police and guard dogs had to be moved on to sites to allow the construction to go ahead, so great was the opposition from local ecologists, environmentalists and, indeed, people who would not place themselves in that category but who ordinarily would be fearful of the danger of nuclear energy.  A Government was defeated in Sweden last year by an Opposition who made this a major issue, even though that Opposition who are now the Government are trying to climb off that bandwagon. They brought down a Government, who had been there for 40 years, on the basis of protection of the environment from nuclear energy.</P>
    <P>The reason I am saying that is that the forms of energy we now know, that is, oil, even our own turf and natural gas, are finite.  There are various estimates of how long they will <Col N="574" /> last.  My guess is probably as good as anybody else's; between 35 and 50 years, that is my guess.  What happens after that?  It does not matter whether it is dear or cheap energy, oil or gas or turf, there is the possibility of no energy, if the people in democracies who are now objecting to the establishment of nuclear energy stations get their way and these stations are not established.  I saw an estimate in <i>The Financial Times</i> this morning that even if a decision is taken at the R. and E. Council in Brussels today to allow the &ldquo;jet&rdquo;, as it is called, to be established in one of the three competing centres, it will probably be 70 years before nuclear fusion is commercially available in the world.  If they go ahead and establish it and if the experiments are successful and it is found that electricity can be generated from nuclear fusion, what happens in the meantime?  Does the world grind to a halt while at the same time the Eastern bloc countries, who have not got the problems that democracies have continue to build nuclear stations as they are doing now?  Who tackles that problem?  This is one of the most important questions tied to energy but in relation to democracy that faces the western world at the moment. There is no democracy, there is no European Community, no IDA, no OECD from the time of the removal of energy.  We are not talking about the scarcity or the price of it but the removal of it.</P>
    <P>Governments will have to be unpopular maybe or perhaps to fall and be willing to take the risk of paying that price knowing that what they are trying to do in their own country is providing a form of energy to fill this gap when the finite fossil fuels run out, and before fusion energy comes in. That will be the test of democracy. If we fail in that test&mdash;this applies to America as well as to Europe&mdash;then the great threat of domination by the east will not alone happen but it will not be a battle because they will have nothing to fight to take over.  Perhaps Deputy Barrett will be Minister for Transport and Power or perhaps it will be Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick.  This <Col N="575" /> Government have taken their stance on this, and I hope Deputy Barrett will say where his party stand.  It is in that context, not in the context of the short term and the movement about existing sources of energy that this matter must be viewed.</P>
    <P>We are talking about not much more than a generation ahead.  When Deputy Barrett's children and my children are our age, that is the shortness of time span in which the world has to solve its problems.  Anything done by Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party, the Democrats, the Republicans, the Liberal Party, the Conservatives, the Christian Democrats in Italy, means nothing if we do not face up to this real and very important problem.  What we do now is essentially short-term unless we find an alternative to these finite fuels, unless we face up to the fact that at the moment the only alternative to them seems to be nuclear energy and we will have to make way for that.  To face up to the fact that these fuels are finite we must have a conservation policy.  I would wish that was as crucial a part of other countries' energy policies as it is of this country's. It is distressing to see that the USA which started off in such a blaze of repentance for past sins and determination to do better for the future and to make themselves live within the resources of their internal availability of fuel oil, have slipped so far that they are now heavily dependent on imported energy for use in their own country.</P>
    <P>As far as this country is concerned, we are 80 per cent dependent&mdash;a frightening figure&mdash;on external sources for energy.  This will be improved significantly by the coming ashore of the natural gas off the south coast in the first month of next year, even though it is a small field.  Tonight for the umpteenth time the Opposition have criticised the Government's use of this gas for generating electricity and have said a grid should be established to pump this gas around the country.  The total amount of town gas, as it is called, used in this country represents only 10 per cent of the <Col N="576" /> size of the field off Kinsale, so even if this grid was to be built at enormous cost&mdash;and enormous cost it would be &mdash;we would still have to find use for 90 per cent of the gas, and that is discounting the fact that a portion of this gas, I reckon 10 or 15 per cent, perhaps more, is used in Cork where it is going to be given anyway.</P>
    <P>Many people spoke off the top of their heads and said that we should not use gas for electricity generation because they read in some book published somewhere at another time that is should not be so used.  They did not look at the options open to the Government.  One of the points made by one of the defenders of the Government was that a grid already exists in this country for transporting energy, and that is the ESB.  The Government had to consider, because it made a difference to the pricing structure for this gas, whether we would take the whole field on a steady period over a given number of years.  What we have decided, and at the negotiated price, is that starting officially in March, 1979, and for 20 years after that the Government would take this gas at this price over that period.  If we had not had a large user to take the gas up immediately from day one of it coming ashore of course we would have had to pay more, because these are delicately balanced financial calculations, and if we did not take it from day one, it would be left in the ground, it would cost the exploiter money, then when it would be taken out of the ground there would be that cost on top of the price of the gas and we would have to pay that.  Therefore it was essential to get the best value for the economy, that we should take that gas <i>in toto</i> as quickly as possible and over a given period.  That is the contract as it was drawn up between the Government and the exploiting company, Marathon.  We have allocated gas to the ESB for the generation of electricity, to NET for the manufacture of fertiliser and to Cork Gas Company for supply to their consumers. The Cork Gas Company have a choice, which they will be making probably in the next 12 months, as to whether they will convert the natural <Col N="577" /> gas into gas which can be fed through the appliances which exist or whether they will feed natural gas in and change the appliances.  That is an internal matter for themselves to decide.</P>

      <P>We decided that this was in the interests of the country.  A secondary and very important interest was to save the balance of payments. If I have only five minutes I would like to deal with the question of refineries. I have dealt with this so often that it should not be necessary to do so again but for the sake of the record I will do so.  A refinery is a refinery is a refinery. It is nothing more than a method of refining crude oil into the various products that are needed as petrol, radiation fuel, residual heavy fuel oils for the generation of electricity or light fuel oil for central heating. There is nothing magic about a refinery. It can be put up and put into commission in less time than it takes to bring oil ashore if we are lucky enough to find oil.  Self-sufficiency in refining is certainly a desirable end but it should have been achieved before the oil crisis.  There was no point in talking about building a refinery in 1974 when the curve of demand for the products of refineries all over Europe was dropping.  There is now 25 per cent over-capacity in the refineries of Europe.  In other words they are producing more product than they can sell.  If we were to build this famous refinery which Deputy Barrett says is so essential, the minimum economic size of refinery in 1977 is roughly twice the size of the existing Cork refinery. The Cork refinery supplies, as Deputy Barrett said, approximately half our needs.  If we were to build a refinery we would then have half of that refinery's products coming to this country, and what would we do with the other half?  Would we send it on to the over-crowded markets of Europe where there is over-sufficiency of refining capacity at the moment? Should we go into competition there, cut our prices for the benefit of the French, Germans, Dutch and English and put up the costs to our own people <Col N="578" /> here in the subsidies we would pass to the refineries?  ?  Is that the solution? Is that what we want to do?  Where would we build this refinery?  In Cork Harbour?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fine.  I will start in the morning to build a refinery at Shannon if Deputy Barrett would guarantee me that that is where the oil is and that is where it will come ashore.  But he does not know that and I do not know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>And until the oil is found we would be silly to commit ourselves to a refinery whose location we could not decide, If we build it at Shannon and the oil is found off the Kish or off Fastnet, how much better off will we be?  We can build any refinery to any size we like when we know the quantities of oil and their location and then we will be refining our own product.  Deputy Barrett says the Arabs would be quite willing to sell products to us.  Of course they would.  They are very decent men.  They will sell it to anybody who has money including the Irish, but they will not give us a special deal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>They will charge us the market price and we will do the same to them.  When we know the type, the quantity, the location of oil and where we can bring it ashore, that would be the time to build a refinery.  In the middle sixties when it was quite obvious that the Cork oil refinery would not be sufficient to meet future demands in this country, nothing was done.  When I came into office in March, 1973, there was nothing about an oil refinery.</P>

      <P>That is a different story.  That is part of the point I was making in relation to when it is essential that a refinery and nuclear power station should be built.  At what stage do the Government stand up <Col N="579" /> and say it must be done, we have to have it for the future and at what stage do they say we must bow before public opinion because they do not want it now even though it affects their children?  This country has an energy policy, I have listed its points and the Minister for Transport and Power when speaking tomorrow night will elaborate on the points I missed tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with this motion.  There appears to be a lack of an energy policy based on the maximum use of the country's natural resources making adequate provision for the protection of the environment. The lack of positive physical planning can give rise to many problems. Positive physical planning is closely linked with the protection of the environment for numerous reasons. When considering any planning application it is necessary to consider the protection of the environment.  The principal sources of energy are lead, zinc ore, turf, gas, oil and electricity. We must examine the relationship between the sources of energy and its impact on the environment.  What is the Government's policy in relation to ensuring that in no circumstances will our energy policy in the future adversely affect our natural environment?</P>
      <P>There are three types of pollution arising from the production of energy which are fairly well known.  There are thermal discharges into waters, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions.  These can be dangerous. Rising energy production will cause problems which could become serious if adequate attention is not given now to their nature and extent.  The increase in atmospheric pollution is already affecting most rural areas and the heating of water to a certain temperature is noticeably affecting ecological life.  There are problems in relation to land use as well.  These problems must be tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maintenance of a substantial level of energy use and transformation and the need to protect the environment must not, in the context of a <Col N="580" /> long term policy, be considered as opposing objectives.  Energy enables people to satisfy a certain number of social and economic needs but it is also a factor in providing the conditions and the quality of life.  A rational approach to energy is an essential element in an environment policy.  The need to conserve energy resources and the requirement of some environmental management go hand in hand. This policy should be developed and pursued.  Techniques for recycling waste matter for the recovery of materials have important implications for the environment particularly in the reduction of pollution.  They may also be important for the saving of energy and the conservation of resources. Decisions for energy protection and environmental protection should relate to the investments which have to be made.  These decisions should be made in the framework of medium and long-term forecasts of developments in both fields.  When new power plants and other installations are being considered attention should be paid to the design and the siting of these installations, to measures taking into account technical and economic possibilities, to ensure respect for the environment both as regards the quality of life and the protection of nature and conservation. Much groundwork should be done at an early stage in relation to collecting data and improving knowledge of the effects of thermal discharges to the environment. We should also consider in a broad sense the equipment of new power plants, such as dry cooling towers, so as to improve as rapidly as possible design and techniques in order to diminish the disadvantages they present where certain aspects of the environment are concerned.  We should utilise all appropriate waste heat produced by power plants.</P>
    <P>During the past 50 years or so world-wide energy production from commercial sources has increased at least 40-fold.  This rate of increase will continue so long as countries continue their efforts towards increased welfare which is measured in terms of GNP <i>per capita</i>.  It is reasonable to expect that the <i>per capita</i> energy consumption rate <Col N="581" /> will increase also.  Therefore, we must gear ourselves to meet the increasing demand for energy.  Having regard to all the factors that are likely to influence demand there is strong evidence that the growth rate of electricity production during the next ten years will increase on the same lines as it has increased during the past decade.  For these reasons particular attention must be given to the environmental problems associated with the production of electricity.  We should bear in mind that, generally, energy is not available in a single form but that rather complex systems made up of numerous components are required for its production. So far as most energy systems are concerned there are involved extraction, processing and, often conversion to a more useful form, transportation, transmission to ultimate use and, finally, the disposal of residue.</P>
    <P>The conversion to energy of fossil fuels leads to pollution of the air and of the water as well as to the degradation of land as a result of mining activities.  The impact on the environment becomes great when one thinks of the discharges from large power plants and refineries.  It is acknowledged that the combustion of fossil fuels is the most important source of air pollution.  These fuels result mainly in sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide which are regarded as being particularly detrimental to the environment and, consequently, hazardous to human health.  With this in mind, industrialised countries during the past number of years have been paying much attention to the pollutants, to their origins and to the possibility of their abatement.</P>
    <P>The general estimates of air pollution in so far as the main pollutants are concerned identify three principal sources with which we should concern ourselves.  First, there is fuel combustion in stationary sources such as boilers and incinerators.  Then, there are the other industrial installations such as processing equipment and, lastly, there is the pollution caused by traffic.  However, the major source of discharge into water bodies is from electricity-generating plants.  This factor should have a major bearing on the question of the location of these plants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="582" /> Because of silting and so on the extraction of coal is regarded as being another source of water pollution. Mining activities generally produce large quantities of solid waste but this is especially so in respect of coal, the mining of which can degrade an entire area.  The question of the transport of energy is one that must be given every attention in terms of air pollution. The most striking example of the danger of increased pollution is the amount of heat discharged from power plants that are growing in size and in number.  Apart from the problems of air and water pollution these plants may interfere with land usage. They raise the question, too, of aesthetics in terms of the overhead lines used for transmission purposes.</P>
    <P>The Government should be in a position to spell out a five-year physical plan in regard to the siting of those installations.  Similar problems exist in relation to refineries.  In the event of oil being located in any area, the location for the refinery should be designated.</P>
    <P>Any measure taken to conserve the use of energy or to achieve better utilisation of existing resources must be considered important.  We must continue to devise ways of making the best use, both industrially and domestically, of our energy resources, bearing in mind the fight against pollution.  In this regard, too, there should be greater emphasis on the collective aspect of transport as opposed to cars which have a detrimental effect on the environment.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the fight against pollution is the question of the organisation and distribution of power within the energy sector.  The question of whether energy production within stationary installations should be centralised as much as possible or spread out nearer to its place of final use, has been decided often on economic grounds but from now on such matters must be decided from an environmental aspect also.  These are matters which must be assessed carefully in the overall context of long-term planning with a view to achieving a balance between the environmental and the economic aspects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" /> How far ahead can we plan?  The Minister says we should be thinking in terms of 30 to 35 years ahead but so far as physical planning in general is concerned there is no overall positive physical planning.  Such planning is fundamental in terms of concentrating on any one sphere of energy.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of environmental protection it is acceptable to transport pollutant over long distances to less polluted areas and for this reason the dispersion technique of a pollutant making use of pipestacks alone must be regarded with caution unless there is sufficient evidence that the transport of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide is not nuisance in itself and that their transformation in the atmosphere does not give rise to the formation of other harmful compounds and that they are quickly eliminated from the atmosphere.  Even where pollution problems do arise the dispersion techniques could be accepted at least as a short term method of relief provided that the latter addition of a flue gas desulphurisation unit is required as soon as these installations are at hand.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that positive physical planning and the implementation of an energy policy should be closely linked and these should be closely linked with the protection of the environment.  We are fortunate in Ireland in that we are still in a position to learn from mistakes made in other countries and can identify ways and means of curing problems and purifying waters already polluted as well as ensuring by legislation that our enviornment is as clean as is consistant with many usages in many fields.</P>
    <P>It is well known that economic and technological progress while bringing much material wealth and benefit are very often accompanied by deterioration of the environment.  It should, therefore, be the aim of any policy for the protection of the environment to ensure that progress in industrial, agricultural, residential and all forms of development is not achieved at the cost of environmentl damage.  I believe <Col N="584" /> that with modern technical advances, with good and proper planning in regard to any development for the promotion of any energy policy there should not be inherent conflict, generally speaking, between the maintenance of a good environment and such development.  The proper time to deal with potential environmental hazards is in the preparation of the physical development plans which I think should have an overall controlling authority in the Government.</P>
    <P>We must remember that in Ireland protection of the environment is essential for numerous reasons.  It forms the basis of our tourism and many of the industries we hope to attract in future.  The one thing lacking here as regards protection of the environment is a single co-ordinating body.  There are 13 different agencies dealing with environmental matters, the Department of Local Government, local authorities, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Transport and Power, the Department of Health, the Department of Finance which has overall responsibility for the financial aspect of environmental problems, the Department of Lands, now under Agriculture, the Office of Public Works, An Foras Talúntais, An Foras Forbartha, the IDA and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  There are too many State and semi-State organisations with various and varying responsibilities for the protection of the environment. While this is so, it will be very difficult to have an acceptable policy.  A single national co-ordinating authority with overall responsibility is really necessary.</P>
    <P>The public generally in most areas are concerned about the protection of the environment particularly when there are proposals to set up oil refineries or any projects in pursuance of national energy policies to provide more energy.  Those particularly concerned, I believe, are those residing in towns and cities or in coastal areas who fully realise the benefits and advantages of living in these areas. Much modern development takes <Col N="585" /> place along our coastline and it is surely of interest to the House to realise that although we have 3,500 miles of coastline, including all estuaries, we have only 342 miles of sandy beach.  We see the real seriousness of the position when we realise that bathing areas are found in about 20 per cent of the total beach areas and that there are only about 80 miles suitable for bathing in our whole coastline.</P>

      <P>Programmes of harbour development for ports and landing places around the coast in the fisheries interest are drawn up and carried out in a systematic and orderly manner.  The programmes are based on the reports of survey teams comprising engineers of the county council concerned, the Office of Public Works and my Department and also representatives of Bord Fáilte and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</P>
      <P>The survey team for the County Dublin coastline carried out inspections of the County Dublin ports and landing places last July and furnished its report to me on 15th February, 1977.  As regards Balbriggan harbour the only improvement work recommended by the team was the dredging of the harbour and I am having this recommendation considered and costed.  This involves the drawing up of an engineering report by the Office of Public Works, and until I have that report and the estimate of cost I cannot say what the nature of the work will entail and consequently what the cost is likely to be.  As no proposals have been made to my Department in relation to the other works referred to by the Deputy the estimated costs of these works are not available in my Department.</P>

    <P> NOTES: 1.  The figures for receipts from beer, spirits, tobacco, petrol and oil (hydrocarbon, other sorts) are mainly comprised of receipts from excise duties but also include receipts from the remaining elements of the protective customs duties on those goods.</P>
    <P>2.  The reduction in receipts from &ldquo;other income tax on wages and salaries&rdquo; in 1976 and 1977 (row (<i>b</i>)) arose because the remuneration of public servants and other employees previously outside the PAYE system was brought within the system from 6 April 1976.

      <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the position is as follows: When the taxpayer commenced his present employment details of his previous pay and tax were not known, and the certificate given to him on 18th October, 1976, was on <Col N="486" /> a weekly basis.  The required figures of pay and tax were obtained on 30th November, 1976, by the inspector of taxes, who arranged for the issue of a full tax-free certificate.  Unfortunately because of a deficiency in the automatic processing arrangements there was a delay in the issue of the required certificate.  This matter has since been rectified by the issue of a manually prepared certificate.</P>
      <P>The operation of PAYE as between the Revenue and an employer is confidential, and so I cannot give any information regarding action against the former employer in this case.</P>

        <i>Cavan):</i> As the Deputy is aware, Fiddown bridge, which was constructed by the Waterford and Limerick Railway Company under the provisions of the Waterford and Limerick Railway (Deviations) Act, 1851, originally gave access to Fiddown railway station.  This station has, however, been closed <Col N="491" /> since 1964 and the bridge, which links Counties Waterford and Kilkenny across the river Suir, is now used exclusively for road traffic purposes.</P>
      <P>CIE are still responsible for maintenance of the bridge and I am advised by the board that it was found necessary on 11th March, 1977, to close the bridge to vehicular traffic, in the interests of safety, to enable repairs to be carried out.

      <P>I understand that CIE approached the Waterford and Kilkenny County Councils on a number of occasions with a view to having the Fiddown bridge transferred to these authorities but that neither county council would agree to the board's proposal.</P>

      <P>The cost can be estimated in various ways.  In line with the answers given to a number of previous parliamentary questions on the subject, the cost has been computed on this occasion by taking the total amount voted for prisons, including an estimate of the amount in Votes other than the Prisons Vote, less the amount voted for capital services and dividing the total by the estimated daily average number of prisoners for the year.  On that basis the answer is approximately £107 per week.</P>
