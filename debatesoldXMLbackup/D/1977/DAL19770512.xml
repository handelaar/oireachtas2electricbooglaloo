    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I was speaking about the plight of widows and white collar workers in our society over the past number of years.  Their plight was ignored by successive Governments. The most needy family in our society are, perhaps, the family who have lost the bread winner.  Next to the death of a parent, the most traumatic thing children can suffer is a change of address.  In many cases where the bread winner dies there is a change of address.  In our society we have the greatest number of children per family unit in Europe and the greatest number of children under the age of 16 years and, therefore, the greatest number of children at an impressionable age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should attempt to buffer these families against traumas in so far as we can.  The State would be negligent not to attempt to do the optimum to buffer families against such traumas. The only way the State can attack this problem is by preventing the family from having to move to another abode to save on expenditure and on household bills.  Very often the advice from the family circle is to move from the original house to a smaller house.  Cognisance is not taken of the trauma suffered by the children. We should help those families financially. <Col N="743" /> We can do this by increasing the financial benefits available to widows with children and we should concentrate more on the widow with children under the age of puberty.  We should try to ensure that they remain static in so far as abode, schools, friends, and so on, are concerned.</P>
    <P>Many of our school leavers at the moment are out of work.  Some of them can obtain jobs but do not wish to work in those that are available for them.  They have the impression that if they obtain their leaving certificate or group certificate they can then have a very well paid permanent job.  I do not believe this ever was or ever will be the case.  When students leave school or the university they cannot start off immediately as managing directors as many of them apparently wish to do.  I believe there are jobs available in the city but because of certain hand outs and comforts at home, which Deputy O'Kennedy last night described as being £14 per week, those jobs are not being taken by school leavers and those leaving the universities.  Everybody cannot have the job he or she wants.  Every dispensary doctor in the country would like a dispensary on the top of the Hill of Howth or Killiney Hill but he cannot have it.  Everybody cannot start off as a sales manager or managing director even though that person may wish to do so.</P>
    <P>I have discussed this matter with teenagers and those leaving our universities. I am quite surprised at the lack of initiative and the lack of imagination in their approach towards employment. I have heard it said that if one wishes to have a good employee nowadays one should go into the married sector.  Those people have an investment in society.  It is a poor reflection on the educational system which has evolved since allegedly free education was introduced that when our youth completed their secondary school education, they believed there would be plenty of jobs available for them.</P>
    <P>I am sure that there are some quite good jobs available.  A young girl with the leaving certificate without any typing or shorthand can obtain a very <Col N="744" /> good salary at 17 or 18 years of age in one of our banks.  We have seen that our two major banking groups have made a net profit of over £34 million despite being closed by strike for 10 weeks.  I have been told that sometimes banks can make more money when they are closed than when they are open.  The nonproductive aspect of banks is the number of people they have to interview. Much of it can be done by post. It is not surprising to see that their profits have gone up.  The budget has been a help in encouraging banks to invest.</P>
    <P>Banks do not meet the requirements of the public.  They have a five-day week while most businesses are open seven days a week.  The banks should have services available on a rota basis seven days a week.  Doctors, chemists, the Garda Síochána, the Army, hospitals and many other sections have to be available seven days a week while banks can have a five-day week and produce a profit amounting to millions. I am sure if privately employed people could do the same they would make a lot more money.</P>
    <P>Banks could help to fill the gap between paying out money and giving information to their clients.  The Minister should look at the legislation to see if it is possible to get the banks to look after the majority of routine income tax queries in an organised manner.  A privately employed person runs an account in one of the banks and at the end of the year has to take all the information to an accountant to present to the income tax people.  The four banking groups have income tax departments.  Why can the information, at the request of clients, not go straight to their income tax section and then go on to the revenue people?  This would do away with people having to spend valuable time on making their accounts presentable for the income tax inspectors.  Paper work has increased astronomically over the past 15 years for self-employed people, so that any effort by the banks to alleviate this will be greatly appreciated by this hard working sector of our society.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the armed forces.  There are so many <Col N="745" /> people leaving schools who have no jobs that I would like to see the Minister in this Bill introducing compulsory national service for our school leavers. This would give them a training that would stand them in good stead for life.  They could be drafted into the Army on leaving school and discharged on the completion of a minimum amount of time.  Not only would this benefit the country generally at this time but it would instil into those people a civic spirit and would help to dispel some of the disillusionment that has been caused by the world recession.  Regardless of the present difficulties, one realises that to have one's income increased from pocket money of 50p or £1 per week at 17 or 18 to benefit of £10 per week puts one in the student prince category.</P>
    <P>Necessity is the mother of invention. In the absence of opportunity, young people will use their inventiveness to meet the situation.  Although I was reluctant some years ago to support the concept of compulsory national service, I have swung completely the other way and, consequently, would urge the Minister to consider seriously introducing it.  It could be for a six-month, a 12-month or up to a 24-month period and it would help to get the young people away from the subculture of the unemployed.  They would be in a healthy environment, fulfilling a useful task and they would be appreciated by the public generally.</P>

      <P>I must remind the Deputy that the Finance Bill deals with that part of the budget which concerns taxation.  I am anxious that he relate his remarks more closely to the Bill.  He has been straying considerably from it.  I would point out that latitude is not allowed in this debate to the extent to which it is allowed during the budget debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for drawing my attention to this matter.  I was not aware of having strayed so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall refer now to a part of this legislation which concerns the taxation of older citizens but to which the traditional media have given very scant attention.  It is surprising that the concessions in respect of taxation that <Col N="746" /> are being given to those who have reached the age of 65 have not been highlighted.  The Minister has provided that such persons can be free of income tax on an income of up to a £1,000 per year and, where there is a spouse, the figure is £1,800.  This is a tremendous step forward and indicates the great respect this Government have for our senior citizens who, for many years, might have been regarded as having been given the cold shoulder.  It has never been the attitude of this Government to ignore them. More than 5,000 people in this category will benefit directly and immediately by this provision.  In addition, the concession will benefit 5,000 extra old-age pensioners so that immediately 10,000 pensioners, plus spouses where they are surviving, qualify for this benefit.</P>
    <P>In addition, Dublin County Council decided within the past few days to introduce a full rates scheme for those whose incomes are less than £2,000. In other words, those of the 10,000 who will qualify for the new income tax reliefs and who happen to live in the Dublin County area will qualify also for full rates remission.  I expect that the other local authorities will be adopting a similar approach.  In real terms these concessions, plus the fact that those people do not have to pay health costs, will mean an increase in the purchasing power of our older citizens of almost 35 per cent.  This is a tremendous boost to them.  It is something for which the Minister deserves much credit.  Unfortunately, it is a measure that has been ignored largely by the media.  Neither has it been referred to by previous speakers in this debate despite the fact that it must be one of the most generous measures of the budget.  However, I am sure that each and every one of the senior citizens not only in my constituency but throughout the country will join me in expressing my gratitude to the Minister on this display of concern and initiative.  Many of our elder citizens feel that their years of service to the State have been forgotten by our legislators.  That is not the case. One would hope that it would never be the case.  The Minister for Finance <Col N="747" /> has shown that in no circumstances will it be the case as far as he is concerned.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with a particular section of Irish life in which I have a very special interest, as have the majority, if not all, other Irishmen, that is the sporting sector.  Possibly this Finance Bill is not complete without containing provisions for the removal of value-added tax from sports equipment, from football boots, footballs, hurleys, football jerseys, volleyballs, boxing gloves, track suits, the general type of equipment necessary for the schoolboy or girl to enable them participate in sport.  The Minister might argue that this is a relatively impossible thing to do.  However, we are aware that there are grey areas in all forms of taxation.  We are aware also that years ago the United Kingdom Government said it would be impossible to remove value-added tax from food.  Yet we did it.  We showed it was possible.  It is also possible to remove value-added tax from sports equipment.  People might argue that the large yacht in Dún Laoghaire or Howth should not be relieved of its tax burden.  Let that be put and see how people feel about it.  If the large yacht is not removed from the value-added tax net, surely then replacements for the yacht, such as sails, ropes, life jackets and such like could be removed in order to stimulate sports and show our people that we are pro-sport, that we want to encourage them in open air, healthy activities.</P>
    <P>We have the situation in which our international sail training yacht, <i>Creidne,</i> has to pay tax to the Department of Finance for replacement sails. Yet we are very proud of that yacht, as we were of <i>Asgard</i> when it represented Ireland.  But <i>Asgard</i> on a race from Plymouth to Cherbourg might blow out six gibs.  Still they would have to pay value-added tax.  The value-added tax would come into the Department of Finance and the Department of Finance would give it back to Coiste an <i>Asgard</i> to run the boat.  In that way a false figure of accountancy and maintenance was built up, that it would seem much more expensive than, in fact, it was.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" /> There are many aspects of sport that could be examined by the Minister with a view to introducing a more equitable system of value-added tax for sport in this country.  For instance, perhaps he could remove value-added tax from sports equipment for school-goers, items such as footballs, football boots, knicks, jerseys, socks and so on.  I do not think the sporting fraternity would abuse that concession to the extent that they would allegedly buy equipment in sports shops for use in school and sell it to outside adult clubs.  Perhaps a little of that would go on between individuals but sports gear has always swopped hands and always will&mdash;second-hand football boots, skipping ropes, boxing knicks, punch bags and so on.  We in this country are placed in the position that as regards international sports participation and successful achievement in those areas we shall have to concentrate on low-price sports and forget about the expensive, heavy capitalised ones, such as gymnastics where there is a necessity for a large gymnasium and expensive equipment. Rather we shall have to concentrate on sports such as boxing, long-distance running and so on.</P>
    <P>We do not have the money necessary to keep expensive sports going.  One has only to look at the budget of a boat club to see how expensive it is to run a mate, eight oarsmen and a cox.  In order to encourage our youth in sports at which they can be internationally successful&mdash;and that is not the optimum approach to sport&mdash; we shall have to aim at low-cost sports, such as boxing, athletics, soccer and others with a view to the Olympics. We can see the tremendous success our athletes have had overseas.  Therefore, facilities should be made available to them here for their encouragement. I am asking the Minister to make a passive gesture of encouragement to our youth and, by all accounts, they will have a certain amount of extra time on their hands if what Fianna Fáil say is anyway related to the truth.  They will have the time to participate in sport.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to remove all VAT from sporting equipment. While he may not be able to do it <Col N="749" /> this year, I hope he will do it as soon as possible.  It is pertinent that we pay tribute to the voluntary organisers on the Irish sporting scene and I am sure that Deputy Fitzpatrick on the opposite benches agrees with me. Money cannot repay the organisers and the ancillary workers for all the work they do.  I should like to mention the people in St. John's Ambulance Brigade, the Knights of Malta and all who help at whatever level.  They deserve great credit.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to the report of the Central Bank which was published yesterday.  In a totally unprecedented way the Central Bank said that not only will the Government achieve the 4 per cent growth rate they plan for but they will probably exceed it.  The report was optimistic and it gave unprecedented support to the Government.  Certainly this was endorsement of the Government's policy and their approach to the problems that have beset our economy. On this occasion the Central Bank broke with tradition and precedent.</P>
    <P>The Minister's stoical approach to the economy in the last few years can be related somewhat to the rally car driver travelling on a dangerous stretch of road.  He has to go into second gear but at all times he must keep the car on the road.  We can relate the car to the economy and the driver to the Minister for Finance.  In the last few years he has done an excellent job; he has brought the economy safely through a traumatic period and he deserves credit for his tenacity.  The Central Bank have endorsed completely all his policies and people should be aware of this.  The Minister got complete support from the backbenchers of his own party in the last few years and I know that Deputy Toal will agree with me here.  The back bench Deputies stood shoulder to shoulder with the Minister through thick and thin&mdash; mostly it was thin times&mdash;despite irresponsible contributions from Fianna Fáil, although I do not include Deputy Fitzpatrick in that.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance yesterday informed the Dáil that there will be 3,000 jobs in the civil service for school <Col N="750" /> leavers.  I will be interested to see how quickly the jobs are taken up because I have the impression that our unemployment figures are inflated.  I do not think they represent the true picture. We do not know the number of people out of work or the number of vacancies that are not filled.  Many people are working and are also on the unemployment register; people in employment are drawing the dole.  Therefore, we should not take at face value the figures issued by the statistics office.  Members of this House have a certain discretion that is not available to civil servants who must produce figures.  The unemployment figures that we have been getting for the past few years are not related to the number of unemployed people; the actual number unemployed is less than that quoted.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy O'Kennedy referred to the Taoiseach's negligence in not having a census taken in the past few years.  They have been looking for information about County Donegal. The Taoiseach's reply was to the effect that the most accurate information would be that for the year in which the census was taken.</P>
    <P>I was very surprised at the indignant attitude of Deputy O'Kennedy when he harped so much on the absence of a statistical figure which is accurate for only 24 hours.  After that it changes and many factors influence it.  I suggest to the members of Fianna Fáil that the census is not going to cure the ills of this country.  It would be interesting to see whether long-term planning based on the census has ever achieved anything.  There are many variables.  We should not jump in at the deep end and say that if we have the census we can work from the census. That is not the be-all and end-all of planning.  A census can give rise to conviction on the part of slide-rule theorists that planning of a certain type based on a census which is just a statistic would have viability.  It will have viability in regard to the simple fact that the statistic is slightly more up to date, but where can it be of such pertinence in County Donegal where there are the traditional migratory workers, the traditional holiday influx of people from the other 25 counties <Col N="751" /> and the six counties of Northern Ireland, and where almost 60 per cent of the people are covered by medical cards?</P>
    <P>There are many sources from which figures which are very much more up to date and possibly more accurate than the census figures can be obtained. At the push of a button today it is possible to obtain an accurate breakdown of over 40 per cent of the population of the whole country.  In Donegal alone at the push of a computer button in the North-Western Health Board it is possible to obtain details of 60 per cent of the population, and if any statistician of any standard whatsoever cannot do a projection from an accurate 60 per cent breakdown he should not be a statistician at all.  He should not even be talking about statistics. Today at noon I can ask for a figure from the North-Western Health Board and have that figure available on the push of a button, because 60 per cent of the population there are covered by medical cards. The same applies to Kerry, Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim, Galway, and Kildare which, surprisingly, has 55 per cent of its population covered by medical cards.</P>
    <P>Consider that and consider the election register which comes out each year and which gives the number of people over the age of 18.  Combine those two simple sources of data and you have practically, to all intents and purposes, the full details you need in regard to the population.  As the Taoiseach said in his reply to Deputy Brennan, that census figure is accurate only for the day it is taken.  The day after there is a different figure and the day after that again it has changed again.  A year later, by the time the figure is published, it is not accurate at all.  All Fianna Fáil are doing when they refer to the census is asking this Government to delve deeper into the inaccuracy of statistics, statistics of bureaucracy and long-term planning combined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>These have not been shown to be successful in the past.  No long-term plan can be based on a statistic which is not a fact any longer when it becomes available and is not published for a year after it becomes inaccurate.  We should look elsewhere for our figures.  We should look for figures which enable us to titrate the movements of migration of the population if we are going to use that as a basis for long-term industrial planning.</P>
      <P>There are two kinds of people in our society whom we could do without. I am referring to the type of industrialist who comes in here and tries to get grants, who somehow or other gets them and then exploits the employees, closes the factory and is off out of the country at the end of his tax-free concession.  That is the first type, the swindler-exploiter.  I would like to pay particular regard to the members of the Industrial Development Authority for the tremendous job of screening they are doing.  One has to travel only short distances across to other countries to see that the degree of honesty and integrity that exists is not too high.  It is not the type of ethos that may be unique to our nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Finance Bill is producing money from the taxpayer to be given to the IDA to be given to the industrialists in the form of grants.  The second type of exploiter is the large exploiter.  We have come into contact with him in the past 10 years.  He is the multi-national, the big businessman who forces a deal on the smaller man, and though the smaller man may benefit financially, the greater part of the benefit goes to the bigger man. That is the fashionable way to exploit in this day and age.  The smaller man does not lose out on the deal but he does not improve himself or his circumstances to the extent that could be termed just, whereas the larger organisation, by virtue of its power and monopoly, can impose the conditions of the transaction, the condition of the deal, to the extent that they are the greater beneficiaries.  They benefit far more than the small man.  That type of exploitation which is prevalent throughout our society should be <Col N="753" /> looked at very closely by the Minister and his Department and associated Departments.</P>
    <P>In this legislation in a way we are aiding the mining companies.  Yesterday I referred briefly to the fact that wealth is not necessarily related to natural resources except in so far as a market exists for those natural resources. Very few countries have benefited from their natural resources.  In one area guano, bird manure, is sold for its phosphate content.  Saudi Arabia has its oil deposits.  The western world developed a capacity to produce wealth in the past 200 years mainly through an industrial revolution and efficient industrial production.  There is no point in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland sitting back and saying: &ldquo;We have silver deposits and gas deposits.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to tax reliefs.  I refer specifically to the profits the banks made.  This can be related to the provisions contained in budgetary measures, but I will not pursue that line if the Chair thinks it is out of order.  Having large deposits of natural resources in a country does not necessarily bring wealth unless there is a demand and a market for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála have been doing an excellent job.  We must produce our goods as economically as possible and find a market for them.  That is the simple formula for financial success in this modern world.  This is epitomised by the Japanese economy where we see no natural resources but productivity at its optimum and marketing. Japan has become the miracle country of the post-war era.  The marketing in the West German Republic is also excellent but the Japanese surpassed the West Germans. The oil in Saudi Arabia would be worth nothing if the western world had not got the capacity to purchase it.  As more deposits of oil are discovered around the world and competitiveness and supply increase, those <Col N="754" /> who attempted to monopolise the market and &ldquo;up&rdquo; the price to the detriment of the economies of other countries will suffer.  In Morocco they increased the price of phosphates which are so necessary for our fertiliser factories by 500 per cent at the stroke of a pen.</P>

      <P>These are factors which can influence the profits of a company and the profits of a company can be related to the Finance Bill in which taxation reliefs are mentioned.  We must attempt to buffer external cost factors, particularly oil.  We must produce our gas with the optimum efficiency and replace our oil consumption with gas as far as that is feasible.  We must encourage exploration for further deposits of gas and natural fuels.  At the same time as we are cutting down on our overseas expenditure of valuable foreign currency, we should attempt to produce goods for marketing abroad.  We must explore new markets throughout the world.  Let us not ignore the potential purchasing power of the Third World.  Two-thirds of the purchasing power of the world is contained in 15 per cent of the world population in the United States and western Europe.  One-third of the purchasing power is outside western Europe and the United States.  We should look further afield for our markets to Japan, China, Africa and India.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should pay particular attention to the countries where our missionary priests have spent years educating the people.  We should look at Nigeria, the Argentine and Brazil where we have not built up markets.  We should increase the grants given to private firms to go out to those countries and improve our marketing capacity.  It is only through marketing and increased efficiency in production that we can improve our wealth.  That is not an easy formula.  Work is most important in this connection. Unfortunately there appears to be <Col N="755" /> apathy in relation to work at the moment.  It appears to be an allergy which is shunned by many of our people.  They feel that work is only done by the well off people and that it is not really for those who should work.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister for this year's magnificent budget, the great tax reforms he introduced, the alleviation of taxation for white collar workers and the rates remission.  I am very pleased to support the Second Stage of this Bill which gives statutory effect to the budget provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): During the past month and also during the past few days I have listened to speeches from members of the Government telling us about the recovery of the economy.  I can see no basis for this.  My view is shared by the majority of the people.  I would attach far more sincerity to many of the speeches made by Ministers during the past few weeks if the Taoiseach and they had spelt out the disastrous state of the economy as they did before Christmas.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance told us then that we were in dire circumstances.  Does anybody believe that it is possible to draft a Finance Bill and change the picture in less than six months?  We know that turning the tide on a declining economy takes a long time, and it is not done by drafting a Finance Bill and putting certain proposals in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the same type of comments after the budget was introduced last January.  We were told what a magnificent budget it was.  About a month later we saw the true picture and the general reaction of the public.  We saw the angry response from the middle wage earner group regarding the tax concessions.  I do not believe the public will accept what we are now being told. I am convinced that this Finance Bill was drafted with a general election in view.  We should look back on the 1976 budget and see the massive tax increases which were introduced then. Those proved unnecessary.  The Minister completely over-budgeted the <Col N="756" /> financial requirements in 1976.  This had a detrimental effect on the economy in 1976.  If there was a realistic assessment of the financial requirements in the 1976 budget this would have played a considerable part in keeping our inflation rate down during that year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in 1976 budgeted for a deficit of £327 million which he said he required during that year.  He increased taxation which added 4 per cent to the cost of living. I do not believe there is any sincerity in this year's Finance Bill or that it contains any measures to boost the economy.  Deputy Byrne referred to the Central Bank report with regard to the projections and achievements in relation to our growth during 1977.  He did not say that their report spells out the disastrous state of our finances today.</P>
    <P>The speeches we have heard during the past month are leading up to a general election.  Anybody who looks at the reality of the situation realises that there is no substance in those claims.  If we look around us we can see escalating prices every day. Mothers and fathers see that their children have no hope of employment. The report of the annual general meeting of Roadstone Limited gives a fair indication of whether or not our economy has expanded.  The Government are trying to pin their hopes on a slight up-swing, which is only 50 per cent of what is required if we are to make any impact on the disastrous state of the economy.  It is misleading and could be damaging in the long run to say that we are out of our troubles. We are far from an up-swing.  I believe, when we have to face further increases in the price of goods later in the year, that any advantage we have gained will be eroded.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced taxation concessions in the budget and he also mentioned them in his speech on this Stage of the Finance Bill.  Those do not apply to the public at large.  I am not decrying the concessions which are given to certain categories.  If we ask somebody in the middle income group what is contained in the tax concessions for him he will tell you in no uncertain fashion after seeing the <Col N="757" /> national wage agreement negotiated and taken in conjunction with the reduction in respect of the middle income group, that this represents a substantial decrease in his standard of living.  Therefore, it is totally misleading to endeavour to create the impression that we have overcome these difficulties.  I suppose the Government cannot be blamed for endeavouring shortly before an election to use every means possible to project this false image.  It is part of politics but I would fault the Government for taking this line to the extreme so that it could be damaging generally to the whole economy.  There is no point in trying to deceive people by bestowing on them short-term benefits.  Nobody is blind to the reality of the situation. The situation would be different if the benefits that have been given were given on the basis of long-term planning and if there was a step-by-step plan as to how they could be maintained and expanded.</P>
    <P>We need only recall the speeches of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance before Christmas last in which they told us of the dire straits of our economy and impressed upon us the need for much stringency.  These warnings were issued only a short time before the budget but in January the Minister found that he had a deficit of £126 million less than he budgeted for in 1976.  Of course, he knew when he was making those pre-Christmas speeches that this surplus would be available.  However, I put little value on the concept of current budgets. Despite this deficit of £126 million less than was budgeted for in the previous 12 months, there was a current deficit of £200 million.</P>
    <P>I wonder how many people realise that the benefits that have been bestowed on them during the past four years will have to be paid for dearly in the future.  It is frightening to read the report of the Central Bank and to realise exactly the state of the country's finances.  When we compare the national debt and our GNP with that of any other country in Europe we know whether we are in a position to expand.  All the economic plans or national development corporations in <Col N="758" /> the world are of no use if the money is not available to implement them. We have incurred debts of the order of £4 billion.  Since this Government have come to office the increase in the national debt has been of the order of 70 per cent.  On current accounts alone the deficit has been £800 million. There is no evidence of how this money is to be paid.</P>
    <P>We now find that of the total taxes going into the Exchequer £1 in every £5 must go to servicing that debt according to the report of the Central Bank.  There is no indication at all that this will cease or that the Minister will not come in here next January&mdash; God forbid that he should be there&mdash; with another current deficit, building up the national debt still further.  Our people should be told honestly that our finances are in the most disastrous state since the foundation of the State. The Central Bank pointed to that fact several times in their report.</P>
    <P>There are two factors which inhibit expansion of business; firstly, if one cannot get the money with which to expand and, secondly, if one goes too far without the capacity to repay.  That is common logic.  That is the situation in which we now find ourselves, that we have borrowed without our capacity to repay.  We should have been concentrating on generating wealth in the last four years within our economy without having to go to foreign sources to borrow.  As time develops I can see that pressure will build up with regard to the sources of finance for the creation of new jobs.  I do not believe that the great policies expounded by Deputy Halligan and others like him regarding national development corporations can in any way remedy our present economic situation.  Were such structures developed today, I would assume they would be financed by Government money but I do not see for a moment where the Government could possibly get such finance because they are at the very limit of their borrowing capacity.</P>
    <P>Even were the Government to come out and say before the general election that they have agreed on the establishment of such a national development <Col N="759" /> corporation, what would it mean?  I do not believe they would be channelling any private funds into it. There is room in our economy for both the private and public sectors&mdash; one can be complementary to the other &mdash;but we must not come down in favour of one sector saying that they will solve all our problems.  When one speaks of a national development corporation, one needs to be thinking in the region of £500 million or £1,000 million if such were to make any impact at all on the creation of new industries.  How would such resources be found bearing in mind the present national debt?  If anything, the trend will be reversed within the next few years because many of these short term loans will mature in that period.  I read somewhere recently that something in the region of £400 million will be maturing in the very near future.  Apart from servicing the national debt&mdash;which this year will probably cost £440 million&mdash;the country will be called upon to repay some of those short term loans which will place added strain on our finances and in turn will inhibit any hope of the Government in their own right generating the adequate employment some Members of this House seem to think possible.  If they fail in that respect, they will have to depend more than ever in the future on the private sector for the encouragement of industrial development.</P>
    <P>If we are to achieve the requisite expansion in manufacturing, we will have to have a considerable inflow of foreign capital.  We must be realistic about that.  When one examines our whole financial structure one realises that there is no way that can be avoided.  I am sure nobody in this House would contradict me when I say that we have not the financial resources available to us to create adequate employment at present.  Up to the mid-1980s we must generate practically 30,000 new jobs annually to meet our target.  During the past four or five years there has been no increase at all in employment in the industrial sector. It would be much better to tell our <Col N="760" /> people the true situation and the challenges they will have to meet in the late 1970s and 1980s if we are to solve the problem.</P>
    <P>When one reads reports of the Central Bank one must ask oneself where the money will be found for the creation of the number of jobs required. Deputy Byrne thought the figures were misleading.  I believe the figures given today are accurate and realistic&mdash; indeed, that they will deteriorate further. We are all aware of the concern of parents today with children sitting the leaving certificate.  I meet them in my constituency every day of the week. They come to me.  They are concerned as are we all.  There is nothing more demoralising for a young boy or girl of 18 to 20 years than to have to walk around our streets aimlessly.  Such must have a detrimental effect on their future if they are unfortunate enough to find themselves in that position for a number of years after leaving school.</P>
    <P>I do not believe for one moment that this Finance Bill can deal with this crisis.  The neglect set in over the past four or five years when we allowed this to happen.  When we left office anybody could have made such predictions.  We had negotiated our entry into the EEC where there was a potential market of 300 million people.  Practical plans should have been developed then for the expansion of our manufacturing and industrial bases.  We knew we would be meeting competition.  Everybody was aware that certain redundancies would take place.  Positive steps should have been taken then to counteract that and in an endeavour to generate as many new jobs as would be necessary.  We omitted to do so then with the consequences of the past four years&mdash;allowing inflation to go unchecked&mdash;which is a price many of our people will be paying for the next ten years.  That damage will be shown up in the whole of our economic structure in regard to our unit costs, the encouragement of foreign manufacturers here.  In fact, the whole picture of our industrial development was tarnished during that time and will not be redressed within a short period.</P>
    <P>At that juncture also we had a <Col N="761" /> Government that came into office with a lot of short-term policies and ideologies.  Going back six or seven years I remember when we had policies put forward perhaps every 12 months by people such as the present Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Those people came into Government with certain short term policies and ideologies but when they attained office they realised the facts of life.  It must be remembered that it is very easy to write such high-falutin ideologies and say: When we get into Government these will be the policies we will pursue.</P>
    <P>They did pursue some of them with disastrous consequences.  I refer to the capital taxation package.  That was one of their ideologies.  I do not believe that has made any contribution whatsoever to our economic recovery or, indeed, to the distribution of wealth.  One does not distribute wealth merely by taking it from one man and channelling it into the Exchequer. If one wants to distribute wealth, distribute shares or the profitability within a company and give equity to its workers.  Certainly channelling it into the Exchequer to service national debts does not equate to the fair distribution of wealth at all.  There are better ways than that of equating incomes of various people and of achieving some fair distribution of the country's wealth.  When we get back in power we will devise schemes for the fair distribution of wealth at the same time making a major contribution to our economic expansion.</P>
    <P>I should like to see employees of any company being given the opportunity of taking shares in that company. Such could be brought about by some reduction in taxation for an employer and for employees who would be prepared, instead of seeking rises, to be given an opportunity of investing in that company.  This is how the wealth of the country will be distributed.  The poor will never be made richer by making the rich poorer.  That concept has never worked and it never will. Profit sharing and distribution of assets will come eventually and when an employee knows that the company is his own and that he will get a share from it at the end of the year <Col N="762" /> he will give of his best.  People who hold shares in a company, even though they are not the employer, are happy to support their company's product.</P>
    <P>We must try to give people security. In the past it was held that nothing mattered but wages and more wages. Nothing is further from the truth. The average person today has other priorities and security is the first one. When an employee has an interest in his place of work and in the job he is doing he will be the best protector of the industry that employs him.  This does not apply to the same extent in the public sector but I am talking about the private sector.</P>
    <P>Many businessmen are coming around to this concept because they believe that it will bring the maximum return from their employees.  Employees should be informed of future policy and the development of the company because these things affect them. We may say that the employer has his capital in the business but capital is no good without labour.  The one complements the other.  I hope that this type of communication between employer and employee will develop more and more.  Over the years the old fight was going on for the cost of living and the standard of living and these are two different things altogether. If we adopt the policy I am suggesting and the Government set up the framework to encourage this, we will be going in the right direction.  As time goes on enlightened companies will take steps to adopt this policy if the proper structures are made available and if they do they will reap benefits.</P>
    <P>The Government can play their part through, for instance, the national wage agreement.  Thousands of people will be only too delighted to know that they have an investment in their place of employment.  Drawing a salary alone is not enough with inflation as it has been for the past four years.  Four years ago £1,000 or £2,000 would have paid for a deposit on a house.  That amount of money today is worth only 50 per cent of its former value.  Many young people have suffered frustration due to that situation.  They may have wage increases of 20 per cent to 25 per cent, but any savings they may <Col N="763" /> have had in the past four years have been reduced in value.  There is no hedge against inflation for these people. For the man who was fortunate enough to have property investments in agriculture or other things the trend was in the opposite direction.  He made money by inflation.  We all know what happens where extreme inflation is concerned. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.</P>
    <P>What is the situation regarding pensioners on fixed incomes?  The person who about four years ago left the public service with two or three years' gratuity and put it into national saving at a return of 7 or 8 per cent today finds that his assets are 50 per cent less in value than they were four years ago.  That is not fair.  It is legalised robbery by the State.  There is no effort made to index those savings.  If the inflationary tendency continues, we may find ourselves in the position of one of the South American countries where all the people drew out their savings because inflation ran at 50 per cent or 60 per cent.  They wrecked the whole economy and one cannot blame them.  At least if people spend money as they get it they get something for it.  Imagine the economic chaos if people here drew out all their savings.</P>
    <P>I have met young couples who have found that after the last three or four years of sparing on both sides they were back to square one where their deposit was concerned.  The price of houses has escalated and the deposits raised 50 per cent or 60 per cent and they could not keep up savings to meet that.  Such people have nothing to thank the present administration for.  This Government will be remembered for their failure to tackle inflation.  We hear about industrialists, farmers, and people who are doing well but we do not hear very much about the many people who are not doing well.  This negative way of saving which we have whereby people must put their money in the Post Office or into building societies and leave it there with no growth will have to be changed.  There must be come national investment trust where people <Col N="764" /> can invest and see their investments grow so that at then end of four or five years they can be assured that not alone will they draw out the amount which they put in but they would be given sufficient to cover for inflation plus interest.</P>
    <P>We should have national investment trusts covering various companies so that people could buy on the stock exchange.  Very few people know anything about investing on the stock exchange.  I do not see any reason why a man who saves £500 a year cannot put this into an industry or business. In this country we seem to channel our money into building societies or into the post office.  The money invested in the post office is taken up by the Government to service the national debt and for unproductive purposes.  It is my conviction that money invested could be used more usefully.</P>
    <P>In the budget the Minister made certain proposals regarding the reduction of corporation tax and these are to be welcomed.  We should support any measure that encourages employers to take on additional staff.  I welcome the 25 per cent reduction in corporation profits tax for expansion of business. The question is, will it work?</P>
    <P>The rate of 5 per cent for expansion of business and the 3 per cent increase in employment may not be of much benefit to many companies, especially those dealing with the export market. It will apply only to companies selling on the home market.  It will not be of great significance to a company who have suffered a loss in the last three or four years because they can bring that forward for income tax relief.</P>
    <P>The employment scheme will not benefit companies who have staff on a part-time basis because the Bill states that only new employment will be considered. These factors can outweigh the benefit of the reduction in corporation profits tax and the employment bonus. I am not sure that subsidising labour will work in the long term; it is a short, interim step.  Manufacturers will only take on staff if they require them and if their business is expanding.  The fact that they will get a £20 or a £10 subsidy will not prove a great attraction <Col N="765" /> unless they need staff.  This is especially so with regard to school leavers because the cost of the insurance stamp must be deducted.  Another question arises with regard to the length of time the employer will have to keep on the staff.  I was talking to an employer recently about the reliefs proposed by the Minister and he told me they would have to be considered in conjunction with the Unfair Dismissals Bill.</P>
    <P>I doubt if the incentives now proposed will be of any great value although I hope they will prove successful.  Something more positive is needed.  We know that there are 130,000 people unemployed.  Nobody has a realistic figure with regard to the number of school leavers and young girls who are unemployed.  Thousands of young girls who left school last year have still not got employment.</P>
    <P>The Confederation of Irish Industry are not so optimistic as the Central Bank about our industrial expansion. I think they have been more practical in their assessment of the situation. The great euphoria about this expansion is not shared by them.  There may have been one or two speakers who were optimistic in their approach at the IMI Conference in Killarney&mdash; the Taoiseach was present and probably they did not wish to be unkind&mdash; but most of them were limited in their expressions of confidence.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach attended a luncheon given by the Confederation of Irish Industry but I do not think he convinced members that we were coming to the end of the crisis.  I wonder if it was necessary for him to take six of the senior Ministers to that luncheon?  Did he think that would change the attitude of the members of the Confederation?  I want to tell him the answer is no.  Six Ministers were at that luncheon yesterday but in other years it was left to the Minister for Finance.  Such nonsense.</P>

      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): It relates to the Government. I do not think business people are <Col N="766" /> impressed by such actions.  They would be much more impressed if they were told honestly about the realities of the situation which I have outlined in my speech.  They know what is happening. The Taoiseach spoke about an upswing of 4 per cent but he did not talk about the realities of the situation.  The members of the confederation know about the charges that will fall on the economy in the next five or six years.  That will not work with the group the Taoiseach was addressing yesterday in Jury's Hotel.  They can assess the economic situation as well as any economic advisers to the Taoiseach.  They are running businesses and they know where the losses and the profits are.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Labour was at the dinner of the Confederation of Irish Industries yesterday too.  He met many of them afterwards and he was mixing with a group of people who are fully conscious of what is going on.  This type of thing in a paper insults their integrity and their intelligence.  They are aware of this section of the Finance Bill.  We are not talking about 1,000 people. That group knew what was contained in the budget and what would be in the Finance Bill.  The Minister insulted their intelligence by having printed in a paper &ldquo;I will pay you £20 a week&rdquo;. My reaction to that would be that I would close down my factory before I would approach anyone personally. This is taxpayers' money.  It was the height of audacity for the Minister for Labour to personalise himself in that way to a small group of people who are fully aware of their entitlements. That type of thing brings Irish politics into disrepute.  It is a scandal.  What would any businessman think when he looked at that &ldquo;I will pay you £20 a week&rdquo;?  I know why it was published. I know what the Minister's rating is in his constituency from a political point of view.  This was not directed at businessmen.  It was directed intentionally at the electorate in Dublin North Central.</P>

      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): Taxation deals with central funds.  Our funds are scarce enough today.  We know how bills have escalated in the public service, and we do not want them to escalate further by that type of misuse.  If the Minister says this advertisement was used to inform manufacturers, that will be an insult to their intelligence.  That type of publicity will not enhance the image of the Minister for Labour, and it does discredit to the whole Government.  I was speaking to some of the people who were at the dinner given by the confederation and I could not repeat in the House what they thought about the advertisement.</P>
      <P>We hear talk about an upswing in the economy.  Did anybody read an article by Paul Tansey a few days ago commenting on the state of the building industry?  He expressed a view based on facts and not on misleading statistics which cannot be backed up.  He gave an entirely different picture of the construction industry, what its performance was like over the past 12 months or two years and what the hopes are for future expansion.  I quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of Monday, 9th May, 1977.  He said:</P>
      <P>. . . output in the construction sector has not yet recovered to its previous plateau.  Taking 100 as the index of cement output in 1973, the index declined to 97 in 1974, deteriorated further to 95 in 1975, and while it recovered to 97 again last year, figures for the first quarter of 1977 indicate further slippage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first three months of 1977, cement sales showed a volume decline of 8.5% below the corresponding figure for the first quarter of 1976.  While the bulk of the decline was concentrated in the first two months of the year, <Col N="768" /> indicating that poor weather conditions may have played some part, this further deterioration is disappointing to say the least.</P>
    <P>Similarly, unemployment in the industry continues at a very high level, with a reputed 25,000 building workers unemployed.  Figures published by the Central Statistics Office last week show that the number of building workers in the private sector unemployed during February was 13% above the average unemployment level in 1975.</P>
    <P>These figures seem certain to increase, as firms in the sector continue to lay-off workers.  On Friday, Roadstone, part of the Cement Roadstone group, announced that it was going to make 250 workers, general and administrative, redundant over the next month, while redundancies were also announced by other firms the same day.</P>
    <P>Roadstone attributed the redundancies to the continuing depressed state of demand for building materials, and the fact that it could foresee no improvement in the level of building activity in the future. Roadstone said that the depressed level of demand was evident both in the public and private sectors, though the company said that it had been particularly hard hit &ldquo;by the severe cutback in road expenditure in the past two years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There had been indications that the company was experiencing difficult trading conditions.  At the CRH annual meeting, it was stated that Roadstone's performance during the first quarter had fallen below target. Still, it surely indicates a very depressed level of demand when a company of Roadstone's size and prestige cuts its workforce of 2,660 by almost 10%.</P>

      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): That has no bearing on it. The building and construction industry is an indicator of prosperity.  Anybody who has followed economic development knows perfectly well that the first indicator of whether the economy is expanding is the building industry. If you want to get the economy moving quickly you concentrate all your efforts on that industry.  In America if they want to get their economy moving quickly they concentrate their efforts on the motor industry.</P>
      <P>It is quite obvious to everybody that during the coming 12 months the construction industry will be in a very depressed state.  No hope can be held out to the 25,000 people who are unemployed in the building trade when we see the report of Roadstone.  If they could see an upturn in the economy they would not have let those people go.  This firm are very efficient in getting the projections right.  They have given a realistic assessment of their situation.  Anybody who thinks he can come in here and make a speech or make speeches around the country saying that our economy is right against that background is only misleading the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the duty of the Government to draw up plans to provide employment. They have no economic policy.  We asked them about it four years ago. We asked them to provide in successive budgets some of the things contained in this year's Finance Bill. Thanks be to God this is the last budget we will have from the Coalition Government.  No greater disaster would befall the country than another four years of Coalition Government, fighting among themselves with regard <Col N="770" /> to their ideologies and what type of economic plan they should draw up.</P>

      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): It is not coming from Fianna Fáil.  It is coming from the business people and those who are out of work.  The Government have no policy to deal with inflation.  They have no economic policy on how we could expand and develop our economy.  We have been allowed to drift along helplessly with inflation eroding our assets.  That is the reason why our unemployment figure is so high today.  If the Parliamentary Secretary has been reading the papers during the past four years he knows this is what the country has been brought to.  It is quite obvious to me that the measures contained in the Finance Bill will not be repeated if this Government get back into power. We will not see a repetition of this policy.  The greatest tragedy that could happen to us is a stop-go method, drawing up one policy and reversing it after a few months.</P>
      <P>The economy has to be planned.  A quick change of direction is no good for us.  There is no guarantee that some of the measures contained in this Bill will be sustained if the Coalition Government are returned to power.  We have heard a lot of talk about a State development corporation, which is expected to solve all our problems.  I have no doubt that we will get the Bill outlining the proposals some time.  The Taoiseach at the IMA conference was not optimistic about the great expansion of State enterprises.  We know how experienced he is when we are near an election.  The people will not be taken in by what they are told by the Government.  They have followed their performance very closely.  The Government are greatly mistaken if they think that the propaganda which has emanated from the various Government Departments will get the public to change their attitude about how incompetent the Government are.</P>

People will have to decide the party they want to govern the country.  In the coming general election they will be asked to make one of the most vital decisions they have ever been called on to make. The people are now in a position to look at performances and draw comparisons. They were not able to do this before the last election.

      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): Some of the financial measures contained in other budgets have brought about our present economic ills.  The oil crisis is blamed for our present economic situation but we know that the Arabs' increase only cost 12p over the past five years while the Government increased the price of oil by 35p.  We have had increases of over 137 per cent in telecommunication charges.  Bus fares have increased by 25 per cent.  The postage stamp rate, which was 4p in 1973, is now 10p.  Those are only some of the factors which have contributed to our high inflation rate.  We have the worst telephone system in the European Community.

      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): I am quite convinced that the most important thing now is to get inflation down, to put people back to work and to draw up new structures for improving the whole area of employment in order to give greater encouragement to workers within their jobs.  These are the aspects of our economy to which we will be drawing attention.  There has never been a time in our history when we needed Fianna Fáil more than they are needed now.  If we are to curb the spiralling rate of inflation and to restore order to the present economic chaos, Fianna Fáil must be returned to power.  Only they can give the type of united one-party Government that is necessary to put matters right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An urgent priority must be the replacement of this Government who have proved themselves to be so incompetent and so divided on economic policy.  We must acknowledge that economics rule our lives and dictate in no small way the advances that we can hope for.  A supreme effort is needed to bring Ireland to her rightful place.  Fianna Fáil are <Col N="773" /> capable of producing that sort of effort and can show that our problems can be overcome.  The first task in this direction is a rekindling of belief in our future as a nation.  In this task Fianna Fáil can succeed because they reflect the views of the people.  Without Fianna Fáil the future would be dark.  With this party in office the people can look forward to unequivocal thinking in both long-term and short-term policies.</P>
    <P>Initial rapid growth in industry and in the allied services must be the aim if we are to bring about a reduction in unemployment and restore the confidence of the people.  This must be followed by steady growth and expansion both in private and in State enterprises, working side by side in a manner that complement each other. The achievement of this satisfactory growth will call for large-scale investment and for an environment that will give every encouragement for reinvestment. On return to power Fianna Fáil will assume responsibility for these policies.  Pious platitudes and various promises are useless if they are not fulfilled but this is something that we have become used to from the present Administration.  Despite all the emphasis they placed on their 14-point plan they have failed to implement the promises contained in that plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Toal</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming this Bill I congratulate the Minister on this, his fifth year in office and his sixth Finance Bill&mdash;an achievement in itself.  I regard the Bill not only as a measure to implement the various budget proposals but as concrete evidence of the prudent and capable manner in which the Minister has handled his portfolio during the past four years.  This Government have brought the people through one of the worst recessions since the thirties.</P>
      <P>I have not been here for all the debate so far but I was present during Deputy Colley's contribution.  He expressed agreement with the measure but criticised it for not going far enough.  Criticism of that kind must be music to the Minister's ears.  The Bill indicates the tremendous achievements of the past four difficult years. The Minister must have been very proud to bring this measure before the House.  During the time that the recession was hitting us hardest he was, perhaps, the most maligned man in Ireland but he stuck to his guns and brought us through those difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="775" /> Having said that the measure did not go far enough Deputy Colley went on to talk about coalition government and to pontificate on the philosophies of Fine Gael <i>vis-à-vis</i> Labour.  He posed the question as to how a coalition government could work.  The answer to that question is obvious.  The everyday answer is there for everyone to see, coalition government has worked for the past four years.  It continues to work and sooner or later our people will be given an opportunity of passing judgment on it.  Indeed by the tone of Deputy Colley's contribution one would think we were already in the middle of an election.</P>
    <P>The main plank in Deputy Colley's speech was the issue of prices.  He talked about rising prices <i>ad nauseam</i> and, in so doing, he passed very lightly over the oil crisis.  He skimmed past the fact that sterling was in trouble and that high interest rates were prevailing in London.  He also skimmed lightly over the fact that we became full members of the EEC in 1973 and that, as a result of free trade, the goods we produce and the price we must pay for imported goods are more competitive.  He went lightly over all of those things, but he laid all of the blame for rising prices at the door of the Minister for Finance.  Prices have risen; I do not have to say that, nor do the Opposition have to tell us. I would remind the Opposition that in the very first Finance Bill the Minister introduced he brought in a provision removing VAT from food.  Food prices are high but they would be at least 7 per cent higher still had that provision not been implemented. At the time the Opposition said that value-added tax could not possibly be removed from food.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley continued to speak about the national debt.  He spoke at length about this.  I am not an expert on matters of high finance but I recognise illogical conclusions when I meet them.  In one breath Deputy Colley said we were borrowing too much and, in another, that we could have borrowed more in 1976.  The national debt had to be incurred because that was the <Col N="776" /> way the Minister for Finance brought our people through the worst economic recession since the thirties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley spoke at length also about unemployment.  The Opposition are not sincere when they pontificate about this.  We all know that there were at last 70,000 people unemployed in the early part of the seventies.  We know also that there were 60,000 to 70,000 unemployed in the so-called boom sixties.  We know also that, in all of that period, unemployment was taken care of by emigration, from the late fifties to the early seventies something like 300,000 people left our shores.  England, America or any other industrialised country is not in the same state as it was ten years ago and does not have the capacity to absorb emigration from our country. As a result of all of this, emigration is down to a trickle.  Indeed, I note that for the past six years the figure for immigration here was something like 12,000.  This is forcibly brought home to me coming from a Border constituency; not only are our people coming home from England and America, buying farms, setting up in business and seeking employment but there are many people from Northern Ireland coming South.  I see this every day.  This influx of people makes heavier demands on the Exchequer and accentuates our unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>The provisions made in this Bill, the generous reduction in corporation profits tax, the incentives for manufacturing industry and the allowances for personal income tax, all go to stimulate growth; with a 4 per cent forecast for this year, the high unemployment figure will at least come down below the 100,000 mark.  It was notable that, of all of the EEC countries, Ireland, Germany and Holland were the only three where unemployment was not expected to rise further this year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley finished up by coming down to speak of such things as children's allowances and free school transport.  He accused the Minister for Finance of having the intention to abolish them.  That argument was settled long ago.  The Minister for <Col N="777" /> Finance had no intention in the wide world of abolishing children's allowances or of doing away with free school transport.  The Opposition are insincere in making such allegations. If you like, it was another indication of the proximity of a general election, that the Opposition spokesman on Finance should use such a paltry argument.  Every member of the Opposition knows that to be inaccurate.  Regardless of how many times they say it, these allowances and free school transport will remain.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to see corporate taxation being reduced by 10 per cent, which will give an added boost to industry, in particular manufacturing industry.  It is a sorry state of affairs when all the Opposition can say about our generous incentives to industry is that the Minister for Labour abused his powers by inserting an advertisement in the Press promoting the employment incentive scheme.  I do not think he abused his powers in any way whatsoever.  It was a way of getting a message across, as Minister for Labour, and it was his prerogative to do that.  It is cry-baby talk on the part of the Opposition to pick on such a small thing and take up so much of the debate on the Finance Bill over such an advertisement.</P>
    <P>I am pleased also in regard to section 7 which gives generous allowances to pensioners.  A man over 65 can get an old age pension with other sources of income and will now get further relief.  In addition to the generous manner in which the budget has treated them, it is further proof of the Government's looking after the old in the community.</P>
    <P>I would like to strike one jarring note in relation to taxes on certain products and in particular taxes as they relate to manufacturing industry in the Border region.  I am talking about the furniture manufacturing industry and the concrete industry. Those two industries have been very badly hit in the Border areas because the rate of taxation is much less for these products in Northern Ireland than it is in the Republic.  The manufacturers of concrete products along the <Col N="778" /> Border are in very serious trouble.  I have brought this before the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance.  The Revenue Commissioners also have a great deal to do with this.  They seem to bend over backwards to facilitate Northern suppliers coming into the Republic but the Southern suppliers who go north do not have the same facilities and they are working at a great disadvantage.  I appeal to the Minister to get under way as soon as possible an inquiry and to ask the Revenue Commissioners to help out in this very important sphere of employment.</P>
    <P>I listened at length to Deputy Fitzpatrick's speech.  He tossed over the old phrases, &ldquo;reduction in the standard of living&rdquo;, &ldquo;the problem of school leavers&rdquo; and the bad state of the telephone services.  He wandered over everything.  Nobody has to tell us about the problems facing school leavers in the coming year.  I was a school leaver myself.  I did my leaving certificate in the early sixties and I had to emigrate.  Fortunately, emigration was there at the time.  It opened up a healthy prospect.  Nowadays emigration is down to a trickle, and all of a sudden the Opposition are crying crocodile tears for school leavers.  They forget that emigration took care of the majority of school leavers when they were in office.</P>
    <P>I thought Deputy Fitzpatrick was not sincere when he talked at length about a reduction in the standard of living.  If this Government have done anything well they have upgraded the standard of living, in particular for the old, the disadvantaged and those people who have nobody to talk for them.  Any claim by the Opposition that there has been a substantial reduction in the standard of living is sheer bunkum and the people will not believe it.</P>
    <P>I heartily congratulate the Minister for introducing this Finance Bill.  His job as Minister for Finance has been a Herculean one over the past four years.  A prominent industrialist once said to me &ldquo;How does Richie Ryan stick it?  As Minister for Finance he is doing the work of ten men&rdquo;.  He tackled the job, he stuck to it, and <Col N="779" /> now we have in the introduction of this Finance Bill the prospect of generous tax concessions to help industry and for people in the middle income group.  This is the result of his capable management of this economy over the last four years and I congratulate him for a job well done.</P>

      <P>I notice that Deputy Toal criticised the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Finance for saying that the provisions contained in this Bill did not go far enough.  He was eloquent about this and told us that if this is all the Opposition could say it was sweet music to the ears of the Minister for Finance.  Then he comes along and tells us that in a certain area along the Border the Minister has not gone far enough, and he asked for more concessions. The Deputy was talking with a slightly tongue-in-cheek attitude and he knows, as do the vast majority of the people on the other side of the House and the people generally, that the provisions of this Bill have not gone far enough.</P>

      <P>It said, and I quote:</P>
      <P>. . .it will take a great deal more than Mr. O'Leary's face in an advertisement to provide jobs for the school leavers of this year.</P>
      <P>This is one of the greatest problems we have.  Deputy Moore yesterday referred to this Bill as the last will and testament of the Government.  I am going a little further and I say it is the last will and testament of a person determined to leave behind to those he did not like a particularly complicated estate the contents of which are of no use to anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could pose some questions.  Will this Bill do anything to settle, even <Col N="780" /> in the short time, our chronic employment situation, which is eating away like a cancer at the very foundations of the State?  Our young people become more and more frustrated.  These are educated people who are not satisfied, and never will be satisfied, with the dole, that is those of them who can get it.  They look for a much better future than the &ldquo;it will be all right tomorrow&rdquo; attitude of the Minister and the Government.  One could ask where are the detailed proposals that are necessary to assure these young people that their future will be secure?  Where is even the outline of any policy or plan to make them less cynical and distrustful?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that timidity seldom creates anything worth while. He forgets that the whole concept of this Government in their industrial planning has been governed by timidity. Agreement could not be obtained in relation to even a starting point of a plan because of this timidity and fearfulness.  They were fearful because of the discomfort and uneasiness of the partners in a marriage of convenience and there was a risk that this marriage of convenience might be dissolved if the Government set about preparing proper plans.</P>
    <P>Last night we heard that the Government have finally agreed to urge the employers to pay a pay increase negotiated between the building unions and the builders.  This is another example of the dithering and procrastination of the Government, of their refusal to try all the negotiating outlets, especially the Employer/ Labour Conference, before brandishing the big stick at the employers and before helping to force the unions to take a decision to strike.  That decision worried many house purchasers, their families and the employers.  All the worry that was aroused could have been avoided if the Minister for Labour had done his job properly in the beginning.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister for Labour spoke long, loudly and glibly about Government efforts to control inflation which he recognises now as the main danger to our economic recovery, even though it took him <Col N="781" /> three years to do so.  He tells us of the high food subsidies that have been introduced and how the Government are looking after the weak, the old and all those unable to look after themselves. He has exhorted all of us to work that bit harder and longer and not to look for extra pay.  He told us that outside influences and not internal ones were to blame for our inflation rate, and he was openly hostile some years ago to a Central Bank report that pointed out fairly and squarely that at least 50 per cent of our inflation was caused by internal sources.</P>
    <P>He wrongly and loudly condemned the Arabs for their temerity in looking for extra money for their oil, thus causing problems for us, and Deputy Toal did the same today.  Yet in 15 minutes in the House the Minister put more on the gallon of petrol than the Arabs did in years.  He then talked raimeis trying to explain why he did it.</P>
    <P>We come now to an election year and his tone has changed.  He is now much more conciliatory than he was, and it is a far cry from that night in 1969 when his description of the Irish people was less than favourable.  He has talked about the fairness of the tax system in comparison with 1972. Has he gone out and talked to the thousands of people, including widows and those on social welfare of one kind or another, who are getting large tax demands?  Has he talked to old IRA veterans some of whom are on social welfare pensions and who have been asked to pay £19 out of £20 in tax? Has he talked to those who have got tax demands for three and four years in arrears?  Has he talked to people who, because of their inability to raise the money to buy homes for themselves and who have rented houses, now find they have to pay tax on that rent because the owner of the house has gone to live out of the State? These people have been asked to pay tax for two or three years.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister talked to those who have had to pay tax on small incomes, who are barely able to keep their children fed?  Has he gone out and met the new poor, the widows <Col N="782" /> of men who were in reasonable jobs but whose pensions are now being taxed to such an extent that in each succeeding year these people are getting more and more into debt?  Has he talked to those whose only refuge from all this is tablets of one kind or another to help them feel they are getting over their financial troubles which in many cases are caused by incessant tax demands, by inability to make ends meet and inability to feed and clothe their children?</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne talked about the advantages to the aged in the Bill.  It is a pity these advantages were not introduced long ago to help people combat the process of inflation.  There is a belief that the policy of the Government was not to control inflation but rather to encourage it so that the returns from VAT and PAYE would expand Exchequer receipts.  As always, in a time of high inflation those least able to pay felt the blast to a greater extent.</P>
    <P>Where is the fair contribution from all classes the Minister mentioned in his speech?  In an orgy of spending after the 1973 election the Government fuelled the fires of inflation, and they have raged unabated and uncontrolled since then.  The spirits of the people were raised in 1973 by the manner in which the Government, as in the words of the old nursery rhyme, &ldquo;went their way spending merrily, merrily, because life to them was just a dream&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, for many people that dream has turned into a nightmare.</P>
    <P>There have been difficulties for the Government; nobody denies that or tries to minimise them.  But if there were difficulties there were also opportunities that did not exist before because, as Deputy Total reminded us today, we are now members of the EEC.  With that membership we had available to us even in 1973 some of the money which up to then had to be used as a subsidy for agricultural prices.  In addition to that, we have now available money from the Regional Fund, the Social Fund, from FEOGA and other sources.  It is highly significant that this money was used generally for ordinary Government <Col N="783" /> revenue and was not used for specific projects until this year.</P>
    <P>We had the full benefits of Tynagh Mines and, but for the ineptness of the Government, we would have had the full benefits of Navan.  We had high hopes of discovering oil and gas off our coasts and hopes that the results to our economy would be far-reaching. The results have been far-reaching, but not in the direction we expected.  At a time when the Taoiseach and his Ministers are being optimistic our import deficit for January, 1977, was the highest since the State was founded and our import deficit for March, 1977, was the second highest.  That is the position in spite of the fact that our manufacturing industry did very well in spite of the hindrances placed in the way by the Government.  Our import deficits were very high also in spite of the fact that our agricultural exports were high.  We should all congratulate those involved in manufacturing industry, particularly those engaged in exporting, for their tremendous efforts.</P>
    <P>We all feel sorry that the Government did not recognise some years ago the opportunities that were available and that they did not take the steps they have promised to take now some years ago.  It is highly significant that in the Minister's speech only a few lines are devoted to the building industry.  Under this Government that industry suffered blow after blow until the situation has been reached where there are 25,000 people unemployed in it and firms like Roadstone are laying off 250 workers.  It is said that a country's building industry is a barometer of its economy, and if that is true there are stormy times ahead for our economy.  The Minister also talked about an improved tax climate causing firms to increase their investment plans, but when industry has been cutting back on expansion for a number of years and laying off men then even a stop in the lay-offs is an advance.</P>
    <P>One must admire the optimism of the Minister.  It is a change from his pessimistic attitude over the past two <Col N="784" /> years and from his admonitions to workers to wear sack cloth and ashes. I am still a non-believer, especially now that we are in the run-up to a general election.  Perhaps, I am being cynical.  The Minister told us of his hopes of increasing employment, a sentiment we all share, but he increased that unemployment by his deliberate inflationary policies.  The actions he now proposes to take are too little too late.  At best they are only stop-gap policies.  The Minister spent a lot of time telling us about food subsidies, but I should like the House to recall that Deputy Colley, during a debate in a Finance Bill two years ago, suggested the introduction of food subsidies.  On that occasion the Minister laughed at him and said this could not be done but, six months later, after acceptance of a national wage agreement, he introduced food subsidies.  Had the Minister adopted Deputy Colley's suggestion when it was put forward that subsequent agreement could have been reached for a lot less in money terms.  Inflation, which hit employment and has since been one of the real causes of unemployment, would not have been as high and many more people would have been at work.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister, in relation to section 7, to outline the position of a man or woman now paying tax whose income is £13 per week from a social welfare contributory pension and £4 per week pension from his or her former employer.  Much heat has been generated about the question of farming taxation, and in this regard I am glad the Minister has had the good sense to realise that he was being unjust in seeking full payment in September of tax from farmers.  The Minister must take into account the factual position in relation to farming, its capacity for the advancement of our economy and the part it can play in our aim for full employment.  No other section of industry has the potential to help eliminate unemployment.  The Minister should not discourage investment, enterprise or hard work.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister a question in relation to the taxing of small farmers engaged in a small <Col N="785" /> way in other work.  In my constituency, as in many other areas, there are many handymen.  Such men are usually the owners of small farms and they carry out general construction and reconstruction works for other farmers for a day's pay.  Are such men now liable to tax on the valuation of their farms?  Will a small farmer who, after he finishes his own work, cuts silage and hay with his tractor and mower for another farmer be liable to tax? The help and assistance given by those farmers to their neighbours is vital, but will they be liable for tax?</P>

      <P>In 1974 I instanced the position of a family farm which was being kept going by the labour of a whole family, and I urged that they should not be penalised by having the allowances of a working farmer halved. I am sorry that the Minister has not seen fit to reward such a family for their hard work and enterprise.  The Minister has done nothing to ease the growing conflict between town and country.  The Minister brandished the figures of 170,000 farmers in the country with only 12,500 paying full tax.  How many of these 170,000 farmers are real farmers?  How many of them are in receipt of unemployment assistance and how many are on valuations for £5 or under, with just a few acres of land, and how many of them are aged?  If the Minister gave factual information he would have done a much better job in assisting town and rural relations.</P>
      <P>Section 51 gives relief from double taxation, but there are other people at the moment paying double taxation, and I would like to know what their position is.  In a case where a person is receiving a pension from another country and he must pay tax to that country, would that be taken into account?  Will that person have to pay double taxation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but I am sure the Revenue Commissioners will take the Minister's guarantee into consideration when I take particulars of this case to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concessions allowed in this Bill have come too late and one can only <Col N="787" /> be cynical as to the reasons for their introduction.  It is because of the general election.  There is something immoral in this type of action.  I look for guarantees that things will not be reversed if the Government by some mischance returns to office.  There is nothing in this Bill to indicate that the measures here are connected to any overall economic plan.  There is nothing to show that there is determination and grit in the Government's efforts.  Recent events indicate that gimmickry is still the hallmark of the Government.  We have no indication as to whether our advantages and disadvantages are getting the in-depth study they require at present.  Our national debt requires 20 per cent of our total tax revenue to service it.  The Minister's budget speech and other speeches made since by various Ministers have told us about schemes in State and semi-State bodies to increase employment.  The Ceann Comhairle saw fit to disallow questions seeking information about the proposed schemes and said that it was a matter solely for the different bodies.  The Taoiseach yesterday said that there would be 10,000 jobs in manufacturing industry if home and foreign demand for our goods increased.  That indicates a total lack of policy for economic development. If things improve in other countries it is hoped that our difficulties will be resolved.  That statement indicates the frenzied hysteria of a drowning man unable to see the shore.  It is typical of the inability of the partners in the Coalition to agree on an economic plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFinn" hpid="Mr. Finn Mr. Finn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from a province which was, and still is, underdeveloped although great improvements have been made as a result of the Minister's taxation budget.  This was a deliberate budget to help the underprivileged people in this country, particularly in the underpriviliged areas.  The Minister must be complimented on his efforts.  Industrial development in my province certainly arose from taxation.  People who were really entitled to pay tax had to pay it.  I have not much sympathy for <Col N="788" /> people who enjoy a certain amount of wealth and who must pay tax.  I have no sympathy for the people who try to evade tax, because the tax taken from them is being used to help the underprivileged people with a view to keeping them at home living with their wives and families, for the first time in the past 20 or 30 years.</P>
      <P>I come from a county which suffered from emigration down through the years.  We now have an industrial boom.  This can be seen in Killala, Ballina, Swinford, Castlebar, Westport, Claremorris and even Ballyhaunis. New industries are being provided and employment is being created.  Under Governments during the past 15 or 16 years, very little effort was made to create industrial development and employment in the west.  I must compliment the Minister and the Government on raising money through taxation with a view to enticing industry into those underprivileged areas, with a view to stopping emigration.</P>
      <P>Deputy Calleary talked about youth. It is a fact that many of our youth are unemployed and that our school leavers will be in difficulties, but under Fianna Fáil our school leavers went to Britain when they were 17 or 18 years of age.  That was a handy way of getting rid of them.  There is no employment for them there or in America now.  The Government are tackling that job properly.  They have nothing to be ashamed of.  Whether it be in June, October, or next spring, they need not fear that they will not get sufficient votes in the west to return them to office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development which has taken place could never have taken place were it not for the initiative of the Government in taking tax from various sectors to provide unemployment assistance, widows and orphans pensions, and to reduce the qualifying age to 66 years.  This was never contemplated by the Opposition when they were in Government.  It has cost the country a tremendous amount of money to keep those people in happy surroundings.  They are living comfortably in institutions, or in their own homes, with social welfare benefits provided by the Government.  Very few people who pay tax would deny <Col N="789" /> them their right to be accommodated in comfortable surroundings within the community.  The Government have faced up to that.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there is a problem for school leavers.  The unemployment figure should be broken down.  We should have a proper report on it.  Unemployment assistance is paid to small farmers.  They are available for work if there is work in the area.  They are not entirely unemployed.  At one time these people went to England on a seasonal basis. Now as a result of the benefits they are getting they can live at home peacefully with their families.  There has been tremendous development in housing.  New modern homes are to be seen all over the country.  Today the farming community have homes which are as modern if not more modern than town dwellers.  This is a wonderful development.  The Government tackled the problem in a realistic way.</P>
    <P>The Report of the Central Bank yesterday was the first favourable Central Bank Report I have seen for ten years.  I am sure the Opposition are not too happy about that.  We must never forget that we faced one of the most serious economic crises since the 1930s.  If the Opposition had been in Government during that period, it is difficult to know where we would be today.  We have seen the disputes inside that party and between former Ministers.  I must compliment their leader&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a good Government today.  I should like to see a certain section receiving help.  In Counties Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo there are people who travel to Galway, Castlebar, Ballina, and so on, to work. The other day a man told me it cost him £15 a week for petrol alone.  He would be far better off working at home on a small farm and drawing unemployment assistance.  I appeal to the Minister to bear in mind people who have to travel to work when he is introducing his next budget.  They must get some concession if we are <Col N="790" /> to keep our people employed.</P>
      <P>Young men who intend to get married have to provide a new home. Their salaries are not all that great and the price of a house is very costly. These people should get some concession, some tax relief, to help them to provide a home.  It is very difficult today for any young man to build a house, make the repayments on his loan and everything that goes with it. If he does not get help from his parents or some relative it is almost impossible for that young man to pay his way.  He should be completely cut off from the tax net for five or six years until he gets on his feet.  I would like to see those people helped in the next budget.</P>
      <P>The Government have done a lot of good for the people in my area. The taxation imposed in the January budget is taken from people who can afford to pay it and the money received is given to the poorer section of the community.  Those people can now live in their own country.  This should be the goal of any serious Government. Thank God we have very little emigration today.  I believe that if the Coalition Government are returned to power for another term of office all our people will be employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>It is refreshing to sit in the House and hear compliments being paid to my party, who were responsible for seeing that emigration ceased.  Even though this was not intended by the previous speaker it is nice to hear it.  I listened to Deputy Byrne this morning in his closing remarks compliment the Minister for Finance for the great job he has done for our economy.  He compared him to a rally driver&mdash;I presume the car was the economy&mdash;who had driven around the hairpin bends.  He assured his listeners that all the team were solidly behind him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand the remarks of the previous speaker who spoke about the rural homes and the modern conveniences that are in them.  He seemed to indicate that the credit for providing them should go to the Minister for Local Government.  The credit for the conveniences in modern homes in rural Ireland must go to the Fianna Fáil <Col N="791" /> Party.  We had reconstruction grants for the people who needed them despite their valuation.  That has now gone.  We introduced group water schemes.  A man building a house in rural Ireland now will not get any grant if he does not qualify for the full grant.  It is a distinct tribute to the Fianna Fáil Government that there are nice houses in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government stands convicted for removing those grants and making it impossible for people to get local authority loans or grants now.  A single man who is now contemplating matrimony, for whom the previous speaker recommended a five year tax honeymoon, will not get any local authority grant if he earns £1,950 per annum gross.  He would be a very brave man to contemplate marriage or setting up a home on an income like that.  He will not get a loan if his income is £2,350 gross. Those facts should be mentioned.  The platitudes we have heard today bear no comparison to what has happened or do not relate to the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>I do not share the views of previous speakers who admired the Administration. I feel the Labour Party do not either.  The fact that the Leader of the Labour Party is quoted in today's paper as wanting to get out and have a June election is an indication that he is not too happy with the Government. If we look at notices of motion today we can see that the Labour Party have now turned into a mutual admiration society where their five Members who belong to the Cabinet are the recipients of congratulations on their great work.  It is very noticeable that no Member of the Fine Gael Party is mentioned, particularly the Minister for Finance who is responsible for the Bill before us.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance deserves some praise.  He is learning.  The recent budget is designed to improve the economy in some respects.  Many of the suggestions we have made have been acted upon, at least in part.  We must compliment the Minister for that. Perhaps he needed remedial attention because it took him four years to <Col N="792" /> learn.  We cannot afford, in a country like this which is only developing, the luxury of four years depression to allow the Minister to do his homework. We have had four years depression with the Coalition Government. We have an ever-mounting number of unemployed, inflation galloping at 20 per cent and over per annum and a national debt which is increasing all the time and has now become an unbearable millstone around the neck of the Irish economy. The policies pursued so blindly by the Coalition Government, particularly by the Minister for Finance, have aggravated those conditions and have helped to sink the country even further into the mire.</P>
    <P>The answer we are given to all this is that it is a world recession.  The main reason that is always given for our difficulties is oil.  The bad workman who looks for excuses will always look for something like that. Oil is given as the main cause for the recession.  Deputy Colley pointed out that the Arabs put 12p a gallon on the price of petrol and the Minister put 35p a gallon on it.  Nobody believed, when the headline first appeared, that we would see the day when petrol would be £1 a gallon.  We have now almost reached that stage with the further increase today in the price of petrol.  We are now told that it has been decided to sell half a gallon of petrol to people who cannot afford to buy a gallon.</P>
    <P>The price of petrol here is very much dearer than that in Northern Ireland or Great Britain.  This is a deliberate result of Government policy.  I cannot see how any Government allowed this to happen.  It must have a very bad effect on our economy.  It has a bad effect on tourists coming here who would like to bring their own cars or perhaps hire a self-drive car.  All the people are faced with ever-increasing transport costs.  CIE fares continue to rise.  It amazes me that the previous speaker should have mentioned the people who travel to work.  It is a wonder the thinking that has surfaced from both parties in the Coalition Government, particularly from two parties which we are told are so united.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="793" /> Deputy Desmond said yesterday that those who have to travel some distance to work should be allowed some income tax concession.  Is it not a wonder that this was not mentioned before when the two parties met and had an opportunity to give the Minister the grass roots thinking in relation to this?  This was enunciated very forcibly before the last election by those who have become very silent since.  A man I spoke to last night told me that it costs him £9 a week to drive from the Curragh to his work in Dublin.  He is paying more for petrol than he is for his rent and there is no income tax allowance for this.  I hope that the next Government, which will be formed by my party, will make the price of petrol on a par with that in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy promising that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to make such a promise but it is something that I would pursue.  It is not only before an election that my voice is heard in this regard.  Unlike Deputies Desmond and Finn, I am not merely raising my voice in a vote-catching exercise.  Rather, I shall pursue the matter where I am most likely to be effective.  At one stage during the reign of the present Minister petrol was cheaper here than in Britain.  Much play was made of that situation and we were told that our prices would have to be brought up to the same level as those prevailing in Britain if we were to avoid a drain from this country.  The drain is in the opposite direction now and in this respect I wish to quote the disincentives to people who might be interested in coming here on holidays.  These are disincentives that have been brought about deliberately by the Coalition.  I refer to the price of the gallon of petrol and of the pint of Harp&mdash;examples of misplaced taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been proved, too, that the Minister is responsible directly for 5 per cent&mdash;one quarter&mdash;of last years 20 per cent inflation rate but more than anything else this regime has seen the crucifixion of the motorist.  Comparisons between conditions here and in Britain must be <Col N="794" /> odious when one considers not only the price of petrol but also the cost of new cars, of spare parts, of tyres and also of motor tax.  My family assure me that the cost of the humble Honda here is much greater than in Britain.  In addition to all this, we are contemplating a situation in which the hauliers in this country will soon be in open competition with their counterparts from across the Border. When I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce about this he said that we must have priorities and that his priorities are elsewhere.  Our priority should be the provision of work at home for our people and at least to give them the opportunity of competing on equal terms with those whom we are now going to allow in here.  I cannot understand the thinking behind this.  It is economic madness. Every shred of patriotism must be gone from the Coalition if they think they can get away with it.</P>
    <P>Our party on return to power will consider the plight of the motorist and will conduct a thorough investigation into his situation.  Is it not very wrong that a builder's labourer travelling daily from Kildare to Dublin is not entitled to any income tax concession in respect of his transport costs while a professional person is so entitled? What is amazing about all this is that the Labour Party, particularly the Minister for Local Government, made this issue an election plank before the last election.  They appeared to be so fearless in their determination to have the situation remedied that people believed them but they have neglected that cause.  Not only that but they have witnessed a Fine Gael crucifixion of the motorist during the past four years.</P>
    <P>Prior to the last election we were being criticised severely because there was an inflation rate of 6 to 8 per cent.  This was pointed out, as an indication, allegedly of how inefficient we were.  But I notice that in today's papers the Taoiseach is reported as glorying in the fact that inflation is expected to fall during the coming year to between 13 and 14 per cent.  In other words, the situation is so bad that we are to be happy that it is <Col N="795" /> only twice as bad as it was under Fianna Fáil.  An inflation rate of 14 per cent is considered an achievement. This aspect of the Government's performance is pretty bad when one compares the situation during our time in office.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the fact that our economy did not disimprove between 1973 and 1974.  It must be apparent to everyone that a stage is reached which would be difficult to worsen.  Above all, the Government have done nothing while prices have become totally out of control.  If we were to pick just one issue with which to confront the Government, the issue of prices would be the one.  It was bad enough for them to ignore the promises of their 14-point plan but the breaking of the promise in regard to the stabilisation of prices must be the worst offence they have committed in this regard.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has failed totally in this area.  Yesterday his colleague, Deputy Halligan, indicated that no small country, by its own efforts, could reduce the rate of inflation.  The humility of the Labour Deputies now contrasts strongly with their extreme confidence when in Opposition and of how sure they were then of their ability to maintain prices at the level they were at when the Coalition came to office. However, Deputy Halligan's statements might be believed in Finglas but they would not be given any credence in Ballyfermot.</P>
    <P>Politicians no more than anyone else cannot be in two places at the one time but their attitudes in one place are sometimes very different from their attitudes in another when they are faced with the possibility of performing in Government.</P>
    <P>We might be asked whether we would do any better given the opportunity. The only positive proof that we would do better is to recall that for nine months Deputy Colley exhorted the Minister to introduce a policy of food subsidies and that for those nine months the Minister dithered but finally implemented Deputy Colley's suggestion.  The result was that in the following month, <Col N="796" /> which was August, for the first time since the Coalition came to office there was a drop in the cost of living index.  The Minister claims some credit for that.  We were pleased to concede him that credit but he deserves no credit for waiting nine months before taking our advice.</P>
    <P>It would appear now that many of those who were very vocal&mdash;housewives associations and so on&mdash;during the Fianna Fáil administration have become silent.  No doubt they are feeling the pinch but what probably has happened is that the public have become punch drunk in regard to prices. When one considers that we already had more than 200 price increases since the last budget we get an indication of how ineffective the Government have proved to be and of how they have washed their hands of any effort to control expenditure and price rises.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said that the building and construction industry will benefit from the stamp duty concession for office building, from the reduction in the main rates of corporation tax and from the large provision for this industry in the public capital programme.  He said that it would benefit also from the general stimulus to the economy in the budgetary measures.  This is rubbish.  Our proposal for the building industry was for an injection of £100 million for the purpose of giving employment.</P>
    <P>I should like to impress on a Government who have let down the building trade very badly that it is in the building and construction industry that the optimum amount of benefit can be got from capital expenditure. We have green fields today where we could have people working tomorrow. We could use all our own materials and work force, people now being paid by the Government to be idle. Despite the statistics quoted here about houses built, we have seen the greatest decline in the building trade during the last four years.  Ask anybody in the supply trade, the large trader, and he will tell you about the boatloads of timber left on his hands. Ask a firm in my own constituency, Roadstone, based there but with <Col N="797" /> branches all over the country, have they been hit by the building trade and they will tell you that they had 250 redundancies recently and that they have not recruited to any extent for the last three years.  These are firms immediately involved in the building trade.  If it was even half as buoyant as the Minister would have us believe, these people would not be forced into the position of making these cutbacks.</P>
    <P>I blame the deliberate policy of the Government and particularly that of the Minister for Local Government who has stuck to the archaic income limits for housing loans and grants in existence since 1962.  Nobody will qualify now for a local authority housing loan or grant if his income is in excess of £2,350, that is, his gross earnings before deduction for tax, stamps or anything else.  We have reached the situation in my constituency where an Army private will not qualify for a local authority loan or grant for a new house, or even for a previously occupied house.  Reconstruction loans are also much more difficult to get now. This madness is beyond my understanding. It is an attempt to run down the very type of activity that would give us optimum returns and a housing stock for the future.  In 1973 our party promised that we would increase the amount of the loan to £6,000 and the income limit to £3,000.  We stand over that and promise that, when we return to power, we will adjust those figures to 1977 conditions.</P>
    <P>I am confident that private building particularly is at a standstill.  The only thing that would restore confidence in private building and in capital expenditure of this nature would be a return to power of Fianna Fáil.  To give an example of how capital expenditure and money invested wisely in this type of activity could generate jobs, I asked a question yesterday in the House.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Public Service, Deputy Reynolds, answered.  It was a question in connection with the Upper Liffey Valley sewerage scheme for Kildare. This is divided into phases one and two.  Phase one refers to large treatment works in Osberstown for which permission <Col N="798" /> has been granted.  Phase two would mean that the towns of Droichead Nua, Sallins and Clane, and Kilcullen and Ballymore Eustace eventually, would be connected to this scheme.  We had hoped that, when money was granted for the first portion of the scheme, money would be made available also for the second portion so that work could go ahead simultaneously, that the immediate benefits to be got by giving planning permission, held up for years, in Droiched Nua and in other areas, and Clane particularly, could be given on the assumption that the services would be existent to meet the demand as soon as the houses were built.  We had hoped that this would go ahead.</P>
    <P>We were told at county council level&mdash;and the reply of the Parliamentary Secretary yesterday confirmed&mdash; that money was not available for the two schemes to go ahead simultaneously. So there has been a deliberate decision taken that no capital expenditure will be incurred and that Newbridge, Sallins or Clane will not grow for another few years until money can be made available for those schemes.</P>
    <P>Now that the Minister is here I should like to take up a particular matter with him.  He appears to have suffered a change of heart from the time of his budget speech to when recent decisions were announced.  My query refers to a farmer with another trade, such as a man who owns a shop, sells blocks, or anything of that nature.  Formerly, if that man was over £50 valuation he paid tax on the profit on his farm and accounts were necessary as well; the notional system was not allowed in his case. In his budget speech the Minister said that the threshold was reduced to nil, that henceforth a person with a publichouse or business and three acres of land would have to pay tax as well on his farm.  At that stage the Minister promised that, because he was reducing the threshold to nil, he would allow the notional system to be used for assessment of profits on his farm and that he would allow people multiply their valuations by 65.  It now appears that he has omitted that concession. In effect it means that very <Col N="799" /> many people with a small amount of land will have to produce accounts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They would be producing accounts on their non-farm activity anyway, so there is no question of any additional burden.  We received representations asking that the notional system would not apply to such people, but that they could proceed on accounts.  Therefore, there is the difficulty of trying to please everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that the people who approached me have not been pleased.  I spoke today with an accountant who deals with these people.  He is a practical man. He will be a candidate of ours in the next election, when we will have the benefit of his expertise&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not a practical man then, if I may say so, through the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Even members of one's own family are not so practical then when one considers their political allegiance.  He tells me that the people concerned want the notional system to remain.  Why would the Minister not agree to give them the option of this notional system if they want it? It means that the Minister has changed his mind in the meantime.  In the case of a person with a very small valuation, that, multiplied by 65, will not mean a lot and the production of books and figures will mean a lot of unnecessary work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I might mention a difficulty referred to already by Deputy Calleary, that of a person who does hire work. I am very much afraid that this very necessary person in the rural community will be forced out of this activity.  I do know that people who heretofore engaged in hire work now refuse to work for farmers already in the tax net because they do not want to appear in their books.  Those with a knowledge of rural conditions will appreciate that the man who has the initiative, machinery, expertise and the wish to further himself and take on this extra work is an essential in a <Col N="800" /> rural area for the many jobs he does for people who are not in the position, who have not the machinery or who for other reasons, cannot do that work for themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now arguing in favour of bringing all farmers into the tax net.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy in the case of the comprehensive school, Manor-hamilton, is as follows: 1973-74 15, 1974-75 16, 1975-76 14, 1976-77 14.</P>
      <P>In the case of vocational schools it is not possible to give the information because teachers are appointed for the vocational education committee area concerned and are not specifically assigned to individual schools.</P>
      <P>In the case of secondary schools the total staff employed is a matter for the individual school manager, the Department's concern being with the number of teachers who are paid incremental salary.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In an amalgamation in cases such as this the specific minimum required is lower for the maintenance of the transport than it would be in a case where it was established because of amalgamation.  The establishment was 10.  In the Dugort school area the number travelling was six for two consecutive terms, which according to the regulations meant that the service fell.</P>

      <P>There have been reports of a number of other children in the area, but five names were given and it seems that only one of those was a child who was eligible for transport under the terms of the scheme. That brought the number to seven, but it also transpired in the course of the same investigation that one of the children who had made up the original basic six had left the area, which brought us down to six again.

In regard to the lack of public money, I regret this, because the full range of IDA incentives and grants are available to indigenous firms and we are very anxious that companies should take advantage of these grants in the matter of re-equipment and maximum productivity.

      <P>I have seen the report in question which is the Sixth Report on <Col N="826" /> Competition Policy of the EEC Commission.</P>
      <P>In this report the references to the ESB are contained in a comparison of corporate performance of 292 firms in the EEC member states.  This comparison is based on four accounting ratios for these firms as derived from financial data appearing in the 1975 list, published by the magazine <i>Vision</i>, of the 500 largest European industrial firms.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the ratings given to the ESB in the report in question as being valid for the purpose of determining the price level of electricity in Ireland.  Put briefly, the profit and cash flow arising from the total operations of the ESB have been measured in the report, against some 16 per cent of the capital required to generate them.  A more appropriate basis against which to measure profit and cash flow would, I consider, be total capital employed. As the ESB has no shareholders the concept of &ldquo;own capital&rdquo;, such as excluding loan funds, used in the report can give the most misleading results.</P>
      <P>I do not, accordingly, propose to take any steps to reduce the price of electricity on the basis of the findings of the report in question.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that under the terms of the Electricity Supply Act of 1927, the ESB set off against revenue the interest and sinking fund provisions for the repayment of capital on their borrowings, and at the same time in the same accounts, they have to set off against gross profits provision for depreciation of the assets which are represented by the things that are already written off to revenue, and that when the EEC examiners who examined accounts looked at this they felt it was not right that the same thing should be written off twice, that a normal commercial company would be allowed to write it off once, and that in these circumstances the very high degree of profitability by normal criteria of the ESB was arrived at? Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that the National Prices Commission should also apply normal <Col N="827" /> criteria, and should not allow the ESB to appear to be making little or no profit, when in fact by the normal commercial criteria, it is making a substantial profit, and that therefore prices of electricity should be significantly reduced?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment of the 1927 Act is a major matter which would require the attention of the Minister for Transport and Power as the Minister responsible for the ESB. Conscious of the problem mentioned by the Deputy, I asked the National Prices Commission on the 9th of July, 1976, to re-examine the criteria which they have been using in looking at ESB price applications.  I understand that a report prepared for the Commission as a result of my request is now before the Commission, and I expect they will be conveying their findings to me in the reasonably near future.  The figures quoted in the EEC study are not fair, because they are not a representation of the real profit situation in the ESB.  The problem is that they have counted only the capital which is supplied from the ESB's resources, and not the capital which is supplied in the form of loans.  The amount of capital being provided in the form of loans to the ESB is approximately 85 per cent of the total capital.  This is far greater than the normal amount that would be provided to a normal commercial firm with which the ESB is being compared in the study.  The normal amount of capital loaned to an ordinary commercial firm would be about 30 per cent, therefore an unbalanced picture emerges if the criteria applied to normal commercial concerns is applied to the ESB.  The ESB also has a very high capital intensity for each unit of production, and most of this capital is borrowed.  This must also be taken into account.</P>

      <P>I made it known last year that I was contemplating a number of changes in company law, certain of which would be in line with provisions which are in the British Companies Act, 1976.  There continues to be a fairly rapid evolution in thinking in the realm of company law; I have received major submissions in the last few months from two professional organisations and expect to receive one from a third body, and in addition the present expectation is that the EEC's Fourth Directive on <Col N="829" /> Company Law will be finalised this year.</P>
      <P>I have concluded that it would be a mistake in these circumstances to prepare proposals for amendment of the law just at the moment and, apart from a short Bill of a technical nature relating to computerised stock exchange transfers, I do not envisage introducing companies legislation in the near future.  Depending on developments, it would seem likely that it will be early next year before it will be possible to introduce a major Bill which I expect to deal, <i>inter alia</i>, with many of the matters which are covered by the British Act to which the Deputy refers.</P>

      <P>Any attempt to put a figure on the cost of training Garda recruits would involve a number of <Col N="836" /> arbitrary assumptions and, in particular, an assumption concerning the number of recruits trained over a given period.  This is because a substantial part of the cost arises from outgoings that, within broad limits, are fixed and do not vary directly with the number of recruits under training in any given period.  These fixed costs amount to £360,000 a year.</P>
      <P>A recruit is paid from the time he begins training and the total emoluments of a recruit during his 26-week period of training are approximately £1,300.  In addition he is issued with a complete uniform which costs approximately £200.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, several similar questions have been put down recently in respect of different areas in the country.  I think that I should now give a general answer to the effect that the Garda authorities exercise a continuing supervision over the police needs of all parts of the country and the allocation of Garda resources is modified from time to time according as the needs of particular areas vary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister assure me that extra gardaí have been allocated to the areas mentioned in my question?  There has been a dramatic increase in the type of crimes I am talking about.  I know from my knowledge of areas concerned that there has been a great increase in crimes in those areas and no extra <Col N="837" /> gardaí have been allocated.  Not alone are elderly people living in fear but also women whose husbands are working away from home.  They are living in perpetual fear of attacks from gangs who rampage around these areas.  As the Minister knows, a pattern has evolved for this sort of crime in those areas in Cork, particularly east Cork, and nothing has been done by the Minister about it.  Can the Minister give me figures to substantiate his claim that he has allocated extra gardaí and that there is extra surveillance in those areas?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <P>I told the Deputy that I arranged with the Commissioners some months ago that special attention would be given by the Garda to elderly people living alone in remote areas.  I have no doubt that that arrangement has been implemented.  It might interest the Deputy to know that the crime provisional figures for the first quarter of 1977 compared with the first quarter for 1966 for the Cork east and west divisions show a decrease in offences against property with violence.  They also show a decrease in offences against the person.  That does not substantiate the allegations made by the Deputy.  I quite appreciate that there were a number of disturbing assaults&mdash;I have particulars of three&mdash; against elderly people in County Cork since 1st January.  I share the Deputy's concern and regret that these should have happened.  The overall crime position has improved in the first quarter of this year in comparison with the same period last year.  All I can say in regard to the Deputy's question, is that the Commissioner has been asked to have extra attention given to elderly people living alone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr. R. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Brucellosis is a notifiable disease and 154 cases of it were notified in 1976. This represents a rate of 4.9 cases per 100,000 of the population and notifications of the disease have shown a fairly steady increase from 1970 when the rate was 1.3 cases per 100,000. In the first three months of this year 36 cases were notified as compared with 30 cases in the first three months of last year.</P>
      <P>Brucellosis is a difficult disease to diagnose and I accept that it may be more common than these figures indicate.  On the other hand the annual increase in notifications may indicate improved diagnosis rather than an increase in the incidence of the disease.</P>
      <P>Brucellosis is transmitted to man mainly by contact with infected animals or by consumption of their milk raw; the disease is not transmitted from person to person. Pasteurisation of milk for human consumption is effective in the prevention of the disease and the extension of pasteurisation of milk supplies is being proceeded with.  The eradication of brucellosis in humans is of course linked with the success of the bovine brucellosis eradication scheme which is operated by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Before reporting progress I was referring to the change of heart on the part of the Minister since making his budget statement in regard to the question of valuation of farmers who have a trade.  In his budget speech he agreed that because he was reducing the threshold to nil, people with only very small acreages would be brought into the tax net and that he would allow the notional system to be used rather than to ask those people to produce accounts.  He has indicated now that he wishes them to produce accounts.  I consider it very wrong that a person whose income from a small holding may be as little as £200 a year would be required to spend money on engaging an accountant or a bookkeeper in order to prove that that was only the amount of the income.  This is a matter that is concerning greatly the people in question.  The difference for them between the notional and the accounts system would be very small. Despite the Minister's remarks today I can assure him that my contentions are based on facts presented to me by an accountant who is dealing with such people in his everyday work.</P>
      <P>One of the effects of the Minister's proposal is that people who normally engage in hire work for their neighbours are not interested in continuing that activity out of a fear that, by reason of their names appearing in the books of their neighbours, they would be brought within the tax net.  Let me make it clear that I am not making a case for the exemption from tax of all farmers.  I am making a case for those engaged in hire work and who perform an essential service for the farming community.  The Minister's proposals in this regard are indicative of an urban mentality and show a lack of realisation of the benefit of these people to the rural community.</P>

In other words, the Government have succeeded in their short term in office in more than doubling the amount that had been borrowed <Col N="848" /> during the previous 50 years.  When we proposed borrowing £1 million for capital expenditure the Minister sneered at us and told us that our efforts to provide jobs in that way would come to naught, that nobody in Europe would lend us the money.  I should like to know what has happened to our credit standing in Europe in the meantime. It was good when we left office. My opinion is that it has been eroded by the squandermania of this Government, who frittered away millions of pounds in dishing out the goodies so as to court popularity and to buy cheap publicity when they should have been building for the future.  Our purpose in borrowing was to provide jobs. We did not intend adopting the policies that this Government have pursued in the field of borrowing.</P>
    <P>The greatest sin on the part of the Government has been their failure to produce jobs for our young people. They are now making promises in this area and we hear much of the job creation programmes of public bodies for 1977.  Yesterday the Minister for Health indicated the job creation programme he had in mind in the Eastern Health Board area but we are convinced that this is merely another pre-election gimmick and that it contrasts forcibly with the penny-pinching of the past three years. During that time when we looked for extra dentists or doctors or community care people we were told that we would have to work within the stringencies of our financial allocations.</P>
    <P>No doubt the decay that has set in in the meantime will not be capable of being put right by any move at this stage.  It is amazing that a situation has now been reached where money can be provided to procure jobs while only a very short time ago no such money was available.  For instance, in one of his first speeches after assuming office the Minister for Education remarked that no money was available for the purpose of reducing the pupil-teacher ratio or for extra remedial teachers.  This is a typical example of the Coalition's blundering because in a class of 45 pupils there are bound to be produced some who will require remedial <Col N="849" /> attention.  As a teacher I am convinced that this is a matter which should be tackled immediately.  Such matters as the drainage of rivers and the improvement of roads might be left for another year or so.  But if one fails to give a child a chance it needs, one is culpable to the extent that one cannot remedy that failure later.  I should like to impress upon the Minister that it would be our policy to pay people to work rather than pay them to idle. It cost £80 million to pay unemployment benefit and assistance last year. Yet the Minister wondered where we might get the £100 million we would plough into capital expenditure to provide jobs.  At the commencement of his Ministerial office I wonder did he question where he would get the £80 million to pay people each year not to work.</P>
    <P>Great prominence has been given to this new employment incentive scheme.  It has got a certain amount of publicity which might do good in so far as it might attract people to it. We have the Minister for Labour's personal guarantee, backed up by his photograph and signature, and he mentions that it is hard fact and hard cash too.  The workers of Newbridge Industries, long since closed down, will remember the first employment premium scheme when they asked the present Government for consideration that would allow them to be paid social welfare on certain days, that they would provide work in the factories for, I think it was, a day-and-a-third each week.  They were told that they would not get unemployment benefit unless they were at home sitting by their firesides, that they could not work and be paid.  That is the thinking that has permeated the Government, that people must be paid to be idle and cannot be paid to work. I hope this new employment incentive scheme will be more effective than its predecessor.  However, it appears to be another eleventh-hour promise and I am very doubtful whether it will be effective.  It is like the recent effort of that showy character in racing, The Minstrel, in the Two Thousand Guineas; the Minister timed his effort a little late.  It is no wonder that the Leader of the minority party in the <Col N="850" /> Coalition, Mr. Corish, wants a June election to get out before the Minister for Labour is forced to pay his IOUs.</P>
    <P>Possibly reference to The Minstrel affords me an opportunity to draw special attention to the decline in the bloodstock industry here.  I am convinced&mdash;and I made this point in the House before&mdash;that this decline is a direct result of Government policy, particularly that of wealth tax.  When it was first mentioned I indicated to the House that I had information on which I could rely that millions of pounds had been frightened out of the country by the mere mention of this tax.  That has happened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Begley) Michael Begley">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Begley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Bloodstock is exempt from wealth tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Those who own the bloodstock, must have a certain amount of acres to be in the bloodstock business at all, and particularly to keep a stallion.  That indicates that they would be in the wealth tax bracket straightaway.  If the Parliamentary Secretary briefs himself on this he will find that I am correct. Millions of pounds were frightened out of the country by the mention of wealth tax&mdash;money we now have to borrow abroad and which was formerly available here for investment. Very few people make money out of bloodstock breeding.  Their capital outlay is very high, the risks are enormous and they must wait for years for any return on their outlay. Because of the different financial climate here now some of our large breeders are selling out.  The Japanese and others are buying our stallions and mares.  Our leading blood lines are going abroad.  Increasingly one notices that the sire of a particular big race winner is now mentioned as standing abroad and being no longer available to the bloodstock industry here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only hope we have in the future is that, for some reason or another, once bloodstock is exported from this country it does not seem to retain the qualities that commended it to people abroad, that in a few generations in the different climate or <Col N="851" /> country to which the horse goes, the qualities are bred out, and they have to come back here to replenish their stock.  I hope that will be borne out, although the recent number of horses bred abroad winning here would indicate to me that we have reached a very crucial stage in the bloodstock industry.  The thoroughbred industry means a lot to the people of Kildare; it creates jobs for a lot of people, an international market abroad which must help our balance of payments and a great sale every year for our yearlings and older stock.  It is one industry that has got no help or subsidy whatsoever from any government. It has kept going at all times, during recessions, wars and everything else.  If we deliberately discourage investment in the industry by the wealth tax we are in danger of killing it off altogether.  While I have no great hope that the Minister would help the industry I would ask him at least not to hinder it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the course of his speech :</P>
    <P>The farming profits of the larger farmers have been brought into the tax net and so have capital gains. The wealth tax has ensured that those who have large fortunes make an appropriate contribution to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>That phrase &ldquo;large fortunes&rdquo; indicates the thinking behind that type of speech. We in Fianna Fáil believe that farmers should pay their fair share of tax.  But what I deplore is the setting up of one section of the community against another.  There has been a tendency&mdash; which has been aggravated recently and which every year becomes more apparent&mdash;for farmers to be set up against consumers and every green £ advantage for which the Minister for Agriculture claims credit is construed by other members of the Coalition party as meaning increased prices to the housewife.  The use of the phrase &ldquo;large fortunes&rdquo; indicated to me that that type of thinking has reached the Minister, if he is responsible for that speech, and I presume he is.  He should refrain from such expressions in the future.  There has been a marked tendency <Col N="852" /> to carry on this activity, and it is something that needs to be curbed. The Coalition party have a duty to endeavour at least to unite the people of this country.  Perhaps they would endeavour to unite the people of the Twenty-six Counties, seeing that they have washed their hands altogether of the hopes of uniting those in the 32. Any contribution, such as that I have just quoted, only serves to fan the flames of an anti-rural or anti-farmer bias and should be avoided in the future.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that unemployment benefit and assistance cost us approximately £80 million last year.  We in Fianna Fáil introduced a redundancy fund.  When Deputy Brennan was Minister for Social Welfare that fund had grown to a considerable size.  At that time very few people expected that it would be depleted or that there would be such demands made on it. In our party we often exhorted Deputy Brennan to allow us money out of that fund for other purposes but he said we should leave it there, that the day may come when it would be needed.  Indeed that day did come.</P>
    <P>We introduced also pay-related benefit.  This was something to be used for a limited period to cushion the effects on those who might find themselves trying to live on a smaller salary than that to which they had become used, those who had entered into commitments, hire purchase, mortgages and so on, during their period of prosperity.  This was something to cushion them and bridge that gap.  It has been abused rather than used by the present Government.  I have often written to the Minister for Social Welfare on behalf of people inquiring why they were not granted pay-related benefit.</P>
    <P>We were informed that if pay-related benefit were added to their unemployment benefit they would have a higher income from social welfare than they would have earned during the year for which pay-related benefit was paid.  Accordingly, they were not entitled to pay-related benefit.  We must have a close look at this.  When a worker looks at his take-home pay after stamp, tax and other deductions have been made and when he takes <Col N="853" /> away the cost of transport to his work he wonders if he is a fool to be working at all.  This Government have contributed to removing the incentive to work.  The rumblings emanating from the Government suggest that they are thinking in this fashion at last.</P>
    <P>From time to time we have made constructive suggestions which have been pooh-poohed and we were told that they were unrealistic.  Before the last general election, when we first mentioned our policy on rates we were told by the greatest brain at that time in Opposition, now Minister for Foreign Affairs, that we were wrong. Now that the Government have tried to implement our policy in part, it is seen that we were right.  We have offered to do away with rates completely.  The Government are taking away a quarter of them.  It is often said that the greatest flattery is mimicry.  In this instance the Government have copied us.  This is an admission that we were right and that they were wrong.  Our policy on food subsidies is shown to be correct because the Government have adopted that also.  It seems that the suggestions which emanate from this side of the House are not all wrong.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by remarking on the cockiness of the Minister when he introduced this Bill.  He said that in this year, the Government's fifth year in office, he was privileged to introduce his sixth Finance Bill.  It is a great relief to me that it will be his last.  The Government have brought the people to the awful situation that they are in.  I can say that never again will the present holder of the portfolio of Finance occupy that position.  It is a relief to know that this will be his last budget. He will never be forgotten by the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a machine to give effect to the many benefits which the Minister introduced in his budget.  In 1976 the Minister adopted a policy of reform or remedy. He felt it necessary at that time to introduce certain possibly unpopular taxation measures to lay the foundations for the reliefs which he foresaw could be enacted this year.  The <Col N="854" /> Government's determination to implement the taxation reforms programme has made possible those reliefs and fiscal incentives in 1977.  The Government do not by any means claim that this is the end of improvement or that all improvement that they would wish for in the tax code has been reached. However, they have started on the correct road to create a situation where all sections of the community will bear their fair share of tax.</P>
      <P>The Minister when introducing this Bill said that an industrial manager, for instance, might be paying income tax at the rate of 80 per cent, while another person with a similar income, operating through avoidance devices and tax havens might pay no tax whatsoever. A wealthy farmer with a similar net income might pay no tax at all without resort to any tricks or devices to avoid it, because farmers have not been taxed heretofore.  Another person might have a similar income through capital gains and he would pay no tax. This is an unfair position which any Minister with a sense of responsibility could not allow to continue.  Since 1973 the Government have radically altered the position.  They do not claim that now or at any time people in similar circumstances will pay exactly the same tax.  They do claim that there will be less variation in the amount of tax paid by people with similar incomes. Under the present scheme the highest personal tax rate will be 60 per cent. The profits of the larger farmers have been brought into the tax net and so have capital gains, and the wealth tax has ensured that people with sufficient wealth will have to bear their share of tax.  The Government have also introduced tax incentive schemes. For instance, manufacturing industries which show an increase in employment or in production will pay a reduced rate of 25 per cent which will apply for three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have abolished death duties.  These represented a tax imposed at the time when people were in the worst possible circumstances to bear it.  Deputies on every side of the House will recall cases where farms and business have had to be sold because people had not the necessary finance to pay death duties.  The Government <Col N="855" /> have ensured that this will no longer be the case.  The tax changes made by the Government since form a logical pattern the object of which is to obtain a fair contribution from all classes.</P>
    <P>The Government have taken special care of people most in need.  They have given special reliefs to the less well-to-do section of the community in a very special manner.  The increases in social welfare payments have been of the order of 120 to 160 per cent during the term of office of the Government.  The Government have pushed ahead rapidly with providing houses and the Minister for Local Government was happy to be able to announce that the building programme of 25,000 houses per year has been maintained.  Yesterday in reply to a question from a Fianna Fáil Deputy it emerged that the combined figure for housing in the private and the public sector was in the region of 25,000.  Of course, the figure was disputed by the Opposition because they do not want the people to know how successful has been the Government's policy.</P>
    <P>The Government have given incentives to manufacturing firms to expand and to create employment and this will relieve the unemployment situation. Speakers from the Opposition benches have been trying to ride two horses in this debate.  On the one hand they have claimed that the Government are only now realising that prices have increased but, on the other hand, other speakers have accused the Government of using the price increases to get into office.  They say that before the last election Government speakers claimed they would reduce prices if they were returned to power.  Fianna Fáil cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>Long before this Government came to power they were aware of what was happening in the area of price increases. When we were in Opposition we urged Fianna Fáil to remove VAT from foodstuffs but they stubbornly refused.  As a result of this Government's policy, where VAT was <Col N="856" /> removed from foodstuffs and where subsidies were granted, inflation has been reduced by 3½ per cent.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil were in office they said they could not give any relief on rates but the previous speaker kept referring to their rates scheme. Before the last election they ridiculed this Government for what they promised with regard to rates relief. Long before the election it was our policy to do something about health and housing charges and this was scorned by Fianna Fáil who said it was impossible.  Three months prior to the last election they issued a White Paper in which they stated it was impossible to do anything about rates and that was still their policy at the dissolution of the last Dáil.  Those of us who have fought elections know how little time there is to talk about policy when we are out on the road looking for votes but that was the time Fianna Fáil enunciated their rates policy.  We criticised them for the hurried way they did it.  Everyone knew it was only an election gimmick so far as Fianna Fáil were concerned. The present Government have carried out their promise to remove health and housing charges.  We have now gone further and this year there was a 25 per cent reduction on rates. These are actual facts, not airy-fairy promises.</P>
    <P>At the moment Fianna Fáil are wondering what will be their next move.  They know their rates policy has been discredited and that the Government have carried out their promises.  The Government have also given an extra £2 million towards a rates waiver scheme.  Recently there was an announcement in the papers that anybody in County Dublin with an income up to £2,000 per year can avail of that scheme.  This is a very liberal allowance and it has been made possible by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government have been criticised for the unemployment position but we know it is due to the economic conditions prevailing throughout Europe.  Fianna Fáil make much of the fact that the Government promised to reduce unemployment. Many of us remember when a former leader of Fianna Fáil <Col N="857" /> promised 100,000 new jobs but they never materialised.  The only places where there were jobs were in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Coventry.</P>
    <P>The people know all about the false promises of Fianna Fáil during the years.  They also know that the Government are determined to carry out their policy, as they did with regard to rates.  Fianna Fáil have claimed that they wanted the Government to introduce food subsidies but a previous Fianna Fáil Administration will always be remembered for having slashed food subsidies after they promised to retain them.</P>
    <P>This Government have been doing a very good job in the areas of social welfare, local government and foreign affairs.  The people know that they can be trusted.  There is no doubt that Fianna Fáil are worried about the prospect of a general election.  Not alone are they afraid of the defeat which they will suffer but they are also concerned about the inquests that will be held afterwards.  They dread those inquests because they can see their party disintegrating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about general Government policy which is covered in every section.  I intervened in this debate because the Government were ridiculed by Opposition speakers.  The Government, and the Minister for Finance, have adopted the correct policy and they will not move from it.  The result will be that when the next budget is introduced the Minister for Finance will be in a position to grant more benefits to our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of speaking on this Bill. Since I became a Member of this House I noticed that successive Finance Bills did not contain any basic plan or show any real thinking on the part of the Government.  The budget has been described as a mild one but one must also take into consideration the severe budgets introduced in 1975 and 1976.  I accept that the budget contained concessions regarding <Col N="858" /> personal taxation but since then the purchasing power of the pound has decreased.  There is little use in talking about a taxation system which will benefit anybody when prices are rising all the time.  The day after the budget was introduced in January the Government sanctioned a big increase in the price of coal and such increases make nonsense of budgetary policy.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us that one of the main features of the budget related to the changes in the personal tax structure which will benefit every taxpayer in the country.  He said these changes were one of the two major elements in the pay increase&mdash;tax cuts package which was the basis of the national wage agreement now in operation.  We were all fooled as the events that took place after the budget was introduced indicate.  A short time later increases were granted in the price of coal, bread, motor insurance and electricity charges.  We are all aware that old age pensioners who must exist on a social welfare payment must also pay the full price for coal.  Old age pensioners living alone in our cities face a particularly difficult situation.  The two main problems facing the country are unemployment and inflation and they were not tackled in the budget.  There is no evidence in the Bill that it is the intention of the Government to tackle them now.  An economic plan is necessary to tackle these problems.  The Central Bank, in the course of their annual report, state that very little progress was made in solving the related problems of inflation and unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only success that has taken place with regard to industry has been under the small industries plan.  However, in the west, particularly in the towns of Tuam, Glenamaddy.  Dunmore, Ballygar, and Mountbellow there has been a decrease of almost 30 per cent in the number of people employed.  What have the Government done for this part of North Galway?  Tuam is in need of special attention and public representatives and many interested groups there have made representations in the hope that employment would be <Col N="859" /> created in the town.  We are hoping that next year a factory will be in operation there.  If more industry is not set up in the town, the population will decrease. Many felt that the motorist was not taxed as severely in the recent budget as he was last year but a short time after the budget car insurance premiums were increased with the result that it is very difficult for very young and first time drivers to get insurance at a reasonable rate. However, the big problem for all motorists, particularly those living in rural areas where there is virtually no public transport, is that the price of petrol has been increasing steadily since 1973.  I should like to remind the House that in 1973 a gallon of petrol cost 37p. Since then we had increases ranging from 1p to 15p which was imposed in December, 1974.  The price of petrol has increased since 1973 by 60p per gallon.</P>
    <P>It is no good for the Government to blame the Arabs for all those increases.  In 1974 petrol was increased by 15p per gallon although the Arabs wanted only 5p.  What happened to the other 10p?  Presumably it went into the Exchequer, but we have seen very little in the way of extra employment created with that money, it has only added to our inflation rate.  In the past four years petrol has increased no less than 15 times.  The Arabs were looking for 12p but petrol had increased here by 60p per gallon.  This is typical of the Government's policy, whereby all their failures are caused by the world recession or our entry into the EEC, and the benefits such as those that will accrue to the farmer in the event of a devaluation of the green £ taking place, will be to the credit of the Government.</P>
    <P>In relation to farmers' taxation we are glad that the Minister has postponed the payment of tax in advance, which was due on 1st September. Farmers, like anyone else, are business people and it is unfair to ask them to pay tax in advance.  The Minister makes a distinction in his speech between farmers.  The Minister said that confusion had arisen over part-time farmers. This group comprises farmers engaged in a trade or profession on a self-employed basis.  The Minister <Col N="860" /> said that such people would be liable for income tax on their farming profits regardless of the rateable valuation of the land.  The Government and the Minister who introduced this policy, do not know about the co-operation that exists between farmers.  A person who does contracting work in a rural area is a very valuable asset to the community.  From this Bill it is obvious that a person with initiative, a farmer with a sideline, will be penalised.  This seems to be a contradiction of the employment premium scheme where £20 is being given to an employer to take on extra adult workers and £10 to take on young people.  If the employment premium scheme is encouraging initiative, this section of the Finance Bill is destroying it.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that the co-operation that exists between farmers will be broken down because of the penal clause in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The greatest unemployment has occurred in the building and construction industry.  There is very little in the Finance Bill to help this industry. The Minister in his speech asked why should the building and construction industry be eligible for the special relief given in relation to corporation tax, and tried to justify why this relief was not given.  Realistic grants and loans must be made available to prospective house purchasers if the building and construction industry is to be put back on its feet. A married man earning more than £2,050 cannot get any grant from either the county council or the Department of Local Government, and if he earns more than £2,350 he cannot get a loan from the local authority.  If he gets a loan, it will only amount to £4,500.  At present day house prices a man would need twice that amount.  The eligibility limit for loans and grants must be increased and the grants must be increased.</P>
    <P>Very little has been done in this Bill in relation to education.  Grants for higher education, university or third level education were not increased and the eligibility limits for these grants have remained static.  A couple with a child ready for university would have to earn less than £1,600 <Col N="861" /> to qualify for a grant for the child.  A man earning £1,600 would only have about £30 per week.  That is unrealistic. A married man with no family would easily qualify for a medical card on that amount of income per week.  We discussed this problem in Private Members' time recently and the Minister told us that more money was being made available in education. There is no point in making money available if fewer people are qualifying for the money.  With present-day prices it is very difficult for a family to maintain a son or daughter in university or at a third level without a grant.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government says that he is providing more money for houses and for grants, but again fewer people are qualifying for loans and grants.  This question must be studied carefully by the Government. Housing and education are two very important areas.  No plan has yet been made to deal with problems in education and no money has been provided for extra building in our primary and post-primary schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point that in dealing with unemployment it is important to create incentives for the building industry.  I was trying to make the point that the extra classrooms which have to be built would create more employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the whole question of unemployment, many industries are set up but, unfortunately, they never develop and reach the target which it was hoped they would reach.  This affects us particularly in the west where everyone is concerned about creating more jobs.  When an industrialist sets up an industry in the west, he finds we have a very poor telephone service, we have not got the necessary infrastructure services, and there is a very big problem with transport on our poor roads.  I often wonder if industrialists are given the full information before they set up <Col N="862" /> industries.  It is important that they should, and that they would be under no illusion as to the backup facilities in particular areas.</P>
    <P>I know of one industry in Gort, County Galway, which closed recently. The major reason for its closure was that there was no automatic exchange, no automatic dialling in the area and it was very difficult to have any communication between Gort and Dublin, or Gort and other countries, and markets were severely affected.  A similar situation is developing in Loughrea where a factory will be closing in July for the same reason. No money was made available in the budget to provide the necessary infrastructures. In the budget, telephone charges were increased and this creates a big problem for industry.</P>
    <P>A motion was circulated this morning signed by a number of Labour Deputies stating that Dáil Éireann notes with satisfaction the massive increase in telephone investment and development in the past four years and urges the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to continue to implement these progressive policies. In Galway quite a number of manual exchanges will not be converted until 1979 or 1980.  This is a problem.  In certain areas in the west there has been a decrease in the number of people employed.  Deputy Daly asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the number of people in employment in the Shannon Industrial Estate in 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1976.  On 31st December, 1973, the figure was 4,551 and on 31st December, 1976, it was 4,033, a drop of over 500.  At the same time at least 50 new industries were created in that area.  It will be quite a problem to deal with unemployment.  The Government have not played their part in providing the necessary extra jobs.</P>
    <P>In the past few days we have heard promises about the jobs which will be created.  The Minister for Health said there will be extra jobs in the health services.  The Minister for Transport and power said extra jobs will be available in the tourist industry, particularly summer jobs.  Bord Fáilte are responsibile for tourism and my <Col N="863" /> information is that no such jobs exist. The Minister might have been mistaking jobs he thought Bord Fáilte had for jobs which the local authorities have in local improvement schemes and amenity projects in different areas.  We cannot get any information from the Minister on this, because Bord Fáilte are responsible for their own affairs and the Minister is not allowed to answer questions concerning the jobs Bord Fáilte may have.  I hope I am wrong, but my information is that Bord Fáilte have no summer jobs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton mentioned the policy on rates.  We all agree with the principle of reducing rates, which is a social need.  During the last general election campaign, the Government laughed at the idea of Fianna Fáil stating they would abolish rates on private houses.  They do not seem to be laughing at it now.  They are giving a relief of 25 per cent on rates this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we ever laughed at the idea.  What seemed laughable was that the idea was pulled out of the hat three days before the election although Fianna Fáil had said the rates could not be reduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>

      <P>I am glad of that.  The budget was very misleading and deceitful in the sense that so many price increases were sanctioned after it was introduced.  By the end of the year our national debt will probably <Col N="864" /> be over £4,000 million and we will have to pay back a substantial part of the external public debt in the next couple of years.  There is no point in the Government saying everything in the garden is rosy.  The facts presented in the report of the Central Bank are very frightening.  Deputy Briscoe said yesterday it was costing us £500 per minute to pay back the debt.  He informed me today that he was mistaken, that in actual fact it cost £800 per minute to pay back the debt.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will have to take that matter up with Deputy Briscoe.  The Government have not borrowed money to create employment.  We are paying our way on a day-to-day basis.  I hope, after the next election when Fianna Fáil get back into power, that they will not delay, as the Coalition have done, in producing an economic plan. This is the only basis on which a country can work.</P>
      <P>The Government did not carry out a census.  As the Parliamentary Secretary is aware this would have given jobs to our young people.  A census is for their benefit because they are the future of the country.  It is very difficult to make any plan when there is a scarcity of statistics.  No Government in any country would have waited so long before producing a plan to work on.  This will be a priority when Fianna Fáil are returned to power.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that this year's budget was the sixth one he brought in.  It is the sixth time that he has stated, on behalf of the Government, that their financial policies will solve all the problems of the State and leave the State better off at the end of the year than at the beginning.  However, when we take the ordinary indicators of progress and advance we find that this is not so.  I refer particularly to the figures indicating rising prices and unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget indicates a change of policy in comparison with the two previous budgets, which were very <Col N="865" /> harsh.  They were offered to the people as the solution of our problems.  On this occasion we had a change from the extraordinary taxation of the two previous years to giving some taxation concession for this year.  One can be pardoned for saying that this is an election year.  If the Government thought that this budget would be so successful why did they not introduce a budget like this last year and the previous year and let the success start earlier?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I would like to put on the record.  The first is that the Minister in his budget statement made very little reference to saving.  The Finance Bill offers no encouragement whatsoever to people to save.  This is a very important thing not alone for the State but also for families because of the spending which we see taking place throughout the country, particularly at weekends, but also at other times throughout the year.  The idea seems to have gone abroad that it is not necessary to save at all.  The Government should ask the ESRI to look into saving, publish a paper on it and try to convey to the people how important saving is.  On the other hand, is it more important that the people should spend their money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past each family as a unit advocated that saving was a virtue and that by saving it was hoped that one would be able to provide for oneself in the future.  However, with the onset of the paternal state there probably is not as great a need for this kind of argument now or in the future.  Some lip service is paid to it from time to time in budgets and incentives are offered to people to save. I do not believe they go far enough. There is an advantage to the State and to individuals if some inducement is offered to them to save for the future because people would not have <Col N="866" /> to depend on the State to the same extent with regard to building their houses and providing for the education of their children.  The taxpayer would then be relieved of some of the burden he bears.</P>
    <P>It has to be seen, however, that it is an advantage to the State that large amounts of money are spent because the State can collect a large amount of VAT on goods which are purchased. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why the State do not do more to encourage saving.  They seem to be allowing spending to increase.  It has to be accepted that the extra expenditure adds to the buoyancy of revenue and provides the State with money to spend which they might not have.</P>
    <P>The ordinary individual cannot go into this problem and get facts and figures on it to indicate which is the better policy from the point of view of the State and of the individual.  The Parliamentary Secretary should ask the Minister for Finance to establish something more definite in relation to saving.  This is a very important matter.  Many people feel that money is not worth keeping in view of the inflation which takes place from one year to the next.  It is hard to believe that that could be absolutely right.  I would like to see the arguments for and against this.  I hope my remarks will get more positive reaction this year than they have got in the past.</P>
    <P>The next thing I would like to refer to is the taxation of farmers.  It is generally accepted that farmers, who are in a position to do so, should pay tax.  Nobody regards the paying of income tax as a pleasant duty and, therefore, there is a natural resistance to it.  We are told that those with a valuation of over £75 will be included in the tax net following this Finance Bill.  It is feared down the country that this limit will be extended downwards from year to year so that every year more people will be caught within the net.  It would be nice to think that farmers would become so prosperous that there would be justification for including them in the net by reducing the valuation to a lower figure.  There is an objection to the national system of indicating taxable income, the <Col N="867" /> relation of the £65 to the £1 valuation. The expenses allowed on it are very limited.  One relates to the payment of rates while the other relates to the employment of persons who are within the PAYE system.</P>
    <P>There are three important matters which do not seem to be included and which are causing concern.  First, there is the regional consideration. The land is not similar in every area. It has not similar capacity for production. Indeed, in some areas its capacity to produce is very limited, sometimes limited to the production of nothing more than grass.  The second factor is that the figures, as they stand, do not take into account the losses that farmers may suffer as a result of deaths or of disease of cattle.  The farmers complain that while there is much talk about the big prices obtainable for cattle, there is no consideration given to the fact that the replacement of these animals is a very costly business so that the figure realised at a mart for an animal is not representative of a net gain.</P>
    <P>As reported at column 1344 of the Official Report for 15th March, 1977 I asked the Minister for Finance if he would indicate all the sources of statistical information that prompted him to raise the production value of £1 valuation of land from a notional one of £40 to £65.  The Minister replied, and I quote:</P>
    <P>. . . the most recent available statistics for income arising in agriculture are those for 1975 prepared by that office and published in table 9 of the June, 1976 issue of the <i>Irish Statistical Bulletin.</i> The figure given in that table for &ldquo;Income from self-employment and other trading income&rdquo; is net of expenses related to farming, including rates on land . . .</P>
    <P>I set about reading the document, quite a challenge for one who is not used to dealing with figures.  The first point that occurred to me was that the figures in it seemed to be based largely on the 1952 system of estimating agricultural output and which was changed further in 1957, in 1959 and in 1962.  An outline <Col N="868" /> is given of how the gross agricultural output is arrived at and also of how the figure for net agricultural output is ascertained.  Finally, there is the income figure for members of the family.  However, those figures seem to be estimated on the basis of sale prices without making any reference to the cost of replacing animals or to the regional situation.  Neither is there any reference to losses due to death or disease.</P>
    <P>Having some idea of the competence of the people who compile these figures I am reluctant to suggest that there is something very wrong about the information but since the figures are now an important feature of agricultural life, either the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Agriculture should be given the task of indicating how exactly the figures are arrived at and, secondly, the full significance of the figures.</P>
    <P>The first figure in the book relates to income from self-employment and other trading.  In this regard the figure for 1973 was £364 million while in 1975 it was £483 million, an increase of £119 million or about 33 per cent. By increasing the notional value from £40 to £65 the Minister is increasing that figure by more than 55 per cent. There is some justification for asking the Minister to explain this further. He has made some reference to using the 1976 and 1977 figures but this whole matter should be explained.</P>
    <P>The other point is that the income is family income and takes no account of the work done by the owner of the land.  It represents work carried out by his family.  This is another matter that the farming community wish to be taken into account and they argue that they should be allowed more by way of claims for expenses to cover this point.  In replying the Minister may find it possible to fob-off all I have said by telling us that if a farmer so wishes he may present accounts. However, there are many farmers who are not prepared to avail of this option but for those who are prepared to avail of it they would like to be assured that the three matters to which I have referred would be included in estimating their incomes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" /> Another feature of this increased notional value is one that may concern the social services of the medical side because there is a feeling abroad that this increase is now being used by the health board for the purpose of assessing eligibility for medical cards.  The result of this is that people who held cards in the past, whose stock position has not changed, have lost their medical cards.  The only explanation for this would appear to be that the health boards decided to take the increased notional value as an indication that the card holder's income had increased.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 11 on today's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This question relates to the payment of the £9.4 million which was authorised by an Act of the Oireachtas we all recall passing through this House, the Bula Limited (Acquisition of Shares) Act, 1977.  It was passed by both Houses on 23rd March last and, I presume, signed by the President some time after that when it became law.  As will be recalled, the purpose of this Act was to enable the Minister for Industry and Commerce to buy 24 per cent of the shares in a private company called Bula Limited for £9.4 million, not to be invested in the company but to be paid to four named individuals and the personal representatives of a fifth named individual through their holding company called Frolic Investments, which name was changed afterwards to Bula Holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of that debate which went on, between the two Houses, for about six weeks altogether and in which I was involved for four weeks here, various facts came to light which the Minister had not told the House about until I drew the House's attention to them.  It is not necessary for me in the very short time at my disposal and for the purpose of this <Col N="870" /> discussion to go through all those facts that were deliberately concealed by the Minister in some of the cases, and of which he was totally ignorant&mdash; ignorant, I would suggest, in a blameworthy way&mdash;in relation to others, when he did not know about the background details of the matter at all. But there were many such facts, one of which came to light and which is directly relevant here, that is the fact that Bula Holdings, to whom the Act envisaged the payment being made on behalf of the individuals concerned, no longer owned the shares and that 80 per cent of the shares in Bula Limited in fact were owned by a company called Norfin Nominees Limited.</P>
    <P>Since I spoke on the matter last it has come to my notice that Norfin Nominees Limited, in another case of a public quoted company where they were registered, as in this one, as security for the very large sums of money advanced to them, refused&mdash; as they are perfectly entitled to do; I am not criticising them in any way at all&mdash;to carry out the request or direction of the other shareholders, the beneficial shareholders and of the beneficial shareholders' directors in that company but, instead, took certain other steps in order to protect their own lending and the money that was due to them.  Because of the extraordinary delay in the payment of this money by the Minister one is entitled to ask at this stage: Has something similar happened in this instance? Is it because the money has now to be paid to Norfin Nominees Limited that this situation arises?  Are Norfin Nominees Limited&mdash;as they are perfectly entitled to do&mdash;seeking to protect their own rights in the matter? I am asking that question.  If that is the case I am not in any way criticising them because they are perfectly entitled, in the interests of their own company and lendings, to do so.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the money was not paid on the due date and has not been paid since, notwithstanding the passage of three months and three days, according to my calculation.  What I was told by the Private Secretary to <Col N="871" /> the Minister was the due date plus the fact that no effort has been made&mdash; as was made clear here today&mdash;by Bula Limited or by their prospective 49 per cent shareholders, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to pursue a planning application lodged originally in July, 1976, and that suggests to me, and I think to anybody who looks at this matter in a reasonably objective manner, that, for one reason or another, this whole proposal envisaged in the Act to which I have referred is not now going to be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>I want to say straightaway, of course, that if this is the case, as it appears to be, this party would welcome that fact.  We regarded this as an outrageous proposal and we have even more cause to regard it as such now, in the light of all the facts that were concealed deliberately from us but which we unearthed.  But, just as much as we would welcome it, clearly the Minister would find it extremely embarrassing and would try, as he now appears to be doing, to cover up these recent developments, delays and changes of plan until after the imminent general election has been held.</P>
    <P>I asked specifically, I think, three times today&mdash;I have not got a copy of the supplementaries because those facilities are not available to me as they are perhaps to the Minister&mdash; what was the reason for this delay and I got no answer.  It became very reminiscent of what went on here in February and March this year&mdash;no answer, no answer, a continual process of this.  Finally, on pressing the matter very strongly, I was told by the Minister today, in a rather vague way, that there were legal delays.  I asked him what was the nature of the legal delays and I got the no answer situation. We are entitled to know what, if any, are the so-called legal delays. &ldquo;Legal delays&rdquo; are words that could cover a multitude.  They could mean that there is some technical problem between the solicitors on one side and the solicitors on the other about the use of certain words in the deeds, or some other purely technical matter that could be sorted out in a matter of <Col N="872" /> a couple of hours if the parties to the arrangement had the will to do it.  On the other hand, the words used, &ldquo;legal delays&rdquo;, could cover a fundamental rethink on the whole matter, an effort to draw up a new agreement, to amend the secret agreement of 12th December, 1975, or, as we recommended to the Minister that he should do, an effort on his part to get out of that secret agreement.  We asked these questions in the only way open to us to ask them in this House, and we got no answers.  We are entitled to protest that we got no answers.  If people begin to draw conclusions in these circumstances, from the refusal of the Minister to answer, then the Minister cannot complain at such conclusions being reasonably drawn in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke only two or three words today and that was to dispute my statement that the first instalment of 50 per cent of this money was due and payable on 9th February, 1977.  I was informed of that fact by his Private Secretary on the telephone when he was asking me to agree to take the Bill quickly in the hope that it would be passed quickly because it had to be enacted before that date.  I understand that subsequently that date may have been amended to either 10th or 11th February, but it makes no significant difference.  The fact that it is a date at that time is borne out by the Minister's own statement in his opening speech on Second Reading on 1st February, 1977, in Volume 296 at column 511 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>Let me point out, by the way, that this money is payable in instalments, 50 per cent within 90 days, 25 per cent within one year and the remaining 25 per cent within two years.</P>
    <P>The 90 days to which the Minister refers there is the date that the arbitrators made their decision and, somewhere between 9th and 11th February is 90 days after the date of that decision.</P>
    <P>Another of the endless possibilities about the extraordinary lack of urgency which now exists, compared with the extraordinary urgency which existed in January and early February, may well be that the Minister is having second <Col N="873" /> thoughts&mdash;as he suggested he might have&mdash;about paying money to people who promoted a company part of whose assets now seem to comprise State-owned minerals, a company who own and are proposing to mine minerals under land that they bought where the ownership of those minerals is 100 per cent vested in the State. It seems to be carrying the socialist idea farther than any of us could have envisaged the Minister for Industry and Commerce carrying the socialist idea, to be paying money for the right to participate in the hopeful future extraction of minerals some of which are owned by the State itself.  All of the minerals could have, in any event, been acquired for the State under the provisions of the 1940 Act by the Minister making an order that did not contain the technical defects which the High Court and the Supreme Court found in the original order made in relation to these minerals.</P>
    <P>At a time when our officially registered unemployment figure is 115,000 and when the actual unemployment figure, including the young people who are not officially registered as unemployed of which there are, unfortunately, tens of thousands, is 145,000, it seems incredible that the Minister shows not the slightest concern with trying to get this company to press ahead with their planning application to the Meath County Council but is quite content to allow the situation to lie as it is with unanswered queries from the Meath County Council who are the planning authority.  These queries are on a very large number of points and are likely to lie unanswered for many months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy that the moneys referred to in Question No. 11 have not been paid to the people concerned.  Those people and their new-found partner, the Minister, have not found it worth their while to pursue the planning application without which no steps whatever can be taken in this matter and without which there is not the slightest chance of any jobs being <Col N="874" /> created, not just this year but in the next two, three or four years, depending on the terms of the planning permission. That permission will ever be granted is uncertain as I understand that there are several hundred objectors in that locality.  The planning application, which was lodged last July and which was sent back to the applicants either at the very end of 1976 or the beginning of 1977 and which is, therefore, not now before the planning authority, does not contain an application for the single most necessary aspect of this whole proposed operation, that is permission for the conversion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is on the extraordinary non-payment of this money which is 50 per cent of £9.54 million which the Minister himself told us, as I have quoted from column 511 of the Official Report of the 1st February, was payable within 90 days of the arbitrator's award.  I asked the Minister why it has not been paid and he refused twice to tell me.  On the third occasion he told me there were legal delays.  When I asked what they were, he sat down.  We are entitled to know why the money has not been paid and when it is going to be paid.  We cannot be fobbed off with the answer that the Minister gave to me that he did not know, it depended on the lawyers or some words to that effect.  I am quite sure that the people concerned who have been owed £4¾ million since 9th or 10th February must, indeed, be anxious about their money.  If I were owed £4¾ million for the last three months and three days I would be hammering at the door of my debtor for my payment to which I would be legally entitled.  Is that not the position here or has the Minister made a new agreement whereby this money will not be paid at all?  Is it now proposed not to go ahead with the project as originally envisaged in order to save the Minister embarrassment?  It is proposed to make no announcement about it until after a general election <Col N="875" /> has taken place?  It is very unlikely at that stage that the Minister will be there to make the announcement.</P>
      <P>A great deal of the speculation that must go on in relation to this arrangement is caused by the fact that the Minister without precedent has pushed through this House a Bill which ratified an agreement for which no Member of this House other than himself or presumably a Member of his Government is responsible.  Many of the questions which one must ask nowadays could or would be asked in a different way or might not have to be asked at all if this extraordinary effort on the part of the Minister had not gone on and had not been continued as it has.  The debate on the Bill in this House has demonstrated why the Minister had to be so secretive.  There were numerous things which he sought to cover up and which were uncovered by us.  There may well be just as many things which would embarrass him equally and which we may in the course of time be able to discover.  The questions which were asked today and were not answered should now be answered and if the Minister persists in his usual performance he has only himself to blame for a further increase in the suspicion which this matter arouses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I leave it to the judgement of any neutral reader of the record as to whether the questions I was asked today were answered or not.  We could all offer opinions about that but I ask people to read the record and to consider the questions and answers.  In all cases I believe that clear, unequivocal answers were given.  In the 20 minutes at his disposal Deputy O'Malley addressed himself very little to the matter which he purported in this question to raise and he talked in as general terms as he could endeavouring to widen the debate and to have a re-run of things that were discussed at great length in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question I was asked related to payment of moneys and the amounts and dates.  I answered that <Col N="876" /> question absolutely unequivocally. Deputy O'Malley invented an extraordinary urgency and he then replied to his own invention of extraordinary urgency by what he now describes as an extraordinary lack of urgency.  One is as much an invention as the other. There is no extraordinary lack of urgency.  There is the perfectly normal procedure of closure and a perusal of the official record of both Question Time and of this debate will indicate that he put words into my mouth that I did not use and he attributed opinions and actions to me, opinions that I do not hold and actions that I did not do.</P>
    <P>With regard to Norfin Nominees Limited, they have not been involved in the completion procedures.  Those procedures are being conducted between Bula and myself&mdash;not in the person of myself but by my Department and the relevant advisers.  There is no extraordinary lack of urgency or delay.  The Deputy can be quite reassured on the question of renegotiation or the question of an altering of direction or intention.  A Bill was passed enabling me to do certain things and I am in the the course of doing them.  That I cannot put an exact date for their completion would surprise nobody unless he was determined to be surprised.  Least of all it should not surprise somebody with legal experience.</P>
    <P>What interests me with regard to the question itself and raising it on the Adjournment is the approach of Deputy O'Malley.  It seems to me to be negative and destructive, although I do not want to use that word abusively. The person on the Opposition side who best understood the legal situation was my predecessor, Deputy Lalor, and I am glad he is in the House to hear me say it.  He well understood the legal constraints.</P>
    <P>I do not purport to quote exactly what Deputy O'Malley said but I wrote down some words at the time. He said that all of the minerals could have been acquired by the State by an order under the 1940 Act; in other words, if I had continued with the policy I inherited.  Had my advice been that that could have been done I had <Col N="877" /> no objection to doing it.  I came in with no preconceived ideas and had that offered me the best of the possible solutions certainly I would have followed that course.  The reason I did not do so was because of the advice I received which seemed overwhelmingly correct and which I gave to the House in the course of the debate. Since Deputy O'Malley has again raised the matter that I could have made an order and gone ahead, perhaps I should briefly refer to that situation again.</P>
    <P>I share the Deputy's unwillingness to have delays.  I must believe it is as sincere on his side as it is on mine but the path of making a new order ran the risk of far greater delays than we have had.  Even if success had been possible to gurantee&mdash;which it most emphatically was not&mdash;there was the enormous risk of paying compensation not for the valuation of one-quarter but for the entire lot.  That was said over and over again in the House. Deputy O'Malley can ignore it or say it was not so if he wishes but I have told the House it is so and we simply get to the stage where it is his word or my word.  The path of making another order was one which presented the alternatives of enormous delay or, if successful, of possibly enormous cost&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister avoided all delay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither of those was an acceptable alternative.  Deputy O'Malley has interrupted me to ask if I have avoided all delay and of course, I have not avoided all delay.  There had been delay from the autumn of 1970 until I got a Supreme Court judgement early in 1974 which was not avoidable anyway and which resulted from a process I did not set in train. With regard to delay, I am not trying to apportion blame.  Deputy O'Malley is trying to apportion it to me but if one looks at the time scale the process set in train in the autumn of 1970 resulted in considerable delay long before my time.  I am persuaded by the balance of advice that persisting on the course, no doubt taken in good faith by the Department and by my <Col N="878" /> predecessor, would have resulted in even greater delay.</P>
      <P>When there is a messy legal situation &mdash;and regardless of who was Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time there was a messy legal situation which none of us wanted&mdash;delay was inherent in the situation.  I suggest that the path of doing nothing with regard to Bula was not acceptable and the path of persisting, in the face of the advice I received, in the previous policy&mdash;which was undertaken no doubt in good faith &mdash;was not acceptable either.  Therefore, the path I took was the correct one.</P>
      <P>What interests me in the debate is that while there has been enormous concentration on the minutiae of the situation and a great use of the word &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; with regard to things that are not extraordinary but are quite normal as Deputy O'Malley knows, the alternative strategies were not discussed by the Opposition at all.  While they spent a great deal of time telling me what I did wrongly, they did not for a moment suggest an alternative course of action which they believed would succeed.  All they did was to reiterate that I should make another order and that I should persist in the policy undertaken. I have given overwhelming reasons why that was not the correct thing to do.  Once those reasons are given it is not an alternative which the Opposition could persist in saying I should do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Once they were in possession of those arguments the Opposition could not persist in saying that I should continue on that course. They only do it for the purpose of raising an issue which they know to be unreal.  It is a perfect example of the seriousness of the debate from the Opposition side that it comes out as four years and four months between the date of judgement of the Supreme Court and the present time because no sort of artithmetic makes it four years and four months.  It is an example of their lightheartedness in relation to available facts and the timetable.</P>

As the <Col N="842" /> person concerned, who had hitherto been in receipt of both these pensions, reached the age 67 on 8th May, 1977, she is accordingly entitled only to one pension after that date, which in her case is the higher rated widow's contributory pension.</P>

Certain inquiries had to be made regarding the reason for this refusal.  The results of these inquiries were submitted to a deciding officer who decided on the evidence available to him that the refusal of the offer of work by the person concerned was reasonable in the circumstances and that he should be allowed unemployment benefit.
