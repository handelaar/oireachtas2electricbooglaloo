      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that what the Deputy has in mind when referring to utilising fully the facilities of Shanganagh Castle is that the institution should be kept filled to capacity.  The successful operation of the open centres depends on the careful selection for accommodation in them of persons who are likely to be suitable for an open régime.</P>
      <P>So far this year 143 boys have passed through Shanganagh Castle.  At present the population there is 38 and the maximum number who could be accommodated there without strain is 45.  The corresponding figures for the other open centre for juveniles, Loughan House, are 117, 28 and about 45.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the number of places of detention in the Republic; the number of such places in respect of which visiting committees' reports were published in each of the years 1973 to <Col N="1178" /> 1977; and the number which do not have visiting committees in accordance with the Prisons (Visiting Committees) Act, 1925.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of prisons and places of detention administered by my Department is ten.  They are as follows: Mountjoy, Limerick, Cork, Arbour Hill, Portlaoise Prisons, the Training Unit, Shelton Abbey open centre for adults, St. Patrick's institution and the open centres for young offenders at Shanganagh Castle and Loughan House.  The Training Unit and Shelton Abbey have been brought within the scope of the Prisons Acts comparatively recently and the number of persons accommodated in them has been small.  For these reasons the need for visiting committees to these institutions was not pressing.  I intend, however, to appoint visiting committees for 1978.</P>
      <P>All seven visiting committees then in existence furnished annual reports for 1973, 1974 and 1975.  Visiting committees had not been appointed to Shelton Abbey, the Training Unit or Arbour Hill Prison which opened in June, 1975.</P>
      <P>Eight visiting committees furnished annual reports for 1976&mdash;all except Shelton Abbey and the Training Unit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda authorities have stated that having regard to other demands on Garda resources, the present arrangements for policing the Littleton area are reasonably adequate and the reopening of a Garda station at Littleton would not be justified at present.</P>
      <P>Save where official accommodation is provided, the accepted practice in the Garda Síochána is that a member is free to live where he chooses provided he does not live at an unreasonable distance from his station and I do not think that a case for curtailing this freedom has been established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the alarm and unease that exists at present in this rapidly developing area, which is situated on the main Cork-Dublin primary road?  Has he had any representations on this matter and is he aware of the dissatisfaction that has been expressed publicly in the area regarding the present arrangements? Having regard to the unsatisfactory arrangements, I would ask the Minister to reconsider the question of at least putting a garda permanently in the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will introduce legislation to prohibit the sale of alcohol to people under the age of 18 in an effort to stem the increase in under-age drinking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will consider the repeal of section 11 of the Intoxicating Liquor (General) Act, 1924.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>The Intoxicating Liquor (General) Act, 1924, prohibits, in general, the sale of intoxicating liquor for consumption &ldquo;on&rdquo; or &ldquo;off&rdquo; licensed premises to persons under the age of 18 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> Section 11 of the Act prohibits the sale of intoxicating liquor in &ldquo;off&rdquo; licences to persons under the age of 18 but subsection (4) allows the sale or delivery of intoxicating liquor in a corked and sealed vessel containing not less than one reputed pint to a person over the age of 15 years.  I have no evidence that this particular exception is a significant factor in the social problem of under-age drinking or that, if the exception were removed or modified, any young people who may now avail themselves of the provision could not easily find other ways of getting drink.  On the other hand, the provision seems to serve no good purpose and if the Intoxicating Liquor Acts were being amended I would seriously consider proposing its repeal.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that the problem of drinking by young persons is a social one related to the drinking habits of the community generally.  Legislative changes or police action can at best have a marginal effect in dealing with this problem.  The co-operation of the community is essential in bringing to the notice of the Garda information concerning those who may be deliberately selling intoxicating liquor to underage persons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Minister's reply that he accepts there is a growing problem in this area. May I take it he has no ideas in mind for any legislative changes in order to cope with this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to similar questions from the Deputy some time ago I told him that the matter was under active review at the moment. This is an aspect that merits consideration. In my reply to Deputy Andrews I said that it appears the provision in the Act does not serve any useful purpose and it is a likely provision that could be considered for repeal in the event of legislation being brought before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that the Minister has in mind introducing some changes in legislation when the review is completed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put it like this.  I have a very open mind on the <Col N="1181" /> matter.  If changes are necessary they will be made.  The provision will be considered for repeal if changes are being made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Did I understand the Minister to say that he does not think that the supply of intoxicating liquor in sealed bottles to people between the ages of 15 and 18 years facilitates drinking by people in that age group? Surely the Minister must be aware that this is the group abusing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The people in this age group are creating a problem.  They are becoming addicted to cider. Indeed, the Minister must be aware that it is not so very long ago since there was a serious incident in this city and that the belief is that those who were involved had been drinking cider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Does the Minister not think that if he were to prohibit, as a matter of urgency, the supply of intoxicating liquor to people between the ages of 15 and 18 it would improve the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to myself, the Deputy probably misunderstood what I said.  I will repeat what I said, that is, that I have no evidence that this is happening.  The Deputy will remember I said that the help of the people at large would be welcomed very much by the Garda in helping them to nail down anybody who might be selling drink to young people or encouraging drink amongst young people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): If the Minister has been reading the newspapers he will know it is a matter of common knowledge that people in the 15 to 18 age group are the people who are buying bottles of cider and other drink of this type and are abusing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I understand the Minister to say that he would seek the co-operation of people to prevent the sale of liquor to people under the legal age?  If that is the case, perhaps the Minister might consider asking RTE to change, if not abolish, their advertisements aimed directly at the category of people we are talking about?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the provisions of section 11 referred to in the question actually permit the sale, at an off-licence, to people over the age of 15.  Would the Minister not consider that that age limit should be increased?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in my original reply to Deputy Andrews' question that this was something that would have to be considered, that I would be thinking about repealing it in the event of legislation coming before the House.  Might I further say that I have read the same newspapers as Deputy Fitzpatrick of Cavan-Monaghan. I spoke recently to a person who was quoted at length in one of these newspapers as saying that drink was being sold to people under 18 and that this drink was being consumed on off-licence premises.  I asked if there was any proof available&mdash;I met the gentleman concerned in an informal way&mdash;and he did not have any proof.  I would love to have proof, and the guards would love to have proof, because this is an area in which we would all like to be helpful and in which we have a grave responsibility to be helpful.  I cannot comment on the advertisements on RTE; I shall leave that to my colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

My next project in this area will be the introduction, in the very near future, of a Bill to deal with existing ground rents on such houses. When both those Bills have been dealt with by the Oireachtas, my intention is to introduce, as soon as possible, a more comprehensive Bill covering substantially the same ground as the Landlord and Tenant Bill, 1977 which lapsed with the dissolution of the 20th Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.  As the Deputy will be aware, the demonstrations against the housing of the family have been called off and I am sure that nobody in this House would wish to say anything which might contribute to any renewal of the controversy.  Moreover, as is not unusual when a dispute takes place, the recollection of observers tends to differ according to their evaluation of the merits of the case.  I shall, accordingly confine myself to saying that the Garda report on the events indicates that at no time was the family either shut up in the house or deprived of food because of the demonstration and that, while representatives of the media were unable in some instances to carry out their assignments in regard to the demonstration, whenever they sought Garda protection it was provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I share completely the Minister's view that there should be as little recrimination as possible on an issue like this.  This is not the first time this has happened.  Is it not a fact that on another occasion very brave and courageous people tried to get into the house to feed the children, the women and the man involved and on this occasion, too, when people tried to get in they were intimidated and harassed? The Press and television people were also harassed and intimidated. Most of us were very ashamed to see this on our national television service. Could the Minister say if this was as a result of a decision taken by the Garda or&mdash;it would seem to me to be an unusual thing that they should be so partisan&mdash;or of a decision taken higher up?  In other words was this a political decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no question whatsoever of any political decision. In regard to this problem in Galway&mdash;which I might describe as an unfortunate one&mdash;it was a pity that it <Col N="1186" /> ever happened.  I am sure every Member of this House would wish it had never happened.  I believe that, even with huge numbers of gardaí there, this demonstration was going to take place. The gardaí, finding themselves in difficult circumstances, as they did in Galway, made a very good job of a very delicate and emotional situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Minister's appreciation of garda behaviour in that situation.  However, is it not a fact that the hooliganism displayed by the alleged settled citizens was completely offset by the civilised behaviour of the itinerants?  Would the Minister not agree that had the itinerants behaved with the same lack of control and positive savagery of the so-called settled citizen, they would soon have found themselves in jail?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he considers that Garda stations should be maintained and re-opened where possible in rural towns and villages; and his proposals in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No small rural station has been closed for more than seven years.  In general I am in favour of maintaining a Garda presence in rural areas but I am not in a position to say whether stations will be re-opened in areas where stations were formerly maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the reply indicates that the Minister has changed his views on the subject.  My recollection is that he consistently called for the re-opening of Garda stations in rural areas when in Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second question I want to put to the Minister is: would he not agree, in view of the mounting level of crime in the country now reaching alarming proportions, the re-opening of Garda <Col N="1187" /> stations in rural areas would give some sense of security to people there and, secondly, help to reduce the level of crime or, at least, increase the level of its detection?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know from where the Deputy got his piece of information&mdash;certainly not from me in my reply.  I said no small rural station has been closed for more than seven years.  I said that in general I am in favour of maintaining a Garda presence in rural areas but I am not in a position to say whether stations will be reopened in areas where stations were formerly maintained.  That is the position.  I am as good a believer in having a strong Garda presence throughout the country as any Member of this House could be.  The matter is under review.  I am constant in what I am saying but his party were not while in office.  During the four-and-a-half years of Coalition administration there was only one Garda station opened.  I am giving the matter serious consideration and I will see to it, if possible, that a stronger Garda presence will be provided in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister is missing the point.  I understand that while in Opposition he consistently called for the reopening of stations in rural areas, but is that still his policy? Does he intend to maintain that policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the Deputy that I still believe in that, as I did while in Opposition.  I have not changed.  If there has been a change in tactics it is on the part of the Opposition. I still believe in a strong Garda presence and I am doing something constructive to achieve it.  As quickly as I possibly can, I am increasing the number of men available to the Commissioner for deployment throughout the country.  We have some extra men already but they are being placed in areas where there is the greatest need for them.  When we have the extra men the question of deploying them in rural areas will receive the consideration it deserves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if it is the policy of the Garda Síochána authorities to transfer a Garda officer when promoted from his existing division to a station outside that division; if so, the reasons for such policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, in general, the practice of the Garda authorities has been to transfer members of the force on promotion from the division in which they were serving <Col N="1189" /> to another division.  The Garda authorities have taken the view that the policy of transferring members on promotion is desirable in the interests of the efficiency of the force.</P>
      <P>There has been a particular development in the policy recently whereby, save in very exceptional circumstances, members on promotion to the rank of sergeant are transferred to Border stations for a period of about 18 months.  This development has enabled the practice of sending sergeants for short periods to those stations to be discontinued and has, I understand, been widely accepted as satisfactory.</P>
      <P>I might mention that the Garda Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme has been amended to enable &ldquo;principles governing transfers&rdquo; and some other matters to be discussed at the Garda Conciliation Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that there is some dissatisfaction in the courts at the rule which transfers gardaí on promotion out of their own division, and in the circumstances can the Minister enlighten us as to the reasons for this rule?  I am not talking about temporary promotions in Border areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the system in operation with regard to transferring across the board those promoted to the rank of sergeant is a very fair system.  I do not agree that the system is causing disunity or disharmony in the courts.  It is accepted as being possibly the fairest way in which it could be worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see the reason for the rule.  I know there is some dissatisfaction because it has been mentioned to me by members of the force.  The dissatisfaction appears to stem from the lack of rationale. Apart from temporary situations in Border posts, what is the reason for this rule?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Commissioner has reported that it is the present policy, and has been for a number of years, to transfer members of the force on promotion from divisions in which they had been serving.  The <Col N="1190" /> policy is designed to promote the efficiency of the force, first because it would be undesirable from the disciplinary point of view to have members serving in their former stations, and secondly because members when promoted can operate more effectively in new areas.  There is also the practical aspect that rarely do vacancies occur in the divisions in which newly promoted men are serving.  I accept the Commissioner's view on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if, in view of the statement by the Taoiseach on 9th November, 1972, (details supplied) that section 52 of the Offences against the State Act, 1939, recently reactivated, giving certain powers of interrogation to the Garda is contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights and any person convicted under it would have a right of action before the Court of Human Rights, he will state the steps he proposes to take to amend this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The reactivation of section 52 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, was not the result of a positive decision by the Government that it should be reactivated.  The only decision that has been taken by the Government in relation to legislation in this area is the decision not to renew section 2 of the Emergency Powers Act, 1976.  The non-renewal of section 2 meant that section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, again became operative and that, in turn, meant that section 52, which relates to the questioning of persons arrested under section 30, also can be invoked by the Garda.  This does not necessarily mean that it will be so invoked and the question whether it will be invoked remains to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement by the Taoiseach on 29th November, 1972, to which the question refers was made on the basis of the legal advice that had been given to the Government.  However, during the period of office of the Coalition Government a different view appears to have prevailed and the section was brought into use again early in 1974 <Col N="1191" /> and several persons were convicted under it since then.</P>
    <P>The Government have not yet had an opportunity of fully considering this matter afresh but will do so shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Taoiseach's categorical statement in 1972, and the very grave implications that somebody can be interrogated on being brought in under the Act and of the difficulties of bringing cases before the European Court of Human Rights, would the Minister not agree that this is a question which should be treated as of extreme urgency?  According to the Taoiseach, we are apparently in breach of the Constitution.  This is a serious issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just told the Deputy that the statement made by the Taoiseach on 29th November, 1972, was made on the basis of the legal advice given to the Government at that time.  I also told the Deputy that during the period of the Coalition Government a different view appears to have prevailed and the section was brought into use again early in 1974. The Deputy will agree it is only right that the matter be examined in depth, and this is being done.  When the matter has been examined carefully and properly, the Government will then have an opportunity to decide on the matter.</P>

      <P>Question No. 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I can put down more questions then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to read it out but it is quite a lengthy statement.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>Public Inquiry into Prison Conditions.</P>
      <P>Calls for a public inquiry into conditions in prison relate either to the physical conditions or to the way in which prisoners are treated by prison staff or to both these matters.</P>
      <P>The physical conditions in prisons are matters that can be seen and checked by anybody who walks about the prisons and accordingly the setting up of a public inquiry to establish what they are would be not only unnecessary but clearly inappropriate. Already, newspaper editors and other journalists have seen the physical conditions for themselves and I have invited representatives of the two Opposition parties to visit them.</P>
      <P>The second ground on which a public inquiry is sought is to investigate allegations of brutal treatment of prisoners, either in the sense of their being physically assaulted or in the sense of being subjected to degrading treatment, unjust deprivation of recreation, and so on.  Most people with an interest in prison matters are aware that prisoners have a right&mdash;which they freely exercise&mdash;to complain to the Governor about any matter which they feel justifies a complaint and, over and above that, they have an unrestricted right to complain to an independent visiting committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is, perhaps, not generally appreciated is that, in addition, they can go into court and, subject to the approval of the court, be represented at State expense to have such an allegation investigated on the basis of sworn evidence.  When I say that this can be done at State expense, I mean that the State pays the fees of the solicitor and counsel for the prisoner.  No fewer than 11 prisoners have gone to court in this way in the last 12 months and in every <Col N="1194" /> single case their complaints were refuted by the sworn evidence of prison staff, staff who were open to crossexamination by counsel for the prisoner concerned.  We have, there-fore, reached a stage&mdash;and I record the fact without comment&mdash;where prisoners convicted of serious crime have what in practice seems to be an almost unrestricted right to go back into court at the expense of the tax-payer and, without any risk to themselves, make allegations against prison staff which turn out to be unsustainable. I should mention that the 11 cases I have referred to are only the ones which actually came to a hearing; in fact there were about 20 other such applications to the courts which the courts refused without finding it necessary to call for evidence from the prison authorities.</P>
    <P>I am aware that, for reasons that have not been clearly stated, it has been suggested in some quarters that a court is not a suitable tribunal to establish whether a prisoner has been subjected to ill-treatment or otherwise deprived of his constitutional rights. The suggestion appears to be that the laws of evidence are too strict, though that suggestion is not made when the same prisoners are themselves before the courts on criminal charges.  In fact. the severe restrictions that undoubtedly exist in the laws governing evidence in criminal cases are of little relevance to the kind of legal action which a prisoner takes against the prison authorities since that action is, in form, a <i>habeas corpus</i> action and is in substance nothing less than a judicial inquiry where the facts can be ascertained at least as well as they could be ascertained by any other tribunal. Incidentally, in none of the 11 High Court cases to which I have referred has there been any question of any member of the prison staff refusing to answer questions on the grounds that an answer might tend to incriminate him.</P>
    <P>May I recall to the House that I myself suggested, when in Opposition, that an inquiry would be useful, not because I believed the allegations might be true, which I did not, but as I said at the time, because I was of the <Col N="1195" /> opinion that it would give prison staff an opportunity to defend themselves against what I believed then and still believe to be a campaign of vilification. I was not then aware that many of these allegations had already been dealt with and rejected not only by the relevant visiting committee but also by the High Court after full investigation on the basis of sworn evidence given in open court.</P>
    <P>It is now clear that, although in case after case the prison staff have been vindicated by the High Court, this fact makes no difference to certain groups. Verdicts or findings, whether by the High Court or by any other competent authority, are simply disregarded by groups of that kind and it is quite apparent that even if there were a public inquiry, its findings would be brushed aside by the complainants unless it said the sort of things that those groups wanted it to say.  In the meantime, while the tribunal was sitting, we would have the problem of prison officers being subjected to public character assassination by people against whom there was no effective redress.  In fact there is now no room for doubt that the policy of some of these groups is to subject prison staff to as much mud-slinging and intimidation as possible in the hope that they will be afraid to do their job.</P>
    <P>In saying this, I want to make it quite clear that I accept without question the <i>bona fides</i> not just of Deputy Browne who asked the question but of a number of other persons and groups as well.</P>

This examination will cover, among other matters, the specific question of liability for injury or damage caused by animals trespassing or straying on the public highway.</P>

      <P>The gardaí in Dublin have instructions to pay attention to preparations for bonfires in housing areas, particularly during the weeks preceding occasions such as Hallowe'en. They keep in touch with the local authority cleansing departments, so that the latter can arrange for the removal of any material collected for a bonfire where the circumstances suggest that danger to persons or property might arise from the fire.  The gardaí also pay attention to bonfires that are in progress, including those on sites provided for the purpose by the local authorities.</P>

I am not worried about gardens being destroyed and cars being damaged; they are material things and can be replaced.  What about the lives that are lost throughout the country because of wandering horses?  When will the Minister bring in effective legislation?  Recently in Limerick some of these people were apprehended, brought before the court and fined £3 and the person who respected the court and made an appearance was let off.

Would he not agree that the arguments put forward then in favour of abolishing capital punishment, to the extent that it was abolished, are operative now, that it is a barbarous practice to take somebody's life and that it has not been a deterrent? It has not changed appreciably. The murder rate has not gone up since then.  We were right to get rid of it in 1965.

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he has any plans to introduce family-tribunal-type courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that terms such as &ldquo;family-tribunal-type court&rdquo; can have widely different meanings for different people and, for that reason, it seems preferable that I should not use that terminology in this reply.</P>
      <P>I believe that there is a need to improve various facets of the operation of the courts, particularly in relation to the general area of family law and in relation to young offenders.</P>
      <P>I have already, in reply to a question on 27th October&mdash;volume 300, &mdash;mentioned some of those facets that are being or will as soon as possible be, dealt with directly by my Department either alone or in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, including the important matter of improving court accommodation and dealing with certain reports of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure that have not so far been dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's question, however, is probably mainly related to other matters, such as the introduction of less formal procedures and the examination of where it may be desirable to have, for instance, advisers or assessors associated with a court.  These are matters on which the Government will be getting detailed advice from the Law Reform Commission and I shall also be getting advice from the <Col N="1210" /> Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.</P>
    <P>May I take this opportunity to mention that I have recently made a number of new appointments to the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure to replace members who, because of elevation to the Bench or for some other reason, were no longer able to act in the role for which they were originally appointed and the Committee will accordingly now become active again.  I do not mean that they had been inactive for more than a short period.  On the contrary, they have in the past done much very valuable work and have produced reports with exceptional speed.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission, for their part, have included in paragraph 12 of their First Programme the following:</P>
    <P>In examining the various aspects of family law, the Commission will consider the best type of judicial or court structure or structures appropriate to deal with the different matters which fall under the general heading of family law.</P>
    <P>While, in the context of the particular matters I am now referring to, there could in theory be some risk of overlapping of function between the Law Reform Commission and the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, I am satisfied that in practice the two bodies will have no difficulty in co-ordinating their work and agreement between them will be facilitated by the fact that the president of the commission, Mr. Justice Walsh, is also chairman of the committee.</P>
    <P>I think it right to add that, while I believe that improvements in the areas I have mentioned are both necessary and feasible and while I have the fullest confidence in both the commission and the courts committee not only to produce carefully thought out recommendations but to do so without any avoidable delay, it is nevertheless necessary to bear in mind that the matters being dealt with are complex and that, therefore, changes must take time.</P>

    <Title>European Council Meeting: Statement by Taoiseach.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the House on Wednesday last, in reply to a query from the Leader of Fine Gael, I suggested that the statement made usually after a European Council meeting might be made in conjunction with the introduction of the debate on the Adjournment.  Following contacts with Deputy FitzGerald I decided to depart from precedent and to make a separate statement.  Unfortunately, I was not able to make this statement on Thursday last as I was away all day on official business.  Consequently, this is the first opportunity since to make the statement.</P>
      <P>Before I give the House an account, in detail, of the European Council which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I attended on 5th and 6th December, in Brussels, I should like to say a few words about the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To many people it is a remote institution involved in obscure discussion in distant places.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The Community treaties are as much part of the law of our land now as our own Constitution. Community legislation enters into every aspect of our daily lives&mdash;into the price we pay for our bread and butter, schemes of taxation, how we regulate transport, relations between employer <Col N="1241" /> and employee, the right of firms and individuals to establish in a particular area, and almost all aspects of commercial or political activity.  There is hardly any part of our official or working lives now which is untouched by Community legislation or influence.</P>
    <P>The present Government have supported the idea of Europe embodied in the treaties.  In this, they are carrying out the will of the people of Ireland.  We have indeed good reason for our attitude.  As a Community, Europe can take its place internationally. As the greatest trading block and the second greatest economic power in the world, the Community must be listened to when it speaks on trade or politics.  And Ireland has a place and a voice in these counsels.  As with every other country in the Community, membership gives it a weight and an influence which alone it could never have.  The strength deriving from this unity benefits some countries far more than others.  The fact that these benefits are not reflected in the annual computation of budget credits and deficits should not lead anyone to suppose that they are not relevant.</P>
    <P>I am not by any means arguing that, for us the budget flows are unimportant. Although the budget is less than 1 per cent of the gross national product of the countries of the Community the net inflow to this country is considerable. This year we will probably have a net favourable balance in cash flows running into hundreds of £ millions.</P>
    <P>In addition to this, there are benefits which accrue to every country from the existence of a market of a unity, size and sophistication sufficient to encourage investment and specialisation, on which all economic progress depends.  These benefits are largely unquantified but often they go in large measure to countries which are net contributors to the Community budget.</P>
    <P>I mention all this now because I want to underline the idea that Europe is not simply a matter of arithmetic. Neither is it remote or unreal.  In our legal and economic systems it is as obligatory as the air we breathe&mdash;and perhaps as much taken for granted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1242" /> In Brussels, I stressed the commitment of the Irish Government to Europe, idealistically, politically and economically.  I wanted our belief in the aims of the Treaties and the ideal of European integration to be clearly and widely understood by our colleagues in the Community.</P>
    <P>The last time I attended a formal meeting of heads of state or of Government was in Paris, in October, 1972. Then, as now, the major issues facing the Community were economic and monetary union and the problems of enlargement.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Economic and Monetary Union, I went to Brussels with no great expectation of results. This may, perhaps, account for my surprise at the degree of commitment indicated in the Council discussions to the idea of European union.  The debate was full and positive.  In supporting the concept, I stressed that the move towards union must involve a greater convergence of the economies of the different countries, and, in particular, positive moves to reduce regional imbalances.</P>
    <P>In the early seventies, Ireland's per capita gross domestic product was almost 54 per cent of the Community average.  In 1975, the figure had fallen to 48 per cent.  In 1970, the average income in Hamburg was five times that in the west of Ireland.  By 1975, the Hamburg figure had grown to six times that of the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>If we were outside the Community this comparison would, I have no doubt, have been very much more to Ireland's disadvantage.  But we are not outside the Community; and the figures as they are, without hypothesis and without conjecture support the case for greater attention to one of the fundamental aims of the Community.  I mean the aim expressed so vigorously at the Paris Summit in 1972 of ending disparities between regions.</P>
    <P>This objective requires a new approach not only to budgetary flows but also to the interpretation of industrial and competition policies.  We cannot contemplate a situation where regional funds and policies are allowed to languish while these other regulatory <Col N="1243" /> policies of the Community are applied with vigour and enthusiasm.  I am not arguing against the unity of the market.  I am stressing simply that the rigorous application of policies favouring unduly the central areas of the Community which though they have their troubles, are incomparably better endowed than the peripheral regions.  This contradicts one of the fundamental purposes of the Community. It strikes against any hope of reducing regional imbalances and, therefore, any hope of attaining economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>The Council reached a high degree of consensus on this issue.  They approved as immediate objectives&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  increased co-ordination of economic policies;</P>
    <P>(2)  the strengthening of monetary solidarity;</P>
    <P>(3)  the development of the Communities financial means and:</P>
    <P>(4)  the search for Community solutions to structural problems.</P>
    <P>They approved of the principle of the establishment, on an experimental basis, of a new instrument for Community lending and borrowing with the loans being managed by the European Investment Bank.  Generally these loans are to be used in the fields of energy, industrial reconversion and infrastructure. The problem of monetary compensatory amounts is to be re-examined to see if they can be phased out, on the basis of proposals from the Commission. A move in this direction is to our advantage and is essential to the unity of the market.</P>
    <P>I come now to Article 131.  This is a highly technical area and I do not propose to take up the time of the House with the details.  Briefly, the six original member states will be paying to the Community budget according to their own-resources system, as from January next.  In the transitional period between now and 1980, when the United Kingdom, Denmark and Ireland will also be paying on the own-resources system, Article 131 limits the size of our budgetary contributions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1244" /> In 1977, we will be contributing approximately £24 million.  Next year, we expected to pay £43 million on the interpretation put by the Commission on Article 131.  However, another interpretation would require a contribution of the order of £60-65 million, an increase of approximately 170 per cent on this year's figure.  Obviously an increase of this magnitude would have been completely intolerable.</P>
    <P>After some discussion in the European Council when I emphasised again the opposition in an earlier Council expressed by the Minister for Finance, to the onerous interpretation, we reached a compromise solution on the basis of a proposal I made.</P>
    <P>Under this compromise, each country will pay to the budget a contribution in accordance with the interpretation of Article 131 which is most favourable to it.  This compromise would involve a deficit in the Community budget of approximately 3½ per cent of the total.  This 3½ per cent is, in turn, to be apportioned among the member states according to one or other of four methods&mdash;each State, again, taking whichever method is most favourable to it.</P>
    <P>The net effect of this compromise will be that Ireland's contribution to the Community budget will be approximately £44 million in 1977. Because the budget will now be calculated in the new European unit of account and because we are net beneficiaries, we will gain in payments from certain Community funds.</P>
    <P>We are glad that a solution to this difficult problem has enabled the Community to take the further step in the direction of European integration through the use for budget purposes of the more logical European unit of account.</P>
    <P>At the European Council in Paris in December, 1974 it was agreed that there would be a regional fund of approximately £540 million.  Our share of this fund, over the past three years, came to about £35 million.</P>
    <P>I have already given the House figures indicating growth in the disparity between the richer and poorer <Col N="1245" /> parts of Europe.  This is due, in part, to the inadequacy of the regional fund. There was, in the European Council, agreement as to the need for a real and substantial increase in the amount of the fund.</P>
    <P>In fact, the Council agreed to a fund of about £12 million to be distributed over the three years&mdash;1978, 1979 and 1980 in gradually increasing amounts. So far as we can estimate now our share will come to approximately £24 million in 1978, compared with just under £14 million in the current financial year.  In 1979, we will get about £25 million and in 1980 a figure probably in excess of £26 million.  These contributions will enable industrial and infrastructural projects to go ahead which might otherwise have had to be deferred.  They will increase the country's capacity for investment&mdash;on which employment and progress depend.</P>
    <P>There was also general agreement at the council to an increase of 2 per cent in the French share of the Fund which stood at 15 per cent.  This increase is for the benefit of the French overseas departments.  The 2 per cent is to be deducted from the quotas of the other member States.  This will affect our percentage quota but only marginally.</P>
    <P>Certain other matters, including the question of whether there should be a non-quota part of the fund, remain to be settled by the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>The European Council took note of statements by the member countries on the progress of legislation to enable direct elections to the European Parliament to take place in May/June, 1978. They noted, in particular that all countries except the United Kingdom, were in a position to hold elections at that time.</P>
    <P>The question of emoluments is to be settled, if possible, in discussions between the Parliament and the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>Community policy on Africa and the Middle East was discussed.  We also referred to measures to counter terrorism. As the House knows, this has been the subject of declarations of the European Council in Brussels in July, <Col N="1246" /> 1976, and in the Hague, in November, 1976.  Work is going ahead on police co-operation and officials of the different Governments are examining the possibility of improvements in practical and legislative procedures.  We are fully committed to international co-operation to eradicate this most henious of crimes.  The European Council asked that certain proposals put forward by the President of the French Republic should receive active consideration.  Naturally, any solution must take account of the varying national laws and institutions of the member states.  This is, however, not a subject which can usefully be publicly debated in detail at this stage.</P>
    <P>I do not think that even the greatest friend of the Community could argue that the Community is close to the life of citizens, either politically or culturally. The purpose of the European Foundation proposed in the report by Mr. Tindemans, Prime Minister of Belgium, is to try to remedy this deficiency.  A proposal for the establishment of the foundation was agreed in principle in Brussels.</P>
    <P>On the question of enlargement, the problems of the Mediterranean were emphasised.  I have stressed our welcome for the applicant countries who are part of Europe and share the principles of European democracy.  The real and substantial difficulties in the way of accession should not be minimised but they are obstacles to be overcome&mdash;not insurmountable barriers.</P>
    <P>I said, however, that while we were prepared to assist fully in the solution of these problems.  We should not, as one of the less developed regions of the Community, be asked to contribute disproportionately.  I also said that we owed it to the applicant countries that the Community to which they are seeking accession should be strong and growing, in its purpose, its procedures, its institutions and in its ability to solve the major problems facing it, including the problems of unemployment, regional imbalance and European integration.</P>
    <P>The discussion on the economic and monetary situation was an extremely <Col N="1247" /> interesting and useful part of the general discussion in the Council.  I intend to cover the subject, in so far as it effects us, when I speak on the Adjournment tomorrow.  It has great relevance to our situation.</P>
    <P>I had the opportunity of discussing, in an informal way, developments in Northern Ireland, with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Callaghan.  We took the opportunity of reviewing progress in the political, security and economic areas.  These talks were useful and informative.</P>
    <P>I have had the conclusions issued by the Presidency laid before the House, in accordance with the normal practice.</P>
    <P>Since this is the First European Council I have attended, it may be useful to put certain views on record. Certainly, I was pleasantly surprised by the speed and precision with which we were able to reach conclusions on matters of great complexity.  Essentially, technicalities are more for experts and should not come before Heads of Government.  But come they do&mdash;and the fact that their implications, often of considerable financial or political significance, can be thrashed out and resolved is, I think, a tribute to the Community and the way it works.</P>
    <P>The involvement in European Councils of Heads of Government whose concerns are more often with home affairs brings them into closer contact with the Community.  This merging of matters of home and foreign policy is what the Community is about.  It helps not only the countries of the Community but the Community itself.</P>
    <P>Finally, personal contacts between Heads of Government cannot but be useful.  It is all very well to speak of communication by other methods, but this communication can never have either the relevance or the immediacy of person to person contact.  A great deal can be attained at this level, and in this way, which would be impossible by other means.  I realise the dangers&mdash;that Councils may enervate the Commission which must be a motive force in the Community; that they may act as inter-Governmental <Col N="1248" /> fora, outside the mechanisms of the Treaties: That the expectation that each and every Council should reach momentous decisions must inevitably be disappointed&mdash;reflecting on the credibility of the Community itself; and, finally, that the Councils by acting as courts of appeal from the Council of Ministers can impair the effectiveness of those Councils.</P>
    <P>But we must pay a price for everything. These criticisms are part of the price for a procedure which enables the Heads of Government in Europe to meet regularly and in friendship to discuss matters of concern to their countries and their Community.</P>
    <P>I think we get good value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: I welcome the Taoiseach's statement and I am grateful to him for having reconsidered his original intention of making this statement in connection with the Adjournment Debate.  He has held over to some degree comments on the broad world economic situation arising from the deliberations in the European Council.  This is appropriate because these will fit into the context of the Adjournment Debate, but the matters he has raised here, if they had been left over, would have been submerged in that debate and that would have been regrettable.</P>
      <P>I am glad that a solution was found to the question of our contribution to the Community.  The solution is satisfactory from our point of view and I am glad the Taoiseach put it forward. I wonder, however, whether he could be more explicit on the question of the net effect on us of the solution.  He speaks of hundreds of millions of receipts which we had obtained from the Community and until this formula came up for discussion the figure which has been given for the current year was of the order of £200 million.  He did say that it will be significant, but the House should be told what the net figures are.  We will be paying many millions more; but is it not the case that we will be getting even more than we receive now, thereby more than counter-balancing additional contributions? We are entitled to some estimate of what the net effect will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> I am glad to hear of the approval given to the new instrument for Community lending and borrowing to be managed by the European Investment Bank, but I would like to draw the Taoiseach's attention, if this has not already come up, to the importance of ensuring that this instrument is not used primarily for the benefit of the better-off countries in the hinterland of Europe.  I do not like the sound of these additional moneys being made available for energy, industrial reconversion and infrastructure.  When this proposal was first put forward at the European Council some time ago by the President of the Commission, he seemed to visualise that this would be primarily, as we recommended, directed to the interests of the weaker countries, and the Taoiseach pressed that this would be the case.  I would like to be clear that the Taoiseach on this occasion pressed this issue.  Have we a guarantee that this instrument will be used primarily to benefit the weaker countries.  I wonder whether the Taoiseach raised this issue and whether we can have any clarification or any assurance that the original intention that this figure would be used for the benefit of the weaker countries will be carried out.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the question of the phasing out of the MCAs was discussed. Would the Taoiseach give any indication of how rapidly this would happen?  We know of the difficulties the MCAs create for us because of smuggling arising from this.  Because of this problem it is important that they should be phased out as rapidly as possible.  No indications have been given of what kind of time the Commission is thinking of and this information would be welcomed by us.</P>
    <P>In the case of the regional fund the increase is good, but the scale remains absurd.  Regarding the proportion allocated to Ireland, the Taoiseach has said that our share was reduced only marginally; but it should have been sharply increased.  The share which was negotiated for us, 6½ per cent, was negotiated in conditions of great difficulty because the Commissioner in question putting forward the proposal left me with the impression that he <Col N="1250" /> was influenced by considerations of its impact on the UK, and Scotland particularly. It was because Britain sought an excessive share of the fund that the French felt it necessary to seek an almost similar share; so Germany reduced the fund to half the sum originally proposed by the Commission.</P>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach, did we seek to get an increase in our share on this occasion, and if so what did we seek?  Did the allocation fixed take account of the circumstances in which the original fund was established?  Will the Taoiseach indicate what action was taken on our behalf, when the French were demanding that their share should be increased?  In all the circumstances the assumption was that, if we had lost out the first time because of the circumstances in which the fund was established we would seek to put that right the next time. From what the Taoiseach has said and from press reports it appears that no attempt was made to put right an inadequate Irish share which arose from the way in which the fund was determined on the last occasion.</P>
    <P>Referring to the inadequacy of the scale of transfers to counteract the impact of freeing of trade and make possible the establishment of economic and monetary union, in retrospect it was a mistake for the Community to have agreed to the freeing of trade first without at the same time establishing measures to transfer resources within the Community in order to achieve an equitable balance.  Membership of the Community is a major benefit to us, but nothing like what it should be if the Treaty meant what it said.  It has always seemed to me that the Germans and the Dutch in particular are getting huge benefits from the freeing of trade but are paying only a fraction of this back, because the benefit has never been identified.  These benefits should mean adjustments in the scale of transfers which would compensate the other countries which have not benefited in like manner, and achieve balance within the Community, a balance which does not now exist.  In this connection I ask the Taoiseach to take account of the MacDougall Report, <Col N="1251" /> in whose preparation his own Minister for Economic Planning and Development was involved.  I ask the Taoiseach to take this report seriously and to seek to have it brought before the Council of Ministers and before the European Council for serious discussion. The larger states have got away with murder in this respect.</P>
    <P>We have no quantitative analysis of what would be needed to make a genuine Community at present and what scale of transfers are necessary to create economic and monetary union and we have no figures to show the benefits which some members, amongst them the Germans and the Dutch, secured through free trade and for which they are paying back only a tiny fraction in the form of their contributions to a Community whose total budget is only .7 per cent of that of the gross domestic product of the Community as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke also about enlargement, but I was worried more by what he did not say than by what he did.  The question at issue is not really the one he mentioned: that our contribution should not be disproportionately increased by the membership of other countries.  This does not directly arise.  If other countries join they can contribute to the common funds of the Community.  There is a commitment which we secured in July of last year in a particular formula, a commitment to the expansion and enlargement of the resources of the Community <i>pro rata</i> with the needs of an enlarged Community, an enlargement of resources which would come at least in large measure from the new states themselves.  There could be some net drains on the resources of the remaining countries because these new members are poorer states and we must be willing to contribute our share towards that.  What is vital from our point of view is that the total resources are increased so that inroads are not made in the share of the social fund, the regional fund, the agricultural fund coming to this country as a result of the enlargement of the Community.  In particular we must ensure that in so <Col N="1252" /> far as the common agricultural policy is extended to Mediterranean products this is done by providing additional resources, however reluctant countries like Germany may be to do so, and that it is not achieved by diverting resources that at present go into the common agricultural policies for the benefit of the temperate products which we produce in this country.</P>
    <P>These are the major economic issues of enlargement.  We secured this assurance in principle that the resources would be increased.  I trust the Government will be watching carefully all the plans and discussions in relation to enlargement and will ensure that when the time comes for the first budget related to enlargement, the promise made by the Community will be honoured to the letter in terms of an enlargement of resources so that the existing resources do not have to be spread amongst 12 members instead of nine.</P>
    <P>Another issue which arises in connection with enlargement is a question raised at the Leeds Castle meeting&mdash; the question of ensuring the maintenance of democracy in member states.  At that meeting it was decided to refer to the COREPER the question of how this could be secured.  It is not sufficient to lay down as it is laid down in practice, although not in the actual wording of the Treaty of Rome, that countries seeking to join the Community must be democratic. In raising this matter at the Leeds Castle meeting the British Foreign Secretary was performing a service to us all.  It is important that we be assured that countries in the Community remain democratic.  If any country&mdash;and I am not pointing any fingers because any of our countries could in ten or 20 years' time be vulnerable in terms of the preservation of democracy&mdash;ceased to be democratic, the Community as at present constituted would be faced with a real dilemma.  If it sought to deprive that country of the benefits of membership, there is no juridicial basis for that, and that country could, by withholding its consent to any decision in the Community, destroy the existing Community and hold up all its activities, thereby blackmailing the <Col N="1253" /> Community into tolerating an undemocratic Government.  That is why consideration needs to be given now to the question of an amendment to the Treaty under which, for example, a majority of the member states could refer to the European Court the question whether democracy has ceased to exist in a member state.  A decision of the European Court based on such a reference by a majority of member states could be binding in terms of the exclusion of that country from membership of the Community.  The existence of such a safeguard would help to protect democracy in all member states, the existing member states as well as the new ones.  Something of the kind is required, given the threats to which our democratic system is subject and given the growing tensions that exist in various member states at present, some of which could eventually lead away from the preservation of the democratic system.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of enlargement to which I would like to refer because it raises a broader issue in regard to our position in relation to the Community.  The Taoiseach referred to the commitment on our part to the Community which he endorsed on behalf of his Government as we did on behalf of ours.  Let me say that our strength in the Community hitherto, as a country which is a net beneficiary and which in financial terms is a significant drain on the resources of the Community, has been that we have genuinely worked and fought for progress towards a united Europe and have won the respect of other member states because of that.</P>
    <P>In connection with that we made a second precondition in connection with the enlargement negotiations.  In addition to the precondition about the enlargement of financial resources <i>pro rata</i> with membership we also made a precondition that the conclusion of the negotiations should not take place until and unless the decision-making mechanism of the Community had been significantly improved.  It has already reached a stage where the whole decision-making process has almost <Col N="1254" /> ground to a halt.  If there were to be three new members all abusing the veto even in cases where there is no vital national interest, the existence of the Community could be threatened. That is a precondition laid down by the Irish Government at the conclusion of the enlargement negotiations and I am disturbed that the Taoiseach made no reference to this.  I hope this does not mean that he is wavering in any way from the determination of our Government to ensure that before there is a further enlargement, which could enervate and possibly destroy the capacity of the Community to take decisions under existing procedures&mdash; to ensure that these procedures are improved. What worries me is that when I raised this matter in the House from the Government benches and pointed to the urgent need from our point of view of ensuring that the unanimity practice is not abused in cases where there is no vital national interest, sounds came from the other side of the House casting doubt upon the wisdom of this approach and suggesting that it was in our interest that the veto be retained in all cases.  I can accept at this stage in the development of the Community that there does not yet exist a degree of solidarity amongst member states and the peoples of member states to enable any of us to trust our futures completely, even where vital national interests are at stake, to the goodwill of our fellow members. Therefore for the moment at least the unanimity practice has to remain and other countries feel this way also. There is no point in our trying to change their minds even if we thought it was wise from our point of view.  It must remain where there are vital national interests at stake.</P>
    <P>But the present Community has often ground to a halt for the most trivial reasons, sometimes in relation to matters of procedure and sometimes in relation to matters which involve no more than £100,000.  We made it a precondition of the completion of the enlargement process that this would be changed.  I am sorry the Taoiseach has not referred to this matter and I trust he will retain our position in this respect. The sympathy and respect which <Col N="1255" /> our country has won and holds in the Community derives from the fact that we have continued to work and press for progress in the direction of a more effective Community, in which decisions are taken effectively, and that we have upheld the European view when it was opposed by other countries pursuing nationalist interests.</P>
    <P>Even countries which themselves are not enthusiastic for progress towards European union have accorded to us a certain sympathy and respect because we have held to our view of the importance of progress towards European union.  Even if they disagree with us, they regard us in a curious way as being the better Europeans for holding to this position.  The contrast between this country and the UK in this respect is very marked.  A large part of the unpopularity of the UK in the Community and the difficulty the UK has in securing support for its particular interests from time to time in contrast to the willingness of the Community in many cases to consider our interests, derive from the way in which we have been positive in these matters.  Any weakening of that could not but be to our disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred briefly to the question of direct elections.  In that connection I seem to have read a comment of his recently in relation to the salaries of European parliamentarians suggesting a doubt as to whether it was wise that the salaries should be fixed at a level necessary to attract a German to the European Parliament when such salaries could be so much greater than the highest salaries paid in public life in this country.  If this is the Taoiseach's view it is one which I share.  While I used to think it was desirable that in this first transitional directly elected European Parliament there should be uniformity in this matter, I have come to the conclusion that the need for uniformity is something which could be postponed until we have a parliament elected by a uniform system.  It may well be better for us to consider a system under which the salaries are fixed nationally for this transitional European Parliament. This is a matter on which we need further discussion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1256" /> The Taoiseach referred to the initiative of the President of France and then went on to say that there should be no detailed public debate of this matter at present.  I respectfully dissent on this point.  The history of this matter is of considerable importance to this country.  It was on 13th July, 1976, at the European Council meeting, that this matter came up in the form of a draft declaration on the desirability of a convention amongst the Nine relating to the taking of hostages, although subsequently it was contemplated that this could be widened to include other acts of terrorism.  When that matter was raised at the end of the meeting, I immediately proposed several amendments to the final paragraph, in consultation with the then Taoiseach, and suggested a change in wording to read &ldquo;That member states undertake to prosecute or to extradite those engaged in the taking of hostages&rdquo; and the Ministers for Justice were invited to draw up a legally binding convention among the Nine member states to this effect.</P>
    <P>If my recollection is correct, at a subsequent meeting this matter was discussed again and was widened from the taking of hostages to other acts of terrorism.  On that occasion we reiterated that it was, in our view, essential that any such new convention must include the words &ldquo;to prosecute or to extradite&rdquo;, in contrast to the procedure in the Council of Europe where an extradition treaty was negotiated over our objections and despite the fact that many other countries had been hypocritical in negotiating this treaty as they have shown an unwillingness to extradite people for so-called political offences as we have seen in relation to the Italian-German case, the Dutch-German case and the French-German case, to name but three.  I am leaving aside the French-Spanish case, Spain being outside the EEC.</P>
    <P>We insisted on this change of wording. There was a brief discussion.  The President of France raised some queries on it but agreed to it and it was endorsed at a subsequent meeting. I am concerned that this new proposal by the President of France is <Col N="1257" /> one in respect of which it is clear that it offers the alternative of prosecution or extradition.  If his proposal did not involve this, then I trust that the Taoiseach would have reminded him of the fact that when the earlier issue was raised we insisted upon and secured the agreement of all the heads of Government to this alternative being provided.  I trust, also, that in any further discussions which will take place on this matter, we will maintain that position.  We are in a very strong position because of the agreement of two successive European Councils on this point, despite the attitudes of the same governments in the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>We should not yield any ground on this because the alternative of prosecution at home to extradition is, from our point of view, constitutionally necessary and in my view is in any event desirable and preferable to extradition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy but I have yet to call on Deputy Cluskey and, in accordance with a decision of the House, there are three items to finish before 5 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have spoken slightly longer than the Taoiseach and I will therefore abbreviate my remarks. The only other point I want to raise on the Community as such is to ask the Taoiseach whether the arrangements for the new industrial countries summit, which has been mentioned in the newspapers, were raised at the meeting? Have we taken up the position that the Community must be properly represented, without the humiliations imposed on the President of the Commission at the London Summit and, if we have not done so, can we be assured that the Irish Government will insist on this matter being properly dealt with in accordance with the spirit and letter of the decisions of the European Council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point I want to refer to briefly is Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach referred to his discussions with the British Prime Minister.  He said they were informative; that is more than one can say for his account of these discussions to this House.  I <Col N="1258" /> would like to ask him if he raised either with the heads of Government or the British Prime Minister the question of the representation of Northern Ireland in the European Parliament? The Taoiseach will recall that at the meeting on 12th July, 1976, under pressure from our Government it was agreed that the number of seats to be accorded to larger member states should be increased from 78 to 81 in each case, a total increase of 12 in the European Parliament, so that Northern Ireland could be given an additional seat, the British Government insisting that they could not give an additional seat to Northern Ireland unless they had two further seats to give to other parts of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>That discussion involved all the members of the European Council. The reason for the extra seats being agreed by all heads of Government was to give an extra seat so that the minority in Northern Ireland might be represented.  There are now amendments in the British Parliament which seek either to remove provision for an electoral system that would provide for such representation, or, alternatively, which would seek to reduce the number of seats to two to prevent that representation.</P>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach raised this matter with the British Prime Minister. He could appropriately have raised it with the heads of Government as the proposal in the British Parliament is a departure from an inter-Governmental decision which is of the highest importance to this country.  I trust he will raise this matter with the British Government and the British Opposition who are seeking, perhaps unknowingly, to undermine an international agreement of great importance.</P>
    <P>Did the Taoiseach raise with the British Prime Minister the question of that Government's willingness to put forward proposals to the parties in Northern Ireland which will be directed to meet their aspirations rather than the aspirations of the British Government and, in particular, to meet the aspirations of a number of these parties for a measure of, although an incomplete form of, legislative devolution, as against administrative evolution <Col N="1259" /> which carries all the difficulties of the thorny problem of power-sharing? I hope he took the opportunity to raise this matter with the British Prime Minister because this matter is of considerable and urgent importance if even an interim solution is to be found to the problem of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a final comment on the Taoiseach's reaction to the European Council.  I thought he was too enthusiastic.  Having attended all these bodies I regard them with grave doubt and considerable cynicism. The views expressed and the good resolutions made about working together to improve the economic situation have, without fail, been abandoned by the countries concerned. The discussion on the subjects have been hypocritical and have led to nothing.  It would be unfortunate if the Taoiseach were taken in by some of the things said on these occasions which we know from bitter experience turn out to mean very little when the time comes to implement them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>: I regret to say that I do not find very much cause for satisfaction in the result of the European Council meeting in Brussels last week.  Once again, as has already been implied, this exercise has been revealed as a show-piece where public relations capacity would seem constantly to outstrip its practical relevance to the lives of the people of the European Communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the limited time at my disposal I would like to deal with four major items which were the subjects of the deliberations by the heads of Government last week&mdash;direct elections to the European Parliament, the regional fund, the national contributions to the Community budget, and the re-launching of the concept of Economic and Monetary Union.  The continued reference that the direct elections of the members of the European Parliament will take place in May or June next year in my view does no credit to any of the participants in last week's Council meeting.  We all know that the elections cannot take place at that time and it is now most unlikely that they will be held even <Col N="1260" /> before the spring of 1979 because of the present legislative difficulties in Britain and the likelihood of national elections there next autumn.</P>
    <P>To continue with this reaffirmation of a hopeless wish for elections in the first half of 1978 is wrong and damaging for two reasons.  First, it makes the task of adequate preparation for the elections by the political parties and, indeed, by other interested groups most difficult.  The consequent effect on the likely turn-out at the polls could be disastrous. Secondly, and probably of much more significance, it gives rise to a very serious issue of credibility.  If the date of the first direct elections is dealt with almost annually at the level of the European Council, and with almost transparent double-talk, the prospect of the whole exercise being diminished as an irrelevance by the electorate is very real.</P>
    <P>There must be an early determination of a fixed and very definite date for the holding of direct elections.  This should be done no later than the occasion of the next meeting of the European Council which, I understand, is scheduled for Copenhagen early next year.  The Labour Party take the forthcoming direct elections very seriously. We see in them the first real opportunity for the democratic involvement of all the people of the Communities in the development of the central institutions of the Community.  We believe it is imperative that nothing should lessen the impact and the political significance of this important milestone in European progress.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Council in relation to the European Regional Development Fund can be described only as a further example of how far the Communities have departed from the spirit of the early seventies, when this country then an applicant for membership, was beguiled by the promise of a regional policy designed to tackle real problems in a concrete and effective manner.  The regional fund is now the only vestige of that promised regional policy.  Next year it seems it will contribute to this, the poorest and the least developed region of the Nine, a sum equivalent to 3½ per cent of our <Col N="1261" /> own capital budget.  This almost ludicrous fact gives rise to two very important considerations for us.</P>
    <P>First, we must continue to press for acceptance by the Communities of the need for a genuine and comprehensive regional policy within which the fund, hopefully reformed to favour the regions of real need, or enhanced in terms of resources would operate.  Such a policy should become the cornerstone of Community economic, agricultural and industrial policy, in general, so that no decision of substance could be made for the Community as a whole which had not been given positive clearance in terms of its regional effects.  Equally, the somewhat theoretical exercise whereby Commissioner Giollitti is expected to bring about some form of co-ordination between the various funds&mdash;regional, social and agricultural&mdash;must be strengthened.</P>
    <P>It is also of the utmost importance that the Commission proposal for &ldquo;non quota&rdquo; resources to permit a more flexible application of the regional fund should be approved without delay, and that the so-called community loans should be launched and applied with concrete effects to investments of regional significance.  When we consider the stage we have reached after so many years of debate on regional affairs in Europe, the scale of the Community's failure is manifest.</P>
    <P>The second point I should like to make about the regional fund is of a more direct national relevance.  The application of the meagre funds to be made available under the terms of the European Council decision is a matter which requires very close attention in this House.  It is of the utmost importance that the most effective use is made of this money, that it is used to support projects which will result in a real improvement in the regional balance within the Community, rather than to bolster up the sort of minor projects which should be carried through in the routine evolution of our national programme.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party, while deploring the inadequacy of the regional fund allocations for the next three years, are firmly of the opinion that <Col N="1262" /> £75 million should be used only in the financing of major projects of long-term significance, in areas such as port development or the improvement of transportation and communications within the country.  In this way, we might have something to show for the activity of the fund in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Communities in the area of regional policy gives an added urgency and importance to the question of national regional policy. Our inability over the years&mdash;and under successive Governments&mdash;to produce and implement a viable and effective regional policy is a reflection of our almost total incapacity in the whole area of economic and social planning.  At the political and administrative levels, there has been no real commitment to planning in the true sense, and the pale substitute of programming has proved totally irrelevant to our needs.  We need a plan for the economic and social advance of our less developed regions.  It appears to us that this plan must be devised, financed and implemented by us, without any reliance on the Communities. We believe it is only when we are seen to be genuinely committed ourselves to regional development, and to solidarity between our own people here in Ireland, that we can have any credibility within the councils of the Communities.  Regional policy should have nothing whatsoever of the begging-bowl about it.  Our commitment to regional advance in Ireland should be matched by a Community will to secure a proper balance of regional development as between all member states.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to the question of Ireland's contribution to the funds of the Community budget.  We must accept the responsibilities of membership of the Communities and that includes our financial responsibilities. The application of Article 131 under the terms of the complex agreement arrived at by the European Council will mean an increase of some £20 million in our annual contribution. That fact should be borne in mind when the effects of the decision on the regional fund are being assessed. The outcome of the arithmetic involved <Col N="1263" /> scarcely entitled the Taoiseach to the headlines about successes in Brussels which his PR men obtained for him.  I feel that the analysis contained in Monday's article by the EEC Correspondent of <i>The Irish Times</i> is rather closer to the mark than some of the earlier nonsense about startling diplomatic successes.</P>

      <P>: It is a fact that the greatest financial advantage to this country of membership of the Communities arises through the mechanism of the CAP and through the farm-price system.  All other financial inflows are insignificant by comparison. Our contribution to the budget should be seen in this context&mdash;here I agree with the Taoiseach&mdash;but it must also be seen in the light of the fact that this great national advantage occurs to a group in our society who, by and large, make no direct tax contribution whatsoever to the welfare and development of the State.  Here is that great anomaly and it is one which is within our capacity as a nation to tackle.</P>
      <P>A great deal of attention was given by M. Tindemans and by Mr. Jenkins after the Council to the question of the so-called re-launching of the idea of Economic and Monetary Union. This appears to represent some kind of political victory for the President of the Commission who has been speaking on this theme over the past few months.  He has spelled out his ideas on this matter with some clarity and he has called for a wide and vigorous debate throughout the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had better get that debate launched here this afternoon.  What-ever may be said about the importance of co-ordinating economic policies and reinforcing monetary solidarity, the fundamental issue here is quite simply the total unacceptability of any substantive move in the direction of EMU without a preliminary stage of massive economic development activity designed to equalise the level of economic achievement in the various regions of the Communities.  EMU without real regional, social and structural <Col N="1264" /> policies is quite unthinkable and it would be extremely dangerous for any Irish Government to allow their partners in the Council&mdash;either at European Council or Finance Council level &mdash;to believe that this country could go along with such a development.</P>
    <P>No doubt the agreement reached in connection with the European loans is seen to be a move in the direction of giving EMU a regional aspect.  We in the Labour Party believe that the effectiveness of this new approach will have to be monitored carefully over a considerable period in order to ascertain whether or not it can contribute significantly to the improvement of the regional balance.</P>
    <P>I note that the European Council, in addition to its decision on Community loans, dealt also with a number of other policy instruments intended to progress the re-launching of EMU. These include work on the convergence of market and competition policies, the pursuit of financial solidarity by the use of short and medium term credit policies, and action in areas of structural difficulty such as the steel, textiles and shipbuilding industries.  It is essential that the regional impact of such moves should be most carefully assessed in order to ensure that existing imbalances will not be aggravated.  There is good reason for caution&mdash;if not for suspicion &mdash;in facing up to a range of policy proposals of this nature which are quite capable of exacerbating regional difficulties rather than alleviating them.</P>
    <P>What has emerged, under these four headings, from the European Council deliberations does not add up to a success or to a significant advance, There has been some movement and a number of quite desirable ideas have been given an airing.  But there is still far too little evidence either of a genuine Community spirit or of a political will to advance at a pace commensurate with the great challenges of the present economic situation.</P>
    <P>It is also most disturbing to note that the European Council could not advance beyond the use of weak platitude in its approach to the issue of unemployment.  With six million <Col N="1265" /> people out of work in the Communities &mdash;and 16 million idle in the OECD countries&mdash;the prospects remain discouraging. Present growth projections for the Communities as a whole hold out absolutely no hope of a reduction in unemployment&mdash;indeed they suggest a continuing upward movement.  The urgent preoccupations of the European trade union movement which were expressed at the tripartite conference last June have not been responded to in any adequate fashion. For very many citizens of the Nine the year ahead will be one of deep frustration and increasing bitterness. I believe that we cannot for much longer avoid the very fundamental analysis of the nature and causes of our deep-seated unemployment problem. Only when that analysis is made can there be any hope of finding a lasting solution.</P>
    <P>Finally, the European Council does not appear to have considered the economic situation of the Third World nations worthy of consideration. Given the current nature of the problems of the poorer countries and the continuing delays and frustrations which attend all international approaches to a solution of them, this fact is to be regretted.</P>
    <P>All in all, the outcome of the European Council upon which the Taoiseach has reported must be considered as providing further proof of the inherent weaknesses and problems of the Communities.  We must hope that what positive decisions were made will be fully implemented and that those of us who believe that the only justification of the Communities' existence lies in the active pursuit of progressive policies for the good of all the citizens of all the regions of the Nine will not be discouraged from working together towards that end.  My summing up of the event would be that for the participants it was a failure but, undoubtedly as far as the PRO job on behalf of the Government is concerned, it was a success.</P>

One could have got the impression that there was some lack of commitment by my party, and my Government, to the Treaties of Rome. A story was told about a lady ambassador from an English speaking country, a committed Catholic, who, having presented her credentials to the Pope, had a conversation with His Holiness.  Half-way through the conversation the Pope was heard saying to her : &ldquo;Madam Ambassador, I already am a Catholic.&rdquo;  Deputy FitzGerald need have no apprehension about our commitment to the Treaties of Rome.  In connection with most of the things he mentioned, he was correct in raising them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move :</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1977, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Labour, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main items in this Supplementary Estimate relate to training, that is, an additional £1.2 million for An Comhairle Oiliúna, comprising £1 million for general expenses and £200,000 for capital expenditure; £50,000 additional for the Irish Management Institute; and £60,000 extra for the Council for Education, Recruitment and Training of Hotel and Catering workers.  The January, 1977, budget provided for additional grants to AnCO over and above these shown in the main Estimate for the Department and the amounts now being sought for AnCO relate, in part, to the additional budgetary provision. The grants which AnCO get from the Exchequer are supplemented by moneys from the European Social <Col N="1272" /> Fund.  Grants amounting to £6.9 million have been approved, or are expected to be approved, from the fund in respect of the 1977 operations of AnCO.</P>
    <P>The main item of AnCO expenditure is on their direct training activities which take place in their network of training centres and in training facilities hired from other bodies.  This aspect of the activities of AnCO has been greatly expanded in recent years as has the demand by individual workers for training by AnCO.  The expansion has contributed to a general raising of the level of individual skills to meeting the needs of our expanding industrial base, particularly those of new industry and to providing improved employment opportunities for a growing number of workers.  The resources now sought, together with the corresponding Social Fund grants, provide for a further stage in the increase of direct training facilities. AnCO expect to train 12,500 people in 1977 as compared with 10,000 in 1976.</P>
    <P>The expansion of training is one of the Government's most useful weapons for helping to cope with the unemployment problem.  As AnCO recover up to 50 per cent of the bulk of their training expenditure from the European Social Fund&mdash;this figure incidentally will be increased to 55 per cent from 1st January next&mdash;and as there are off-setting savings to the Exchequer on social welfare benefits, the nett cost to the Exchequer is relatively low.  The skills of the trainees are much enhanced and their employment prospects improved.  In 1976 over 80 per cent of AnCO trainees were placed in employment within six months of completion of training.  I am satisfied, therefore, this additional expenditure in 1977 is well justified.</P>
    <P>The grant to the IMI is being increased from £300,000 to £350,000. The grant to the institute has been held at £300,000 for several years and has represented a steady falling percentage of the institute's income.  I have reviewed the matter recently and decided that, in view of the importance of management training to the development of the economy, some <Col N="1273" /> increase in 1977 is called for.  Recovery from the recent recession and the solution of our employment problems will call for the highest expertise from Irish management.  The institute can make a major contribution to raising management performance.</P>
    <P>As regards CERT, this organisation, which has heretofore concentrated on training for hotel employment, has been extending its activities in relation to training for catering and tourism. The great majority of those who benefit from training organised by CERT are young people.  In view of the improvement in our tourism industry and the good prospects for the future, an additional £60,000 is provided for CERT for 1977.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, both CERT and the IMI also benefit from grants from the European Social Fund.</P>
    <P>Two new subheads provide for grants to the Council for the Status of Women and the Employment Equality Agency.  The Council for the Status of Women is an umbrella organisation, representing 30 women's organisations.  The grant is to be matched by a grant paid by the Commission of the European Communities, which has invited the council to operate an information centre on women's rights in this country.  Similar centres are being established in the other EEC member countries.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Agency was established under the Employment Equality Act, 1977, and came into operation on 1st October, 1977. The agency is concerned, in the public interest, with working towards the elimination of discrimination against women and promoting equality of opportunity between men and women in the employment field.  It will also advise the Government on the working of both the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977, and make recommendations for any amendment of these statutes which it considers necessary. The provision in the Supplementary Estimate is for staff costs and other operating expenses of the agency during the last quarter of this year.</P>
    <P>An additional grant of £10,000 for <Col N="1274" /> the National Industrial Safety Organisation is also provided.  For the last couple of years NISO have been able to meet a good deal of their expenses from certain accumulated reserves which have now been exhausted.  In effect, this grant provides for a return to the normal level of financing of NISO.  I consider it important that the valuable activities of NISO in promoting an awareness of the needs for workplace safety and in encouraging better standards of Industrial safety, health and welfare should not be curtailed.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate indicates that there will be savings on the new subhead for the employment incentive scheme, which was opened in the first Supplementary Estimate for the Vote passed in May last and for which a sum of £3 million was voted. Unfortunately the expectations of the previous administration have not been realised about the extent to which this employment premium scheme would be availed of by employers.  Since the present Government took over, the rate of premiums for school-leavers has been increased from £10 to £14 with effect from 12th September, 1977; and the scheme, which was confined to manufacturing industry and agriculture, has been extended to cover additional employment in construction and services generally.  However, the impact of these decisions on expenditure in 1977 has not yet been great and their main impact is likely to be on 1978 expenditure.  The scheme as so far announced applies to additions to the workforce up to 24th February, 1978, but premiums will be payable in respect of qualified additions for a period of up to 24 weeks from the qualifying date.  It is my intention that this scheme in its extended form would apply to additions to the workforce up to the end of 1978.</P>

      <P>One of the main problems in Irish industry, particularly in our industrial relations, is bad management.  That is not in any way to excuse the behaviour of the trade unions in certain areas or, as in the case of many unofficial disputes, the abandonment of trade unions by their members.  When there is a strike trade unions are blamed but very seldom is the blame put on management.  Yet there are two sides to every story.  As we have heard from the Taoiseach, Ministers and the IDA, in the Ferenka dispute the management were very much at fault.</P>
      <P>It is important that we have proper management training.  The Minister is responsible for industrial relations and I would ask him to take a special interest in training managers in personnel functions and in industrial relations.</P>
      <P>In view of the very limited time at my disposal I shall have to omit part of my prepared notes.  I am sorry to learn that the employment incentive scheme is not living up to expectations. Certainly that is a disappointment in view of the emphasis placed on it by the Government and ourselves in the need for job creation.  As I perceive the problem it is even more serious than has been recognised generally, especially bearing in mind the increasing participation of women in economic activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even bearing in mind the increase to £14 in the youth employment premium scheme it is not a sufficient incentive to overcome the disadvantage of the social welfare stamp.  I would ask the Minister to address himself particularly to this problem&mdash;if it is correct that there should be an effective pay-roll tax on employment.  It is especially penal on labour-intensive industries. If we are serious about job creation we shall have to give thought to some way of ameliorating the employers' social welfare contribution. <Col N="1276" /> Perhaps something on the line of a reducing scale as the number of employees increases could be considered &mdash;perhaps a reduction of 5 per cent in the contribution for every 50 persons employed or something of that nature. To my mind that is the largest factor militating against the effectiveness of the employment incentive scheme and the youth employment premium scheme.  I would hope the Minister could persuade the Minister for Finance to do something about it.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something about the national pay agreement. This is the first opportunity I have had to speak on labour matters in this House, and I avail of the opportunity also to wish the Minister well in his new post and to assure him that, as long as I am convinced he is doing all he can, he will have my uncontroversial support.  I regret to say that, in relation to the Ferenka dispute I did not press the Minister on the issue in the House on the 9th and 10th December.  However, the Minister is new to the job and I shall forget that issue for the moment.  I hope he will be more forthcoming in the House in the future and more active in the area of difficult disputes.  I very much hope a reasonable increase will be achieved with regard to the national pay agreement.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister for Finance has many promises to live up to and that he will have a difficult time meeting even a proportion of them in the forthcoming budget.  But the national interest demands a reasonable pay agreement which I strongly believe would be facilitated by income tax concessions.  It is unfortunate that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development has sought to bring into the area of the national pay agreement domestic rates and abolition of car tax which has nothing whatever to do with it.  Everybody is aware that car tax and rates are gone.  It is a pity that sort of confidence trick could jeopardise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to avail of the few minutes left to me to clarify the position in regard to industrial work here. Following some weeks of public debate at national and local level there is a need to vindicate the rural industrial worker.  Some weeks ago, on the Industrial Development Bill, 1977, I urged the Minister responsible to allocate as many industries as possible to small towns and settlements in rural areas.  That was my tribute to the role of rural industries and their achievements in recent years, especially that of the rural industrial worker.  From experience of my area the siting of further industries in such areas will continue to aid our industrial development. Following the Ferenka disaster and the ensuing public debate on the reasons for its closure or who was to blame, many hints, references and indeed sneers were made.  In fact there was an undercurrent smear campaign questioning the expertise, ability and intelligence of the rural industrial workers. I regret to say that many of those suggestions and inferences came from both sides of the industrial divide, about which I am most concerned.  I believe those remarks and inferences have done an injustice to a very fine body of workers.  On a television programme, I think on Friday week, the editor of a Limerick city paper was interviewed when, to my mind, his only contribution to the solution of the problem at Ferenka was a sneer when he outlined a particular incident that had occurred.  The only contribution he made to the settlement of the industrial dispute was a sneer at the industrial workers of Limerick.  As Shadow Minister for Labour I take strong exception to such remarks.  I <Col N="1278" /> want to put the record straight as regards the industrial workers of my region from my 20 years' experience in local affairs.</P>
    <P>In the mid-West region, as far as the national picture is concerned, the greatest example of industrial development is what has occurred at Shannon Industrial Estate.  Of the 6,000 workers approximately 85 per cent come from rural areas.  Need I place on the record of the House our appreciation of what has taken place at the Shannon complex?  Industries have been created there second to none and their labour relations are to be envied also when contrasted with many other parts of the country.  When we speak of non-nationals and concerns involving workers in new enterprise I should like to place on the record of the House the mining concern in my town employing 600 people.  It has been established now ten years and I am satisfied that, if the Canadians decided to pull out tomorrow, Irish management at Mogul would be well able to continue to carry out the duties entailed in this industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £250,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1977, for retired pay, pensions, compensation, allowances and gratuities payable under sundry statutes to or in respect of members of the Defence Forces and certain other Military Organisations, etc. and for sundry contributions and expenses in connection therewith; for certain extra-statutory children's allowances and for sundry grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main Estimate for Army Pensions for the year 1977 was for a net sum of £13,020,000.  The Supplementary Estimate which I am now introducing <Col N="1279" /> is for an additional sum of £250,000. This Supplementary Estimate comprises £303,000 for pensions plus £103,000 for increased grants in respect of free travel, electricity and television licences offset by increased appropriations-in-aid of £22,000 and savings of £134,000.  Of the net amount being provided for in this Supplementary Estimate, a sum of £225,000 is required to meet a portion, 3½ per cent, of the general increase in pensions in 1977 for which provision was not made in the original Estimate.</P>
    <P>Under subhead D&mdash;Military Service Pensions&mdash;the additional sum of £54,000 is due to the increased cost of these pensions and to the fact that the savings in respect of deaths are less than was anticipated.</P>
    <P>Under subhead E&mdash;Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes 1937 to 1977&mdash;an additional sum of £249,000 is required to meet the cost of pensions and gratuities of former members of the Permanent Defence Force.  The need for this additional provision was due to the increase in pensions for which provision was not made in the original Estimate and to underestimation in respect of gratuities for non-commissioned officers and privates on discharge.</P>
    <P>Under subhead M&mdash;Grants in respect of the provision of free travel, electricity and television licences to certain veterans of the War of Independence and so forth&mdash;an additional sum of £103,000 is required to meet the increased costs since March, 1977 of the free travel scheme.</P>
    <P>Subhead O&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid &mdash;£22,000.  The increased contributions by officers of the Permanent Defence Force towards the contributory pensions scheme for widows and children are due to increases in the rates of pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the Supplementary Estimate.  Would it not be possible to open up again applications <Col N="1280" /> for Old IRA pensions?  There must be very few such people left.  In our respective constituencies there are people who feel aggrieved that they were not granted Old IRA pensions. The last date for application for such pensions has long since gone and I wonder if the Minister would consider opening the scheme for the few people left who genuinely gave service and who for one reason or another were late in applying.</P>
      <P>I should like to comment on the means test for Old IRA special allowances. It is a very niggardly means test.  Unfortunately, it has come to our notice that many people in receipt of such allowances, particularly widows of deceased pensioners, were in receipt of portion of their late husbands' pensions and are subject to income tax. I can bring to the Minister's notice shocking cases where income tax was deducted from these miserly allowances. Because of the means test, one must be virtually destitute before qualifying.</P>
      <P>On the question of free travel, I presume the same kind of means test applies as to social welfare categories and that the same procedure of having one's official photograph taken by CIE applies.  To my mind this is a most degrading system which has caused much humiliation, embarrassment and distress and I ask the Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Social Welfare, to devise a more appropriate method so that if photographs are required they can be taken without causing hardship and humiliation.  The Minister will appreciate that the old people concerned are veterans of the War of Independence and that many of them are maimed and blind.  However, they are expected to travel long distances to CIE depots to have their photographs taken.</P>

      <P>I thank the House for agreeing to the Supplementary Estimate and I will refer briefly to the points made by Deputy Treacy.  I am sure he is aware that the Government in 1955 made a decision in regard to applications for Old IRA pensions.  I do not think it would be practicable to open up this <Col N="1281" /> scheme some 20 years later.  I do not know if he was serious in making that suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

The Deputy referred to this test but he did not make any reference to a specific aspect of it.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The allowance was introduced to meet the needs of holders of the 1917-21, or earlier, medal who are in difficult financial circumstances and unable to provide for themselves. If additional moneys are to be allocated for this purpose it would be better to increase the amount for those who qualify rather than to make any major changes in the method of assessing means.  I would agree to an easement if it were possible but it is best to ensure that the money is devoted to those in greatest need, and the means test at least ensures that.</P>
      <P>The application of the income tax to widows' incomes would not apply in the case of special allowances, as widows of the recipients of special allowances do not qualify for a widow's allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 340 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, the following are exempt from tax: all wound and disability pensions under the Army Pensions Acts; allowances granted to dependants of persons killed in the 1916 Rising; dependants of signatories <Col N="1282" /> of the Proclamation of 1916; dependants of Michael O'Callaghan, George Clancy, Terence MacSwiney and Arthur Griffith.  Those are the various exemptions.  Military service pensions and other allowances, including allowances payable to widows of military service pensioners, and special allowances are reckonable as income for tax purposes.  That has been the position since 1967.</P>
    <P>The question was raised about hardship in connection with photographs imposed on persons who qualify for free travel.  I will certainly have the matter examined to see if the procedures are as humane as they should be.  If there is any question of hardship or distress I would be most anxious to ensure that that would be eliminated and new procedures adopted.  I assure the Deputy I will have the matter examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">

      <P>A sum of £44,000 is being provided to meet the increased cost of salaries, wages and allowances arising from pay increases granted under the national wages agreement and the creation of a separate Department of Fisheries&mdash; subhead A.1.</P>

      <P>Killybegs and Castletownbere fishery harbours are managed and controlled by my Department under the Fishery Harbour Centres Act, 1968. The present rates of harbour dues and other charges at these centres have been in operation for many years and the receipts therefrom are grossly inadequate to meet expenditure on salaries and maintenance charges at these two centres.  As a result the cost of operation of these two harbour centres has to be subsidised.  It is proposed to bring the present charges more into line with modern trends but, pending introduction of the new charges, an increase of £13,000 is required in the subsidy in the current year.  This subsidy is met from subhead C.4.</P>
      <P>An additional sum of £785,000 is being provided in the Grant-in-Aid of administration and current development, to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, adding up to a total grant for the year of £2,575,000&mdash;subhead D.1. Part of the additional sum is provided in order to enable the board to expand its development activities.  The balance is required mainly to meet a shortfall in the grant-in-aid in 1976 and a deficiency in the anticipated receipts from the board's boatbuilding operations in the current year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I just hope we can meet our target for 1979, namely, doubling our catch in the three years allocated in October, 1976.  I have grave doubts that we can do so and I wish the Minister success in his endeavours. However, I would like to see a more dynamic approach.  I have here a report from the Irish Federation of Marine Industries and in it they say:</P>
      <P>The Federation strongly holds the view that even if a common fisheries policy was agreed tomorrow with clear and substantial advantage to our fishing industry that, due to the backward state of the industry, we would be unable to capitalise on the situation.</P>
      <P>This is an indictment of the lack of development in the industry in bygone years and I would like the Minister to tell us how we are doing with regard to the plan for doubling our catch by 1979.  Are we on course or are we falling back?  I believe we are falling back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First and foremost, the ban on herring fishing around our coast, particularly in the Celtic Sea, must result in a serious drop in the catching power of the fishing fleet.  I agree the ban is essential.  Not only that, but I believe it came far too late.  It was a case of closing the stable door after the horse had bolted because herring stocks had <Col N="1285" /> been fished out completely when the ban was imposed.  Had proper conservation been adopted ten or 15 years ago there would be no need now for such a total prohibition on herring fishing in the Celtic Sea.  That is not the fault of the present Government or of the former Government.  It may not be the fault of any Government because it is a fact that fishermen are naturally greedy and they and their foreign counterparts overfished areas which should have been left untouched when they were occupied by spawning fish.  I find it difficult to understand how the plan can reach fruition and I should like an explanation from the Minister on the matter.  Apart from the Celtic Sea a ban was also imposed in other areas.  The total catch must be down because of these prohibitions.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, we gained a tremendous lot of ground by the interim unilateral measures which we took earlier this year.  They resulted in a major increase in the catches of white fish around the coast and they will help in some way to achieve our target.  Unfortunately, these measures lasted for too short a time&mdash;I think it was only four months.  Had those measures been allowed to continue we could have easily achieved our goal.</P>
    <P>I believe we will have a ruling tomorrow by the European Court on our case.  I have spoken previously&mdash;and not too kindly&mdash;regarding the Minister's attitude, but that is water under the bridge.  We will have the decision tomorrow and it looks as if the case will go against us.  It would be a tremendous boon to the fishing industry and its development if the decision of the court were in our favour.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to do with the expansion of our fishing industry.  The only way we can get this expansion is by keeping foreign trawlers far away from our coast.  The unilateral measures did that and since these measures have been eliminated the white fish catches have decreased considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> There has been a serious development in recent days regarding the supply of fish in this country.  We have seen a large-scale importation of fish from Iceland and this shows just how serious the position is at home.  I believe that last night an Icelandic boat landed a cargo of fish in New Ross, County Wexford, and this afternoon another Icelandic boat landed a cargo in Drogheda, County Louth.  For Ireland to be importing fish on such a scale seems like bringing coals to Newcastle.  It is a sad state of affairs when the fleet here cannot sustain the limited number of processing industries we have.  My information today is that we are importing fish from Iceland on a large scale.  It shows the value of the unilateral measures taken by the Icelandic Government in that they have huge quantities of surplus fish to sell all over the Continent and here in Ireland, which should naturally be a fish exporting country.</P>
    <P>While it is a sad state of affairs, it strengthens our case in demanding an exclusive 50-mile zone because it means that, because of the rate of catching by the continentals close to our coast, our stocks are seriously depleted.  The fishing industry is taking a hammering and instead of the expansion which we were given the right to achieve in October, 1976, we are actually experiencing a diminution of our catch.  This strengthens our case for demanding that exclusive zone.</P>
    <P>From my observations of the fishing industry, I have the distinct feeling that our fishermen are not adequately trained.  If we are to reach our targets in expansion we must have fully qualified men manning the boats around our shores.  Two weeks ago I visited the National Fisheries School in Greencastle. It is the only school for training young fishermen and for training potential skippers to the level where they can get their ticket.  The deckhands were in good numbers and there was a full complement of 30 in the class, but it was sad to see that there were only two people taking the skippers course and there is accommodation for 30.  It would appear that our fishermen and potential skippers do <Col N="1287" /> not think it worth their while to learn some of the finer points of their profession by taking the eight-week course at this school.  If we are to be considered as a fishing nation of some importance, schools like this should be packed and there should be waiting lists of young men trying to get in. We should have five or six such schools around our coast.  I believe that in Japan and Norway they have large numbers of training schools and even universities for training people in fishery techniques.  I would ask the Minister to consider the expansion of our training schools and to consider how best we might encourage fishermen to train to the best advantage. Obviously this is not being done at the moment with regard to the course for skippers.</P>
    <P>Our methods of fishing at times can be detrimental to the industry.  As I said, it is a natural instinct to be greedy and we are not any more so than others.  I have noticed a tendency among fishermen to try to make the fast £ and to damage their long term future by doing so.  We have seen this very much in recent years with regard to salmon stocks where there has been a vast amount of overfishing, especially drift netting at sea.  It will have to be curtailed.</P>
    <P>Another development which has been brought to my notice is the practice of using what is known as a purse seine in catching fish.  I believe that purse seining is a very deadly method of fishing and it has been banned in most countries, particularly in Norway. It has made an advent in this country and traditional fishermen are very worried that it may spread.  It involves a large degree of unfair competition in that the catches taken are quite huge and stocks cannot stand up to extensive fishing through this method.  I would ask the Minister to examine it and consider whether it is in the interests of our fishing industry. No doubt it will lead to tremendous catches in the short term but will our stocks be depleted in the long run?</P>
    <P>I referred to our salmon fishing industry. It must be seriously examined. We, as politicians, have been largely <Col N="1288" /> to blame in recent years for allowing far too much scope for over-fishing, especially drift netting at sea, and illegal fishing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister state recently that he intends to bring in legislation to provide for a new form of boards of conservation. This is to be welcomed.  The salmon industry will come to an end if the present system is allowed to continue. I have the greatest regard for people who serve on boards of conservators. They do so at their own expense in most cases.  They spend many hours away from home and get very little thanks.  Their efforts are largely unrewarded because of lack of finance. I would like to see the State providing much more money so that the new boards can eliminate the damage that is being done to the industry at the moment.  At present boards of conservators have neither the manpower nor the equipment to stop the poaching that is going on.  Almost daily we read in the newspapers every salmon season about waterkeepers being assaulted and intimidated and about wholesale drift-netting off the west coast.  It seems to go on unabated and people get away without being prosecuted. This is probably due to the lack of funds and equipment at the disposal of the boards of conservators.</P>
      <P>Our salmon industry could be a thriving industry if it were properly controlled.  I do not believe that too many licences are being issued at the moment.  I believe the licences are in order.  It is the amount of illegal fishing by people who have not got licences and the use of illegal nets by people who have got licences that is doing the damage&mdash;that coupled with poaching and pollution.  I look forward to the implementation of the new legislation to curtail those illegal activities.  The Minister can rest assured that he will get every assistance from this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The former Parliamentary Secretary in charge of Fisheries, Deputy Murphy, has been slated at times for having issued too many licences.  I believe he <Col N="1289" /> adopted a very humane approach.  The salmon fishing industry can survive with the amount of licences available at the moment if they are properly looked after and properly supervised.</P>
    <P>During the past ten years it seems to have been a policy of the Department of Fisheries to develop a small number of large harbours.  There is one such harbour in Dunmore East, County Waterford, and I believe Castletownbere was also developed on a very large scale.  Those developments are now complete.  The Department of Fisheries should embark on a scheme to provide a number of smaller harbours in key areas.  If we are to get the type of expansion we are looking for in our fishing industry we must allow more boats to put to sea and more men to fish.  At the moment tens of thousands of people around the coast would fish on a fulltime basis if they had the opportunity to do so.  The harbours which they use are only fit for taking boats in and out in the summertime. They are not allweather harbours.</P>
    <P>The Minister should bring in a rational programme so that every man who wishes to go to sea on a fulltime basis is afforded the opportunity.  I have seen frustration among part time fishermen who see what is being made by people fishing out of the large ports. They have not got an equal opportunity.  I would like to see a programme drawn up to provide safe harbours, not necessarily huge modern ones such as we have at Dunmore East, but harbours with the bare facilities.  Thousands more people could come into the industry if such a programme were introduced.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister any intention of promoting mariculture around our coasts?  It has become obvious in recent years that there is a great future for mariculture.  I believe the Russians plan to provide the bulk of their fish needs by 1990 through the use of mariculture. When one considers the extent of the Soviet Union one realises that they must have some vast undertakings in mind.  Have any officials of the Department been studying the methods adopted by the Russians or by the Norwegians?  I believe the Norwegians are very skilled in this type <Col N="1290" /> of activity.  They supplied Europe and Great Britain with large quantities of salmon during the past season through the medium of mariculture.</P>
    <P>There is no place better suited in western Europe than Ireland for such an undertaking.  The west coast with its huge harbours and inlets is a natural centre for that type of operation. We have obviously lagged behind.  While it is not possible to rear every species of fish by this method the most valuable can be reared, such as salmon, trout, lobster and other forms of shellfish.  We should develop this industry to the full.  I wish the Minister the best of luck in achieving the target we have put before us in doubling our 1975 catch by 1979.  I do not believe we are going the right way about it.  We will have to be far more dynamic and energetic in our approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is of necessity a limited debate.  A time limit applies and the limitation applies in respect of scope to deal effectively with the fisheries policy.  The Supplementary Estimate before the House deals with very few matters.  Mainly it deals with providing for essential moneys to meet increased costs in salaries and wages. There is, unfortunately, nothing in the Supplementary Estimate of a meaty kind dealing with the real problems of the industry&mdash;the need to expand and the need to preserve stocks.</P>
      <P>Some additional moneys are being provided for An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for wages and salaries and also for current development to enable the board to expand their activities.  I would like the Minister's assurance that the £2,575,000 being provided is sufficient to bring back some semblance of security to all those employed with BIM, especially those in the boatyards under the board.  I hope the Minister can assure us that he has provided sufficient money to ensure continuity of employment for all the men employed in those boatyards and that there is sufficient work for them in building new boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Widespread concern was displayed by the board and their members recently&mdash;graphically demonstrated by <Col N="1291" /> public protest, especially in Cork&mdash; about possible redundancy, the fall-off in orders for the building of boats and, by and large, the feeling of depression regarding the overall future for the industry.  This concerns such fundamental matters as the provision of a proper fishing zone, which is agreed by all to be a minimum of 50 miles, and in addition other important factors in respect of a policy for the expansion and preservation of fisheries.  I trust that the anxiety being experienced by all those employed by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara will be laid by the provision of this Supplementary Estimate and that the future will look brighter for them.  In recent months there has been an obvious lack of confidence in regard to the future on the part of all those employed by the board.</P>
    <P>I notice that grants of £69,000 have been approved by the EEC in respect of a number of fishery harbours.  I would be grateful if the Minister would elaborate on that item and indicate where the moneys are likely to be spent.  Also, he might tell us what future development can be envisaged in terms of grants being made available by the EEC for the improvement of harbour facilities.  I agree fully with the previous speaker in respect of the need for the improvement of our harbours.  Apart from the prospects of much greater catches we envisage the Minister implementing a policy which will provide facilities for the processing at Irish ports of large quantities of the fish caught in Irish waters.  In other words, we look forward to the establishment of fish processing plants and ice plants with all modern amenities. Development of this kind will provide extra employment for our people at home but proper harbour facilities are a prerequisite to development of that kind.</P>
    <P>The estimate deals largely with the provision of money for expenses such as salaries and wages.  In this regard I note that there is a sum of £44,000 to meet the increased cost of salaries, wages and allowances arising from pay increases granted under the national pay agreement.  There is a further excess <Col N="1292" /> of expenditure of £40,000 which arises in respect of travelling expenses and is due mainly to the increased volume of travelling in connection with EEC matters.  The House and the people generally would no doubt like the Minister to avail of this opportunity to tell us what progress, if any, was made during his talks last weekend in Brussels.  What is the present position regarding Ireland's essential claims?  I trust that he will tell us, too, whether all this travelling in which he has been engaging for so long will continue while the situation remains that, despite all his trips to Brussels, Strasbourg, Bonn and so on, nothing tangible is resulting either for the fishermen or for the industry generally.  Or is it the position that effective control of our fisheries is receding fast from us, that all the major decisions are being made in Brussels and that the sovereign right of this Parliament to control the destiny of the nation and, in particular, of the very important fishing industry, is almost gone and gone effectively in respect of fundamental matters?  The matters we are talking about here are of a minor nature. Apart from aid to Killybegs and Castletownbere ports and some essential aid to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara there is nothing in this Supplementary Estimate that touches the fundamentals or the real issues affecting the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Is it the position that our rich fishing territory is about to be virtually confiscated by our EEC partners and that we are almost helpless in dealing with that situation, that, in particular, we are defenceless in regard to asserting our right to a 50-mile exclusive zone. Hopefully, the Minister will be able to report to us, limited as the time is for this debate, on these questions.</P>
    <P>In order to give the Minister adequate time to reply I intend concluding shortly.  He will then have an opportunity of touching on the essential matters with which we are concerned primarily.</P>
    <P>It is not my wish to suggest that the Minister is a prisoner of his eight European colleagues, caught up in some form of straitjacket from which he would not appear to be able to extricate <Col N="1293" /> himself on the important issues of the 50-mile exclusive zone and a proper preservation and expansion policy for the industry.  We should like to hear when decisions on these matters are likely to be reached.  I am prepared to prophesy that before not too long we shall witness a shameful sell-out on the fundamental issue of a 50-mile exclusive zone.</P>

      <P>I take the point but I considered myself entitled to ask the Minister to comment on what transpired in Brussels arising out of that part of the Supplementary Estimate which provides for additional moneys for travelling expenses especially in connection with EEC matters.  Presumably, the Minister travels to Brussels and to other parts of Europe and of the world primarily and essentially in respect of fishery matters.  It is not my intention to find a way around the matter but after this week the Dáil will not resume business for several weeks.  In the meantime the nation is entitled to know, now that a suitable opportunity has presented itself for informing them, what is happening in respect of fisheries.  I am inviting the Minister to comment on the questions I have raised and to tell us what hopes he may have for a better deal for Ireland in respect of all matters relating to fisheries, with particular reference to the achievement of nothing less than a 50-mile exclusive zone.</P>

      <P>To deal with the last issue first&mdash; although it is not quite pertinent to this very modest Supplementary Estimate that is designed to tide over fisheries in the financial sense to the end of the financial year&mdash;the fisheries talks taking place with our Community partners, are still in a negotiating position.  When in a negotiating position one does not spell out in detail the various nuances, tactics and developments that arise in the course of negotiation.  I have made <Col N="1294" /> our position prefectly clear.  We are seeking with our partners to arrive at a Community solution.  It must be remembered that as far as Ireland and every other member state are concerned, it is important to seek to achieve a Community solution.</P>
      <P>The Irish people by referenda in 1972 decided that issue for us and we have derived substantial benefits from our membership of the EEC since 1st January, 1973.  It is a futile exercise to suggest that we can make declarations on our own in this area or in any other area.  In this area we must participate with our Community partners in seeking to achieve a legitimate solution. We can and have argued our case strongly, but we must seek to achieve agreement.  I do not propose to go into any of the nuances of the negotiations as they stand at present except to say that as of now seven of the nine Community countries do not agree with two Community countries, Great Britain and Ireland, who, in their different ways seek a form of exclusive zone.  Our case differs from the British case in many ways.  We have differing interests, but on the issue of having a form of exclusive zone both Britain and Ireland agree.  I have made the position clear and until the negotiations resume in January that will be the position.  It is very difficult to see a way out of a situation like that and that is why last year interim negotiations for 1977 had to be the order of the day, in order to prevent a free-for-all. This year that may again be the position.  We may have to have interim arrangements based on quotas to prevent a free-for-all situation and to have some form of regime in the absence of agreement between all nine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Treacy raised the question of the boatyards and the sufficiency of work.  In regard to the boatyards the position has improved substantially since the introduction of the recent terms in respect of the purchase of boats.  As the House is aware, I announced these improved terms some weeks ago and the result of these&mdash; the reduction in the deposit from 10 per cent to 5 per cent in the case of boats between 66 feet and 90 feet, the extension of the repayments period <Col N="1295" /> from eight to twelve years, linked with the new repair grant of 50 per cent towards the cost of the conversion of boats to new methods of fishing allied to the existing 25 per cent grant in respect of new boats, embodied in the new scheme&mdash;is a new impetus in regard to orders.  Orders are now coming into the boatyards, orders that will sustain Baltimore and Killybegs during 1978 and hopefully orders coming into Dingle will also sustain that yard.  That is limited good news that I am glad to be able to give the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy raised a point with which I agree, but which was contrary to the point made by Deputy Deasy, that processing needs to be sustained. Shore employment is of tremendous importance as regards the building of the fishing industry.  Shore employment runs at six to one properly developed compared to boat employment, especially with the increased mechanisation and automation of modern boats. I see no objection to developing shore employment based on landings by boats from outside this country.  That is a healthy development.  As regards the Icelandic landings in New Ross for processing there, that have been referred to, they will be for re-export into Britain and other parts of the Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

      <P>The Deputy is taking a negative view.  I agree with Deputy Treacy's view that one must be positive in this respect.  In any regime in the future I would like to see the ideal situation as one where we would license outside boats to land here for processing and re-export.  That surely would be a healthy development in the employment sense.  Indeed, the Congress of Irish Trade Unions intimated this view to me through the Irish Transport Union, which is the main union catering for deck hands working on fishing boats.</P>

      <P>The Icelandic vessels referred to by Deputy Deasy are not being allowed to land in the UK but are landing in New Ross for processing and for re-exporting to the UK and France and are giving employment there.  I see nothing wrong with that type of development.  In any fishing plants or licensing arrangements we may have here in the future I see such arrangements being part of the fishing scene, a scene where we specifically license boats from outside countries to land here for shore employment purposes.  That is an excellent arrangement to run side by side with the development of the Irish fishing fleet.  There is no contradiction between the two provided we develop the processing part to a sufficient extent to absorb such landings in that way. The Irish fishermen agree with me in this respect.</P>

      <P>Deputy Treacy referred to the question of the EEC grants to harbours.  The situation, I am glad to say, is that these grants have been approved or are in the course of approval at the rate of 25 per cent to harbours other than the major harbours.  This point was also made by Deputy Deasy.  I will name the harbours concerned by way of illustration: Ballyglass in County Mayo, Portmagee and Cahirciveen in County Kerry, Quilty in County Clare and Greencastle and Clogherhead in Donegal and Louth.  These grants are being made available by the EEC towards harbour development in smaller landing areas outside the major harbour development which is being financed entirely by capital resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deasy made a very constructive speech on opening the debate on <Col N="1297" /> the Estimate.  I appreciate very much his view that the emphasis must be on conservation.  This is an area which has been neglected, certainly in recent years, an area in which no attempt has been made to grapple with this very vital problem affecting the fisheries&mdash;and this is not just in Ireland but on a global basis.  It is not just Ireland that has been neglectful; bigger countries than Ireland have been equally neglectful, as witness the total ban than exists this year and will exist next year on herring fishing in the North Sea, which was once one of the great herring fishing areas of the world.  The North European and East European countries have fished that sea out of herring and it has to be rehabilitated.  We have a similar problem in the Celtic Sea adjacent to Deputy Deasy's constituency, where because of overfishing and the threatened extermination of the herring stocks, we have a ban operating off the south-east coast in the Celtic Sea and we will continue to operate that ban.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Deasy suggests, these conservation measures and this ban will of course affect the total catch, and our total catch figures cannot be as high as anticipated two years ago in the Hague Agreement.  The total catch figure cannot be as high as that because of the herring fishing bans operating in an absolute way in the Celtic Sea and in a very limited way around other areas of the coast on the west and north-west.  This applies to Britain and to Western Europe generally. However, that should not worry the House or anybody concerned with the development of the Irish fishing industry, because in a situation like this conservation must come first.  It is a case where one must forget about targets and plans, get down to the first essentials and get priorities right.  There is no point in having paper plans for this industry or projections or targets if there are no fish there at the end of the day.  It is as realistic and as brutal as that: unless we give priority to conservation there is not much point in talking about planning further industries because you would be planning on paper with no industry.</P>
    <P>It is not merely an Irish problem <Col N="1298" /> or a Community problem; it is tending to be a world problem.  It is a particular problem for the North Atlantic generally and for the European Community in particular.  If we cannot face up to this challenge of conservation of our fish resources it will be a very sad reflection on a Community who have come together for the purpose of co-ordination in the common interest. Here is a basic challenge facing the Community to conserve fish stocks, which are a basic food resource and therefore very important.  Fish will be a source of protein for the 300 million people shortly to be within the Community. If we fail to grasp this challenge and have an ordered regime within Community waters for the supply of this basic food resource, the Community will have failed in a very essential and important aspect of aspect of what Community is supposed to be about.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy, in referring to conservation, omitted to mention what is in my view the most important aspect &mdash;helping to rehabilitate fish stocks.  It is not the small matter of the unilateral measures taken by the last Government, which went on for a few months and have now been proved wrong as far as the European Court is concerned&mdash;that will probably be finalised tomorrow when there will be a court hearing.  The important decision was the Community decision taken on 1st January of this year to have the 200-mile limit enforced against all foreign countries.  That has kept the leading fishing countries out of malpractices, out of Community waters. These are the Russian, East European and the Japanese boats who were scooping up the fish&mdash;irrespective of size&mdash;for factory processing purposes, for industrial purposes and purposes other than human consumption.  That has stopped and this has had a very good effect on the fishing, despite the comments about the fishing industry and how it is going.  We have had a very good year this year off the north-west and west coast, and the south-west coast to some extent, in both herring and mackerel.  There has been a very real revival in mackerel fishing right around the coast of Ireland, <Col N="1299" /> south-west to north-west.  That is directly attributable to the fact that mackerel are now flowing into our shores, whereas they were being scooped out by the Russians and Eastern European ships until they were excluded on 1st January this year. That is a very important Community measure which is having a very positive effect now.</P>
    <P>The other points made by Deputy Deasy concerned the training scheme. I agree with him.  I am not satisfied about the training scheme.  I hope to be able to make an announcement very shortly on a reorganised training scheme with, as he suggests, training and education facilities for fishermen around the coast at centres other than Greencastle.  I hope in the New Year to announce the details.  I agree with his criticism of the lack of skipper participation as against fisherman-trainee participation.</P>
    <P>I agree also with Deputy Deasy that the real problem in relation to salmon fishing does not arise in regard to the inadequacy of the law or of regulations, although they can and will be improved in the course of new legislation and regulations which I will be introducing in the House in the New Year.  The main problem is the blatant illegal fishing that is going on under the existing law.  I propose to have the Navy in to assist the various fishery officers already employed by boards of conservators to ensure that there is an effective service when the new salmon season starts.  Enforcement is the answer here, very strict enforcement in the early days of a new salmon season to warn people that we will not tolerate the extermination of the salmon stocks and that action is being taken and will be seen to be taken.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy raised the question of mariculture, and that is an aspect which will be dealt with in legislation in the New Year.  Progress has been made now in a fairly substantial way by the ESB and Messrs.  Guinness Ltd. In two separate areas in the West of Ireland substantial progress has been made in the artificial rearing of salmon. There are cages at sea in which the salmon run is being simulated and <Col N="1300" /> a product is now being developed which is, we think, as good as natural salmon.  This is a tremendous development and breakthrough.  One of the difficulties at the moment is that there is at present no legal basis for mariculture in Ireland, which is a very serious inadequacy.</P>
    <P>In other words, you can invest millions of pounds but you have not title to the salmon reared in this manner at sea.  The new legislation I referred to will provide the framework for the development and investment that is required in this area.  It is evident that our coast and climate, particularly our western coast, present the ideal environment for trout and salmon rearing.  If the job can be done by artificial means in a natural environment we will be able to tap huge resources.  The Norwegians and the Japanese have experimented a great deal in this field.  The ESB and Arthur Guinness &amp; Company have already done substantial development work and have now arrived at the stage where their research will take off.</P>
    <P>There is great scope in regard to shellfish development which can be encouraged by up-to-date scientific methods.  At present there is such a development in Cork Harbour in which BIM are involved and it has been very successful.  A co-operative in Fenit, County Kerry, are involved in an oyster-bed development which is also very successful.</P>
    <P>A lot of attention is being devoted to deep-water fishing, limits and so on, but the fish resources adjacent to our coast could be our most important resource of all.  It is our responsibility to ensure the rehabilitation and development of our salmon, sea-trout, brown trout and shellfish stocks.  We cannot blame the foreigner or anybody else if we neglect these stocks.</P>
    <P>One of the few fruitful matters to emerge from the conferences I have attended since I became Minister for Fisheries emerged from a conference in late October.  We achieved a substantial objective in that the Community has recognised the right of each member state to what are called localised fisheries.  A member state can take any action that is needed to deal <Col N="1301" /> with localised fisheries.  The scale has not yet been fixed for these fisheries but it is hoped that it will be within 12 miles of the coast.  Within that zone we can do what we like with these fisheries.  This is an important achievement and sufficient attention has not been given to it.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is undesirable.  It is prohibited in regard to herring within 12 miles.  Purse seining for herring is illegal.  Up to 200 miles in the Celtic Sea outside the limit it is prohibited as well.  I intend to introduce a series of regulations in the new year in regard to netting for white fish and purse seining will be included.  There is an undue amount of netting of white fish around the coast at present.  It has been blatantly abused by the French in particular, who have engaged in doubtful practices in regard to netting white fish.  The Commission have introduced regulations along these lines, to have netting practices that allow sufficient escapement for the renewal of stock.  That is basically what conservation is about.  In regard to white fish, I am satisfied that the use of narrow mesh has been a big factor in reducing stocks.  I agree with the Deputy's view on purse seining.  It is an anti-conservation form of fishing.  Is that the only point the Deputy has?</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,759,480 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1977, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Environment including grants to local authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing, and miscellaneous schemes and grants including a grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>Deputies will have noticed that the name of the Vote has been altered in line with the changes made some months ago in the designation and role of the former Department of Local Government.  The Taoiseach, in advising the House of the intention to make these changes, indicated that the new Department would have the primary responsibility for environmental matters and that this was considered appropriate because of the widespread functions of the Department of Local Government in building and the provision of roads, other services and amenities. The arrangements that may be necessary to give further effect to the Department's special role on environmental matters are at present under consideration. Obviously it is something that requires a good deal of consultation with several other Departments.  In the meantime my Department will continue to promote the welfare of the physical environment.  This will be done mainly, as in the past, through the local government system by which pollution is controlled and the quality of the environment protected through the operation of the physical planning system and the provision of key environmental services.  We are, therefore, still very much in the business of local government, which must continue to be strong and effective if the environment is to be healthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local government is big business in terms of the services it provides for the good of the community and in terms of the employment it both affords directly and supports in the private sector.  Not least, it is big in terms of <Col N="1303" /> the finances it requires to provide those services and that employment.  The present Supplementary Estimate is for a gross amount of £6,792,480, which is offset in part by savings of £5,033,000 elsewhere on the Vote.  The net sum required is £1,759,480.  Accordingly, the total net provision for the Department's Vote for the present year comes to £85,874,500.  Great as this total is it represents part only of the total expenditure on local government services in 1977.  Money for the services is also provided from the Local Loans Fund, from the Road Fund and by local authorities from their own resources. When all these moneys are reckoned, the overall total is estimated to be over £450 million.  Of this sum about £270 million is financed from Exchequer sources.</P>
    <P>The present Supplementary Estimate is spread over nine subheads.  The two largest of these&mdash;subheads M and S&mdash; are closely linked in the sense that each of them deals with expenditure on roads.  When I took office the total grants allocated for 1977 to local authorities for road works were £26.57 million. This comprised £17 million from the Road Fund, £7.57 million originally provided in subhead M of the Vote, and a further £2 million provided by the former Minister for Finance in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>One of my first tasks as Minister was to identify areas under my control where additional employment could be generated in accordance with the Government's policy on job creation. As part of that exercise I examined the position of the building and construction industry which has suffered high unemployment in recent years and which is affected by the level of activity of local authorities, including their road works programme.  As part of a package of job creation projects announced by the Government shortly after taking office the allocations to local authorities for road works was increased substantially so allowing additional road works schemes to a total value of £5 million to be commenced in 1977.  The expanded grants programme and the contribution by local authorities will ensure <Col N="1304" /> that something of the order of £63 million will be expended this year on road works.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Government's action, grants allocated for road improvement works this year amount to £16.193 million compared with £6.732 million in 1976 and, taken in conjunction with the normal proportion of block grants devoted to the same purpose, represent a total State investment of about £21 million in improvement works on public roads in 1977. This expansion of the works programme is an indication of the importance I attach to the development of our public road network, having regard to the part it plays in the environmental, industrial, agricultural, commercial and social life of the country, its on-site and off-site employment potential, and its value to tourism.</P>
    <P>In order to meet the payments falling due in respect of the foregoing roads programme in the current year and also to meet £4.35 million for administrative and so on expenses, including costs of collection of road tax and a contribution to the Garda Vote, as against £4.25 million provided for these purposes in the budget, it is necessary to increase the amount of the Exchequer grant under subhead M of the Vote from £9.57 million already voted to £12.17 million and I have, therefore, provided in the Supplementary Estimate for an additional amount of £2.6 million under the subhead.</P>
    <P>One of the first duties I had to undertake as Minister was to introduce a token Supplementary Estimate related to the Government's undertaking to abolish the annual road tax on certain vehicles.  I intimated at the time that a substantive Supplementary Estimate would be introduced when the effect on Road Fund income could be more accurately measured.</P>
    <P>Due to the abolition, with effect from the 1st August last, of the tax on all &ldquo;private&rdquo; cars not exceeding 16 horse-power and on all motor cycles, it is estimated that the total income which will accrue to the Road Fund this year from motor taxation, and so on, receipts is £18.1 million.  The expenses of the fund are £33.42 million, comprising £29.07 million in respect of <Col N="1305" /> grants to road authorities and £4.35 million in respect of the administrative and so on expenses to which I have referred above.  Allowing for £12.17 million voted moneys under subhead M of the Vote, the additional amount now required under subhead S to meet the shortfall in motor tax receipts to the Road Fund in 1977 is £3.15 million.</P>
    <P>The local improvements scheme provides seasonal employment on non-public roads and minor drainage projects. The number of applications on hands with local authorities has increased very substantially.  In order to provide additional employment in 1977 I have increased the original provision for the scheme under subhead J from £1 million to £1½ million.</P>
    <P>The extra provision required in subhead R is a direct result of the swift action taken by this Government in implementing its election manifesto.  As I announced in Dáil Éireann on 6th July, 1977, the manifesto undertaking to give a special new house grant of £1,000 has been implemented with effect from the 27th May, 1977.  The new grant is payable to persons purchasing or building a new house or flat who have not already purchased or built a dwelling for their own occupation. This new scheme was considered necessary mainly because of the financial burden on many, particularly young married couples, who are anxious to provide their own homes but were not entitled to any grant to do so because of the inequitable and highly restrictive means test for State grants imposed by the previous Government. The income limit imposed was as low as £1,950, plus £100 for each dependent person up to a maximum of £400, which debarred the great majority of house purchasers, including persons of very modest means from obtaining any great assistance. This decision to restrict new house grants to persons eligible on an income or valuation basis for supplementary grants from local authorities resulted in a massive reduction in grant activity.  Only 6,388 grants were allocated last year compared with a total of 16,166 in 1975.  In the first six months of 1977, only 2,050 grants were allocated and in the third quarter <Col N="1306" /> of 1977, the number fell to only 601. Thus only 2,651 grants were approved altogether in the first nine months of 1977.  When introducing the £1,000 new house grant scheme, I took the opportunity to simplify and streamline procedures and to abolish unnecessary complexities.  Under the old scheme, there were so many variations in the State grants payable that it was confusing to the public and obviously overdue for review.  Another example was the method of calculation of the net floor area measurement which was unnecessarily complex.  I replaced this with a simple gross area measurement.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the scheme on 6th July last, there has been an unprecedented demand for application forms and it is certainly true to say that the scheme has captured the public interest.  Up to 2nd December applications had been received from 6,414 applicants of which 1,685 were approved, 129 paid and 342 rejected. The remaining applications are under examination and in the majority of these further information is awaited from the applicants.  I expect the vast majority of them will be approved.</P>
    <P>The amount provided in the original 1977 estimate for new house grants was £2.5 million.  When I announced the implementation of the £1,000 grant on 6th July, I had expected that the original allocation would be fully used this year on the old scheme of grants.  However, because of the falling off in activity under the old scheme, which is understandable in view of the restrictions imposed on eligibility by the previous Government, estimated savings of £300,000 will arise this year on the old scheme of new house grants. Since it is an essential condition of the new scheme that a house must be completed and occupied before the grant may be paid, it is expected that payments under the new scheme this year will not exceed £280,000.</P>
    <P>In implementation of a further one of the measures announced in the Government's programme on job creation, I introduced last August a scheme of grants to local authorities for certain environmental works which will provide about 250 new jobs.  Allocations <Col N="1307" /> totalling £500,000, related to local unemployment figures, were notified to local authorities for works to be carried out under the scheme. The grants are based on 100 per cent recoupment of labour costs and 50 per cent of other expenses.  The works selected by local authorities must have a high employment content and be of environmental benefit to the community. Provision is made in subhead G for a sum of £200,000 to meet payments to be made to local authorities before the end of the year on foot of work done under the scheme this year.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate includes additional amounts of £90,000 required under subhead A for salaries and so on of departmental staff and £23,500 under subhead I to increase the grant-in-aid towards the administrative expenses of An Foras Forbartha. The need for these amounts arises from the application of the two phases of the 1977 National Wage Agreement and the removal of marriage differentials in certain salary scales.</P>
    <P>Under subhead C a further £45,000 is needed to meet the extra cost of Post Office services attributable to higher postal and telephone charges. The amount to be received in appropriations-in-aid&mdash;subhead P&mdash;is being increased by £96,000.  This arises from higher recoupments in respect of departmental administration costs from the Road Fund and by local authorities in respect of the operation of the combined purchasing system. There is a minor offsetting reduction in receipts of £4,000 arising from the termination of application fees for new house grants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): As the Minister told us in his opening remarks, the name of the Department under his control has been changed from the Department of Local Government to the Department of the Environment.  As he also told us, and as the Taoiseach told us on 5th July last when announcing the new Department, the Department will concentrate on and have more time to devote to environmental matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> Shortly after the new Government took office I put down a question to the Minister in an effort to ascertain what function he would be assuming in accordance with the Taoiseach's statement.  I asked what changes were being made in the Department, what additional staff had been taken on, or what staff had been let go to other Departments.  I could summarise the reply to that question by saying the Minister was unable to tell me what changes would be made in the Department as a result of that new name.  It was quite clear from the Minister's reply that there would be no change and that all that had taken place was a change of name from the Department of Local Government to the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>The Minister said if I repeated the question in a short time, in a matter of months, he would be in a position to give me further information.  We are now discussing a Supplementary Estimate voting £200,000 for environmental matters and we have no further information about the Minister's plans for the environment.  I do not propose at this stage to go into this matter at length because there will be another opportunity to do that.  I want to put on record that the Minister's attitude to his new Department is simply not good enough.  He now has responsibility for the environment whether he likes it or not.</P>
    <P>The right to a quality environment was declared to be a basic human right by the United Nations at a Stockholm conference in 1972.  The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Molloy, attended that conference at which the right to live in a human and not a dehumanising environment was declared as a basic right.  They declared that slums and ghettos are environmental disaster areas and, therefore, need a crisis approach.  They went on to say at that conference that such areas sow and spawn delinquency, crimes, social and family disharmony and community disaffection, all of which are reaped by the community at large, but more especially by those who live in those ghettos.</P>
    <P>I want to put the Minister on notice that we on this side of the House will <Col N="1309" /> be expecting results from his new Department under these headings.  We will expect the Minister to declare these areas or these ghettos environmental disaster areas.  We will expect a special fund to be set up, supported from the EEC, to combat the problems in these areas and to provide urban renewal and extra intensive services to combat the degradation of these environments.  As long as I am spokesman for my party, I will expect the Minister to increase educational efforts and to have campaigns, awards and prizes for the most improved street or house in the type of area I have been speaking about.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that education is the key to a future quality environment. People need to be conscious of the shortcomings of the environment in which they live when that environment is bad.  They should have the desire to improve it and they should know where to get the necessary help. So far as I can see, the Minister has not announced any plans to educate people in need of education to achieve a better environment.  They are not aware of the need to improve their environment or they would not act as they sometimes do.  We need a commitment from the Minister that he is concerned about this and that, under his new title, he will embark on an educational programme to ensure that people realise the necessity for an improved environment. I could talk about Dublin Bay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Chair would have something to say about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should stick to the Cavan lakes and leave Dublin to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I could speak at length about Dublin Bay and the necessity for conserving this very fine amenity. I could also speak about rural Ireland, as Deputy Quinn reminded me. The Minister may find himself in a rather peculiar position when he discovers that one of the greatest offenders against the pure environment are local authorities for which, under his other hat, he is responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1310" /> I believe that to date, as I said when I put the question, in order to ascertain what we might expect from the new Department of the Environment that that Department was set up in an <i>ad hoc</i> fashion without any thought being given to it.  I also believe that in irrelevance it belongs to the realm of white rabbits.  It was produced by the Minister for Planning and Development who might more appropriately be described as the Minister for Tall Hats and White Rabbits because this is such an animal.  It has been let loose without any study, without any in-depth thought or without any preparation.  I do not want to go into this point further at this time; I want to put the Minister on notice that he is now in charge of the Department of the Environment.  The Taoiseach when setting up that Department on the 5th July last stated that the Minister would have more time to concentrate on environmental matters.</P>
    <P>We will be expecting him to create a situation in which he will not be ashamed to be reminded of the decision taken at the Stockholm conference in 1972.  Heretofore one Minister could blame another and one Department could say that environmental matters were more for one Department than another.  The Taoiseach recognised that when he stated, in setting up the Department, that there had always been a degree of uncertainty which Department or agency were responsible for environmental matters.  The setting up of this Department was meant to put an end to that uncertainty and to place responsibility fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Minister for the Environment.  That is where it is now and we will expect results.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate provides money for An Foras Forbartha, additional money for the local improvements scheme and the Road Fund.  These three injections of money mean that local authorities will have more work to do.  In many cases these funds are augmented by funds from local rates.  It is necessary there-fore that we have a look at the overall position in the light of instructions given by the Minister to local authorities and ask ourselves: how are <Col N="1311" /> these local authorities going to spend the money voted here?  Is it more than a coincidence that the Department of Local Government have shed that title and will no longer be known by that name?  Does that mean we are about to see the end of local democracy and local Government?  I am afraid it does.</P>
    <P>I welcome the abolition of rates which the Minister promised.  When in his pre-election manifesto, he undertook to abolish local rates on private dwellings and other hereditaments, he did not tell the people that he proposed to abolish local democracy and place local authorities in strait-jackets and that as a result they would be no more than rubber stamps in the hands of the Custom House.</P>
    <P>A series of circulars sent out by the Minister within a few months means that local authorities are now to be instructed as to the amount of money they may spend, irrespective of their services.  Irrespective of their plans for 1978, they are to be tied to an increase of 11 per cent&mdash;I have a circular here but I will not have time to place it on the record.  That means that Dublin Corporation have to strike a rate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I will not go into detail but I want to give one or two examples.  I cannot see how the money being voted can be spent by local authorities if they are going to be placed in a straitjacket.  Dublin Corporation will have to adopt a rate of £11.65 instead of £11.99.  This means that they will be short £250,000 for reconstruction grants, £220,000 for minor sanitary services and £180,000 <Col N="1312" /> for the purchase of land for open spaces.  We are now talking about the Ministry for the Environment and curtailing expenditure on land for open spaces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that Dublin County Council or Dublin Corporation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Dublin County Council, I am sorry.  That money is to be found elsewhere&mdash;it is to be borrowed, that is the only other way it can be found.</P>
      <P>Monaghan County Council is one of the only county councils with a proper estimate committee which has brought in estimates year after year which were accepted by the county council without question.  They had to reduce their rate this year by 73p in the £ or £200,000.  Dublin County Council in striking a rate that will be short by the figures I have given&mdash;in the neighbourhood of £1 million&mdash;will not take into account any increase in wages that might result from the present wage round.  I want an assurance from the Minister this evening that there will be no cut-back in services or in employment this year.  All over the country expenditure on roads is being cut-back to implement the Minister's direction.  As I said, when the Minister promised to abolish rates he did not tell the people that he was going to put the local authorities in a straitjacket and stifle local democracy, as we understand it.</P>
      <P>I do not have time to deal with the Minister's £1,000 for new house grants.  This is a gimmick.  A man in my constituency who bought a cottage a few years ago and now finds it is inadequate has been refused a grant by the Department for a new house because he bought that cottage three or four years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear the Minister say that for the first six months of 1977 housing grants approved amounted to only 2,050 but he went on to say that for the second half of the year grants approved under his new scheme amounted to only 1,685.  He told us that great interest has been shown in the scheme; but that interest is only reflected in the application forms, not in <Col N="1313" /> the number of grants approved.  I gave a clear example of the deficiency in the scheme.  Here you have a man who has qualified for the £1,000 grant but he is denied that grant because he bought a cottage a few years ago, for which he did not get a grant.  Now he wants to house himself properly but he is disqualified from obtaining a grant because of the Minister's provisions in the scheme.</P>
    <P>I welcome the addition of £500,000 to the local improvements scheme. If the Minister is going to borrow money to finance schemes it is as well that he should do so in respect of this project.  If he is going to embark on a rake's progress of borrowing money to implement many schemes, by all means let him borrow for this scheme.</P>
    <P>As a rural Deputy for many years I am aware of a shortcoming in the scheme and I have put down a parliamentary question in regard to it.  If a number of people living on a boreen or a lane want the lane repaired, the undertaking can be obstructed by one person who may be on bad terms with the other people.  I have applied to successive Ministers to take authority to compel that man to agree.  It could be done quite easily by the county council serving a notice on the objector telling him it was proposed to carry out the work and giving him the right of appeal to the District Court if he did not agree.  I know the Minister has been advised not to do this, that it will create difficulties. Similar advice was given to his predecessors. They were also told that there were not many such cases but I have nearly a dozen on hands at the moment.  It is an outrage that people should be allowed to obstruct a worth-while scheme just because they are on bad terms with their neighbours.</P>
    <P>I understand this debate must conclude at 7.15 p.m. and I do not wish to take up any more time.  I have dealt with some points and I shall avail of another time, perhaps not too far away, to elaborate on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Supplementary Estimate.  The expenditure is necessary and I am glad to see the Minister coming to this House looking <Col N="1314" /> for more money.  The Supplementary Estimate is interesting in that it reveals on the part of the Department a certain approach to policy that, even after what is still a short period for the new Department and the Minister, I find a bit distressing.  Let me be very precise in what I mean.</P>
      <P>The largest item in terms of governmental action taken on the initiative of the Minister, rather than action taken as a result of election pledges to abolish car tax or to introduce the £1,000 grant for new houses, is in the area of the grant to the Road Fund. Under subhead M there is provision for an additional sum of £2.6 million on the grounds, as stated by the Minister, that this will provide a certain amount of employment with a consequential effect on the economy overall.</P>
      <P>I am a little disappointed that the first Minister for the Environment should cast himself in the role of one of the old liberal and concerned landlords of the 19th century who when faced with the prospect of famine and destitution throughout the country set up road works&mdash;in effect, roads going to nowhere&mdash;in order to create employment.  The reality is that relative to population we have the most extensive system of roads in the whole of western Europe.  In Deputy Fitzpatrick's constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, especially in the Cavan part of which I have some experience, the road network is extremely extensive and generally it is kept in exceptionally good repair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reason for raising this point is to hope that this attitude to job creation will be a very temporary one. In line with what Deputy Fitzpatrick said, I hope the Minister will take the title to the new Department in a more comprehensive sense and that the need to create employment, with which I have no argument, will be spread over a greater area of environmental works and activities and not simply to road works and the Road Fund.  The Minister is new to his post and I am a new Deputy.  I am open to correction on a number of my interpretations regarding the Road Fund, but it seems to me that while there is much essential road work to be done, in many cases it <Col N="1315" /> could be confined to critical areas.  All other things being equal, we could live with the road system in its present form and condition if certain major modifications were made.  For example, on a national network system we could give much more active encouragement and funds to essential by-passes which would reduce the time distance between one major centre and another.  It would also improve dramatically the environmental quality of towns such as Athlone and others that are plagued by a large increase in vehicle traffic and in the size of the vehicles.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to take note of the points I have raised and to reply to them now or in another place and at another time.  Perhaps he would come back to this House and give us some indication of his thinking on the matter.  It is not enough merely to change the name of the Department and to change eventually the notepaper. The whole re-orientation within the Department is essential.  The name &ldquo;Department of Local Government&rdquo; was largely an irrelevant name for most of the activities operating from the Customs House.  There was a problem of getting a comprehensive title. I think the title &ldquo;Environment&rdquo; is as good as one could get but, as Deputy Fitzpatrick has pointed out, it places a particular emphasis on the Minister. This has been stated by him and by the Taoiseach in this House.  The Minister has a co-ordinating role for environmental matters and he has ultimate governmental responsibility for such matters.</P>
    <P>Perhaps a debate on a Supplementary Estimate is not the place to try to define precisely such matters.  I should like to see the Minister increasing the estimate to An Foras Forbartha in order to produce a White Paper or a position paper on the precise role of the Department stating with what areas it is proposed to be involved.  The Minister might present the House with a document giving us an idea of how he sees the Department of the Environment evolving over the next three or four years during his period of office.  I must limit the period to <Col N="1316" /> three or four years because I do not know whether the Minister will be there after that.  Such an exercise would be very useful.  I am disappointed that the grant to An Foras Forbartha, or some such body, has not been increased to enable the Minister to achieve that sort of strategy planning.  I am not aware of it taking place in the Department at present to the extent I should like.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the House, in reply to a question from Deputy Fitzpatrick, that a unit was being set up and the whole thing was under consideration. But &ldquo;under consideration&rdquo; can mean a lot of things, not the least of which may be lack of resources and of time.  I should like to have seen moneys made available under this Supplementary Estimate so that the Minister might say: &ldquo;We have a new Department of the Environment.  It is essential; it was not included in our manifesto.  This is what we would like to do and how we propose doing it.&rdquo; He should detail the kind of priority programme to be implemented over the next three to five years.  To get people to carry that out means seconding them from other work; essentially it means money and also creating employment.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not seen fit&mdash;I may be wrong in this and perhaps the Minister would clarify the position for me&mdash;in his speech to give any indication of any substantial change in the centre of gravity within the Custom House.  Excluding party politics altogether, that is a case for genuine concern and, in my view, disappointment.  I fully appreciate that the Minister, when in Opposition, was spokesman in another area.  I have sufficient grasp of the topics of local government and the environment to realise the extent of my ignorance in this respect and I acknowledge the Minister's task is a difficult and extensive one. A certain amount of time must be afforded any person in that position to come to terms with it.  I would hope that by the end of the Minister's first year in office at least we would be in a position to discuss a programme of work and action for his Department, that the Minister, as the first in that <Col N="1317" /> Department, would place a document before the House, which we, as Members of the Oireachtas, would be afforded an opportunity of discussing. This would ensure that, irrespective of who else might take up the Ministry in the future, there would be on the record of the House a major discussion on the role of the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>The Road Fund is the major item in this Supplementary Estimate&mdash;there, as I understand it, as a direct result of the Minister's action.  The other items are replacement funds for car tax and so on and, finally, there are the housing grants.  The whole attitude to the housing grant is an interesting one. I will be very interested to see how effective will be the £1,000 grant.  Certainly it was effective in the first context in which it was designed, as an election package.  I shall not spill sour grapes on the floor of this House, but it worked well in that regard.  It is now a reality.  It will be interesting to see if it will improve the way housing is made available in our society; if it will improve justice in the allocation of such housing resources as are available; whether it will contribute towards the Government's major policy objectives and those of the Minister's to the overall improvement of the environment. It could create a situation in which the market would be distorted in favour of new houses as against second-hand ones, in favour of new houses in new areas.  This, in turn, would place pressures on environmental services ranging from roads, sewerage and so on to the matters about which Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke that cannot be provided this year by Dublin County Council.  I have no objection to the £1,000 grant.  I sympathise with the constituent of Deputy Fitzpatrick who was not eligible but it was clear to me he could not have been eligible since he owned a house already.  However, by throwing in the £1,000 grant in that fashion, it swayed the market very much in favour of the construction industry&mdash; for which it was partially designed&mdash; and for buyers of new houses.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will monitor the effect of this grant, not so much on the number of applicants who <Col N="1318" /> apply&mdash;and in that context may I congratulate the Minister on simplifying the procedures and the calculation of areas which was a sensible undertaking&mdash;but on the housing market.  If we are endeavouring to bring about some form of environmental improvement in large urban areas, some increase in financial incentives will have to be made available to the second-hand housing areas, from the building-stock and social composition points of view.  This grant is no longer in the realm of manifesto politics; it is a reality.  While it has succeeded manifestly in its first objective, I believe it could distort the housing market in a number of ways.  The Minister may well appreciate this point having had experience himself in the auctioneering world.  It would be very useful to the House, to the Minister's Department and to future Administrations to monitor its effect on the housing market.  There have been requests made in the past by, I think, Deputy Keating of Fine Gael and others to try to match the effect of the £1,000 grant with something for secondhand houses or for the repair of houses.  Perhaps the Minister would speed up his proposals and come back to the House as soon as possible, because distortion of the market will continue unless the general public is made aware that something else exists also.  In that context I am speaking with great experience of the Greater Dublin area and people who wanted to live in certain areas within its boundaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal first with the last question Deputy Quinn raised. The £1,000 grant is working very well. Deputy Fitzpatrick criticised its slow progress and so on.  The grant may be allocated and paid only when a house has been completed and occupied unlike the scheme of grants it superseded and when the eligibility of the applicant has been established. Naturally, we shall not have 6,000 grants paid out in the first three or four months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to be able to announce that the Government have approved a similar rationalisation of the reconstruction, <Col N="1319" /> water and sewerage grants and for generous increases in the present maximum grant.</P>
    <P>Since 1972 the maximum reconstruction grant payable by my Department has been £200.  Housing authorities could pay a supplementary grant to persons who qualified under their local schemes.  In future, housing authorities will not have to contribute in this way towards the cost of private house improvements and my Department will make grants up to a maximum of £600 a house or two-thirds of the cost, whichever is the less.  The restriction of the grants to houses below certain valuation limits, which the previous Government introduced, will be ended.</P>
    <P>The maximum recouped to local authorities in respect of the special grants which they have been making for the adaptation of houses to make them more suitable for occupants suffering from physical handicap or mental illness will be increased from £400 to £1,200.</P>
    <P>My Department also pay grants for the provision of private water supplies and sewerage facilities in houses.  The maximum grants have remained unchanged since 1963 at £50 for a water supply and £25 for sewerage facilities. Higher grants at the rate of £100 for a water supply and £30 for sewerage installation are payable where the services are provided as part of a group scheme.  Local authorities may pay an equivalent supplementary grant.  The supplementary grants in these cases will also be ended, but in future my Department will meet two-thirds of the cost of the works or £200 and £150 respectively, whichever is the less, for individual water and sewerage installations. An additional £100 a house will be paid for each service installed as part of a group scheme.  In all these cases the increased grants will be payable in respect of work commenced after 31st October, 1977.</P>
    <P>I intend to increase from £200 to £600 the maximum loan which may be advanced without security by a local authority to assist in house improvement works and to allow loans of up <Col N="1320" /> to £3,500 to be made in cases where satisfactory security can be provided. The income limit of £3,500 a year which applies to SDA loans will also operate in respect of loans for house improvements.  Legislation will be needed to validate the changes in grants and it is my intention to request the approval of this House for the introduction of a Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1977, for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick will now know that the sum of money which he said Dublin County Council will be unable to provide for reconstruction grants will no longer be their responsibility. The Deputy criticised the percentage rates increase permitted to any local authority, 11 per cent on the non-domestic rate, but he forgot to inform us that the same Dublin County Council, Coalition-controlled last year, struck a rate which was only 5 per cent more than the previous year.  A man from his party was chairman at that time.  As a result of buoyancy and the change in the system of block grants, Dublin County Council will not be getting an increase on the amount of the block grants of 11 per cent.  It will be far in excess of that. They know that, and they should have got their figures right before they handed them to Deputy Fitzpatrick. That Coalition-controlled council last year were satisfied with a 5 per cent increase and now they cannot do with an increase of 11 per cent, or perhaps more.  Suddenly they have run out of money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1977, for contributions to International Organisations and for Official Development Assistance, including certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate arises because of certain savings which have been made under Subhead F of the <Col N="1321" /> Vote for International Co-operation. It is proposed to transfer these savings to Subhead E of the same vote and, since subhead E is a Grant-in-Aid Fund, Dáil approval is required.  However, this Supplementary Estimate does not involve the allocation of any additional grant to the Vote for International Co-operation, other than the token sum of £10.</P>
    <P>Subhead F of the Vote for International Co-operation for 1977 concerns payments for the benefit of developing countries arising from our membership of the European Economic Community. In the 1977 Vote, £1.74 million was provided for the purpose of meeting Ireland's contribution to the European Development Fund, established under the Lomé Convention and to the International Fund for Agricultural Development, as well as providing for any contingencies which might arise in the course of the year.</P>
    <P>Our contribution to the European Development Fund for 1977 was assessed as 1,620,000 European units of account which, on the basis of the rates of exchange prevailing on the prescribed payment dates, resulted in expenditure of £1,059,475.  The International Fund for Agricultural development has recently become operational and the first instalment of our contribution, amounting to £190,000, will be made before the end of the year.  At this stage it is considered most unlikely that any additional commitments will arise under this subhead, thus leaving an unexpended balance of £490,525.</P>
    <P>I now propose, therefore, that this unexpended sum be transferred from Subhead F to Subhead E of the Vote for International Co-operation.  This subhead covers payments to the Grant-in-Aid Fund for bilateral and other aid contributions for developing countries, for which a sum of £975,000 has been provided.</P>
    <P>The proposed transfer of additional funds to this subhead would mean that immediate consideration could be given to the commitment of these funds in response to a number of requests for bilateral assistance which would otherwise have to be turned <Col N="1322" /> down or at least deferred until next year.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned, of course, to ensure that the overall volume of our official development assistance for 1977 will be maintained, as far as possible, at the level of £7.3 million, which was the sum allocated for this purpose at the beginning of the year.</P>
    <P>Our programme of bilateral aid, to which it is proposed to transfer these funds, is a small but significant acknowledgement of our willingness to do something more for the Third World than merely fulfil the obligations which arise in this respect from Community membership and from membership of international organisations in the United Nations system. The programme is directed, to a significant extent, towards the poorest countries of the developing world and, more particularly, towards the least well-off sections of the populations of these countries.</P>
    <P>To date, five &ldquo;countries of concentration&rdquo; for Irish aid have been chosen and these are Lesotho, Sudan, Tanzania, Zambia and India.  The number has been limited to five for the moment because the resources available to us are extremely modest in comparison to the problems of development throughout the Third World.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to imply, of course, that our aid is or should be channelled exclusively to these five countries.  This is not the case.  Smaller amounts of assistance are also channelled to other countries in Asia, such as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka and, in Latin America, to, for example, Colombia.</P>
    <P>Ireland is in fact in an excellent position to meet many of the needs of developing countries, and our assistance reflects our own pattern of development, with a heavy emphasis on the supply of technical expertise for the development of agriculture, education and economic infrastructure.  And it should not be overlooked that bilateral aid expenditure can provide potentially valuable outlets for Irish goods and services as well as giving many Irish organisations the required overseas experience to enable them to compete for other contracts funded by international development agencies, <Col N="1323" /> such as the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme or the European Development Fund, under Community auspices.</P>
    <P>On a more general level, the bilateral programme has had the effect of making our own people more aware of the real needs of the developing world and of how interdependent the entire world community has become.  Most importantly, we can learn how our own developed society can best cope with the structural changes in the world economy which are inevitable if we are to conduct our relations with developing countries on the basis of dignity and justice.  Development co-operation is not simply about the transfer of resources; it is also a two-way process of education and understanding, a process which is vital to the creation of the more equitable world order to which we aspire.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £700,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1977, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of Public Works; for expenditure in respect of public buildings; for the maintenance of certain parks and public works; for the execution and maintenance of drainage and other engineering works; for expenditure arising from damage to the property of External Governments; and for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Wyse)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary to meet increases in the cost of the services rendered by the Office of Public Works.  The gross additional amount required, £1,219,000, is offset partly by estimated savings on certain subheads of the Vote, leaving a net requirement of £700,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1324" /> The main item in the Supplementary Estimate is the additional sum of £600,000 required under subhead E for New Works, Alterations and Additions.  The Office of Public Works has a large number of building and construction projects on hands at all stages of progress.  With the Government emphasis on job creation and the allocation of additional money for that purpose as part of the 1977 Budget job-creation package, steps were taken to bring projects to the construction stage with all possible speed and contractors for works in progress were encouraged to expand their work forces to the optimum level.  As a result of these measures and in spite of the long lead time involved in planning, trading procedures and so on, expenditure of £600,000 over and above the sum of £6,000,000 provided under this subhead in the original Estimates for 1977 is expected to have been incurred by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>An additional amount of £336,000 is required for subhead H&mdash;Purchase and Maintenance of Engineering Plant and Machinery and Stores.</P>
    <P>Practically all of this money is needed for the purchase of new plant for use on arterial drainage schemes. These schemes have a very high employment content and in order to keep them going at a reasonable level the purchase of new plant is vitally necessary.</P>
    <P>Sums totalling £20,000 are required for subheads A2, B2 and C to cover additional administrative expenses, the main item being increases in the cost of postal and telephone services.</P>
    <P>Subheads F2 and F4, for which additional sums totalling £138,000 are required, cover the cost of furnishing, heating and lighting State-owned property. Part of the increase is due to increased wages and costs and the remainder is due to increased demands which had to be met to maintain proper working conditions for State employees.</P>
    <P>An additional amount of £60,000 is needed for subhead J.1, National Monuments, to cover increased wages and costs.  Apart from providing a very valuable service in the field of conservation activity and archaeological <Col N="1325" /> research, the National Monuments service is a labour intensive one, providing employment in areas where it might otherwise not be available.  A sum of £65,000 is required under subhead K&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash;to cover an expected shortfall in receipts due to the fact that some major works being carried out on behalf of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have not proceeded as rapidly as expected.</P>

At my request, which the Government endorsed, the Central Bank agreed to provide the necessary funds on the understanding that, subject to the approval of the House, any expenditure over and above the cost of the limited measures which the Central Bank were prepared to implement would be recouped by the <Col N="1330" /> Exchequer as soon as possible.  I am gratified that the bank agreed to this course of action, which was the only way in which payment could be effected expeditiously.  After allowing for distributions made by the liquidator and the exclusion of certain depositors, the total amount to be provided by the Central Bank in the current year is estimated at £2.76 million.  Approximately £960,000 is payable by the Central Bank, leaving a balance of £1.8 million to be recouped by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The facts of the case are fairly widely known but it may be helpful to recount briefly, for the benefit of Deputies, the factors which lead the Government to decide on full payment. Firstly, this was the first case of a bank failure since the introduction of the new licensing and supervisory arrangements under the Central Bank Act, 1971.  It became apparent that, rightly or wrongly, there was a widespread belief that having licensed a bank the authorities would stand behind it.  It is only right to point out that this view would have been strengthened by the measures taken by the authorities elsewhere in recent years to safeguard the interests of depositors with banks in difficulty, although the problems were rather different in scale.  Secondly, there were a substantial number of small depositors involved who faced heavy losses and many of whom were already experiencing hardship.  Thirdly, the Government were satisfied that generous action in this case would reinforce the high standing of our financial institutions and would go far to obviate any danger that our efforts to attract overseas investment would be adversely affected.</P>
    <P>Few people would dispute the principle of extending aid in this instance. There are arguments for limiting such aid.  They were put to me strongly by the Central Bank.  I respect these views and accept their validity.  But in the particular circumstances of this case, as I have outlined them to the House, and in the absence of standing arrangements to deal with the problem, I am satisfied that the decision to make full repayment was the correct one.  But let me make it quite clear that this is <Col N="1331" />&ldquo;the exception that proves the rule&rdquo;. It is not the intention to underwrite bad or imprudent management or to cover investors whose greed for large returns outruns their discretion.  The Irish Trust Bank case has revealed some weaknesses in supervisory powers.  Amending legislation to close these loopholes will be brought forward as soon as possible.  It is my intention to provide for limited relief for depositors where there is no option but to allow a bank to fail.  The scheme, which I hope it will never be necessary to implement, will be in line with modern thinking in other countries and in the European Community. That is as far as I intend to go and I want that message to be heard and taken to heart by all concerned.</P>
    <P>For the information of the House I would add that in addition to the sum now required a further provision of around £100,000 will have to be made in the Estimates for 1978 in respect of payments on foot of claims, which have not yet been cleared by the court examiner.  The delay in these cases is not exceptional.</P>
    <P>I wish to place on record my appreciation of the assistance and co-operation afforded to my Department by the staff of the Central Bank and by the official liquidator and his staff, as a result of which the payments were made smoothly and successfully.</P>
    <P>The present Estimate before the House is for the purpose of recouping to the Central Bank the additional cost incurred by them in the current financial year in providing funds for the repayment in full of Irish Trust Bank depositors.  The amount required is £1.8 million.</P>
    <P>On the Vote for the Houses of the Oireachtas, £132,000 is sought mainly to cover the cost of increases during the year in accordance with the national pay agreement in allowances of Deputies and Senators and increases in their motor mileage rates and overnight allowances.</P>
    <P>There are also Supplementary Estimates for the Office of the Minister for Finance, mainly covering pay increases, increased expenditure on office machinery and on management <Col N="1332" /> of Government stocks; for the Office of the Attorney General, because of a higher incidence of legal costs; for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, mainly for increased expenditure on fees to counsel; and a token estimate for the Office of the Minister for the Public Service.  This is for the Institute of Public Administration.</P>
    <P>There is also an excess Vote for Superannuation and Retired Allowances relating to 1975.</P>
    <P>I commend these Estimates to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Vote No. 14 is the one on which I want to speak mainly. The Minister said:</P>
      <P>But let me make it quite clear that this is &ldquo;the exception that proves the rule&rdquo;.  It is not the intention to underwrite bad or imprudent management or to cover investors whose greed for large returns outruns their discretion.</P>
      <P>That is exactly what we are doing. The Minister knows it is nonsense to say that this is the exception that proves the rule.  Every time the Fianna Fáil Party in particular&mdash;maybe other parties will succumb to the same weakness when this precedent is shown to them&mdash;coming up to an election are faced with a similar set of circumstances they will do the same thing because the finger will always be pointed backwards at the Irish Trust Bank which a political party undertook in the heat of an election campaign to bail out and then put the bill on the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>The total bill goes on the taxpayer even though the Minister referred to a sum of approximately £100,000 next year.  He does not say if that is just from the Exchequer or from the Central Bank.  It has been the practice in the Central Bank to refund to the Exchequer from time to time the profits they make.  They will be light by the sum the Minister refers to in future years.  It is just not the £1,800,000 plus the £100,000 in 1978 that the taxpayers will be liable for. They will be liable for the full amount even though liable for only £1,900,000 directly now and next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1333" /> We are talking about a principle here. Any Government or any political party who have any respect for the financial institutions constantly exhort the public to invest in their own savings schemes, the Post Office, the ICC and the ACC.  Any Government or any Department who have the slightest respect for these institutions would not dream of doing what is being done here.  How can one answer some person of limited means who invests £1,000 in the Post Office at 6 per cent, or whatever the rate is, who comes to you and says: &ldquo;Was I not a bloody fool that I did not put it in the Irish Trust Bank at 18 per cent and you would bail me out?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Thousands of genuine people invested in this Bank.  The vast number of the people who invested in it are absolutely above reproach. They were tempted by a high rate of interest into putting their money into the Irish Trust Bank.  Some of them were possibly under the impression that it was guaranteed by the State.  It is difficult to see why the State should guarantee the ACC, the ICC and other institutions at a rate of interest sometimes 8 per cent lower than this bank were offering.  How could anybody be foolish enough to think the State would be in competition with itself and guarantee itself against itself as in this case?  The Minister knows that a lot of the depositors in this bank are fictitious.</P>

I will give an example of a depositor named Mr. Barry in 119 Kildare Street.  There is a name Barry and there is a legitimate street but the <Col N="1334" /> number is fictitious.  There can also be a Father O'Callaghan of the Catholic Church c/o the bank and an attachment: &ldquo;do not forward correspondence&rdquo;.  There are many people of that nature.  My information is that the £960,000 covers depositors up to £15,000 and what is being voted here tonight is to cover depositors with more than £15,000.  Is that not correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is no truth in this allegation in fairness to the Minister's Government and members of that Government the Minister should refute it.  There is no statutory basis, as far as I have been informed, for the payment of this money.  Deputy de Valera frequently, while he was chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, drew attention&mdash;I suspect that we have possibly been guilty of this and possibly this is not the only case of this&mdash;to money being voted here without statutory backing.  I do not notice in the Minister's speech any suggestion that he intends introducing such legislation.  He stated:</P>
      <P>The scheme, which I hope it will never be necessary to implement, will be in line with modern thinking in other countries and in the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My knowledge is that what is done in other countries is that either the Central Bank, if such it is called, or the corresponding institution in that country, forms a fund with the ordinary commercial bank and the other banks that come under it.  They set up a fund out of which moneys in cases like this, are paid and the Exchequer does not finance it.  If the Minister can <Col N="1336" /> quote an example of where an Exchequer intervenes directly in such a situation, I should be glad to hear it. The Minister says that the Irish Trust Bank case has revealed some weaknesses in supervisory powers and that amending legislation to close the loopholes will be brought forward as soon as possible.  It is his intention, he says, to provide for limited relief for depositors where there is no option but to allow the bank to fail.  Under what Act is this money being paid out? If I am reading the Minister's speech correctly it is not intended that the legislation being introduced will provide for the paying out of this money but that it will close loopholes exposed by the failure of the Irish Trust Bank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>I hold no grudge against those people who have got their money out of the Irish Trust Bank as a result of this Vote.  They took a risk, but the venture was not successful.  Consequently, they hit a weak political party at a fortuitous time politically, engaged in a bit of arm-twisting which resulted in that party making a foolish promise for which the taxpayer will have to foot the bill.  That is the £1.8 million we are voting this evening.</P>

      <P>The first point I wish to make, lest I overlook it later, relates to an interjection in which I said something to Deputy Barry which indicated that the purpose of this Vote was not merely to repay depositors of more than £15,000. What I said was correct but I think I know what the Deputy had in mind, that was, that the Central Bank's original proposal was to refund a certain amount in respect of deposits up to £15,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is that amount that is coming from the Central Bank and this Vote is required to make up the difference, the total amount being in respect of total recoupment for all depositors other than connected depositors and, as I have indicated a small amount where claims have yet to be made or processed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I made is correct, that is, that the £960,000 will pay depositors who invested up to £15,000 while the £1.8 million is to pay those whose investments were greater than £15,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct.  The Central Bank's proposal was in respect of deposits up to £15,000, but it was intended to pay a sum of 29p in the £ which was the estimated amount at that time that the liquidator would recover over and above the amount already realised.  Therefore, this amount would not have recompensed in full any depositor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If the liquidator could recover it there would be no necessity for the 29p to be paid by the Central Bank.  The liquidator would achieve that.</P>

      <P>It is important that we be clear on this question.  The £960,000 makes up the difference between the 29p which the liquidator will collect and the £1 for those depositors who invested up to £15,000.</P>

It is becoming more complicated because the liquidator's estimate has changed.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried to indicate that the Central Bank's original proposal was to pay a sum of money which would have been recouped to them eventually by the liquidator.  The bank's proposal was confined to depositors of up to £15,000 but would not have recompensed in full those depositors.  Deputy Barry began by quoting what I have said concerning this being the exception that proved the rule and he said it is not the exception.  Let me remind the Deputy of something he may have overlooked: this is the first time that a bank licensed by the Central Bank has failed.  Arising out of that failure certain weaknesses have been disclosed in our statutory provisions for supervision.  If we had never had the kind of provision that is in this Supplementary Estimate we would still have had to take some action to deal with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have indicated both this evening and previously, I propose to bring in legislation that will provide for some form of protection for depositors of licensed banks lest any such bank should fail in the future, although I trust there will be no such failure. <Col N="1339" /> However, we propose to provide some form of protection to cover such event. I have tried to make it clear in the past and again this evening that that form of protection will not amount to full recompense for any depositor in a licensed bank.  It is very easy now to say we should not do that.  I understood Deputy Barry to say that we should not make provision for any recompense for a depositor who had invested in a failed bank.  I do not know whether that was what the Deputy intended to convey, but it is not a proposition I accept.  Neither is it a proposition accepted by the Central Bank.  We are doing something about that.  However, there is validity in the argument that recompense should not be given in full lest it might encourage people either to be careless or imprudent in their management of banks or to encourage the depositors to invest money in banks paying rates of interest that are too high.</P>
    <P>That is all very well as far as the future is concerned and what we do about it, but what we are dealing with here is the first and only case that has come up. There is a good deal of evidence to show that many of the depositors honestly and genuinely believed that this bank had the full support of the Irish Government and of the Central Bank.  We know that belief was wrong and not well-founded, but that does not say it was not a genuine belief.  I am satisfied that in quite a number of cases it was genuine. I am also satisfied that there were cases of particular hardship involved. In fairness, Deputy Barry did not suggest this, but attempts have been made to suggest that what is involved here is a group of wealthy speculators to whom money is being paid out now by the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>Before Fianna Fáil gave its commitment in this regard I received representations from a number of sources at home and abroad and I believe it might be no harm to outline a few of the cases.  Deputy Barry Desmond unfortunately is not here for this discussion although he was very vocal on this topic before.  I wonder what his <Col N="1340" /> reaction to these cases would be.  One case is where a group of men in this city were made redundant and they invested their redundancy lump sums with the Irish Trust Bank expecting that it would bring them a small additional yearly income.  When the bank collapsed they lost not only the income but their redundancy lump sums.  Most of them were in their late fifties and had no hope of getting other jobs.  Does Deputy Desmond think that this sum we are asking the House to vote in that case is being paid out to a bunch of wealthy speculators?  Another case on which I received representations was where an industrial worker in the west of Ireland who was maimed for life as a result of an accident at his job was awarded compensation for his injuries in the courts and invested the entire amount in the Irish Trust Bank.  If we had not done what we have, that man would have been left with something in the region of 30p in the £ to date.  An Irish-American couple who were living in New York had invested their life savings with the Irish Trust Bank because they planned to spend their retirement in Ireland.  They thought that the Irish Trust Bank being licensed by the Central Bank was one that would ensure their money was safe and suddenly they found themselves facing their retirement without a penny.  Another Irish-American who emigrated in the fifties had worked hard and saved his money, planned to come back home and start a job in Ireland.  He was in the process of building a house when the trust bank closed down.</P>
    <P>I mention these cases to make it clear that while they are not representative of all the depositors they are very representative of the great majority.  These are not the kind of people that we are told are benefiting from this payment.  Most of these are small people who are ruined unless this is done.  One can be tough about it and say &ldquo;that is too bad, but they should not have invested their money unwisely&rdquo;.  Many people I know have to suffer if they invest unwisely, but quite clearly a lot of these depositors were not skilled investors; they had no skill at all in this area and they believed that this bank, being licensed by <Col N="1341" /> the Central Bank had the backing of the Irish Government and the Irish State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry asked for a breakdown of the depositors.  As accurately as I can get it, it is of the following order; between £0 and £1,000 the number of depositors was 574, between £1,001 and £5,000 the number was 367, between £5,001 and £10,000 the number was 123, between £10,001 and £15,000 the number was 54 and £15,000 plus the number was 45.  It will be clear from this that over 80 per cent of the depositors were people who had investments or deposits in the range between £0 and £5,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>But not over 80 per cent of the money goes to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, of course not. There were, as we can see from the figures given, some relatively large depositors.  What is to be said?  Are we to say that they are not to be compensated, that only the smaller people are to be compensated although possibly some of the smaller deposits, for all I know, were large deposits divided up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was the original intention that depositors with investments of over £15,000 would not get anything.  That could never be because they always get what the liquidator would recover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That was never part of our proposal.  Deputy Barry has not grasped the significance of the fact that this was the first and only licensed bank which collapsed here.  Does the Deputy realise the impact that this made?  Did the Deputy hear anything about the kind of reaction there was, for instance, in parts of the United States to some of our efforts to attract industrial investment as a result of the collapse of the Irish Trust Bank?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I know some of the investors here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine Deputy Barry may know something about the reaction and what was happening to some of our IDA efforts in America as a result of this collapse and the <Col N="1342" /> statement that the Government had no responsibility and would not accept responsibility.  We had to consider the effect on our efforts at industrial promotion, and in the long run, perhaps most importantly, the record of our financial institutions given that this was a licensed bank.  This all happened in the context of banks in other countries having collapsed and having being bailed out.  Deputy Barry made the point that he did not think that this was done by the exchequers but by the body corresponding to our Central Bank in other countries.  The Deputy also made the point earlier in his speech that he really did not think there was any difference in the source and that ultimately the money came from the Exchequer.  That is true in so far as any profits made by the Central Bank accrue to the Exchequer in the long run.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry says there were fictitious names or addresses or both in this case.  Maybe he has more information than I have on this.  Speaking from recollection, the only information I have which would bear on this matter is in part of a police report on the New York area, which was obtained by the previous Government and known to the previous Government before they left office some months before, a police report which showed that there was no evidence whatever to support any suggestion that depositors in the Irish Trust Bank were themselves in or were fronts for subversive groups.  The fact that that report was available did not prevent colleagues of Deputy Barry who saw the reports and who should have known better pretending to the Irish public that there was some evidence in that regard.  The only reference that I saw was in one case where it appeared that the address given was not accurate; there are not a corresponding number in the street in question, as Deputy Barry said, but it appeared in the report that the person concerned was identified by the police and there was no evidence whatever of any criminal or subversive intent on the part of that person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barry also put forward an innuendo&mdash;this is not his normal form and I regret that somebody persuaded <Col N="1343" /> him to do that; of course it is his right and duty if he has the evidence to support the innuendo to put the whole case before the House, but he did not.  What he did was to ask me to deny that any member of the Government or a connection of a Member of the Government had money in the Irish Trust Bank.  Deputy Barry should know, if he does not, that the list of depositors in the Irish Trust Bank is not available to me.  It is available in the Central Bank who are legally prohibited from making it available to anybody else.  It is available to the Official Liquidator who cannot make it available without an order of the High Court.  Therefore Deputy Barry knows I cannot say positively that no member of the Irish Government or a connection of a member of the Government is on that list. Of course I cannot.  I have not seen the list.  I suggest that this is an unfair and disreputable tactic.  If Deputy Barry has evidence to support that contention he should say so and tell us what the evidence is, but if he has not he is putting the old question, have I stopped beating my wife?  I think whatever I say he is going to say, &ldquo;You did not deny it&rdquo;.  He knows I cannot deny it because I have not the evidence.  Has Deputy Barry any evidence to support it?  If he has why did he not put it on the record of this House?  These tactics in the end do not redound to the credit of those who engage in them, and I trust that Deputy Barry will not in future allow himself to be talked into this kind of tactic by anybody else.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry asked whether there was any legislation authorising this payment and I indicated in an interjection that there was not.  He may misunderstand the position.  It is true that I referred to legislation to be brought in and, as he correctly said, I said this would relate only to the future, to tightening regulations and to providing a limited scheme of compensation if any such case should arise, but it does not relate to this case.  I think he misunderstood the position with regard to authority for payment of this.  The authority for payment of this <Col N="1344" /> is obtained from Dáil Éireann and that is what we are seeking now.  If Dáil Éireann give that authority it is open to the Dáil to give it without legislation, so that legislation as such is not necessary.  I think he misunderstood Deputy de Valera's crusade as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts which was for payment of moneys where there was statutory authority but payment in excess of the statutory authority, and therefore there was not authority other than a vote of the Dáil on the Appropriation Account.  That is a complicated exercise and Deputy Barry may be conscious of it because it arose in connection with the Department of Transport and Power.</P>

      <P>I stress again that I believe the decision in this case was the right one, having regard to the hardship involved, the reputation of Irish financial institutions, the actual and much greater potential damage to our efforts in industrial promotion abroad, and above all the fact that all of this arose out of the first and I hope only failure by a licensed Irish bank.  I believe we were right to do it but I want to stress that, having done it and in the circumstances I have described, we in this party have no intention&mdash;Deputy Barry may say that other political parties may do this in the future; if they do they can answer for it&mdash;if any such case should arise in the future, of providing anything more by way of compensation than will be provided for in the legislation we intend to introduce. It will not be full compensation.  I want to make that perfectly clear.</P>

There can be few people now who are not aware of that fact.  I believe the decision in this case was the right one and I ask the House to give the necessary authority for payment of this money by way of recoupment to the Central Bank.</P>

He appealed against that decision and on 16th September, 1977 an appeals officer reversed the decision given by the deciding officer and restored benefit. Payment of disability benefit amounting to £40.80 for the period from 12th May, 1977 to June, 1977, <Col N="1217" /> was made to the claimant on 30th September, 1977.</P>
    <P>Title to benefit subsequent to 4th June, 1977, is governed by the number of contributions the claimant had paid or credited in the 1976 contribution year and as he had less than the required minimum of 26 contributions in that year, payment could not be made subsequent to 4th June, 1977. Following inquiries made by my Department, arrears of contributions amounting to 20 in the 1975 contribution year and 36 in the 1976 year were paid by his employers on 7th December, 1977, and these contributions affected his entitlement to benefit not only in the current year but in respect of the previous year.</P>
    <P>A cheque for arrears of benefit of £353.71, accordingly, was issued to the person named on 9th December, 1977. This amount was made up as follows:&mdash; £320.41, representing payment of disability benefit at the maximum rate for the period from 6th June, 1977, to 29th November, 1977, the date of the last medical certificate received from him, plus an adjusting payment of £33.30 in respect of the difference between the maximum weekly rate and the reduced weekly rate of disability benefit already paid for the periods prior to 4th June, 1977.</P>
    <P>I am aware that, as stated by the Deputy, the person concerned recently sought to resume work but was not allowed by his employer to do so.  He lodged a claim to unemployment benefit at his local employment office on 2nd December, 1977.  That claim was not allowed as he had furnished certificates of incapacity up to 29th November, 1977, and had not submitted a final certificate indicating that he was fit to resume work.  If he is unfit for work and submits the necessary medical evidence, his entitlement to disability benefit from 30th November will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the circumstances in which a part-time company director whose main occupation is that of a sole trader independent of the company of which he is a director may be called upon to pay social welfare contributions out of the remuneration received by him as such director; if he is aware of a considerable amount of public confusion in relation to the matter; and if steps will be taken to clarify the issues involved.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any public confusion in relation to the matter of the social insurance of company directors.</P>
      <P>The position is that employment under a contract of service is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.  Company directors, as such, are not regarded as being employed under a contract of service and consequently the directorship, of itself, does not make a person insurable under the Acts.  The constitution of a company may allow the company to employ a director in an office of profit as if he were a person other than a director and, under such an arrangement, his employment could be under a contract of service and thus insurable.  If, however, a working director is in a controlling capacity within the company to such an extent that he makes decisions for the company, he would not be regarded as being employed under a contract of service and would not be insurable.</P>
      <P>Under the Social Welfare Acts, any decision as to whether an employment is or is not insurable is given by a deciding officer and there is a right of appeal against any decision if a person affected is dissatisfied with it.</P>

      <P>No cattle headage scheme grant is payable to this herdowner in respect of 1975.  Following inspections under the 1975 scheme, three herds previously separately registered under the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme in the names of the herdowner and other members of his family were amalgamated under a single herd number. An advance of £420 had been paid under the Beef Cattle Incentive Scheme early in 1975 in respect of one of these herds.  A grant of £300 due in respect of the joint herds for 1975 under the Cattle Headage Scheme was offset against this advance.  The balance of £120 was offset against the 1976 scheme payment and a payable order for the remainder, that is, £228.00 has been issued to the herdowner concerned.</P>

Also, as there is no compulsion on school-leavers to register with the NMS the figure does not include all school-leavers seeking employment.</P>
