      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House with a speech on this Bill but I wish formally to draw the attention of the House, as I have done previously, to the fact that this is probably the most important Bill we pass but it will be disposed of in a matter of minutes at the end of term.  This is not new; it is the custom of the House. I do not mean that as a reflection either on the administration or the Government.  It is, as I stated previously, a reflection on the House.  In this Bill we are authorising the whole of the expenditure covering the period of the Estimates that we passed in June and the Supplementary Estimates we passed yesterday.  In fact, we are giving legal rubber-stamp effect to a provision that grants moneys for the summarised purposes in the Schedule. We are granting public moneys without any adequate consideration in this House or in a Committee of this House until, perhaps, two years later when the Committee on Public Accounts will go through this and we will have the usual arguments.  By that time the money has been spent, and legally spent.  I wish to draw the attention of the House to what we are doing now formally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that all Members read the last published report, for 1974, of the <Col N="1352" /> Committee of Public Accounts.  That report will be followed by the report for 1975.  The reports are in arrears in publication but any Deputy interested in something more than merely the so-called political matters will find in those reports that there are serious questions arising now for this Parliament, if it is to be a sovereign Parliament, on the question of its own financial control.  Virtually, by such a thing as this Bill, we are handing over all control of public expenditure to the administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the Deputy in the sense that I think he is saying that the House does not pay sufficient attention to the money we vote.  We passed a lot of Supplementary Estimates last night and we are now in the process of passing almost £2,000 million between 10.30 a.m. and 10.40 a.m. on the second last day of this session.  As Deputy de Valera mentioned, this is not new and it is not the only Dáil where this was done.  The Deputy has been a lone voice in this crusade to give this House better financial control of the public finances.  He brought this point up on many occasions.  I suggest that it is time that the three parties, with the assistance and guidance of the present chairman and the last chairman, of the Committee of Public Accounts, devised some means by which there would be accountability to the House for the money spent, not two or three years after it has been spent legally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, on behalf of the Labour Party, to be associated with the remarks made.  In fairness, Deputy de Valera raised this on previous occasions.  It is not a party political matter and I do not wish it to develop into such.  I do not wish to create the view that, now that we are in Opposition, we should be having a crack at the Government on every possible occasion.  Successive Governments have been responsible for allowing this develop.  The serious note of warning sounded by Deputy de Valera concerning the casual manner in which we dispose of a figure in excess of £2,000 million, without <Col N="1353" /> proper scrutiny by the House, is something that should concern every Member, irrespective of party.</P>
      <P>The suggestion made by Deputy Barry could be very usefully taken up in the interests of Parliament and in the interests of the people as a whole. This is not a political issue and it should not be made into a political scoring point.  Since it has been raised so forcibly this morning by Deputy de Valera, the three parties should get together but, while it is not a political matter, the responsibility to ensure that some proper mechanism is worked out rests undoubtedly with the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy de Valera indicated, it is the tradition in this House that we do not discuss the Appropriation Bill in detail.  It is discussed in considerable detail in the other House where it is analogous to our budget debate because the budget, as such, does not go before the other House.</P>
      <P>The Government are anxious to cooperate in any procedures which would improve the methods of ensuring accountability but, let us not get carried away in this matter, because some things which had been said simply are not accurate.  The purpose of the Appropriation Bill now before the House is to appropriate the various supply services by Statute.  It is not simply a question of authorising the amounts of money involved in this. They have already been authorised by the House either as Estimates, Supplementary Estimates, or payments under Statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera will be familiar with the fact&mdash;indeed, he is very familiar with the fact&mdash;that a certain argument was made recently to rely on this Bill to authorise certain payments. He is also familiar with the fact that that argument is no longer being made by the present Minister for Finance. Therefore, we are not purporting in this Bill to authorise payments but merely to appropriate payments already authorised.  I want to make it clear that this procedure being followed is not merely rubber-stamping large expenditure. <Col N="1354" /> It is simply appropriating it to the various Votes.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I want to say it is clear that, over quite a number of recent years, the amount of time devoted to Estimates and Supplementary Estimates has been reduced.  I would suggest that is the area which ought to be considered if there is to be some all-party approach to the matter as to how greater time could be devoted to Estimates and Supplementary Estimates.</P>
    <P>In this context, in all fairness I should point out that yesterday virtually the whole day was devoted to Supplementary Estimates.  A timetable was laid out for the various Supplementary Estimates and, in fact, the House did not use all the time laid out for this purpose yesterday.  I say that so that we can have some air of reality about the discussion going on here this morning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is quite fair.  The indication was, even though it was not agreed between the parties, that in the time allocated only spokesmen would reply to the debate and there would be no backbench contributions. Backbenchers are also entitled to have a say on Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, but nevertheless it is true that, within the circumscription agreed between the Whips, the time available was not fully used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>That also is not fair comment.  As happened yesterday, if a spokesman is left with six minutes to comment on a Supplementary Estimate, it is not possible to comment intelligibly in six minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept that the arrangements are not fully satisfactory but, having accepted that, if we are genuine in our talk about establishing accountability to this House, at least such time as is made available should be fully used.  All I am saying is that the time made available within the confines of what was agreed by the Whips was not fully used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Because backbenchers were excluded.  We had to <Col N="1355" /> agree to that to get the business through.  That is the unsatisfactory part of it, without wanting to enter into controversy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not obscure the issue.  The fact is that certain times were laid down which were available to appropriate Ministers and spokesmen and those times were not fully used.  That is a fact which cannot be denied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is talking about a quarter of an hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>However we may explain it, it is a fact we cannot deny. Having said that, I want to repeat that far from having an objection to them the Government would actively encourage efforts which would be practicable and would ensure a greater degree of accountability than has been manifest in recent years.  The detailed methods by which this could be achieved would have to be a matter for fairly lengthy and careful discussion between the parties.  I would encourage that.  I would hope that, having said what we have said, the House would now be prepared to follow tradition on the Appropriation Bill which is not purporting to authorise payments but rather to appropriate them to the different Votes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of explanation, this Bill gives statutory authority to the Estimates and, without this Bill, the Estimates, even if they were fully discussed, would not have statutory effect.  That is all I want to say. It does more than appropriate.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Bill put through Committee and reported without amendment.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I comment briefly?  One of the methods we might examine to ensure the possibility of having more adequate discussion on Estimates and Supplementary Estimates or on this Bill, might be to have Friday sittings on some occasions.  I notice the Minister has become very silent and inactive on this matter since he changed from this side of the House to that side.  During the period of office of the previous Government, the demand for extra sittings made by the then Opposition was met by the then Government.  More time was given to discuss these various items.  I have seen no indication of that method being adopted or attempted by this Government to facilitate the House to discuss as fully as possible various matters of national importance which come before us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out that Deputy Cluskey is mistaken in thinking that, for instance, last year or the year before more time was devoted to Estimates.  The fact is that the amount of time being devoted to Estimates has been steadily decreasing &mdash;I am not sure of the present year which, because of elections and other things, would not have been a normal year&mdash;but last year the least amount of time was devoted to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1357" /> Let us not confuse ourselves with regard to what the actual situation is. I want to make it clear that we are willing to consider various suggestions that might improve the reality about the House and its investigation and examination of various Estimates and accountability.  The suggestion made by Deputy Cluskey may be practicable, but when the Whips discuss it they may not find it so practicable. Do not let us approach this on the false assumption that last year the then Opposition demanded extra time for Estimates and got it, because I am afraid that is not the fact.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been traditional in this debate to make a wide-ranging review of the major issues facing the country.  I intend to follow this precedent.  In what I have to say, I will touch on the Government's strategy for dealing with unemployment and inflation, on developments in industry and agriculture, on industrial relations, public service reorganisation, the European Social Fund, energy policy, the development of our infrastructure and environment, <Col N="1359" /> health and welfare, the problems of Northern Ireland and, finally, on the prospects for 1978 if we get our approach to incomes right.  I shall also, as I indicated yesterday, be outlining the implications for us of the economic and monetary situation as it is developing in Europe.  Deputies will recall that this was discussed at the meeting of heads of Government in Brussels earlier this month.</P>
    <P>I will start with unemployment.  The single most serious problem facing this country today is unemployment.  It is this which is central to the Government's strategy.  Like almost every other country in western Europe, we have been faced with an upsurge in the numbers out of work, caused, in part, by the recession of recent years and, in part, by demographic trends, which are producing a disproportionately large inflow of young people to the labour market.  We in Government have no illusions that this problem will be easily solved.  Neither are we under illusions as to the consequences if it is not.  The stability of society itself is at stake.</P>
    <P>Our approach to job creation is twofold.  We propose, first, direct action to provide an additional 20,000 jobs over 12 months in building and construction, the public sector and youth employment projects.  Immediately we took office we moved to implement this part of our programme. Within three weeks we implemented several commitments with major job creation potential.  We also appointed a Cabinet sub-committee to prepare new initiatives to increase employment. Over the intervening months we have announced further measures.</P>
    <P>It may be helpful if I recall a few of the steps we have taken.  We increased the 1977 capital allocations for job-creating expenditure on roads, sanitary services, vocational schools, environmental works, local improvement schemes and hospital building. We raised the income and loan limits for SDA housing loans and provided the £1,000 grants.  The response to this initiative has been immense.  Between the date it was announced and the beginning of December, the Department <Col N="1360" /> of the Environment have received applications for almost 6,500 grants.</P>
    <P>We created 600 additional posts for teachers in secondary and vocational schools.  We have taken an additional 400 graduates into training as national school teachers.  We have authorised an additional 500 gardaí.  In all, funds have been authorised for the creation of close to 4,700 jobs in building and construction and more than 3,500 new posts in the public service.  Many of these jobs will benefit school leavers. The employment incentive scheme has also been extended to the building and construction, hotel and catering and other services sectors.  It is hoped that in combination with other elements of our programme, this will induce recruitment of an additional 5,500 employees, 3,000 of them young people.</P>
    <P>The employment action team established by the Government to identify suitable employment projects for young people have presented their first report to the Minister for Labour who is at present giving it urgent consideration. In addition, measures have been taken to stimulate further development of small industries.  While each such industry employs very few people, there are so many of them and the scope for more is so great that, in aggregate, they have the potential to make a significant contribution to increasing employment. The programme we promised to switch spending from imports to home products is at an advanced stage of consideration.  Further job creation opportunities have been identified and decisions will be announced in due course.</P>
    <P>But it is not in this area that the major drive for new jobs must come. The second part of our strategy involves the creation of conditions in which the private sector will take over as the primary agent of growth and generate additional sustainable employment. This involves a stimulus for investment.  This in turn requires buoyant demand and an improvement in our competitive position, to ensure that increases in demand will not benefit only those in other countries who sell us goods and services of higher quality or lower prices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1361" /> There are many hopeful signs that we can achieve the sort of export-led growth we need.  In 1977, the rate of economic growth was at about 5 per cent which puts us near the top of the league internationally.  A substantial expansion of business investment, a significant improvement in private consumption and a rapid increase in industrial exports have been the main factors underlying our performance.  And there has been a remarkable upsurge in agriculture.</P>
    <P>Investment has been dynamic this year.  To judge by trends in imports of producer's capital goods, the principal impetus has come from the private sector.  Capital formation in real terms in machinery and equipment probably grew by about 15 per cent.  Consumer demand grew through the year and an increase of 4½ per cent is the estimated out-turn.  It is probably true to say than an improvement in consumer confidence has played a large part in inducing the revival in consumption following its weak trend in recent years.</P>
    <P>For the second year running the rise in the volume of our industrial exports will be well above that of world trade in manufactures.  It now looks as if the value of our exports this year will amount to £2,500 million or almost 35 per cent more than in 1976.</P>
    <P>A most encouraging feature of the 1977 returns is the continued increase in the importance of the continental EEC countries as a market for Irish exports.  In January-October, 1977, which is the latest period for which detailed statistics are available, our exports to the seven continental members of the EEC advanced by more than 47 per cent&mdash;the highest rate of increase recorded for any of our principal markets.  We sold over 30 per cent more to the UK, 23 per cent to the EFTA countries and over 20 per cent more to North America.  These figures reflect the policy of seeking a better geographical distribution of our exports and a reduction in our dependence on one market.  Córas Tráchtála are diverting an increased share of their current resources to the support of company marketing programmes aimed at these European markets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1362" /> Industry, generally, has also fared well.  In the first half of this year, output was more than 8 per cent higher than a year earlier.  The year-on-year increases in July and August, though not as high as in the first six months, are also encouraging.  In any event, the third quarter is not a good guideline to output trends because of the holiday period.</P>
    <P>What is even more encouraging is that employment in industry continues to rise.  In the second quarter it was 6,500 higher than a year earlier.  For the year as a whole, numbers at work should show an average rise of about 7,000.  This is the sort of foundation on which we can build if we manage our affairs properly.</P>
    <P>Few of our major industries have suffered more in recent years than building and construction.  This sector has been allowed to decline to the extent that unemployment has doubled in four years&mdash;reaching an all-time record of almost 26,000 at the beginning of 1977.  Already we can see the signs of recovery&mdash;resulting from the stimulatory measures taken by the Government.  The trend in cement sales is encouraging and the monthly index of employees in the private building sector suggests that employment in the industry is now rising.</P>
    <P>I shall deal now with agriculture. The year 1977 has been a good one for farmers.  Gross agricultural output rose by an estimated 30 per cent in value and there will be a volume increase of about 9 per cent.  This is a reversal of the position in 1976 when output fell.  The growth achieved in 1977 has come mainly from milk, beef and cereals but pigs and horticulture have also registered significant improvements.</P>
    <P>The prices of some of our more important products have risen by 30 per cent or more.  While some sectors, notably sheep and potatoes, have not benefited efforts are being made to improve market conditions for these products.</P>
    <P>In general, the prices of the main agricultural inputs such as fertilisers and feed stuffs have not risen to the same extent as producer prices and so <Col N="1363" /> cost conditions in agriculture are now more favourable.  These developments should lead to a further increase in output next year.  The increased reinvestment of profits from this year, particularly in improved grassland management and better livestock, should provide a firm basis for improved prosperity in farming.</P>
    <P>The encouraging performance of industrial exports during 1977 has been matched by the growth in agricultural exports, which are estimated to have increased by approximately 30 per cent in value.</P>
    <P>The potential of the food industry has now been exhaustively researched and the next few years should see that potential exploited to a much greater degree.  The processing of native raw materials is an essential element in the Government's strategy for economic development.</P>
    <P>The proportion of the working population engaged in agriculture has fallen from over 34 per cent in 1961 to something over 20 per cent now. With the markets of Europe open to us and the prosperity I have mentioned as a basis for confidence and expansion in coming years, we expect some decrease in the rate of decline.  The contribution of agriculture to the creation of employment is a factor we cannot afford to overlook.</P>
    <P>I shall deal now with industrial relations.  If we are to prosper we must create employment in industry and services. There can be no question that our tax and grant regimes provide attractive incentives for industrialists thinking of investing here.  But there are intangible factors which can often be as important to an investor as incentives measured in terms of cashflow and discount rates.  Social stability is one of these factors.  A pleasant environment is another.  And good industrial relations is a third.</P>
    <P>The prominence given to industrial disputes does not, I hope, hide the fact that harmonious industrial relations exist in the vast majority of undertakings throughout the country.  However, certain aspects of industrial relations now give rise to concern.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> Perhaps the most disturbing aspect is the tendency for individuals and small groups of workers to resort to unofficial action.  This can often result in the complete stoppage of work at a plant.  It is particularly hard to justify when agreed procedures for the resolution of disputes exist.  In the short-term it can, as we have seen, cause great hardship and do irreparable damage.  In the long-term, it can injure the status and acceptability of the trade union movement, as the guardian of the rights of workers.  The fact that a grievance exists is not a reason for striking out blindly, regardless of consequences.  All of us&mdash;the trade unions, employers and Government&mdash;have an obligation to see that order prevails.  Anarchy is to no one's benefit.</P>
    <P>It has been the tradition and continues to be the Government's preference that both sides of industry should themselves regulate industrial relations, practices and procedures. Nevertheless, the Government must intervene in the national interest, if the parties themselves cannot resolve the new and apparently intractable issues which have been emerging.</P>
    <P>I believe there is an urgent need at the present time for a fundamental reappraisal of industrial relations.  The Minister for Labour has announced his intention to have a review undertaken of the subject.  The review will be commencing soon and will, I hope, provide a framework for the introduction of reforms, in the interest not only of the national economy but of workers themselves&mdash;who suffer more than most from strikes and industrial disruption.</P>
    <P>As it may be some time before the recommendations of the review body will appear, the Minister for Labour has also indicated his intention to meet shortly with representatives of employers and trade unions for discussions on those industrial relations problems which need to be tackled without further delay.  Our existing system of industrial relations has, despite shortcomings, generally worked well, and it would be my wish that the forthcoming discussions will lead to a <Col N="1365" /> number of improvements in the system in the short-term.</P>
    <P>I come now to the European Social Fund.</P>
    <P>What makes unemployment now so intractable is the pace and nature of change in industry and industrial processes.  Investment in new plant is essential if industry is to survive. Equally important is investment in the efficiency of the men and women working in our factories, fields and offices.</P>
    <P>The European Social Fund provides assistance for certain types of vocational training and resettlement schemes, including programmes of vocational rehabilitation for handicapped workers.  Up to the beginning of December, 1977, social fund grants totalling over £50 million have been approved and further grants amounting to about £10 million are to be approved shortly.  These grants have enabled us to develop our national training systems at a far more rapid pace than would otherwise have been possible.</P>
    <P>The Government expect that the social fund will continue to provide valuable assistance to this country in building up its training facilities.  Our main criticisms of the fund are twofold. Firstly, we consider that it is inadequately financed having regard to the magnitude of the problems with which it has to deal, especially regional problems and problems relating to employment for young persons.  Secondly, we believe that the scope of the fund should be extended to enable it to provide assistance for employment measures other than occasional training and resettlement, specifically for measures which would help to create more employment for young persons.  In that connection, we are encouraged that the Council has asked the Commission to submit proposals for introducing a new fund aid for employment measures, centering on young persons.  We will be pressing strongly for the adoption of such an aid as quickly as possible and, of course, for the provision of additional resources to finance the new measures.</P>
    <P>What I have been talking about mainly concerns efficiency and morale <Col N="1366" /> in the private sector.  The public sector also requires to concern itself with these problems.  There are now about 270,000 persons employed in the public sector, in its widest definition. What happens in that sector and the way it does its business can have a large influence on our affairs as a nation.</P>
    <P>On my appointment as Taoiseach I indicated my intention of making some fundamental changes in the organisation of public business at Government level.  These changes are virtually complete. The Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy now has responsibility for all aspects of energy from exploration to use, thus ending the irrational division of functions in this area; the Department of Local Government has become the Department of the Environment and is being reoriented towards a greater concern with environmental matters.</P>
    <P>Two measures have been enacted to amend the Ministers and Secretaries Acts.  The first established the Department of Economic Planning and Development which is well on the way to providing a co-ordinated public sector planning system.  The second provided for increased support to Government Ministers and, with the appointments of Ministers of State which I have announced, the basic reorganisation which was envisaged is complete.  I propose to appoint Deputies Raphael P. Burke, Ray MacSharry and John O'Leary to be Ministers of State at the Departments of Industry, Commerce and Energy, Public Service and Environment respectively.  The existing Parliamentary Secretaries will be redesignated Ministers of State in the Departments in which they now serve.</P>
    <P>These appointments and redesignations will be effective as of 1st January, 1978.</P>
    <P>So far I have concentrated mainly on the traditional areas of concern.  However, if the events of recent years have meant anything they must bring home to us the extent of our vulnerability to fluctuations in the price or supply of oil, coal and other sources of energy. <Col N="1367" /> We are among the countries of Europe which rely most on external sources for energy supplies.  And the extent of our imports in themselves constitutes a huge burden on our payments balance. Six years ago we paid less than £70 million for our oil imports.  This year we will be paying close on £250-300 million.</P>
    <P>This is a situation to which the Government will be giving closest attention. We cannot really contemplate a situation of full employment in a country when a sum equivalent to perhaps £100 for every man, woman and child has to be paid abroad annually for one single commodity.</P>
    <P>Industrial training, public service reorganisation, energy policy and indeed all aspects of Government action are being slanted in the direction I have indicated&mdash;towards the creation of more opportunities for employment. Taxation and fiscal policy will have the same general motivation.  And so also will what we do in relation to infrastructure and the environment.</P>
    <P>Employment in the construction industry has varied upwards and downwards of the figure of 70,000 over the past decade or so.  Indeed, the industry is ideally constituted to absorb the flow of workers from the land.  And what the industry produces is essential to a sound economy.  Workers must have houses&mdash;and the construction of every house requires just short of one man year of employment.  The 25,000 or so houses a year now being built is useful not only for the accommodation which the programme provides but for the employment it gives both directly and in ancillary industries supplying cement, timber, furniture and all the other fittings that go into a modern home.  The Government will continue as they have begun, to support the housing programme.</P>
    <P>Similarly, transport facilities in our country are in substantial need of modernisation.  The roads system carries substantially more than 90 per cent of all our internal passenger and freight traffic.  No industry can prosper for long if it is burdened with unnecessary transport costs&mdash;brought about by delays at the docks, on the roads or <Col N="1368" /> in any other part of the system.  The improvement of the infrastructure in this respect must be as much part of any drive for new industry as the construction of factories themselves.  We need to look both at the level of our expenditure on the roads system and the way in which it is allocated, so as to ensure that we are getting the best value for the expenditure in creating a modern and efficient transport system&mdash;which serves our basic purpose of creating an economy capable of sustaining a high and remunerative level of employment.</P>
    <P>This programme must be accompanied by measures for the protection and improvement of the environment. I have already referred to our decision to create a new Department of that name.  Indeed, the protection of the physical environment from pollution and of communities from decay through lack of recreational and other facilities is one of the Government's major concerns.  We are making substantial progress in relation to the provision of water for industrial and domestic use and&mdash;indeed to such an extent that many of us now have come to regard the problem as being no longer of serious dimensions.  Considerable progress has been made in the control of water pollution.  We have extended the Housing Act which controls the demolition and change of use of dwellings, for a further two years.  In implementing the job creation programmes we have provided a special scheme of grants for local authorities which will not only benefit the community by improving playgrounds, parks, providing extra car-parking facilities, access to beaches, scenic areas and so on but will give much needed additional employment.</P>
    <P>Ultimately the purpose of all programmes of economic advancement is the security and well-being of the individual citizen.  I do not think anyone can claim that we are neglectful in this area.</P>
    <P>In 1966, there were 856,000 persons or 30 per cent of the population with full eligibility under the health services. In 1977, there are about 1,200,000 or 38 per cent of the population so eligible.  Similarly the number <Col N="1369" /> of recipients of weekly social welfare payments and their dependants has risen from 19 per cent of the population in 1966 to about 30 per cent of the population now.  With these large proportions involved, it must be the concern of any Government to ensure that health and welfare expenditure is directed to where it is most needed and can do most good.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of the Government to ensure that the value of welfare payments is, at the minimum, maintained in line with cost of living increases, and where possible to increase those payments especially where there is greatest need.</P>
    <P>In the health services, we have embarked on a substantial programme of hospital building and renovation in many areas of the country and the Minister for Health has undertaken a comprehensive review of the areas of need&mdash;to see if legislation requires revision, facilities are in need of rationalisation or other changes are necessary to improve the quality or the efficiency of the service.</P>
    <P>Our concern with Northern Ireland goes even deeper, if that is possible, than our concern with the economic problems of employment and inflation. When so much suffering is at stake and so many lives have been lost or are at risk, it is hard to think purely in economic terms.  But, however difficult the task, it is salutary occasionally to do so.</P>
    <P>Since the troubles began in Northern Ireland in 1969, the extra cost to the Exchequer here of increased security, compensation, industrial grants, etc., has been of the order of £200 million. This figure does not include the loss to our economy through the decline in tourism, and possibly also though to a more limited extent, in lost industrial investment.  If employment is to be the theme of Government strategy then economic co-operation with Northern Ireland does indeed make sense in a very real way.  Every Deputy in this House could, I imagine, devise without difficulty schemes for the use of the sums I have mentioned&mdash;to promote employment, to provide incentives for industry, to improve the infrastructure and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1370" /> The problems in Northern Ireland are not fundamentally economic but a sensible approach to economic problems can do much to alleviate the suffering there and help progress in both parts of our island.</P>
    <P>It was these considerations which lay behind the agreement I reached with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Callaghan, in our discussions in London last September.  I had the opportunity at the European Council of reviewing with Mr. Callaghan developments in Northern Ireland since then.</P>
    <P>Meetings between the officials of our two Governments, including representatives from Northern Ireland Departments, have been held in London and Dublin and further meetings at official level are planned.  These meetings will be followed by a Ministerial meeting early in the new year.  They have been conducted in a friendly and constructive atmosphere, and I am hopeful of worth-while results.  For the present, however, it would not be timely to give specific details of the matters being discussed.</P>
    <P>On security, the situation in Northern Ireland seems to be getting better. In the first nine months of this year, the number of deaths as a result of terrorist activity has been reduced by almost two-thirds, the number of shooting incidents by one-third and the number of bomb explosions by more than one half.  These improvements give no grounds for complacency.  They still represent a level of violence intolerable in a civilised society.</P>
    <P>Where I think particular care must be taken is in the disposition of security forces of a certain type or tradition in particular areas in Northern Ireland.  This is a matter which can cause great trouble.  I do not need to underline its sensitivity.  There is just no point in taking unnecessary risks.</P>
    <P>Of course, what is even more important than measures to counter violence is a political settlement.  The most immediate progress could come about through the development of an accord among political parties and interests in Northern Ireland.  As Deputies are aware, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has written to all the main <Col N="1371" /> political parties there, outlining a framework for further talks at official level on an interim devolution arrangement. Our commitment to a system of power-sharing or participation acceptable to representatives of both sections of the Community in Northern Ireland is well known.</P>
    <P>Equally well known is our belief that any long-term solution of the problem in Northern Ireland depends on the recognition of the legitimacy of the aspiration of the majority of the people of the island to unity, achieved by consent and under agreed institutions. Any other solution can only be temporary, as have been the solutions during the past 60 years.</P>
    <P>When I was speaking yesterday I said that I would go in more detail today into the analysis by the European Council on the economic and monetary situation.  I want to do this now because it has a bearing on the discussions going on about the possibility of a pay agreement in 1978. These discussions should not take place in isolation from the way in which the economies of the countries with which we trade, and on which we depend for our prosperity are developing.</P>
    <P>In 1977, we will sell abroad substantially more than 40 per cent of all the goods we produce.  Of these exports, about three quarters will go to the countries of the European Community. In addition, we depend on those countries for substantial revenues from tourism, services and investment. Therefore, what is happening in Europe is of vital concern to us.  If Europe prospers, economic management here can be comparatively relaxed.  If it does not, we will feel it in the prices we pay, in our job prospects and in our pockets.</P>
    <P>The heads of Government in Brussels had before them estimates of the extent of the problems now in vital sectors of industry in Europe.</P>
    <P>In steel, which is of fundamental importance to European prosperity, the industry is working at 60 per cent of capacity.  Steel companies are in growing financial difficulty so serious as to put the future of some of them in <Col N="1372" /> jeopardy.  There is world over-capacity in shipbuilding.  The Community have a capacity to build almost twice the forecast level of demand, over the next four or five years.  This means that 75,000 jobs out of 165,000 are in danger. In textiles, 272,000 jobs have been lost already, 166,000 of them in the clothing industry.  Even with capacity at its present level there will, on the Commission's estimates, be substantial over-capacity up to 1981.</P>
    <P>These problems are compounded by the way in which the population of Europe is increasing.  Over the next four or five years, it will go up by about 6 million: but because of demographic factors, there will be an extra 9 million workers coming on the labour market.  This, in itself, would pose problems of extraordinary difficulty in economic management, even in times of the greatest prosperity.  But this is not such a time.  In Europe now there are 6 million people unemployed, or a total of approximately 5.7 per cent of the labour force.</P>
    <P>The likelihood is that, on present policies, the growth rate in Europe next year will be of the order of 3½ per cent.  This may sound reasonable. However, it is necessary to bear in mind also the estimate of the Commission that a growth rate of between 4 and 4½ per cent is necessary simply to maintain employment at its existing level.  In other words, if the lower forecast is borne out by events, the present intolerable rate of unemployment in the Community will increase further in 1978.</P>
    <P>In October, the Council of Finance Ministers approved a strategy with the objective of a growth rate of 4 to 4½ per cent and the European Council agreed that every effort should be made to implement that strategy.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most encouraging feature is that Britain, which is still our major market, is expected to turn in the best performance for several years in 1978, with a growth rate of about 3 per cent.  There is also the obvious recognition at the highest political level in the Community of the need for policies to encourage expansion&mdash;if it can be achieved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1373" /> An acceptable international rate of growth is dependent upon decisions yet to be taken by other Governments. This means that there is a question mark over the outlook for international trade in 1978.  There is substantial spare capacity internationally. It is certain that conditions in 1978 will be tough.  Opportunities there will be, but if we were to grasp them we will be in competition with the strongest economies in the world, with the most up-to-date technology, and in some cases an enviable record of industrial peace.  What is perhaps most relevant of all is the consensus which emerged among the heads of Government in Brussels that if Europe is to pull out of recession and if employment is to grow, as it must to ensure political and social stability, there can be no real increase in wages in the Community in the coming year.</P>
    <P>This has relevance here.  On figures produced in <i>Trade Union Information</i>, to go no further, there will be an increase of approximately 3.5 per cent in the real earnings of persons working in manufacturing in 1977.  The proposals in the manifesto to which the people of this country gave over-whelming support last June will produce a further substantial increase in 1978.</P>
    <P>This is on the basis of a 5 per cent increase in wages and adjustments in taxation.  Every Deputy in this House knows, for example, that a married man with two children on £80 a week may pay about £14 in income tax. Does he really worry if the benefit to him comes from a reduction in this burden&mdash;or from an increase in his wages, which, I may say, will, in turn, be subject to further taxtion?  It is all money in his pocket, one way or the other.</P>
    <P>In deciding on their strategy, the Government have taken fully into account the position of wage earners as compared with persons depending on other forms of income.  The proportion of profits in national income has declined in recent years.  It is from profits that investment is financed.  And it is on investment that jobs depend.  In their own interests, workers cannot allow this trend to <Col N="1374" /> continue.  And for a Government to base a policy on any other assumptions would be economic lunacy.</P>
    <P>Between 1973 and 1976 the increase in average earnings in agriculture has been less proportionately than the increase in the average weekly earnings of industrial workers, so that should not be an issue in negotiations.  In any event, I am not sure of the relevance of the comparison.  Agricultural incomes fluctuate with the weather, upwards and downwards, to a degree which most workers would not find tolerable.</P>
    <P>I mention these points because they are part of the background against which any future wages settlement must be negotiated.  The Government will be putting approximately £300 million on the table in these negotiations. They are doing this against the background in Europe I have outlined. They are doing it to create 25,000 extra jobs next year&mdash;and get down an intolerable rate of unemployment. That indeed is the crucial issue in the wage negotiations.  The talks are not only about wages, they are also about jobs.  How many persons in this House would be party to an agreement which negotiated his neighbour and perhaps himself out of a job?</P>
    <P>The second major issue in the negotiation is prices.  In the year to November, 1976, our inflation rate was over 20 per cent.  Although the November, 1977 figure has not yet been published, it should be close to 12 per cent.  If the Government's proposals are accepted, we can look forward next year to a further reduction to approximately 7 per cent.</P>
    <P>I should like to dwell a little further on this point.  Every increase in incomes over and above the underlying increase in productivity in our economy&mdash;usually estimated at about 4 per cent&mdash;causes an increase in prices: and this increase in prices applies to the total income of the worker or investor, not just the increase in his income.  Therefore, apart altogether from the effect on jobs of income increases which are too far removed from the underlying growth in productivity, these increases can defeat their <Col N="1375" /> own purpose.  Through the price rises they cause they can destroy, in real terms, half or two-thirds of the increase: income tax will take the remainder.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the manifesto are a package.  They cover incomes, prices, taxation, welfare and employment. The pleasurable items cannot be abstracted and the rest discarded.  We are not living in easy times and any action of ours based on the supposition that we are would be folly.  We have recently seen the effects locally of ignoring economic realities.  We cannot, as a nation, take the same course. The proposals on pay, employment and prices which the Government have advanced can achieve a breakthrough and bring our country to a prosperity it has never before experienced.  Last June the people gave their verdict on the package.  We expect those immediately concerned now to be equally pragmatic.</P>
    <P>I do not say this lightly.  Literally, we are at a turning point.  Things are improving.  Employment is up; unemployment is down.  And, despite the stagnation in international trade, this process is continuing, if not accelerating. We are in sight next year of a growth rate which would be a record for us and amongst the highest in Europe.</P>
    <P>But all of this can be changed if we take the wrong direction.  We could find ourselves plunged again into the sort of recession from which we are just emerging&mdash;with unemployment at substantially more than 100,000 and still rising, and pervasive fear on job security.  This is a consequence the Government will do all in their power to avoid.  And it is on these imperatives that the strategy in the manifesto is based.</P>
    <P>This has been a dramatic and a decisive year for our people and our country.  We based our election campaign on the belief that there is a great deal that we can do as a nation to overcome the many difficulties confronting us.  The people have clearly affirmed their support for that view. We have already taken the first steps <Col N="1376" /> on the road to national recovery.  We will press ahead with that campaign in 1978.  The Government will seek and are entitled to expect the support of all sections of the community in their attack on unemployment and inflation. We must not allow our efforts or our energies to be dissipated on matters of a more local or more immediate nature, whatever the merits of these issues might be.</P>
    <P>We have not come into office to perpetuate or repeat the confusion and despondency of the past four years.  We know that the Irish people can and will respond to challenges and will overcome difficulties, however great they might seem, once they are given leadership of courage and conviction.</P>

      <P>The first thing I want to do is to congratulate Deputy Burke, Deputy MacSharry and Deputy John O'Leary on their appointments as Ministers of State.  Frankly, I would have expected the Taoiseach to say in what capacity they are to work.  When the Minister for Finance introduced the Bill appointing the ten Ministers of State I complained that the Taoiseach should have come in and justified the three extra appointments and said which series of responsibilities these appointees would have.  This morning the Taoiseach in proposing the appointments of the three Deputies merely told us they were going to the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, the Department of the Environment and the Department of the Public Service respectively.  Does that mean that Deputy John O'Leary will have responsibility for energy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I should have said Deputy Burke.  He goes to the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.  Will he be responsible for energy or will the present Minister retain that responsibility and will Deputy Burke have other responsibilities?  It has been repeated a number of times that these Ministers will have extra responsibilities <Col N="1377" /> and specific duties to perform. The House should be told exactly what these duties will be because we shall not have an opportunity of expressing either agreement or disagreement until they have been operating in their Departments for a number of months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt?  It is not a matter for the House in the sense that the House does not vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that but, when the Bill was before the House, I asked that the Taoiseach would come in and explain exactly what he intended these three new Ministers to do in their respective Departments.  If, as appears from the Taoiseach's introductory statement, Deputy Burke will be in charge of energy in the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, that is a wrong decision.  Again, I do not know whether this will be so and I am arguing on the basis that it will be the position.  Bringing together all facets of energy under one Department is the correct decision.  Before I was changed from the Department of Transport and Power I was asking that all energy would be brought under the Minister for Transport and Power.  It does not really matter which Department it is so long as the total energy field is under one Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach says energy has assumed enormous importance in the last four years.  The effect on our balance of payments, on our industrial costs, on the capital necessary to allow Bord na Móna and the ESB to develop in such a way that we can decrease our dependence on imported energy and the effect on consumers who have to pay eventually this huge extra bill makes this possibly one of the most important concerns for the Government and, indeed, for the people generally.  No matter how able or how hardworking the Minister of State concerned <Col N="1378" /> is, it should be the charge of an actual Cabinet member because the Minister of State will not be attending Cabinet meetings and the effects of decisions made in the energy field will have a bearing on most of the Departments of Government, particularly those dealing with the environment, industry and commerce, transport, aviation and tourism.  All these areas are affected by energy costs and this should be under the control of a Minister of the Government as opposed to a Minister of State.</P>
    <P>The very decisions being taken in the Council of Ministers of the EEC regarding energy are important and there is a very thorny question on which the whole country will have to focus attention in the very near future. It is the question of the substitute form of energy when the fossil fuels run out at the end of this century, as they are prophesied to do, and whether we should build a nuclear reactor.  The decision was taken by the previous Government at the beginning of the oil crisis to allow the ESB to go ahead in the planning of that station. Whether we actually build the station or not is a matter which should exercise the minds of the whole population, not just the Members of the Oireachtas.  The decision taken will have far-reaching effects.  The experts say that without nuclear energy there is no possibility of meeting the energy demands of the world beyond the year 2025 but we must be conscious that a satisfactory solution has not yet been found for the disposal of uranium waste.  The effects of this waste will last for 500 years and decisions made in the near future will affect 15 or 20 generations to come.</P>
    <P>I presume that the appointment of a Minister of State for the Public Service will mean that the Minister for Finance, who is also the Minister for the Public Service, will no longer take immediate responsibility for the Public Service, though his will be the ultimate responsibility.  Regarding the appointment of a Minister of State in the Department of the Environment, it would appear from the Taoiseach's speech that the responsibility of this Minister will be roads and transport, <Col N="1379" /> even though there is a Minister for Transport already.  There would seem to be the same conflict arising here as arose between the Department of Transport and Power and the Department of Industry and Commerce in relation to energy.  These are points which the Taoiseach should have cleared up and I hope that the Tánaiste will do so later in the debate.</P>
    <P>An adjournment debate has traditionally given the House a chance to criticise the performance of the Government during the previous 12 months.  We now have the chance to criticise the performance of two Governments because the year was evenly divided between the Coalition Government and the present administration.  I find myself at a disadvantage because from this side of the House I could very well have made the same speech which the Taoiseach made this morning. It is a long list of pluses in the economy which are a direct result of what we did in Government.  He talked about the improvement in the security situation, unemployment coming down, inflation at 12 per cent which is an improvement on last year, industrial growth up, exports up and an increase in economic activity of 10 per cent.  All these are a result of the actions and policies of the previous administration. At the time of the last adjournment debate in this House in July, 1976, there was also unrest amongst bank officials and it is peculiar that this is again the case.  During that debate, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Cosgrave, and the then Minister for Finance told the House that we were beginning to see our way out of the recession which affected our economy and the economies of the world, with the exception of the oil-producing states, since the autumn of 1973, and that if we managed our affairs prudently and accepted discipline we should within 18 months be on the road to recovery and to a level of prosperity virtually unknown in this country for two generations.  The Taoiseach this morning used nearly the same words to say we are now in that position. Towards the end of his speech he said that the prospects for 1978 can be extremely good.  We had pointed out <Col N="1380" /> that road in the summer of 1976 and again in the budget early this year and we repeated the message during the general election that there were no easy options, that the choice was between jobs and higher incomes for those already at work.  This message was scorned at the time and rejected as not being realistic but it has proved to be correct and, as the Taoiseach said this morning, it is now the policy being adopted for the years ahead by the present administration.</P>
    <P>Last year many forecasters were prophesying a zero growth rate for 1976 and we prophesied a growth rate of 2½ per cent or 3½ per cent.  It turned out to be 3½ per cent and our industrial output rose by 10 per cent.  These successes during the past 18 months should be seen against the background of the £ for £ link with sterling and the effect on our economy of the huge drop in the value of sterling in the summer and autumn of last year, a drop which could have pushed outside our control our inflation rate which we had been successfully grappling with, bringing down and getting under control.  They said the budget of last January, combined with a moderate wage agreement&mdash;they knew they were being told the truth by both sides of industry, the unions and employers&mdash; was essential for our economic future. I am glad that that message at that time was heard and acted on.  That moderate wage agreement, together with the injection of £100 million in the last budget, meant that we could with confidence during the election predict that our economic growth for 1977 would be in the region of 5 or 6 per cent.  We predicted that inflation would be down to 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>Those figures have been confirmed this morning by the Taoiseach.  This further underlines that the strategies and policies pursued over our four years of protecting the weaker sections and moving the economy forward and taking advantage of any lift outside the country were the correct policies. That has proved to be so.  The picture at the time of the election this year was of a country with one of the highest growth rates in the OECD, with falling unemployment, falling inflation <Col N="1381" /> and an economy that was soundly based with policies, the impetus of which carried us through our last six months and the present administration forward on the course we chartered.  We predicted that 1977 would be one of the most successful years for the Irish economy for many years.  An added bonus which the present administration received was the revaluing of sterling by 4 per cent in the last few months.  An economy that imports roughly 40 to 50 per cent of its goods cannot but benefit by a reduction of 4 per cent in that price in its fight against inflation.</P>
    <P>The present administration came in at a time perfect for a new Government. Unemployment was falling, prices internally and externally were falling and all the indicators for a booming economy were present.  Sales in the ESB increased by 10 per cent in the first eight months.  Cement sales, as the Taoiseach stated, increased between May and August by 7 per cent. The Taoiseach attributed this to the new Government, even though the rise in the cement sales commenced in May and cannot be credited to the change of Government but rather to the change in weather.  Cement sales were low for the first four months of this year because the weather at that time meant a slowing down in the construction industry.  Immediately it improved cement sales jumped to 7 per cent in the following four months over the corresponding period of the previous year.</P>
    <P>The Government have now run 10 per cent approximately of their term of office&mdash;based on the fact that the average run of Irish Governments is three-and-a-half to four years.  In that time the only legislation that has come to the House has been legislation which we left in the pipeline with the exception of two measures, increasing the number of Parliamentary Secretaries and changing their titles to Ministers of State and the appointment of Deputy O'Donoghue as Minister for Economic Planning and Development. The other legislation introduced was being prepared before we left office. The attitudes of the Ministers of the present administration also changed. <Col N="1382" /> The things they sneered at for six months prior to the election they now find, or allege to find, or profess to find, the correct course of action.</P>
    <P>We all remember that during the budget debate when we looked for, and got, co-operation from the social partners on both sides of industry, when we said that everybody had a responsibility, strong words were uttered by the Opposition side of the House.  We had the thumping of the table, statements that Governments must govern and that it was not anybody's duty except the Government's to do things.  Now the picture has changed.  The Government are now saying that people must be responsible and we are hearing phrases like &ldquo;We will do certain things if we get co-operation.&rdquo; The latest one was used by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on television recently.  He said: &ldquo;If management and unions adopt the sensible approach...&rdquo;.  Such phrases abound in speeches by the Taoiseach and Ministers recently.  They do not do any service to our people or to their own credibility when they so quickly change their minds and their stance. Their present stance is correct but the degree of irresponsibility shown by them in Opposition is bound to reflect on their credibility as they are seen not to fulfil&mdash;not the small print of their manifesto&mdash;the impression they gave of what was in the manifesto. That is the dangerous thing, the raising of expectations that will be impossible to fill.</P>
    <P>A Minister sometime ago told us that the wage negotiations were no concern of theirs, that this was a matter between unions and employers.  Of the budget of almost £2,000 million, 35 per cent was for pay in the public sector.  In the broadest sense 270,000 people are paid by the Government.  Of course they should be seeking to influence the levels of pay increases in the national good.  But the Government by their actions and by the atmosphere they created during the election campaign have raised people's expectations.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the formation of his Department the Minister for <Col N="1383" /> Economic Planning and Development spoke in contradictory terms of what could be expected by way of a combination of the manifesto proposals to cut taxes and a 5 per cent wage agreement. His figures have been easy to contradict, even by first-year economic students.  The figures represent a series of double counting.  The Minister says correctly that in the manifesto the proposals to abolish car tax and rates were taken as part of a total package for the wage agreement but this was never underlined or appreciated because the manifesto was produced about a month before the election and at that time members of Fianna Fáil did not disillusion anyone who chose to believe that in addition to the abolition of rates and car tax there would be income tax cuts and wage increases. The Minister said that inflation at 7 per cent and the abolition of car tax would give to workers a real income increase.  He included the abolition of rates and car tax as a contribution to bringing inflation down to 7 per cent but went on to say at the same time that part of the real wage increase would be by way of not having to pay rates or car tax.</P>
    <P>At a time leading up to what will be perhaps the most serious discussions of an economic nature ever to be engaged in, discussions that will be much more important than this adjournment debate, the Minister must be contributing to the difficulty for both sides of industry in reaching an agreement by his launching of a series of contradictory figures.  All of us here agree that a moderate wage settlement is of vital importance to our economic future.  If we allow our competitive costs to get out of line with those in Great Britain or to get too much out of line with those in other EEC countries or in any other counntry with which we trade, our exports must suffer and employment in export industry as well as in the agricultural industry must suffer too.</P>
    <P>The Government have not helped in any way to bring about an atmosphere in which a moderate wage increase would be possible.  I trust that those who sit around the negotiating table <Col N="1384" /> will regard anything that has been said by Ministers in the past six months as being mere euphoria engendered by a return to office and, in some cases, elevation to the Cabinet.  The negotiators, hopefully, will regard the situation not on the basis of promises or otherwise in the Fianna Fáil manifesto but on the basis of what is good for the country.  We hope for an agreement that will ensure fairness to those at work and, equally important, an expansion of employment so that those out of work may be employed.</P>
    <P>In one way I suppose we should be thankful that, perhaps because of the financial realism of somebody behind the scenes, the promises of the manifesto are not being implemented fully. For instance, the £1,000 flat grant for new houses becomes £1,000 for firsttime house buyers.  Taking into consideration the abolition of the grants that existed up to the coming into operation of this new grant, in some cases the recipients will benefit to the extent only of £100 extra because they would have qualified for grants totalling £900 under the old system.</P>
    <P>There has been, too, the undignified scampering of the Minister for Education before a bunch of irate students who were calling for increased grants. The Minister sanctioned the increases but not an increased eligibility level, although that also was a promise of the manifesto.</P>
    <P>We were promised an immediate prices policy whereby the people would be informed about increases by way of television and the newspapers.  This policy was to incorporate a dynamic Buy Irish campaign and to this extent there was mention of 10,000 jobs.  Instead, we have had the pathetic performance of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy last week who, on being asked why this policy had not been implemented, said that he sent his Parliamentary Secretary to Radio Éireann but that the people there were not interested in talking to her.  This is comic opera stuff.  If the maximum prices permissible are published in the papers every month and their publication paid for, why can the Government not do the same so far as advertising on television is concerned. <Col N="1385" /> What we have had is a furtive effort to conceal prices.  An order is made allowing for an increase in the price of coal but this is not announced by the Minister.  Rather the coal company announced on a Friday evening after their office has closed that the price of coal will be increased on the following Monday morning.  There was no warning of this increase and no concern for the poorest sections of the community for whom coal is one of the essentials of life.  As an indication of how much further these people are being squeezed, the cheap fuel scheme, under which two hundredweights of coal was given per week or per month to those on social welfare benefit, was changed this year.  They no longer get the voucher for the quantity of coal or turf involved; they get a sum of money. Even though the sum of money is sufficient at present to buy the amount of coal that the voucher provided previously, if the price of coal went up under the voucher system they were covered for a quantity of coal, whereas under this system they will get less. One of the debates here earlier this year was on the price of coal and Deputy O'Malley, the then spokesman, said that the poor could freeze to death.  That was an ironic statement on the attitude of the Government. Now the poor can freeze to death in a much shorter time under the present administration.</P>
    <P>On industrial relations, I do not want to mull over the unhappy history of the closure of the Ferenka plant in Limerick with the consequent unemployment of 1,400 people there and others who were supplying it.  I hope that the stance adopted by two Ministers during October and November this year had no deeper motivation than the endeavour to pass the buck from one to another.  Even though he advised us to be careful of what we said and to choose our words carefully lest we damage the situation, the Minister for Labour made no contact for six weeks prior to the closure with either of the unions involved.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy says that he was only told on the morning of the closure by telephone call from Holland that this factory was due to shut.  Even though <Col N="1386" /> the Minister may have got final word on that day, if we are to believe his contribution during the Private Members' Time debate he was convinced that unless a solution was found the factory would close.  As far as we can judge, although we are not in possession of all the facts, the Government did not react in a positive way to the proposal by the Ferenka directors that the Government should take over the factory.  I accept that the Government were right in not accepting full responsibility for the Ferenka operations in Limerick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think a Government should become too involved in a highly specialised industry of that type.  However, there were other combinations of involvement possible.  If this company&mdash;and every comment by the Press since has seemed to confirm this&mdash;were producing a product which was in short supply and if their parent company had three months of unsatisfactory trading that made it necessary to seek other involvements to relieve the pressure on their finances, there was a whole series of positions between the 7½ per cent the Government owned and the 100 per cent which Ferenka wanted them to take over.  If the Government were serious in keeping that factory open they would have entered into negotiations. The Minister concerned would have said that the Government would not take it over but that it was possible that, if they sat down and talked, they could come to an arrangement somewhere between these positions that would be mutually satisfactory, that would keep the factory in production and would keep the people concerned in their jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first indication we have had of what this Government will do when faced with troubles of this nature.  There will be an undignified scramble to pass the buck, to make one Minister accept the odium and all of the bad publicity attached to it and, when the worst comes to the worst, there will be abuses and threats that everybody except those who have the <Col N="1387" /> responsibility, those who had a share-holding in the company, those who had the contacts at their disposal to do something about it, were at fault. The attitude adopted by the two unions was bad and some heads needed to be knocked together.  I do not know which was right or wrong.  I believe it is always possible to find a solution by talking.  If this Government and those Ministers were serious about seeking a solution, they could have spoken to the two unions and found a solution. It was not in the union's interest or in the interest of the 1,400 workers to shut down the factory.  The two unions should have been made to sit around the table to find a solution.  But nobody cared, except to see that, if the worst came to the worst, the odium did not fall on his shoulders.</P>
    <P>In relation to the promise of relieving domestic dwellings of the rates burden, obviously the system by which the local authorities recoup their shortfall had to be devised in a hurry.</P>

      <P>The system of putting a blanket of 11 per cent increase across the country is nonsense, and I ask the Taoiseach and his Minister to look at this again.  To give only the same increase to a developing area as to an area that is already developed is going to create tremendous problems, possibly unemployment, certainly shortages of services in many of these areas. This is the performance for the past six months of this Government who have been riding on the crest of a wave of economic resurgence which we produced by careful management of this economy during our period in office. Let them not mess it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this debate is to examine the Government's performance over the last six months since they took office.  When one compares this document which is the Fianna Fáil manifesto with the Taoiseach's speech here this morning one wonders just how cynical Fianna Fáil can be.  What was produced was a <Col N="1388" /> degree of irresponsibility unmatched in the history of this State.  I intend to examine a little more closely and compare what is stated unequivocally in that manifesto with the factual situation with regard to the Government's performance or even their continuing commitment to fulfilling the promises made in that manifesto.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach with his usual courtesy has informed me that because of the late start of the debate he will have to leave before I finish.  I accept his explanation, but I will restructure my speech somewhat to comment on a few items in the Taoiseach's speech. First of all, like the previous speaker, I congratulate the three Deputies, Deputy R. Burke, Deputy MacSharry and Deputy J. O'Leary who were announced as Ministers of State here this morning.  I agree that there is a necessity for new posts of this nature. Anyone who has any experience of Government would agree on the desirability of the creation of these posts. If I had any criticism to make it would be that not enough posts have been created.  There is one glaring omission, not with regard to names or personnel but with regard to Departments to which the three new Ministers of State have been assigned.  I notice that there is no Minister of State and there has been no Parliamentary Secretary assigned to the Minister for Health and Social Welfare.  Both of these are major Departments.  Both of them in the main deal with the most deprived section of our community.  This to me is a clear indication of the priority which Fianna Fáil intend to give to the underprivileged in our society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be, and I believe there are, internal reasons within Fianna Fáil why this decision may have been made in the way it was made.  I am not concerned with the internal difficulties in Fianna Fáil except where the price for those internal difficulties has to be paid by the underprivileged in Irish society.  This shameful decision was inspired, in my opinion, by shameful motives.  Surely there were other ways in which this <Col N="1389" /> problem within Fianna Fáil could be resolved.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this debate is to examine the record of the Government since they came into office on 5th July. Looking at the situation from last January up to the election in June, all the achievements with regard to the improvements in our economic circumstances spring directly and have been internationally identified as springing directly from the decisions made in last January's budget.  As a result of those decisions, difficult though some of them may have been to make, it was predicted by totally impartially international economic observers that our growth would be approximately 5 per cent because of those decisions.  The predicted growth is still 5 to 6 per cent.  There has been no change in that.  The rate of inflation was estimated to come out at approximately 30 per cent.  There has been little or no change in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>So what achievement can Fianna Fáil ascribe to their performance in Government?  They have had the benefit now of what was done in January and identified, not in political terms here in this House by one trying to score off the other, but by international economic commentators and people who are not only impartial but are very vocal with regard to the way we run our economy and who have indeed certain influence over the way we run our economy.  So the Government's achievement of any economic improvement is directly related to the budget of 1977.  The same applies to exports and to tourism.  These were all predictable and this was predicted long before the election.</P>
      <P>The difficulty which was recognised and which we did not overcome was unemployment.  That is still the main difficulty and the greatest social evil we have.  The manifesto, apart from the Santa Claus aspect, the car tax, the rates and the £1,000, illusory in some cases, on new houses&mdash;in the main concentrates on employment and prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at what Fianna Fáil said in relation to unemployment and prices <Col N="1390" /> and then let us look at what Fianna Fáil have done in relation to these two major aspects of our economic difficulties. The Government came into office as a result of a confidence trick. They called the tune in the manifesto. I believe the Irish people will pay the piper because there is no way the promises can be delivered, particularly by a Fianna Fáil administration.</P>
    <P>Before going into detail in regard to Fianna Fáil's promises, I should like to refer to Ferenka.  Ferenka has been a major disaster for the country as a whole and for one region in particular. These things can happen.  It is difficult to have winners if you do not have losers.  If we attract foreign industry as we do, it is possible that these things will happen, even with the best will in the world and with commitment and effort to prevent them happening.  That has not been the case with Ferenka.  I believe Ferenka would still be open had it not been for, in one case, the activity and, in the other case, the inactivity of two Government Ministers, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, for his activity, and the Minister for Labour, for his inactivity.</P>
    <P>We had a Private Members' Motion on Ferenka and we were told at that time by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy that he was first informed verbally that the company's intention was to get out and that they made a verbal offer to the Minister to take over the factory.  If one is to believe the Minister, as one does, he apparently dismissed that offer out of hand.  Because of his attitude, the light way in which he dismissed the offer, the directors of the parent company made the offer again on 23rd November, according to the Minister, but this time the offer was made in writing.  It would appear that the Minister again dismissed the offer out of hand and it is alleged, and has not been contradicted, that his behaviour at the meeting was largely instrumental in the decision being made by the parent company in Holland, after a report from their directors who attended the meeting, that there was no way they could negotiate with this Government and they made the decision to close the factory.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1391" /> One would think it unlikely that there could be a more serious aspect of this matter but there is.  The question of Ferenka was raised in this House during Question Time and Fine Gael and Labour Deputies tried to pursue the matter by way of supplementary questions.  In reply to supplementaries, the Taoiseach himself pleaded for restraint and implied that if this matter was pursued in the House it would do damage to what he again implied were negotiations being carried on for the resumption of production at Ferenka. We responded to that appeal.  I persuaded Labour Deputies who had not only a national interest but a local interest in, and concern for, the matter to refrain from pursuing it.  My appeal was based on the Taoiseach's statement which implied that negotiations were going on.  We now know they were not going on.  We now know that no activity was going on in regard to Ferenka.  It has a very serious implication because one rightly and responsibly accepts that that type of appeal, especially when made by the Taoiseach, is not made to save himself or his party from political embarrassment but is genuinely in the national interest. We responded to that appeal because we thought it was in the national interest but the facts that have been revealed since show that the appeal was made for party political purposes. It has potentially great dangers to the national interest in future issues that come before this House.</P>
    <P>I have restructured my remarks because I did not want to make them in the absence of the Taoiseach and I accept that he has to leave before I finish.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the manifesto.  On page 7 it states, &ldquo;Fianna Fáil propose immediate action to provide 20,000 new jobs within 12 months.&rdquo;  I do not know what they mean by &ldquo;immediate action&rdquo;.  Recently, the Minister for Education suggested that &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; meant action.  Nearly six months after they took office is &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; in Fianna Fáil's interpretation.  They also promised to provide 5,000 jobs in 1977.  There are only three weeks left <Col N="1392" /> in which to provide those jobs.  They have provided approximately 400 jobs, mainly for school teachers.  The other 2,300 jobs which have been created, excluding those 400, were created out of money provided in the January, 1977, budget.</P>
    <P>If you look more closely at the Fianna Fáil manifesto you will find a number of contradictions and ambiguities. On one page there is a reference to the creation of new jobs and when you go on to another page it states &ldquo;reduction in unemployment.&rdquo; One can create new jobs and the live register, as far as unemployment is concerned, can continue to rise, but Fianna Fáil have, for the first time, produced a document which commits them to certain policies and objectives.  There is no doubt that their commitment is totally without ambiguity. They are committed to reducing unemployment.  It is summarised on page 9 of the manifesto as: Reduction in unemployment, 1977, 5,000; 1978, 20,000; 1979, 25,000; and 1980, 30,000.  By 1980, according to this commitment by Fianna Fáil in order to win an election, we will have unemployment down to 30,000 unemployed. It is an incredible commitment coming from a party who know what the implications are.</P>
    <P>This manifesto was not produced by some group of young idealistic, committed Irishmen who wanted to achieve something for the Irish nation. It was produced by a group of people who had experience of office over 16 long, unbroken years, who knew precisely what both the external and internal economic implications were, who knew precisely what the limitations were within the framework in which they had worked during 16 unbroken years in office.  One cannot forgive this on the basis that it was produced in good faith by a group of dedicated, committed Irishmen trying to achieve the best they could for the Irish people.</P>
    <P>This document quite clearly&mdash;it will become increasingly more clear&mdash;was an exercise not only in gross irresponsibility by Fianna Fáil but gross cynicism by them.  This massive increase <Col N="1393" /> in employment is to be achieved by the same personnel and by the same approach and methods that were pursued by them in office during 16 unbroken years when we had, when the Coalition came into office, as a result of their activities, a live register in January, 1973, of 76,000 unemployed, approximately 7 per cent.  That was at a time when nearly every other country in the western world was enjoying full employment.  I do not know how by the same people, the same methods and the same approach they will achieve this economic miracle.</P>
    <P>The only thing they have achieved&mdash; I grant that it was very successfully achieved&mdash;is their return to office. That is what the manifesto was about. It was not about the very deep-seated, serious, economic and social problems which face the country.  The unemployment problem cannot be solved or even drastically reduced by the old traditional methods.  They have no commitment, they have no sympathy.  They have a hostility to the only possible approach by which full employment could be achieved over a period of time, that is by a proper economic and social plan.  We welcomed the development we thought was coming within Fianna Fáil when they announced the creation of a new Department of Economic Planning but we were totally disillusioned and saw immediately that what was afoot was window-dressing when we submitted certain amendments to the creation of that Department which would have made it possible for the Minister and for that Department to engage in real economic and social planning.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have no commitment to it, they have no belief in it and they have no intention of allowing the Minister for Economic Planning, who might have a commitment to it, to have the necessary power or scope to engage in it.  I believe, if we are disillusioned, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Deputy Martin O'Donoghue, will be extremely disillusioned before much longer if he has not already reached the point where he cannot be any more disillusioned by the operation of this.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have been advocating <Col N="1394" /> two things with regard to unemployment and the possible chance of creating full employment over a period of time.  We have advocated real economic and social planning and all that implies.  We have advocated the establishment of a national development corporation.  We are convinced that if there is any possibility of full employment it can only be achieved through those instruments and through the creation of those structures.  The Labour Party are accused, particularly by Fianna Fáil, of having doctrinaire approaches, an ideological commitment to those things.  We have not got the ideological hang-ups but it is becoming clearer that the Government have ideological hang-ups.  They see something sinister in the creation of a national development corporation and in the exercise of genuine economic and social planning.</P>
    <P>The Government are afraid of those things.  They have a mental block against this type of exercise and they also fear that it might antagonise the private sector.  They have misused that apparent fear by the private sector, which they apparently recognise is there, to build up hostility throughout that part of the community towards the establishment of those structures.  If we can achieve full employment it will benefit every section of the community.  It will benefit Ireland as a whole and it will benefit the private sector, the agricultural sector and the other sectors that make up our community.  It is ridiculous to hope to achieve full employment with the demographic predictions and the recession we have gone through by the same policies that could not do it before the recession, when it was much more easy to attain.  It is a piece of nonsense for which the Irish people, unfortunately, will have to pay.</P>
    <P>One of the most active and critical members of the previous Opposition was the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, Deputy O'Malley. One does not have to think too far back to see Deputy O'Malley sitting on the front benches where Deputy Barry is sitting now and, with his tiger approach, criticising left, right and centre: job creation, natural resources <Col N="1395" /> and prices.  He was in there with all the solutions.  He is now sitting in a seat where he can implement the solutions he had so readily when he was sitting on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>What has been the performance of that Minister who has direct responsibility in these areas?  Has he achieved 5,000 new jobs?  Quite clearly he has not.  The Government have been directly responsible for the creation of approximately 400 new jobs, mainly for teachers.  Has he managed to make any significant impact on price increases? Quite clearly he has not.  As I said earlier, and as has been acknowledged, any effect in this area has been as a result of the January budget.  What has been his contribution? In the main his contribution has been to lose 1,400 jobs.</P>

We sat here during a debate on the Adjournment on Ferenka in which the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy blamed the management of Ferenka and the unions.  He blamed everybody in sight. It was an exercise of a man in the dock, which he was and rightly so. He pleaded all sorts of reasons and blamed everybody but himself.  If the Minister is as blameless as his colleague seemed to imply with his interruption, why the concealment of the offer made by Ferenka?  Why was it not made known to the House when I requested the Taoiseach to make it known?  Now are we to sit back and accept the loss of 1,400 jobs and not <Col N="1396" /> mention it, sweep it under the carpet and let the people of the Limerick region and the catchment area pay for it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We will not conspire with the Government to conceal facts which should be known to the Irish people.  Let us take the question of our natural resources on which the Minister was so vocal and knowledgable when he was in Opposition and see what performance we have had from him in that area since he took office.  What changes have been made in his dealings with the companies who are exploiting our natural resources?  He was highly vocal when he was in Opposition.  Has he changed any of the arrangements, any of the agreements negotiated and entered into by the previous Government?  I do not think he has.  I have no evidence that he has.  I would welcome such evidence if it were there.</P>
      <P>In the Fianna Fáil manifesto there is a definite statement that Fianna Fáil in Government would create tens of thousands of jobs by the building of a State-owned smelter.  What arrangements have been made for the building of that smelter?  Has any preliminary work been carried out for the building of that smelter?</P>

      <P>If the Minister really believes the arrangements made were wrong, has he changed them?  Has he any intention of changing them?  I have not heard any announcement to that effect, and I do not think anyone else has.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil manifesto was explicit about prices and what Fianna Fáil would do in that regard.  It is no harm to remind the House precisely what the manifesto says about prices. Fianna Fáil said they would engage in a whole range of activities to ensure that the public were made aware of what was happening on the prices front. We were to have weekly advertising in the newspapers, on television and on the radio.  I have not read or seen any Government-sponsored advertisement or announcement on fluctuations in prices.  They were to restructure the National Prices Commission immediately. No effort has been made, no announcement has been made and no thought has been given to this matter.</P>
      <P>Where is the October report from the National Prices Commission?  So far as I know, it has not been published as yet and we are now into December.  Is the Minister sitting on it?  Is he holding it to let the bad news be known after the Dáil rises?  Is he looking at it, scratching his head and saying &ldquo;I will wait until the Dáil rises and not let them get at me there, and the public may have forgotten about it by the time the Dáil resumes&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1398" /> These were all specific and definite commitments made by Fianna Fáil in their manifesto.  The Labour Party do not believe they will be honoured, but they will not be forgotten.  In the full knowledge of what they were doing, Fianna Fáil wrote that manifesto, went before the people on the basis of that manifesto and were returned by the people.  It gave very definite undertakings. It was a hastily, ill-thought out, cynical exercise, but at least it is there.  For the first time the Irish people have a document which commits Fianna Fáil in certain areas&mdash; employment creation and unemployment reduction.  That is the precise term used&mdash;reduction in unemployment. It commits them on prices, a State-owned smelter, natural resources, and other ways.</P>
    <P>We do not believe that these undertakings can be honoured by Fianna Fáil.  We told the people during the the election campaign that we did not believe they could do that.  So far as this Party are concerned, that is what was promised and that is what they were put into Government to achieve and deliver.  For the next four, four-and-a-half or five years as the Minister said, we will continually remind them that it is their responsibility to deliver the contents of that document in full. Regrettably we do not believe it will be possible for them to do so.  However, that is their responsibility; ours is to ensure that if they do not deliver we will expose their failure and we will do that relentlessly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Taoiseach on his speech and my colleagues Deputy R. Burke, Deputy MacSharry and Deputy J. O'Leary on their new appointments as Junior Ministers and wish them well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach outlined many important major issues in his very far-reaching speech on the state of affairs of the nation.  I wish to refer to one aspect of society which in my view will play a most important part in our future development.  I refer to the urgent need for a new attitude to efficiency in this State as a whole.  It is opportune at this moment now that <Col N="1399" /> the Government are giving a lead in structuring new Departments&mdash;the new Department of Economic Planning and Development, incorporating energy into the Department of Industry and Commerce, and the new Department of the Environment.  The nation must follow this example of efficiency in approach.  It is all very fine looking to the Establishment for the answers to the ills and problems that beset us, but more often than not the answers are to be found from within ourselves.  I refer to the necessity to increase our efficiency if we are to meet the targets of employment and productivity in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Might I digress for a moment to the comments made by the previous two speakers?  What they contributed does not mirror the feeling in industry and the general level of confidence permeating throughout this country.  It is far better to endeavour to be constructive in contributions during this debate rather than, in a negative manner, destructively criticise continuously.</P>
    <P>The recent legislation empowering the IDA to play a more active role in companies, both financially and in shareholdings, thereby contributing directly to generating more employment is commendable.  No individual can seriously imagine that the general degree of efficiency at every level can remain the same if we are to attain the growth needed to create 300,000 and 400,000 new jobs in the next decade.  A new attitude towards efficiency is needed by men and women at home and at work to maximise their efforts rather than to be content with an effort that falls short of full endeavour.  A new attitude to efficiency would spell out the deplorable wastage in our society, wastages of energy, food and basic raw materials.  We must cease to be a throw-away society and be more constructive in maximising on our produce.</P>
    <P>I do not wish my remarks to sound unpatriotic because they really are the opposite.  I want to be constructive in an endeavour to show a sense of pride and self-confidence in making the most of our work effort.  If we can <Col N="1400" /> identify our shortcomings, surely we are in a better position to be able to address ourselves to correcting the various problems.</P>
    <P>The question of wastage is most important.  I am hoping the new Minister will consider putting forward some type of energy conservation programme, because in my view education in this area is urgently needed. President Carter's blunt warnings to the American people, and the same warning to the British people a few days ago on the urgent need for conservation of energy, prefacing the impending measures that these countries are taking, should not fall on deaf ears here.</P>
    <P>The recent EEC report on energy conservation in the Community remarked that this country appeared less willing to face up to the problem of greatly increased costs of energy, especially oil, than the other seven member states which made up the International Energy Agency.  There seems little evidence to refute these remarks.  That is very disturbing in view of the fact that Ireland, with no real native energy resources other than peat and water, is in the most vulnerable position of all.</P>
    <P>The oil shortage of 1973, and the subsequent steep price increases to which the Taoiseach referred, plunged this country into an economic chaotic state.  That year, 1973, demonstrated how totally dependent we are on imported energy.  Is there anything we can do to reduce our heavy dependence on oil?  There is quite a lot we can do and ought to be doing right now.</P>
    <P>I suggest that energy saving publicity campaigns, fuel efficiency grants and a more rapid development of the existing natural resources are also desirable, but they do not serve to underline the problem of becoming more efficient in any incisive way.</P>
    <P>Within every individual there is an inability to address himself to energy conservation.  There is a natural inclination to regard the matter of energy conservation as something that only can be dealt with at Government level or at international gatherings.  This <Col N="1401" /> inclination conveniently transfers the responsibility to faceless energy commissions. This is the wrong attitude to have.  Unfortunately, over the past 15 years the relative prosperity to which we have become accustomed has left us in a situation that unless we take a very serious look at our attitude to energy there is a danger that all our efforts in job creation and in developing industry will start to go downhill.</P>
    <P>The individual Irish person contributes greatly to the energy crisis because he or she uses unnecessary amounts of energy, whether it is leaving lights on, making unnecessary journeys by car or dumping useful products that could easily be recycled. Those of us over 35 years have memories of the more stringent days when the lack of prosperity made our parents and grandparents much more careful and cautious than we are to-day. We tend to associate that admirable frugality with our past relative poverty.  A slogan that we hear very often in Ireland is, &ldquo;We have been poor long enough.&rdquo;  It is a question of attitude.  A massive educational job needs to be done to condition the minds of people towards an energy-saving attitude.</P>
    <P>Such a message could be propagated in an organised educational programme in schools at primary, post-primary and even higher educational level.  It should be the subject of a continuing publicity campaign in the media.  There should be energy-saving projects in schools and in communities, even in offices and in industry. Projects should be supported and encouraged by the Government, local authorities, State-sponsored bodies, organisations, institutions and companies. Why not have the title of man or woman of the year, or school or company of the year awarded to an individual or to a collective body of individuals who can contribute in a sensible and productive way towards an energy-saving campaign?  It is a question of an imaginatively planned, comprehensive educational programme that will evoke the enthusiasm and ingenuity that may be tapped.  Human endeavour must always be directed to the development of our natural resources <Col N="1402" /> even if these natural resources are limited and costly.  It can be done. We must start addressing ourselves immediately to the problem of energy conservation.  It is commendable that the Government have included energy in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I would urge the Minister to address himself to the need for an educational attitude to energy conservation.</P>
    <P>Another poignant example of the absolute inefficiency that bedevils our society is the wastage of food at domestic and other levels.  Despite the high cost of food we have not quite accepted the fact that food will be expensive from now on in the European context.  An ironic situation prevails in Ireland.  On the one hand there are reports from social workers in certain instances of malnutrition among elderly people while, at the same time, the World Health Organisation reports that we rank as one of the best fed nations in the world.  Research carried out in Trinity College in conjunction with the Department of Social Medicine and the Dietetics Department of the College of Science and Technology in Kevin Street has shown that our abundant food supply is being used at present in a most inefficient and haphazard way.  Again, I come back to the call for greater efficiency in the area of wastage.  There is a lack of education among the population regarding the nutritional level of foods in relation to the cost.  This is an important and major area.  We must be more careful in our attitude regarding the wastage of food.</P>
    <P>We have much to learn from the eating habits of others when it comes to the question of wastage.  A major catering firm here has pointed out that not only are we inefficient in our attitude to feeding our people but they have referred to the amount of food that is thrown away which could be re-used as animal foodstuffs and also for growing other produce.  If such a trend continues we will be forced to take further action.  We are living in a society that is very much a &ldquo;throw-away&rdquo; society.  Part of the reason for this deplorable practice lies in the fact that we need an overall national policy which encourages people to take a <Col N="1403" /> positive attitude towards a war against wastage.</P>
    <P>What can be done about enforcing a new attitude of efficiency?  In his opening remarks in this debate the Taoiseach outlined the commitment of the Government.  He spelled out what will be necessary to create more jobs and the strides that the Government are taking.  My contribution is that unless every man, woman and child becomes more efficient our efforts are all in vain.  This is not looking to the Government totally for the answer; it is looking from within.</P>
    <P>Sometimes we take a kind of perverse pride in our easy-going ways, in the slower, less frenetic pace of life as compared with more industrialised and advanced countries such as Germany, the United States, Sweden and Britain. Indeed, the very attitude of our advertising to the easy-going way of life here points to that.  We should not get matters out of proportion on the subject of efficiency.  We would do well to recognise that we are far from being efficient in many industrial, agricultural and administrative activities.  We would do well also to realise that, unless we put a premium on efficiency and make it part of our national approach to work and effort at all levels, it will be very difficult to fulfil employment targets in the years ahead. This is an attitude of mind but it is important that people be prompted and urged into becoming more aware of these facts.</P>
    <P>It does not require any great deal of effort to look for salient examples of inefficiency in our society at present. Indeed the root cause of many complaints of the consumers' association about poor products, bad after-sales service, unanswered complaints about goods and shoddy service very often is not a question of sharp practice on the part of the shop, factory or company supplying such products; it is more a matter of downright inefficiency, where letters of complaint have lain on desks unanswered for months on end.  If consumers and others who feel they are entitled to special consideration are treated haphazardly, how much more aggrieved do people in a less advantageous <Col N="1404" /> position feel?  Ask anybody who has ever applied for a job in answer to advertisements and you will usually be recited a litany of incidents of unanswered letters, telephone calls never returned, appointments which were not kept, the people saying they did not expect a reply.</P>
    <P>The Government are taking every step possible to create an atmosphere in industry in which employers will take a hard look at firms and endeavour, where possible, to re-employ. Again I refer to maximising our efficiency, the result of which must surely be greater productivity.</P>
    <P>On a broader level there are more examples of inefficiency which have very much more serious consequences than, say, the non-delivery of some item to a household.  One suspects that many business and companies have closed down, not through cost increases, competition from abroad or shrinkage of the market but because basically the management was inefficient; that may be a harsh criticism but it is a reality.  There have been a noticeable number of occasions when workers have taken over defunct businesses and made going concerns of them.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the industrial coin there are the chronic cases of union inefficiency, in communicating with their members, with management and other unions.  How, in the Irish context, can there be efficiency with over 90 trade unions operating?  That, in itself, is the classic example, not that the individual unions are inefficient but that there are so many. What is needed are stronger trade unions with whom there can be more efficient negotiation rather than having such a large number of smaller ones. That is not to say that inefficiency constitutes the only factor in the closure of businesses or the breakdown of industrial relations, but in many cases it has loomed largely on the horizon.  What can be done?  It would seem that the first thing that ought to be done is to examine every level of inefficiency and encourage commercial enterprise to create incentive schemes. The Allied Irish Banks sponsored an efficiency competition open to Macra <Col N="1405" /> na Feirme clubs, which was an excellent means of bringing the problem before the people, to try to create a sense of awareness and of commitment. Likewise, other commercial interests and Government Departments could sponsor all kinds of useful projects in which the emphasis was placed on efficiency alone.</P>
    <P>While we should not lose our sense of proportion, or indeed our sense of humour over such things, the time is opportune for us to recognise a general attitude of acceptance of efficiency.  We must realise that inefficiency has handicapped our ability to meet targets and challenges in the past.  If, in this area, we are prepared to recognise there is room for so much improvement, we will be well on the road to building a stronger and more secure economy.</P>

      <P>This debate normally affords the House an opportunity of reviewing the Government's performance over the months or the year just ending.  On this occasion the Government have not been in office a year yet, because, on the 16th of June last, the people voted for a change of Government, which was their democratic right.  That change took place in this House on 5th July last.</P>
      <P>The statement made by the Taoiseach this morning was very much one that would be made by any Taoiseach, or indeed the former Taoiseach, had he still been in office.

      <P>I might mention that it is the duty of a visiting committee to hear and investigate any complaint which any prisoner may desire to make.  I do not think that an advocate is needed to enable a committee to discharge that duty effectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the difficulty, but I am told that the procedures for dealing with disciplinary matters in prisons and places of detention are set out in rules 66-71 in the rules for the government of prisons.  If an offence is committed the prison officer reports the offence to the chief officer who decides if it is serious enough to justify a formal report to the governor.  When a formal report is made to the governor he in turn decides if it is serious enough to take it any further.  If it is, the prisoner is <Col N="1410" /> called before the governor and the officer reads out the details, elaborating as necessary; the governor then invites the prisoner to comment on the matter, and having heard both sides the governor decides what is to happen from there on.  The relationship between the prisoner and the prison officer is reasonably good and healthy.  I do not think any prisoner is afraid to make a complaint or to see to it that he is treated as he should be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that if the governor wishes he may refer a charge for hearing by a visiting committee and the visiting committee can deal with it.  Various powers are set out for the visiting committee and I believe that these powers are sufficient to deal with any situation that may arise.  In recent times the question of updating these powers and involving these committees more than they were in matters such as this came up and recommendations are with the Department of Justice for consideration.  One of the recommendations is that a person appearing on a disciplinary charge should have an advocate because he may not be able to make his own case.

      <P>The Government are not reconsidering the implications for Ireland of the Euratom Treaty.  The granting of facilities for the exploitation of any radioactive materials which might be found rests with the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.</P>
      <P>I would add that the provisions of the Euratom Treaty which appear to have prompted the Deputy's question relate to the need to ensure a Common Market with equal access for all consumers in respect of nuclear materials within the Community.  These provisions include the requirement that no supplies are diverted to unlawful purposes, and to this end the treaty includes an elaborate system of safeguards.</P>
      <P>I would also like to inform the Deputy that, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons&mdash;a treaty first suggested and worked for by Ireland&mdash;the European Community has concluded a comprehensive agreement concerning safeguards between Euratom and the International Atomic Energy Agency&mdash;the designated agent for the implementation of the safeguards arrangements specified in the non-proliferation treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>We are learning all the time about the dangers of uranium and its uses.  It is the most dangerous substance ever found known to man. In addition, is this not a strategic material and as we are not members of NATO, giving access to this very dangerous powerful strategic material to members of NATO is a decision which might be considered as contravening the concept of neutrality which we are trying to hold in a very difficult situation?  Have the Government given any consideration to that question?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would share the Deputy's concern if it was based on certain assumptions that the development of uranium here could be conceivably used for military purposes but because of the controls which the Minister has, which I have mentioned both in relation to prospecting and <Col N="1414" /> exploitation, we have a degree of sovereign control which I assure the Deputy guarantees to what extent we can that whatever will be exploited will be used for peaceful purposes.  I share the Deputy's concern about some developments.  Some of the resources of the earth can be used for either peaceful or non-peaceful purposes. Within the Community under the terms of the Euratom Treaty and as we are co-sponsors of the Treaty for Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, our commitment in the future will be as it has been in the past.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that under Protocol 26 of the Treaty of Accession, Article 2.2, we are bound to facilitate the granting of sub-licences on commercial terms to member states for exploration in relation to uranium? Surely if one gives a licence on commercial terms it is with the purpose of exploiting the find and once it leaves our shores we are in no position to exercise any control whatever.  Is not that the new danger, in the light of two questions, first the strategic question and our neutrality, and secondly the danger of even the peaceful use of this? Nobody is yet happy about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said on more than one occasion, and I am sure the Deputy shares my concern, sometimes technology has moved ahead of the political capacity of Governments to control technological development.  That is the reality we have to live with.  Nonetheless, within the terms of the Euratom Treaty and the Treaty for Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in which we are involved, we have a degree of control which is not available to us in connection with the development of these resources elsewhere by other countries with which we are not associated. However, the checks we have within the Euratom Treaty and the checks which the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy has will guarantee to what extent they can that not only will uranium not be diverted for military purposes but will be a useful source of peaceful energy.  That is a matter of great concern to us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no EEC funds payable directly to political parties, Irish or otherwise, in the member states.  In its 1977 Budget, however, the European Parliament set aside a sum of 3 million units of account, or approximately £1.25 million, for an information campaign on direct elections. One million of these units of account were allocated to the Parliament's own information services while the other two million units of account were allocated to the six political groups in the European Parliament roughly according to their level of representation in the Parliament.  The actual distribution of these funds to the political parties which make up the groups is, of course, a matter entirely for the groups themselves.</P>
      <P>In their budget for 1978 the European Parliament propose to set aside an appropriation of 4.8 million EUA for its own information services for the purposes of direct elections and to make available a further sum of 4 million EUA for the political groups. As I mentioned earlier, however, the actual distribution of this latter sum among the political parties which make up the groups is entirely a matter for the groups themselves.  I should also mention that for the moment the sums involved are provisional as the budget procedure is still under way and will not be finalised until December.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I understand there is what one might call not a once-off but a twice-off payment in respect of the direct elections, one in this current year and the other for next year which are allocated between the groups.  It is then a matter for them to decide how they allocate between the constitutent parties of their group. There will be no other payments to any groups for any purpose of that type.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions No. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>I regret that the United States have found it necessary to withdraw from the International Labour Organisation and I hope that they will find themselves in a position to rejoin at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland, together with the other members of the European Community, has been in close contact with the United States over the two years since they gave notice of withdrawal from the ILO with a view to persuading them to continue their membership. In September, Prime Minister Tindemans of Belgium, on behalf of the Nine, delivered a letter to President Carter expressing the concern of the Nine at the possibility of US withdrawal and requesting the President to <Col N="1418" /> extend the United States notice of withdrawal so as to allow for further discussion and negotiations.  The United States, however, did not find it possible to follow that course of action.</P>
    <P>It had been our view that United States withdrawal from the ILO might well impair the effectiveness of an organisation that has played a major role in improving conditions of workers throughout the world and that has a major contribution to make in the field of human rights.  Ireland, together with our partners in the Community, sympathised with many of the concerns which influenced the United States in their decision to withdraw. We felt, however, that it was possible to strengthen the ILO while at the same time preserving its basic integrity by discussion and negotiation with other members of that organisation. Ireland will, of course, maintain close contact with our partners in the Community regarding the future of the ILO.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, I am sorry that the United States have found it necessary to withdraw and I hope that they may be able to rejoin at a later stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are deeply concerned at the evidence of increasing repression in South Africa.  As stated in the Dáil on 2nd November, following the recent repressive measures a protest was made to the South African Government on behalf of the nine countries of the European Community.  I outlined the views of the Government and our condemnation of apartheid in the course of my address to the General Assembly of the United Nations on 5th October last.</P>
      <P>As regards cultural and recreational contacts with South Africa, I should first place on record that Ireland has no cultural agreement with South Africa and that we have no official contacts with South Africa in this field.</P>
      <P>In relation to sporting contacts, Irish national sporting organisations have been directly informed, in accordance with UN recommendations, of the Government's firm attachment to the Olympic principle of non-discrimination in sport.</P>
      <P>While in my view it is for those directly concerned in cultural and recreational activities to make their own decisions in matters of this kind, I would strongly urge organisations and individuals concerned in arriving at their decisions to give due weight to the statements of the present Government and of their predecessors deploring the policy of apartheid; in particular, I would hope that they would decline to participate in events which are of their nature organised on a discriminatory basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if, in view of the repressive regime under which there is undisputed and growing deprivation of civil rights to the majority of black Africans in South Africa, the Government will consider, either at once or progressively over a period, severing all economic and trading links with South Africa and transferring these trading arrangements to the free countries of Black Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of economic and trading links with South Africa, I should perhaps first of all recall that Ireland has, together with its partners in the Community, been considering ways in which the collective weight of the Community can be brought to bear on the Government of South Africa so as to cause it to change its policies.  As a first step the Nine have elaborated a code of conduct for firms operating in South Africa and the examination of other possible measures, in which Ireland is playing an active part, is continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the international level, Ireland has for many years imposed a ban on the export of arms and military equipment <Col N="1422" /> to South Africa, in accordance with calls by the Security Council of the United Nations and has urged that this embargo be made mandatory on all member states: we have welcomed the recent decision of the Security Council to this effect.  Furthermore, we have recently co-sponsored a resolution in the General Assembly calling on the Security Council to consider imposing a ban on new investment in South Africa.</P>
    <P>It is our view, in relation to measures of an economic nature, that it is necessary for the international community to act in concert and after due consideration of the various possibilities, their likely effectiveness and likely consequences.  From what I have said it should be clear that we are ready to play our part in such consideration, and to implement those measures which may be decided upon in order to bring pressure to bear on South Africa for change.</P>
    <P>I think that international action of the kind I have mentioned would be more likely to be effective than action on our part alone.</P>
    <P>I should add, of course, that the Government, quite apart from this, are making every effort to promote trade with the countries of black Africa.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very encouraging that all the international power is being turned against South Africa at present. In view of the fact that it is not possible to veto powers in the Security Council, would the Minister not agree that we should take independent action in order to express our horror at the continuing repression in South Africa against these unfortunate people fighting for their liberty, even though I appreciate the economic difficulties in the special circumstances of our historic position?</P>

      <P>The Deputy, I and the House generally would be concerned about effective action.  I assure the Deputy that, within the process of political consultation of the Nine, we have been actively promoting a development of economic sanctions against South Africa.  This is the most effective action we can take and I can assure <Col N="1423" /> the Deputy that we will pursue it consistently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>The Government would wish all citizens to be fully aware of the situation in South Africa and of our attitude to it when considering offers of employment in that country.  Nevertheless decisions in this regard are a matter for individuals concerned. While the Government do not favour efforts to promote emigration to South Africa, such as that referred to by the Deputy, they do not have power to prohibit advertisements such as that referred to, nor do they consider that it would be appropriate to seek such powers in the absence of binding international obligations in this regard.</P>

    <P>I have recently received from the Civil Service Commissioners a notification to the effect that they are not in a position to recommend a person for appointment on the results of the interviews conducted by the board set up by the commissioners.  The Deputy <Col N="1427" /> will appreciate that, as the competition was conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners I am unable to comment on the timetable.

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that an examination has already been conducted by the Civil Service Commission.  The procedures took from six to eight months but the result was negative.  In view of the urgency of the matter I hope to be able to take one of two approaches. One would be to request the Civil Service Commission to have a further examination and to cut down on the time it takes to reach a decision.  If that does not prove feasible it may be necessary for me to consider some other option to ensure that we have a legal adviser within the service.</P>

This is to some extent unavoidable as a certain proportion of town clerks in small towns will always seek advancement to higher paid posts and it is desirable that they should have reasonable opportunities for advancement. However, the problems which are created for urban councils by frequent changes have been under examination in my Department with a view to finding a reasonable solution.

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if, prior to granting approval for the new buildings proposed for the Wood Quay sites in Dublin, the Government had access to detailed costings and specifications of the proposed council offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Ministerial approval was sought in respect of this project under a number of heads.</P>
      <P>The corporation acquired the site for civic offices by compulsory purchase order, and this was confirmed by the Minister for Local Government in 1964.  This decision related solely to the intended use of the site and no details of the offices proposed were required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently the corporation issued an invitation to developers to submit proposals for the construction&mdash;including its financing&mdash;of the offices.  The proposals would have to relate to a corporation brief which required developers to take account of the architectural and environmental characteristics of the site.  A number of proposals were developed and six firms were invited to submit detailed architectural and financial proposals.  These were assessed by a special board of assessors and one firm was adjudged the best.  This firm then submitted the proposal for formal planning permission to the corporation.  It was granted, but appeals were lodged against it by a number of third parties.  The appeal then lay to the Minister for Local Government. In connection with the appeal, which related to various planning considerations, the information furnished included a copy of the brief prepared for the corporation by the developers, a copy of the report by the city manager on the recommendations of the assessors, and detailed plans and <Col N="1430" /> specifications including a model of the proposed development; the city manager's report included comments on the financial implications.  The Minister granted permission, subject to conditions, in 1972.</P>
    <P>The firm which had put up this proposal was unable to follow through on its financing proposals, which had provided for a lease of the property to the corporation with an option to them to purchase.  The corporation then decided to proceed with the scheme themselves.</P>
    <P>No specific State grant or subsidy is payable towards schemes for local authority offices and local authorities are therefore not subject to any State sanction in regard to them except in so far as they may decide to finance a scheme by way of a loan, to which ministerial sanction is required.  In examining an application for sanction to a loan in such a case, it is not the practice to go into detailed costings and specifications but rather to consider the overall need for the scheme and its general financial implications. Sanction to the corporation's borrowing proposal issued from the Minister for Local Government on 19th April, 1973.  The proposal involved the raising of a bridging loan to finance the full scheme, on the basis that long-term loan arrangements would be settled after the bridging period of seven years.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, in November, 1973, the Government of the time considered that the use of the site for civic offices should be reappraised having regard to various planning and archaeological considerations.  The corporation was asked for a full report accordingly, and in the subsequent examination an amended layout was submitted by the corporation providing for a redistribution of the office buildings.  Following consideration of the subject by the Government in 1974, the corporation were advised in February, 1974, that there would be no objection to the amended scheme proceeding.  The report submitted on this occasion did not involve detailed costings and specifications.</P>
    <P>In April, 1977, the corporation submitted revised loan proposals, taking <Col N="1431" /> account of the substantial increase in costs that had occurred since 1973. They now proposed to undertake the scheme in phases, and for the first phase proposed the borrowing of a sum over a period to 1980, the borrowing to be repaid in the period 1981 to 1984 out of revenue.  As in the case of the previous loan proposed, it was not necessary to go into detailed costings and specifications.  The sanction of the Minister for Local Government issued on 11th May, 1977.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin Corporation have available to them the advice and assistance of the National Museum and, as disclosed in the recent proceedings in the High Court, have been acting in a responsible manner in relation to the Wood Quay site.  As matters stand, it is for the corporation to decide to what extent preservation of features is practical and desirable and, at this stage, I do not consider it necessary that I should make any recommendations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is primarily for the corporation, as owners of the site, to decide if this is so and, accordingly, whether the feature is worth preserving or not.  The National Monuments Act, 1930, defines a national monument as a monument or remains of a monument the preservation of which is a matter of national importance by reason of historic, architectural, traditional, artistic or archaeological interest attaching thereto.  Section 12 requires the local authority, the owner of such monuments, to maintain it, irrespective of whether the monument is being listed as a national monument by the Commissioners of Public Works.  I should add that the commissioners have over-riding power.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that the purpose of this debate is to take note of the Government's performance during the year just ended.  As this Government have been in office but a short time, we are not in a position to pass judgment on the ability of individual Ministers.  Last June Fianna <Col N="1452" /> Fáil made certain promises and gave an undertaking to the electorate that they would implement those promises immediately on taking office, if elected. During this debate we will refer to these promises and give credit where they have been implemented, although it must be admitted that it is very easy to implement some of those promises and hope trumps will turn up sometime in the future in order to find the money necessary to pay for them. As time goes on the Opposition will have ample opportunity of pointing out the futility of some of those promises, although Fianna Fáil got into power, as they were meant to do.</P>
      <P>I believe a number of Fianna Fáil people fought the last general election gladly throwing away promise after promise.  Not only were there promises in their manifesto, but we got promises from individual candidates in various constituencies.  They readily made these promises because they firmly believed they would not win the election.  That is an open secret.  They got a great shock when they won. They were celebrating for a long time and some are still celebrating.  Many of them have not yet got down to the real thinking and working of Government. Every Government have a honeymoon period, but because of the short time they have been in power it is very difficult for the Opposition to give an analysis of their performance.</P>
      <P>The only legislation passed by the Dáil which was not prepared by the previous Government were the two Bills creating the new positions in Government&mdash;the Department of Economic Planning and Development and the new positions filled today.  I congratulate the three men who have been promoted.  I have had the pleasure of working with one of them for a number of years in Dublin County Council, Deputy R. Burke.  I wish them well in their new positions.  We do not yet know their exact positions but they will be Ministers of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, with the exception of these two Bills all the legislation was prepared by the previous Government. Of course, there have been slight alterations but in the main they were all the Coalition's Bills.  I do not know <Col N="1453" /> how long it takes a Government to settle down but this Government have not yet produced anything we can get our teeth into.  We will be anxiously awaiting the next session to see what will be placed before us.</P>
    <P>Leave was given by the House this morning to introduce a Bill which Fianna Fáil promised would be passed during this session.  Only under pressure from the Opposition did the Taoiseach seek permission to introduce it.  When questioned about when it would be circulated, the Minister for Justice did not know.  I honestly believe that the first stroke of the pen has not yet been put to the drafting of that legislation.  Permission to introduce the Bill abolishing ground rents would not have been sought this morning if pressure had not been exerted by the Labour and Fine Gael Parties.</P>
    <P>I believe we are in for a time of stop-go effort with regard to legislation. We have had many announcements since the Government were elected. When Ministers were asked to comment on them, they were rather hesitant, indicating that they were not sure the announcement should have been made, whether the time was ripe or that it was rushed in some way to overshadow something else that might appear in the newspapers.  Many people believe that the Taoiseach's speech in Tullamore last week was made in an effort to overshadow other things.  While I am not accusing the Taoiseach of deliberately doing that, so many people have said it to me that I feel it is my duty to say it in this House.  In other words, the feedback is that many people do not seriously believe what the Taoiseach said or that his heart is in what he is proposing to do with regard to the apprehension of those who are carrying out serious crimes in this State.</P>
    <P>One could reflect for some time on the law and order position since this Government came to power.  Many people who intend visiting Ireland are taking a serious look at what is happening south of the Border.  It is unusual to have half a week without an armed raid.  It is not unusual to have three armed raids on a Friday.  This <Col N="1454" /> is a deplorable situation.  It is bringing us back to the situation the National Coalition found when we took office in 1973.  The Government are not giving enough attention to this matter. It is apparent that they are not serious about tackling the situation.</P>
    <P>Last week I referred to the upward trend in the tourist figures.  Many people who were dealing with tourism were heartened by the pleasant news of the turnabout in events with regard to the tourist figures some two or three years ago.  Speakers on the other side of the House may point to the great times of the 1960s.  Much of this was attributable to the many visitors to Ireland.  The troubles in Northern Ireland in 1969 seriously affected the tourist industry and it took many years of hard work to convey to people in other lands who were anxious to visit here that the troubles were almost entirely north of the Border.  When they looked like spilling over into the South Bord Fáilte did a splendid job in convincing tourists they were safe in coming here.  I am quite sure that the same people in Bord Fáilte are worried about the number of armed raids that have taken place since this Government took office.  We have many things to attract tourists but armed raids are no attraction.  I would urge the Minister now present in the House to put this point of view to the Cabinet and to urge his Government to take all possible steps to bring to justice those who are carrying out armed raids.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Justice, now Senator Cooney, did much worth-while work.  When he took office in 1973 his Department was not in a healthy state.  He had to embark on a programme of increasing the strength of the Garda Síochána and this could not be done overnight.  He left a healthy Department behind him, one that is geared to handling the situation. The only thing that could prevent that would be a whisper from the politician or from the political head of the Department.</P>
    <P>The people have a right to question if that Minister is doing all in his power to ensure that the citizens of this city can go about their daily live <Col N="1455" /> in safety, particularly on a Friday.  I am not so sure that the Minister is doing all that he can.  I should like to ask the Minister for Justice how many districts in the Dublin Metropolitan Area are without district inspectors. I should also like to ask him how often have recommendations come to his desk to fill these vacancies, only to be rejected.  How often do these recommendations have to come to him before he accepts them?  The people of this city have a right to know the answers to those questions.</P>
    <P>It is true that the garda on the beat in Dublin city is more evident than has been the case for 10 years or more but if we do not keep those positions filled we cannot hope to grapple with the situation.  We cannot hope to eliminate the dreadful fear of not knowing when we get up on a Friday morning if it is going to be our business premises that will be raided or if it will be our money that will be missing that Friday night.  Is the Minister waiting until certain names that might be familiar to him come before him to fill the positions?  If that is the case it is to be regretted.  For far too long such positions have been filled on political grounds.  Any Minister who is not prepared to accept the recommendations put to him should be prepared to give a reason.  I will leave it at that. I hope more words on these lines will be spoken in this debate and that the Government will reconsider the situation.</P>
    <P>In their election manifesto Fianna Fáil agreed to implement certain proposals. I wish to look briefly at a few of the promises they made and how they handled them.  First, there was the promise of the £1,000 grant for a house.  This looked extremely attractive to young couples who were considering purchasing new houses.  Unfortunately the details were not spelled out. It was described as a help to those purchasing houses, to put an end to the struggle to gather a deposit.  Did Fianna Fáil do that?  I do not think so.  Many of my constituents who have been in their houses for a considerable time and who have all the qualifications have <Col N="1456" /> not yet received the grant.  It was of no assistance to them in their efforts to gather a deposit although it may be of assistance after they have paid extra money on the loans they must obtain from the bank in the meantime. Fianna Fáil are not giving £1,000 to house purchasers.  The people concerned were already entitled to a local government grant and to a supplementary grant in most cases, making a total of between £700 and £800.  If they were entitled to an agricultural grant I understand the sum would amount to £900.  This great £1,000 hand-out Fianna Fáil promised the electorate has turned out to be £100 in some cases and up to £250 in others.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the Irish Trust Bank affair, if such it can be described. I believe the Government are rather frightened at what they have done in this respect.  In the heat of the election campaign an undertaking was given to the depositors in the Irish Trust Bank to refund their money in full.  It is worth nothing that in the passage of the Supplementary Estimates in the House here yesterday the Minister for Finance devoted two full pages of a three-page speech to the Irish Trust Bank.  Reading that script delivered yesterday one can see how frightened are the Government for having created this precedent because the Minister for Finance went to great lengths to say that this would never happen again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>What guarantee have the Government and the Minister that it will never happen again?  Now that Fianna Fáil have shown the way surely it is open to any political party to make a similar promise in the heat of an election campaign.  I believe it was a dangerous precedent to establish in relation to people who gamble their money in this way.  I might have been one of those who would have placed a deposit in the Irish Trust Bank; I did not; but I am not saying I would not do so in similar circumstances in the future because the interest rate was attractive and I am as much a gambling man as anyone <Col N="1457" /> else.  I believe it has now left it open for people to place their money where they will get the greatest percentage return in the knowledge that, if pressure is put on, the Government will pick up the tabs if the organisation, bank or whatever, goes bust.</P>
      <P>In the few minutes left to me I want to refer to the fiasco last week of the Christmas butter and to say to the Government: if ever we have a handout from the EEC again, for heavens sake, handle it differently.  There are shops today who have not yet received their supply of Christmas butter. There are people today who have not used butter for years and who have been unable to get a supply of the Christmas butter while others who never use anything else on their bread now have a stock of it in their deep freezers.  I never want to see a scheme which could be of benefit to our people carried out in that manner again.  I know it is not an easy undertaking.  If one were to distribute it evenly amongst the entire population I suppose it would necessitate the issuing of cards of some description.  I am not asking that that be done.  I do not think anybody would object if this butter had been confined to old age pensioners or recipients of social insurance or social welfare benefits.</P>

It was grossly unfair of a Minister to attack a local authority in the way he did here last evening.  I would ask him to reflect on the work being done by that local authority today with its 25 members, the same number as they had as far back as 1948.  Dublin County Council spend, I suppose, £1 million a week.  The amount of work being done by the local authority&mdash;I could cite figures if time allowed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of issues on which a Minister for Foreign Affairs might be expected to comment in a debate of this nature. Nevertheless the House will appreciate that, in the time available to me, it will not be possible for me to go into great detail in relation to many of them.</P>
      <P>I should like to reply to some points made and give an outline of how the activities of my Department fit into the overall policy of the Government for economic development, which might be helpful at this time.  In the first instance I might refer to some comments of the Leader of Fine Gael on the Taoiseach's report to the House yesterday on the European Council meeting&mdash;just for clarification&mdash;in view of the fact that some of the comments or questions of the Leader of Fine Gael were based on misunderstandings as to what was discussed at that Council meeting.  It is clear that the function of the European Council on that occasion, as on many others, was to analyse general economic progress, or lack of it, within the European Economic Community, to see what measures would be necessary to strengthen the commitment of the Community and of the partners within it to achieving the stated aims of the Community.  For that reason two matters particularly arose for discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the debate on general economic conditions within the EEC the question of the Commission's proposals on economic and monetary union arose.  I want to say&mdash;perhaps the Taoiseach may have felt too modest to say so himself&mdash;that the Taoiseach made it very clear indeed that, in his analysis of the EEC since he last attended what was then a Summit meeting in Paris in 1972, the Community had not, for one reason or another, moved consistently along the lines of the Community's own aims; that it had been unable to eliminate the <Col N="1459" /> level of imbalance and, for that reason, any steps towards economic and monetary union had been less than effective. In that context the Taoiseach pointed out also the obligation on the Community&mdash;he clearly reiterated this &mdash;to redefine and commit themselves henceforth to achieving those aims.</P>
    <P>I was struck particularly by one point made by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party in the course of his contribution yesterday.  When speaking of the Community he said it was a mistake to agree to the freeing of trade first, this in terms of the development of the European Economic Community itself.  I want to say to the Leader of the Fine Gael Party that if that is a mistake now&mdash;and perhaps it is&mdash;it was even more a mistake four years ago and perhaps even more a mistake when the Community was established.  The basis of the Community&mdash;as he and I well know&mdash;in the first instance was a free trade area, the European Common Market.  Almost two decades after its establishment it is a bit late to say it was a mistake.  Perhaps it was.  What this Government are determined consistently to point out&mdash;as the Taoiseach said at the European Council Meeting in more than one intervention&mdash;is that this freeing of trade, now a characteristic of the Community, confers certain advantages on the centre.</P>
    <P>I have myself at home and within the Council consistently repeated this. Sometimes the gap widens rather than narrows between the centre and the periphery, and to maintain the present gap the Community would be obliged and committed to applying greater resources to the regional and social funds and to elements of regional policy.  The Community must go much further and therefore the Taoiseach rightly approached the Council on the terms set out by the Community itself. It is significant that in his contribution&mdash;and there was a very definite response to this and to the disciplines involved for the Community by and large in realising the stated aims of the Community to relieve imbalances and bring about a move towards economic <Col N="1460" /> and monetary union&mdash;the Taoiseach could say that this Government will move towards economic plans and projections and this was something his predecessor was not in a position to say to the Council over the last four years.  If one goes to the Council of Ministers asking for disciplines and commitments one is not prepared oneself to implement then one will be less than effective and persuasive in looking for a response.  The Taoiseach took the initiative in asking that they insist on these disciplines in relation to the control of inflation and in relation to programmes designed to provide effective employment, particularly for young people, so that that would be a special commitment of the Community as it is for us at home.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Leader of Fine Gael, as does the Taoiseach, that the Community has not been at all times consistent in these aims; but it is a little strange to imply that there is any fault due to this Government because of what the Community has not achieved over the last four years.  We have consistently at Community level and at Council of Ministers level highlighted these factors and the Commission has placed on record, and this is again significant, the degree of support and security they found in the consistent position we have taken&mdash; I can speak only for our time in Government&mdash;in supporting them in their aims towards eliminating regional imbalances with a view to eventually bringing about a degree of co-ordination towards economic and monetary union.  That is the fact.</P>
    <P>It will be our consistent policy in the years ahead to strengthen the Commission and give it the iron will to proceed along the lines of its own stated policies consistent with the Treaty of Rome and consistent with the Treaty of Accession we signed in early 1972.  Our Community partners recognise that even though we are a small country we have a vital role to play, not as vital a role as a major country or a major economic unit in the Community but nevertheless a vital role.  Why should that be so?  First, because the major economic countries benefit from the freeing of trade and <Col N="1461" /> also because of the impression the Community creates both within and without of the kind of concern we have for the needs of the present and potential of the future.  The young people of the Community must identify in that Community a degree of social concern which is not limited to the boundaries of any one country but which is a constant and consistent element in Community policy.  To the extent that it is lacking, and it is lacking from time to time, it will be my constant purpose and that of my colleagues to keep reminding the Community that it cannot go half-way towards what was originaly intended, namely, a free trade area, an area which obviously confers advantages on central areas as distinct from peripheral areas, and that it must fulfil its obligations both within and without.</P>
    <P>Small countries such as Ireland for historic and other reasons have a great deal to contribute to the attitude other countries will have towards the Community. We have a goodwill&mdash;no credit, perhaps, to the present generation but, so long as we respect that goodwill, we share some of the credit &mdash;in the African, Asian and South American States which are coming into independence and developing their economies.  We can exploit that goodwill to our own advantage through the various bilateral and multilateral agreements. More importantly, we can use that goodwill to the advantage of the Community, not for all of which have the developing countries the same degree of admiration they have for our country.  It is well then that the major countries in the Community should recognise that a small country like ours has a very important contribution to make because of its historical past and because of the manner in which it can bring about a closer liaison between Africa and Europe, South America and Europe and the Far East and Europe.  That is the role we shall be highlighting, because membership of the Community cannot be balanced in terms of gains or losses.  As a Community it must be more accurately assessed in terms of the total contribution and I believe our political goodwill is a very major contribution and <Col N="1462" /> one we are not in any way reluctant to remind some of our Community partners about.</P>
    <P>The Leader of Fine Gael also referred to the question of enlargement. Here he was under a misapprehension in thinking this was discussed at the European Council.  It was not and so the Taoiseach could not refer to it in reporting to the House.  It was discussed at the Council of Ministers on more than one occasion and I have consistently stated that a precondition for the Community itself&mdash;and this has now been adopted formally and is in a sense a return to what was previously adopted but in somewhat better terms&mdash;is that it will provide adequate resources within the Community and make available the necessary resources in the context of enlargement as, otherwise, it will not be anything in the nature of the Community we joined or anything in the nature of what many of the member states would wish to present it as being.  This is not a precondition for Greece, Spain or Portugal.  It is a precondition for the Community on its own terms and both the President of the Council of Foreign Ministers at the moment and the present Commission have adopted this formula in the latest statement from the Council of Ministers.  Therefore the Leader of Fine Gael need not in any way be concerned because this was not referred to by the Taoiseach.  We have consistently not only followed the line suggested but even gone a step further in proposing the obligation on the Community itself.</P>
    <P>I have said before that political commitments are not enough.  They are too easy, too illusory and too dangerous.  Political commitments must be matched with economic performance.  Let us be realistic, factual and honest.  If there is a political commitment let us see evidence of the economic commitment to back up the political commitment; otherwise we will be doing a disservice not only to the existing Community but to the wider Europe.</P>
    <P>It was a matter of great satisfaction to the Taoiseach and to me to hear the President of the Republic of France, <Col N="1463" /> the Chancellor of West Germany, the Prime Minister of Britain and others spontaneously and genuinely thank the Taoiseach and his advisers for the formula which enabled the contributions to the next two years' budget to be adopted in the first stage of the second day's discussions when on the previous evening no such expectations seemed feasible.  From our point of view this means that the extra contribution over and above the minimum contribution, namely, the Commission's interpretation of Article 131, will be of little or no account.  The total extra contribution will be less than £4 million in two years.  The payments to us from the regional fund, the social and the other funds of the Community will be paid in the new European unit of account, and the proposal by the Taoiseach which was eventually adopted will mean a net gain to us in that area alone over the next few years.  We were able to get that gain for ourselves in the context of Community support and we were able to win what was noted as being a political decision from the European Council, which is something that the Council of Foreign Ministers were not able to bring about.  It was a contribution not just to ourselves but to the political co-operation which must be an essential element of any meeting of heads of State in the European Community.</P>
    <P>In relation to the regional fund it is obvious from what I said earlier and from what the Taoiseach said at the European Council, that what we sought in terms of the commitment of the Council was much clearer evidence of their determination to apply the resources of the Community to enable peripheral areas to develop on an even keel with the central areas, to such an extent that it touched the reactions of some of the other heads of Government who apparently had not been reminded of this consistently over the last number of years.  It is fair to say that the Leader of the Fine Gael Party acknowledges that the regional fund as it stands is a significant increase in real terms of perhaps 50 per cent over the next three years from what it was over the last three <Col N="1464" /> years.  This is an indication that some forward move is being made.  It is not enough, but some move is being made.</P>
    <P>The increase is significant, although it is not as much as will be required. The Leader of the Fine Gael Party suggested that the increase should be bigger, but I am sure he recognises some of the realities of trying to get this increase.  The Taoiseach was more successful than any other negotiator on our behalf despite the great expectations we had in 1973 or 1974 when this House was left with the impression from visits of my predecessor to Germany, France and Rome, that they were all coming around to our view.  I recall that the results were very different from the expectations raised.  The reality now is better than then, but we must not sit back in complacent satisfaction.  We must recognise that it is a step forward that must be enlarged to ensure that we can realise our own programmes within the Community.  It depends to a very large extent on our performance. We must rely on our own programmes and on the Community to support those programmes, to implement real economic development here.  I have no doubt that the manner in which the Government will apply the increased resources from the regional fund in the next few years will prove that they will be applied effectively to ensure continuing economic expansion in the areas of greatest need.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Fine Gael Party referred to cross-Border projects. During my visit to Belfast yesterday I got the impression that it is appreciated by both the British Government and the people of Northern Ireland that this Government are very much committed to the development of cross-Border projects to the extent that I was asked on occasions how was it that our predecessors did not seem to be pursuing this so urgently.  It is very evident from the first talks the Taoiseach had with Prime Minister Callaghan, from discussions which our officials had with officials of the Foreign Office and of the Northern Ireland Office over the last few months, and it will be even more evident from the Ministerial meetings which will <Col N="1465" /> follow up as soon as the first stage of the official discussions have terminated, that this is a commitment between both Governments.</P>
    <P>It is a way of working together to discharge a common obligation.  More than that, it is a first stage which will subsequently be followed up by the appropriate assistance from the European Community.  I think I was the first Foreign Minister of this country to bring this matter up formally before the Council of Ministers.  The response I got was quite positive and I am sure that at the appropriate time&mdash;because they have now been put on clear notice of it&mdash;the frontier regions within this country will get adequate support from the regional fund or any other fund resources available.  So far we are reasonably satisfied with the response we have got from the British Government regarding the areas we have mentioned as being appropriate for further studies and we will follow up on that basis.</P>
    <P>The question of representation at Summits is important.  We recognise that this Community must be represented as a Community and not merely by the major powers within the Community. This matter has now been resolved after four years.  It was resolved at the meeting of Foreign Ministers in Belgium, when I, in conjunction with representatives of smaller countries, managed to get at long last a commitment from the major powers of the Community that hence-forth the Community will be represented by the President of the Commission and by the President in office of the Council whether he belongs to a large or small country.  Already within the European Community we are ensuring that the Community are staying on the rails of their own direction, at least as originally set. The outcome of the various negotiations in which we have been involved at European Council level, Foreign Minister level, agricultural level or otherwise is significant.</P>
    <P>Finally in that connection, the matter of the MCAs was raised also.  I find it interesting that these matters have been raised now.  For the first time there is from the European Council a <Col N="1466" /> commitment to tackle urgently this problem of abolishing the MCAs which have distorted trade in agriculture over the last number of years. This commitment has now been adopted by the Council and has been referred back to experts who will report back to the next Council on the progress made and the manner in which this can be done as speedily and as effectively as possible.  No such decision was taken by any previous Council.  The approach of the Taoiseach and the Government to all of this is that wherever there is distortion and unfair competition we have highlighted it and have succeeded now in getting commitments.  It is not the end of the road; it is a long, slow process. Also, where our own interest is concerned we have been able to ensure that the outturn has been as good as anything that emerged before this.</P>

      <P>On the question of our diplomatic representation generally there are two approaches to diplomatic representation, not to be distinguished one from the other but from which to judge the significance of our association.  Obviously for a small country this means firstly the trade and economic consequences of diplomatic association and secondly the political consequences.  In terms of trade and economic consequences it has been evident that some of the associations we have established over the last few years, particularly with some of the state trading companies of Eastern Europe, have not been as beneficial from our point of view as we would have wished them to be.  It is fairly evident from statements made by my colleagues in Government, particularly the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, that this is a matter for concern for the Government. This is a matter that I have discussed with the Ambassadors of the countries concerned.  We have indicated to them that to develop the relationship&mdash;in the best and fullest possible sense of the word&mdash;with a country, to bring about new understandings, closer relationship and better co-operation, <Col N="1467" /> you must do that on the basis of a reasonable balance of trade and trading opportunity.  I say with some degree of confidence that the imbalance we have seen over the last number of years will be corrected as almost a condition of our developing relationship, which we are all very anxious to promote, irrespective of ideological differences that exist between us.</P>

      <P>Only this very day, I am glad to tell Deputy Bruton, in discussions with the new Ambassador from Czechoslovakia, who presented his credentials to President Hillery this morning, I got from him a commitment to ensure that the imbalance which exists between Czechoslovakia and ourselves would be narrowed to ensure trading outlets for us. Ours is an open economy and we are not concerned with stopping imports into Ireland.  What we are concerned about is guaranteeing outlets for our exports and I am satisfied that we will see a big improvement here.  If we are not happy with what will emerge we will be ready to point out to them that this is not the way to promote proper and effective relationships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department in this do not in any way clash with Córas Tráchtála, who obviously have the major function, but make the original political introduction, particularly when dealing with state trading companies with whom we have to deal Government to Government. We work in close liaison with Córas Tráchtála.  One of my first priorities since coming to office has been to ensure that that element of our diplomatic representation, namely creating the proper political climate for the development of further trading relations, would be effective.  I am satisfied that in the development of our diplomatic associations, and particularly in the opening of new embassies, the Government will take a very consistent and very comprehensive view, not just reacting to what may or may not be a request for new <Col N="1468" /> relationships from other countries, but we will over the next number of years determine what is in our political and economic interest.  The House can judge from the performance which will emerge over the next few years to what extent we will be consistent.</P>

      <P>I should like to compliment the three men who were promoted today.  I am particularly pleased for Deputy Burke because the Burke family have a long association with politics.  Deputy Burke's father was a well-liked member of this House and I am sure he is happy that his son has become a junior Minister.</P>
      <P>We often talk about Moses coming down from the mountain with a tablet of stone.  Somebody came out of a think-tank with the Fianna Fáil manifesto and that is why it has turned out to be wet.  It was the first time Fianna Fáil put anything down in writing. Because there was so much in the manifesto, people glanced through it and read what they wanted to read out of it.  The result is that we have had some remarkable interpretations.  The manifesto had the effect of changing the Government.  Unlike some people who believe they had no right to do wrong, I believe the people had the right to change the Government and they did so in no uncertain terms.</P>
      <P>So far, what have we got from the Government?  We have a change of names of Departments.  Some of the changes are appropriate and some of them are awkward.  For the life of me, I cannot see how the Department I served for four-and-a-half years can benefit from being renamed the Department of the Environment.  I could understand the change if there was pressure for it, but change for the sake of change is ridiculous.  To make matters worse, everything connected with the Department had to be changed and that was a fairly expensive job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since their defeat in 1973 the Fianna Fáil Party set out to return to power. They worked very hard at it and good luck to them, but they were completely unscrupulous.  Up to May of this year <Col N="1471" /> the charge was made in this House again and again that the correct figure for unemployment was 185,000 instead of nearly 110,000.  The two people who used that figure regularly were the Taoiseach and the Minister for Labour.  A few weeks ago I was amused at the Taoiseach being asked the current unemployment figure.  He did not know the answer then but he knew it last May.  I would quarrel with the figure of 185,000.  If it is correct, then we must surely have passed the 200,000 mark by now because this year's school leavers must be added to it.</P>
    <P>One of the main problems we have had under Fianna Fáil, and for a period under the National Coalition, was the introduction of capital-intensive industry.  When a new industry was started or an existing one improved, the industry became more efficient and this resulted in the loss of many jobs.  The new Government should look at this matter very closely. Fianna Fáil said they were going to remove the dole queues.  I remember the Taoiseach being very sure of himself in regard to the number of people who would be employed after Fianna Fáil returned to power.  During the interview he was asked, &ldquo;When do you intend to reduce the dole queues?&rdquo;, and his quick reply was, &ldquo;Immediately we take office&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach has now been in office for six months and he has not done it. A lady member of Fianna Fáil appeared on television the same night and she was abusive.  She talked about the right to work and that this lot&mdash; she was referring to the National Coalition&mdash;were keeping people out of jobs.  She succeeded in getting a seat in this House but the people are still being deprived of the national right to which she referred.</P>
    <P>Today I listened to Deputy O'Kennedy talking about the EEC, how things were to be done and the great Europeans we are.  When I consider the number of people who are unemployed in the member states it makes me wonder whether we should copy the EEC in regard to running our economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1472" /> Before they came into power, Fianna Fáil had an answer to the problem of school leavers.  They were very noisy in this House about the rights of school leavers.  I remember answering a question on behalf of the Minister for Labour on the number of last year's school leavers that had been employed.  It turned out only 7 per cent of them were still seeking work at that time.  A Deputy who is now a junior Minister asked me if many of them had taken jobs for which they were not trained.  I would ask the Minister who is present to find out from his colleagues if they are going to supply jobs for which people have been trained to the school leavers who are at present seeking jobs.  I know the answer.  Little if anything has been done for those people.  I am afraid they will have to live on the pre-election promises of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil were very definite about prices before the election.  They said they would make efforts to ensure that prices would not increase.  When he was in Opposition the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy was adamant about prices but they are still increasing.  The only difference between now and when we were in office is that price increases were headlined by the media.  For some extraordinary reason price increases are not being headlined now.</P>
    <P>Recently, there was a substantial increase of £5 per ton in the price of coal and it was difficult to find a report of it in the newspapers.  Recently, three price increases were announced on the radio.  On the same day I got a copy of the prices report which had been approved by the Minister and discovered that there had been 43 price increases.  Now where did the other 40 go to?  Fianna Fáil are very good at covering up; they seem to be able to ensure that people are not made aware of price increases.  Ask any housewife, particularly in Dublin, and she will tell you whether she is satisfied with Fianna Fáil's performance in regard to their promises.  The only time you will find out about price increases is when you are paying for goods at the supermarket check-out. Incidentally, a regulation was passed that the prices of certain commodities <Col N="1473" /> should be displayed in shop windows in such a way that they could be easily read by people before they enter the shop.  I do not see many of them now. I believe there is a shop in town where a very patriotic gentleman has the prices in Irish.  I am sure it is in the interests of the Irish language that he has the prices in Irish in the window but there is no English version and since most people in the city only read English, the Irish version is not much use to them.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the question of the Christmas butter.  Some years ago when an amount of butter was being made available at a reduced price we decided that it should be given to social welfare recipients.  I should like to know why the Government did not decide to do the same thing.  If ever there was a scandal the distribution of the Christmas butter was one because not alone has it not been delivered to some of the small shops but some of the supermarkets appear to have more than they can get rid of.  Some of them even made it a condition that a customer had to buy £5 worth of goods before he got a coupon entitling him to 1 lb. of Christmas butter.  Where would the old age pensioner, the widow or the unemployed man or woman fit into that scheme?  Like everything else the Government have put their hands to so far, they have made a mess of the distribution of that butter.  The Minister concerned should see to it that this does not happen again.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Taoiseach made a short reference to the new Department of the Environment and to housing.  He also referred to the building industry and the tremendous improvements being made.  I suggest that there has not been a tremendous improvement in the building industry and, as far as housing is concerned, I regret to state that we will not be able to have the annual 25,000 house-average which we had over the last four years.  That is no fault of mine.  During my period in office I made a provision that an allocation for local authority houses be given to local authorities early in the year and when the progress was well known a further allocation be given.  I do not know what the general <Col N="1474" /> position is but I am aware that in my constituency, County Meath, only one allocation was given, the first one. They have not been given the second one.  More than £1 million has not been paid.  Has that happened elsewhere or was that specially reserved for one constituency?</P>
    <P>With regard to the number of new houses, I am afraid we will find that the number will drop considerably. People engaged in the business of house building and selling houses have told me that there is a slump in the market.  I am aware that the Government decided to increase the amount of money which a local authority could lend for the purpose of building houses but I am not aware that this has made a big improvement, because with present interest rates on SDA loans it is not very attractive.  I am glad the building societies were able to produce a tremendous amount of money and that they are getting the support they should get from the Government, as they received from the last Government.  I regret that those who will be borrowing money through the SDA loan scheme will not have much joy.  I wish now to refer to the change in housing grants.  We would all love to see grants given to everybody anxious to build a house, particularly those in need.  I remember a case being made in the House that enough money was not being given and that people engaged in agriculture could get £900. It was stated that it did not matter whether they originally owned a hovel or not: they got the £900 if they decided to build a house.  The Minister was asked some time ago whether those people would qualify and he said he would make arrangements to have them included as if they did not previously own a house.  I understand that arrangement has not yet been made. Anybody who owns a house, not alone in this country but&mdash;according to the form issued by the Department&mdash;anywhere in the world, or if their spouse owns a house anywhere in the world, will not qualify for the £1,000 grant.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister yesterday the number of people in County Meath who had qualified.  I was told there were 580 applicants and that one person had qualified.  I was told also that <Col N="1475" /> so far it had not been found possible to pay him.  At that rate the first £1,000 will go a long way because if the Government cannot pay one grant in six months in a county where a lot of houses are being built it does not say much for the counties where fewer houses are built.  The reconstruction grants should have been increased.  I said before that I would like to see them increased and I hope my successor will do so, because we must preserve existing housing stock at all costs.  I understand the Minister will be going around in the near future opening a number of beautiful housing schemes and the best of luck to him. However, he will not have to do as I had when I started opening schemes erected under Fianna Fáil, carry a notebook to take complaints from the tenants who were only a few weeks in the houses.  They complained that roofs were leaking, that walls were crooked, floors broken, windows were not fitting and about absence of heating.  The houses the Minister will open are fit for working class people to live in.  I hope that, no matter what economies the Government decide to make, they will not make an economy on the standard of house building.  We do not want any more of the type of houses built under the last Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the question of rents of local authority houses and the sale price.  I understand that in the Dublin South-West Constituency during the election campaign a special election manifesto was issued to the effect that those who bought local authority houses before 1973 and paid cash for them would get a refund of one-quarter of the money if Fianna Fáil were returned to office. When this matter was raised in the House by a Fine Gael Deputy some weeks ago the Minister said Fianna Fáil had no responsibility for that document.  From that I assume that Fianna Fáil can be all things to all men.  If it suits in one place they can say it and then the party can say it has no responsibility for it even though there is a Deputy from the area in the House as a result of that manifesto. The rents of local authority houses are <Col N="1476" /> up for review.  Last year a deliberate attempt was made by a Deputy, now a member of the Government, to cause as much trouble as he could on a local authority because the local authority had not notified tenants of an increase in the rents.  A substantial amount was due in arrears.  Even when I compromised and gave them exceptional terms &mdash;not given anywhere else&mdash;so that the burden would not be too heavy on them, that Deputy kept up his agitation and did his best to cause trouble. Although that rent review was due in July it had not been completed.  I understand that NATO have not been able to meet the Minister to date.  I believe there is a possibility that the Minister will meet them today and I hope he treats them as the responsible body they are.  When I took over in the Department of Local Government there was a two-year-old rent strike on hands and I had to settle it.</P>
    <P>I hope my successor will not be foolish enough to create or cause a further rent strike, something he can do pretty quickly if he starts dealing unfairly with the decent people who live in those houses.  Those people living in houses built before our time have a lot of real complaints.</P>
    <P>Since this Government took office there has been a dramatic increase in the number of road accidents.  I cannot blame the Government for that, but I want the Minister to do everything possible to get back to the situation which prevailed in the last three years of my term when the number of people being killed and injured on our roads was dropping annually.  I do not know why the position has changed.  It should not happen and those who drive recklessly should be condemned.  I do not think it was a good idea to suspend the test for those alleged to be driving while drunk.  If there is a mistake in the test it should be remedied.  Any loophole should be fixed up and the test put back in operation.  Drunken driving causes many road accidents.  Nobody who is drunk ever gets killed.  We are too polite to say he was drunk if he happened to be killed but if he kills somebody else it is different.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister made an announcement about rates on local <Col N="1477" /> authority houses.  A great deal of publicity was given to the fact that the Minister and the Government had decided local authority tenants would be treated the same as any other householder so far as rates are concerned. Why would they not be?  When we took 25 per cent off the rates this year, we took it off the rates of local authority house tenants.  Why should they be treated any differently from anybody else?  Why should there be a song and dance about this, or is it an effort to say that because they will have a reduction in their outlay under that heading they cannot complain if rents go up as a result?</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister for Foreign Affairs has left the House because I wanted to say something to him.  He lectured us on how well he is getting on in Europe and the great respect being shown to his Government.  Great respect was shown to the previous Government. Our Minister for Foreign Affairs did not belong to our party, but I would say that perhaps he was the best Minister for Foreign Affairs we ever had.  I am not surprised to hear the present Minister for Foreign Affairs saying he is being welcomed with open arms in Europe.  He was the adviser to the IFO and he told them that of course they were entitled to hold out for a 50-mile limit.  They were not to mind what the Coalition Government were talking about, they were entitled to a 50-mile limit and they would have to get it.  I wonder is that being mentioned in Europe now?</P>
    <P>That is not the line adopted by the Minister for Fisheries when he steps from one foot onto the other and decides what he wants to say.  Apparently he says one thing and, if it does not suit his listeners, he changes to something else very quickly.  Of course, that would be no problem to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education appears to be working very hard.  Like his predecessor he is meeting with many difficulties. In the short time available to me I have one or two cribs to which I should like to refer.  I should like to know why the Department, under the new Minister, decided to change the decision on the building of a technical school in Navan.  The building of this <Col N="1478" /> school which had been decided on by his predecessor has now been cancelled and it has been decided to improve or increase the size of the existing school, although it had been agreed by the Department that the siting of the existing school was a traffic hazard. Perhaps somebody might answer that one.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know why the Minister has reduced the amount of money being given by way of State grant to a school in my parish of St. Mary in Drogheda.  I should also like to know, when he was increasing the grant to students, why he did not consider it necessary to increase the income limit of those eligible for the grant.  I have had numerous complaints from people.  One person's daughter would be eligible but for the fact that she has £355 per annum as a librarian in a local branch library.  This amount put her £5 over the limit.  The amount her daughter would get would be nearly double the amount she is earning as a part-time branch libarian.</P>
    <P>On the question of social welfare, I remember the Minister for Economic Planning and Development stating early this year that one of the ways he felt the Fianna Fáil Government could reduce expenditure was that £30 million could be taken off social welfare.  I put down a question on this matter.  A number of people have been working for years in Butlins Holiday Camp near where I live.  One woman who worked there for 29 years and another woman with 17 children whose husband died have been refused unemployment benefit on the ground that they work on a seasonal basis only. When I tried to get further information from the Minister, he made some reference to their economic circumstances. That was the first time I knew there was a means test for social welfare disability or unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>Once you stamp a card either you are entitled to benefit or you are not. Your economic circumstances do not come into it.  This is happening.  Some of my colleagues tell me the same racket is being worked throughout the country.  Similarly, many people, particularly women, who have been drawing disability benefit for a number <Col N="1479" /> of years now find themselves debarred from benefit.  They are brought in and examined and told they are not unfit for work.  If this is the way in which Fianna Fáil are to give parity to women on social welfare as they claimed in their election manifesto, it is a damned peculiar way of doing it.</P>
    <P>On the question of the number of jobs created by Fianna Fáil, the health services have been quoted.  I was very interested last week to hear the Minister for Health stating honestly in the House, as I would expect him to do, that Fianna Fáil had not paid for any of the jobs which had been created. They were included in the budget and provision had been made for them in the existing arrangements.  All Fianna Fáil had done was to continue with the arrangements to give these additional jobs.  Quite a substantial amount of money was made available in this year's budget for job creation. With it, we expected to bring down the unemployment figure to under 100,000 before the end of the year. Unfortunately, Fianna Fáil have not succeeded in doing this.  They got it down to about 105,000 and now it is climbing back up again.  I am sure that before very long it will be back to where it started.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk about wage negotiations.  Everybody is an expert on this matter.  I have been a trade union official for almost 30 years and, while I do not agree with unofficial strikes or with the decision sometimes taken to honour an unofficial strike picket&mdash;that is wrong&mdash;at the same time I believe there has been too much messing with trade union negotiations. If the Government think they can get away with 5 per cent next year they will have to have their heads examined collectively or individually.  There is not a hope in the world of getting away with it, because it does not represent a reasonable amount.</P>
    <P>There is another issue we must remember.  We hear a lot of talk about competitiveness with other European countries.  Wages in most European countries are very much higher than they are here.  If we can get production up to the right level, we should be <Col N="1480" /> able to compete very well with European countries.  The big trouble for this Government, as it was for the previous Government and Governments down the years, is that they do not want to admit the rate of pay given to the civil service, which must be paid directly out of State funds, is causing all the difficulty.  Why do they not come out in the open and say that? I was amazed to hear even the Taoiseach talking about an average wage. A couple of weeks ago the Minister for Economic Planning and Development talked about an average wage of £78 a week.  The Taoiseach mentioned a figure of £80 a week.  The majority of workers are in the lower paid category. They earn between £40 and £50 a week and they must make do with that.</P>
    <P>The Government must tighten up security.  They must change the system whereby people go before the courts, and the courts know they are guilty of a crime, but they can walk out free because an &ldquo;i&rdquo; was not dotted or a &ldquo;t&rdquo; not crossed.  The Garda are doing a good job and they must get support.  The additional gardaí now on duty were included in a scheme prepared and put into operation by the previous Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In his contribution the Taoiseach referred to the fact that a number of promises have been fulfilled, including the removal of car tax, certain capital allocations for job creation during the year, the raising of the income and loan limits for SDA housing, provision of the £1,000 grants, the creation of 600 additional posts for teachers and extra gardaí.  The Coalition said it was impossible to do all these things.  However, they have been done, inflation is lower than predicted and the level of unemployment is reduced. The Coalition may tell us that this was just a question of good luck on the part of Fianna Fáil, but I would say it was good decision making and good planning by Fianna Fáil to take these measures and find them successful, even in this first year in office.  The people gave Fianna Fáil a clear mandate to get the country moving again.  They placed their confidence in Fianna Fáil, and especially in the Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch.  This trust was not misplaced and already the Government's conviction and decisive actions have instilled a new confidence in our economy and have resulted in a reduction in the number unemployed and a decrease in inflation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry claimed in his speech today that all these improvements were the direct result of Coalition policies, but since the election there has been a dramatic change in the investment climate.  The Coalition's Minister for Finance was too closely associated with the conduct, or with the name of conducting, witch hunts for any individual, farmer or company who dared to make a profit.  The former Taoiseach had the opportunity to renew the confidence of the people in his Government by shuffling his Cabinet.  He failed to take this action and paid the price in the June election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The progress made to date by Fianna Fáil augurs well for 1978.  I look forward to hard work in this House during the coming year.  I represent a constituency in Dublin North East where <Col N="1485" /> unemployment is widespread and where the number of school leavers over the next five years must surely be the highest in the country.  I welcome some of the measures which have been taken by Fianna Fáil during the past five months.  I welcome in particular the recent establishment by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy of the industrial consortium for job creation and maintenance, identifying obstacles to growth and co-ordinating State agencies to take positive action to ensure that the jobs that are needed will be provided.  I welcome also the new advance factories and the new emphasis on home industries, evident in the IDA Bill.  In my view these will be very valuable measures for people seeking employment.  I commend the Minister for his enterprise development programme, which includes loan guarantees and interest subsidies for first time industrialists.  In the coming year I should like to see a venture capital fund, perhaps including the financial institutions.  I would also like to see two advance factories on the north side of Dublin city.</P>
    <P>The new ACC Bill provides for considerable flexibility in the provision of credit for agriculture.  I should like to see greater use of these provisions to encourage suitably qualified people, especially young people, to invest in the intensive areas of agriculture.  Section 8 (1) (a) (iv) of that Bill reads:</P>
    <P> Providing such other credit facilities as it thinks proper, (including giving guarantees to any person in relation to the payment of money, and of interest on the money, or the repayment of money paid by that person on foot of loans, advances or other credit facilities granted by that person and the payment of interest on such money), </P>
    <P>Section 8 (1) (a) (v) reads:</P>
    <P>engaging in the provision of hire purchase and leasing facilities and for that purpose acquiring, disposing of and otherwise dealing with stock, and </P>
    <P>Section 8 (1) (a) (vi) reads:</P>
    <P>arranging for the provision of credit facilities for any person... </P>
    <P>I believe that in these measures there <Col N="1486" /> is the flexibility to go much further in relation to the provision of the kinds of capital and resources which are necessary for young people to have a real involvement and interest in the intensive areas of agriculture.  To my knowledge this has not been the case to date.  I have read the provisions of the Bill and hope and trust they will be implemented.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to energy policy.  This was mentioned in the Taoiseach's speech and Deputy Barry also referred to it.  He said that energy had assumed enormous proportions in our economy in the past four years. It certainly has, as we are all very much aware.  Within those four years we should have had a comprehensive policy on energy, but no such policy was developed.  I welcome the announcement by the Minister last week that a decision on a nuclear power station will be made within the next six weeks.  Whichever way the decision goes it is important that it be accompanied by a policy for energy conservation.  It is quite obvious that we need better insulation in our homes and in our offices.  We need to use our natural gas as a premium fuel for fertilisers and for town gas supplies. We need to look at combined heat and power schemes which can increase fuel use from 35 per cent to 70 per cent and 75 per cent.  For instance, these might be power generating stations associated with district heating; in north Dublin it might be associated with glasshouse heating.</P>
    <P>We need a number of other measures to ensure adequate conservation of energy.  The measures are there to be used and I hope that the Minister in his policy will make adequate provision for conservation.  As a country we have become complacent regarding our energy supplies.  The OECD report in January, 1977, gave us a clear and simple message.  Either we conserve our energy supplies and develop a comprehensive energy policy or we face an even greater energy crisis in the next decade.</P>
    <P>I wish now to deal with the question of energy in Dublin.  There is a major problem in the cost of supplying electricity, particularly in the past 18 months.  This applies especially where <Col N="1487" /> there are no gas mains laid.  There are areas on the north side, in Milbrook, Mount Olive, Swan's Nest and St. Donagh's Estate where no gas mains have been laid.  These people must depend entirely on electricity for energy and therefore cannot avail of the Government subsidy on gas.  These people should be given special consideration during the coming year.</P>
    <P>Deserted wives, widows, the unemployed and low income families have been experiencing enormous difficulty in the past 18 months.  Many of them incurred large debts during last winter in respect of ESB bills and there have been many disconnections. There are very high investigation and reconnection fees and the families concerned have experienced great difficulty.  I suggest that consideration be given to the following measures.</P>
    <P>First, that the ESB be required to employ a small number of welfare officers to assess the situation and propose remedies before disconnecting any family.  Far too often people are disconnected and deprived of energy. Subsequently a Deputy, councillor or welfare officer has to plead with the ESB to have supplies restored, when in the first instance it should have been obvious that this would be a difficult welfare situation.  Secondly, I suggest that disconnections be suspended until early in the New Year to give people an opportunity at least to enjoy Christmas.  A major effort should be made to reconnect families for Christmas.</P>
    <P>With regard to the handicapped and welfare classes, although of necessity we must concentrate our efforts on getting the country moving again we must also ask ourselves where we are going and who is going with us.  I welcome the practical concern for handicapped and welfare groups shown by all sides of the House in the session that is now ending.  The society we seek is one in which our social concern matches our commitment to private enterprise, where economic development and social progress advance hand-in-hand.  The voluntary bodies who care for the handicapped have made enormous progress, and as a result <Col N="1488" /> many handicapped people have been trained to play a valuable part in our society.  These people will present new challenges to us in the coming year to provide workshops, employment incentives and aids for them.  I trust their needs will be catered for in the coming budget.</P>
    <P>With regard to the section dealing with industrial relations, Deputy Barry introduced the question of Ferenka in relation to the problem of industrial relations.  There are some valuable and simple lessons to be learned from recent events in Limerick.  I will make three points.  First, in dealing with disputes presently there is too much delay. There are agreed procedures for the settlement of disputes but too often they do not go into action quickly enough.  At times the personnel officer of the company concerned is unavailable and at other times the official union representatives are not readily available from headquarters.  In addition, far too often formal written agreement setting out the steps to be taken in the event of disputes does not exist in a company.  Qualified people are essential on both sides when disputes arise.  There is a need for substantial training grants for union representatives so that they can match fully the personnel managers in their negotiations.  I should like to see adequate funds made available to trade unions to enable them to give their representatives the training and development they consider fit.</P>
    <P>The second point concerns the monitoring of the multinationals.  I would ask Deputy Barry where was the director who represented the IDA and the taxpayer on the board of Ferenka when trouble was brewing?  Are the criteria for the appointment of such directors right?  I understand that the Coalition-appointed director in Ferenka was on the boards of numerous other companies.  Is this the right kind of procedure?  Did he, or was he able to give equal attention to all of the companies? The Coalition seemed to have had a weakness for appointing one superman to many directorships.  I note this was also the case with regard to boards and organisations connected with agriculture.  There are no such <Col N="1489" /> supermen but there are many competent Irishmen in all parties and in none who could contribute as directors in such circumstances.  We must learn the lesson of Limerick and ensure that we get the right men to represent us on these companies and boards.  We must pay them well enough to allow them to devote a major part of their time to the job.</P>
    <P>With regard to the monitoring of the multinationals, I see a need to strengthen greatly the Industrial Relations Unit of the IDA.  The multinationals must be accountable for the development of their industrial relations. Grants are payable in phases and these grants should be dependent on the introduction of recognised industrial relations procedures.  Union representatives should be free to report progress to the Industrial Relations Unit of the IDA, perhaps in association with the Government's nominee on the board.  In this way the Minister could be fully briefed and acquainted with progress in the company in regard to industrial relations.</P>
    <P>Special grants might also be related to the development of Irish management at top level.  This would bridge gaps in understanding which became evident in the Ferenka dispute between management and workers.  Similar monitoring procedures might well be adopted in relation to local industries assisted by the IDA.</P>
    <P>The third point I should like to make in relation to industrial relations is that of the implementation of the secret ballot.  I believe the unions themselves should insist on a secret ballot, possibly even a postal one, when strike action is proposed.  In that way the unions would be seen clearly to be putting into practice the principles of union democracy.  We all know of instances where a show of hands has led to victimisation, social pressures and a delay in reaching decisions workers themselves may well want. The implementation of the secret ballot would be very helpful in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have every confidence in the reasonableness and responsibility of the vast majority of Irish workers, given the right opportunity of expression.  Our children, who have a vested interest in this debate will not thank those of us <Col N="1490" /> who have a responsible part to play in developing good industrial relations if we do not come up with adequate solutions.  We all want to see strong unions and an end to inter-union disputes.</P>
    <P>In my community alone, on one short road, there are 1,000 children.  It is their futures and aspirations that we debate.  I welcome the Minister for Labour's proposed Commission on Industrial Relations.  I trust it will investigate urgently the whole range of industrial relations in industry.  I congratulate the unions on the work they have done over the last 60 years.  In relation specifically to the question of industrial relations and the problems it can cause, I would say to the wreckers, disrupters or false prophets, whether they be in management, unions or in the Oireachtas&mdash;and I say this on behalf of our younger people&mdash; be careful for you tread on my dreams.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The underlying theme of this debate and the main concern of those of us on all sides of the House is the problem of unemployment, that of providing an opportunity for a fulfilling and remunerative life for young people leaving our schools and for the many older people now finding themselves out of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to deal in my contribution exclusively with agriculture and the contribution it can make to preserving and creating jobs.  Far too much attention is paid to the alleged differences of interest between people in agriculture and those living in towns or engaged in other occupations.  Over the last four years the previous Government&mdash;and it was not the previous Government alone, the farmers and the country at large in response to improved prices in the EEC&mdash;succeeded in reducing the rate of flight from the land as against the preceding four years by half.  During that four year period approximately 20,000 fewer people left the land than in the previous four year period.  Those are 20,000 fewer people competing for jobs in towns; 20,000 fewer people competing with our schoolleavers for jobs.  If farming and agriculture can be expanded, if the population can be maintained on the land, that constitutes <Col N="1491" /> a direct contribution towards relieving the problem of unemployment in towns for young people and the unemployed in general.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Council, in their Report No. 34, pointed out that the right policies in relation to agriculture can have a major effect between 1975 and 1985 in the matter of employment.  Depending on whether what they describe as a high growth strategy or a low growth strategy is pursued by the Government and industry, there can be 15,000 more people employed in agriculture in 1985.</P>
    <P>It is not merely employment on the land that is important; it is employment in processing agricultural products as well.  In the same study the National Economic and Social Council pointed out that if a high growth strategy in agriculture was pursued we could create 24,000 new jobs in agricultural processing over the ten-year period between 1975 and 1985.  If on the other hand a low growth strategy in agriculture was pursued, we could expect to create only 570 new jobs.  Quite apart from those jobs there are the additional ones which agricultural prosperity will contribute in various services to farmers, the sale of inputs, the provision of contracting services and so on.</P>
    <P>When one compares the cost of creating a new job in agricultural processing or an existing one in agriculture with the very high cost indeed in terms of capital grants of creating a new job in industry, it is quite clear agriculture has a major contribution to make.  For every £1 of State resources spent on agriculture the return can be as good, if not better than that in other areas where money might be expended. Certainly I believe it will provide a better return than the type of public works programme talked about so much over the last few months. While the public works job may have an initial beneficial effect, it does not have any long-term, self-sustaining viability whereas a job preserved in agriculture or created in food processing does have the ability to sustain itself without continuing support from <Col N="1492" /> the Exchequer.  That is very important when looking into the future and at the level of public debt which this or any Government can afford to incur in the programmes now adopted.</P>
    <P>The National Coalition in their manifesto prior to the election recognised the lead role agriculture must play in the future of our economy; so also did the Fianna Fáil Party.  They stated that the main thrust in the recovery of the national economy must come from agriculture.  Those are words taken from their manifesto, words which I applaud sincerely and with which this side of the House agrees.  In view of the very specific statement that that is, it is unfortunate that the Taoiseach in his address here today devoted such a short part to agriculture.  Indeed nothing he said went beyond what one could describe as a very brief recital of well-known facts about agriculture.  There were no proposals, no suggestions for future action by the Government in relation to agriculture.  The Taoiseach spoke about initiatives in other areas of the economy, but he spoke of no initiative to be contemplated by the Government in relation to agriculture.  I hope a different attitude is adopted by him in future speeches.  I hope his neglect of agriculture in terms of positive proposals in this Adjournment Debate is merely an oversight, but I doubt it. The Minister for Agriculture, in relation to the decisions he has had to make so far, has shown a degree of indecision, of postponement of decisions which would have been unheard of in the tenure of his predecessor.</P>
    <P>I shall give a few examples which will demonstrate the case very clearly. In so doing it would be well to concentrate on those areas of our agricultural industry at present in crisis. For example, potato production is one where great difficulties are being experienced at present.  The price to the producer has fallen drastically and many producers who are engaged in an intensive and employment-giving form of horticulture are now facing severe losses.</P>
    <P>The Government in their election manifesto promised specifically that a <Col N="1493" /> potato marketing board would be established. If ever there was a need in any year for a potato marketing board surely it is this year.  The Government have been now five months in office, the period of greatest difficulty for the industry, and they have not yet delivered in regard to this board.  Neither have they given any indication as to when they may deliver on it.  They have not followed the example set by their Northern Ireland counterparts who introduced a special ware potato stock feed scheme which allows surplus potatoes at reasonable prices to be used for feeding stock by the Government taking up the potatoes at a price to the producer and reselling them for stock feed.  This Government have not done that.  Neither have they shown any serious endeavour in relation to a common agricultural policy in regard to potatoes and difficulties continue unabated because of lack of action by the Government.</P>
    <P>A similar potentially difficult situation exists in relation to grain as a result of a very good harvest this year. Substantial stocks of barley fill the grain stores.  It is not being used to any adequate extent for the production of compound feeding stuffs for those farmers feeding animals over the winter months.  Feeding stuffs are being imported and smuggled grain is crossing the Border.  This does not necessarily originate in Northern Ireland.  It may have originated in France and further afield.  This is being used instead of our own substantial stocks, and the result is it will be very difficult indeed to negotiate a reasonable price for barley next year.  The Government will say they have taken some action about smuggling and I have no doubt something has been done by the Revenue Commissioners, but without success. Grain smuggling continues.  I have put forward what I believe to be a foolproof way of dealing with this problem, namely, introducing under section 2 of the Fertilisers and Feedstuffs Act a requirement that all those selling compound feed must state on the bags the ingredients and the source of those ingredients.  In that way the problems could be identified.  I admit it would not deal entirely with the smuggling <Col N="1494" /> problem and, in that context, the answer must be a much closer vigilance on the part of the Revenue Commissioners along the Border.</P>
    <P>The Government also promised in their manifesto higher grants for farm storage of tillage products.  Here, too, we are facing a situation where there are substantial amounts of grain in stock.  They are likely to be more substantial next year if we have another good harvest and so there is obviously a very strong case for implementing this promise of higher grants for farm storage of grain now so that farmers will not be in a position of having to sell their grain at high cost to someone else to store or in terms of loss if the prices are not reasonable.</P>
    <P>We have a similar problem in the matter of the sheep industry.  Here the operative word would seem to be indecision.  The Minister says it is his intention to obtain free access for Irish sheep products to the French market on 1st January regardless.  His contention is, it is our legal right and he is trying to negotiate a bilateral deal with the French.  Why a bilateral deal if the Minister is really confident about free access from 1st January?  I believe he should be confident about his rights under the law now that the transition period is over and he should not be pursuing the prospect of a bilateral deal which will only give the French and the European Community an excuse to defer the introduction of a full common agricultural policy allowing completely free access to all parts of the Community for sheep products.  A patched up deal between this Government and the French Government on the eve of a French general election is hardly likely to give much solace to Irish sheep producers. The Minister's decision to go along that road, and in so doing possibly postpone the vigorous prosecution of a court case which has been resting since an oral hearing in May in the European Court, can only have adverse results. The court should have come to a decision long before now.  The fact that it has not done so is possibly due to lack of pressure by the Irish Government and the Minister because he wanted to negotiate a bilateral deal <Col N="1495" /> with the French.  This strategy is bound to create doubt as to its wisdom from the point of view of achieving a common agricultural policy and reasonable incomes for sheep producers who have little or no option but to be in sheep because of the nature of the land they work.</P>
    <P>As a major dairy producer we have an interest in expanding the market for milk products.  One of the measures proposed by the Council of Ministers at a meeting in April of this year was the introduction of a school milk scheme which would make milk and milk products available to school children.  The EEC agreed to provide 50 per cent of the cost provided the Governments in each of the Nine provided 25 per cent, half what the EEC was providing.  Many countries have already gone ahead and introduced the scheme.  Others have indicated they intend to do so and are drawing up the relevant legislation and making the relevant arrangements.  Our Government have not decided to do anything. Last week the Government were embarrassed when I raised this matter by way of parliamentary question and subsequently on the adjournment.  There was no Minister available.  The Minister for Social Welfare held he was not responsible but, lo and behold, the following week he took the debate. Presumably he had been given his instructions in the interval and the Government had made up their collective mind as to who was responsible in a matter that was going to bring in a valuable social service.  The Government would never have made up their collective mind had I not pressed the matter.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly, the challenge to agriculture is increased production.  In the last four years we have had substantially improved prices.  It is only fair to say that the increase in production in response to these prices has not been up to expectations.  What are the reasons for this?  I believe there are two reasons why the farmers' response has not been sufficient.  There is first the need to improve know-how in the best use of the land.  Farming is now highly scientific and farmers need the <Col N="1496" /> best possible advice and education. Secondly, there is need for improvement in the management structure of agriculture and the provision of better access to the management of farms by young small farmers who wish to expand their holdings and who are finding it very difficult to get land.  In relation to know-how, the previous Government decided to set up the National Agricultural Authority to unify research, education and advice, and that authority was in being when the Government left office.  It was ready to go immediately into operation to set clear development targets integrating these services which any sensible person will see should run together.  An adviser can only give advice based on research, and education is relevant only when it is based on the latest research.  It makes sense that these three services should be closely linked and that the planning for them should be integrated and carried out by one unified body.</P>
    <P>The first act of the new Minister was to announce that he was withdrawing the Agricultural Institute from the National Agricultural Authority. In the manifesto, the Minister is committed to setting up a separate agricultural training authority.  Instead of having one authority doing one job dealing with the thing in a businesslike manner, the new Government are setting up three authorities&mdash;the National Agricultural Authority, presumably dealing with advice; the Agricultural Institute, dealing with research; and the Agricultural Training Authority, dealing with training.  These will be good for people who wish to become chief executives of State companies and for people who wish to become members of boards of State companies, but it will not be good for agriculture to have three bodies doing a job that could be done by one body.  Instead of having decisions taken within the one building where researchers can consult with advisers and so on, these consultations will have to take place through letters between different offices throughout the country. Career structures will be set up and we will have separate empires built to the detriment of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1497" /> This penchant for creating new boards is not confined merely to agricultural education, research and advice. We will have the welcome setting up of a potato marketing board and a grain marketing board.  The functions which these boards will have are necessary, but I question the wisdom of setting up a lot of separate boards.  We will have a potato marketing board, a grain marketing board, Bord Bainne, the CBF and, according to the election manifesto, there will be an overall body which will supplement and co-ordinate the existing bodies.  The overall body will supplement and co-ordinate existing marketing efforts in liaison with CTT.  I do not disagree with the intention behind the setting up of these boards.  It is good that the Government are thinking in terms of having an executive agency responsible for an expanding marketing programme in the areas of potato and grain production, but I question the wisdom of having them all in separate empires with one overall body which is doing no more than supplementing and co-ordinating.  There is a strong case for having one authority to deal with all agricultural matters.  I doubt if the fragmentary approach of the Government will get the results or will ensure that our agricultural goods are processed to the maximum extent within this country and are not sent abroad for processing where the added value will occur.</P>
    <P>There is a need for integration of decision making in relation to agriculture, not only within the agencies under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture but within the Government between various other Departments which impinge on the development of agriculture.  Possibly the greatest agent for structural reform in agriculture is the non-contributory old age pension scheme operated by the Department of Social Welfare.  The non-contributory old age pension regulations require that a farmer who wishes to apply for an old age pension cannot retain ownership of the land.  In many cases that is the encouragement to older farmers to hand on their farms to their sons so that the son can get into full management of the land on an unfettered basis.  That aspect illustrates <Col N="1498" /> the fact that a Department apparently remote from agriculture can have a major beneficial effect on structural re-form in agriculture.  The Government should review the whole range of social welfare benefits which affect agriculture, the range of taxation which affects agriculture and the operation of the various schemes, including the farm modernisation scheme, which come within the ambit of the Department of Agriculture to see how they can be integrated in one common strategy so as to provide the maximum amount of employment for people on the land.  The danger is that if such co-ordination does not take place between the various Government agencies affecting agriculture, the tax code will be pushing the farmer in one direction, the farm modernisation scheme will be pushing him in another and the Department of Social Welfare scheme will push him in yet another direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government promised in their election manifesto that they would seek to have the development farmer category under the farm modernisation scheme expanded so that all farmers would be included and so that there would be no transitional category but just an expanded development category and a commercial category.  The number of farmers in the west, and in other parts too, who would not qualify for development status is nothing short of alarming. The difference in the amount of grants that they can get by being in the transitional category as against the development category may not be too significant in some cases&mdash; although it rules them out for equipment grants&mdash;but the psychological effect is great.  The implicit suggestion that development is not for them is very bad.  In the west of Ireland agriculture is and should be the answer for the vast majority of the population. We need to develop the small farms as well as farms which are now within the scheme.  I agree with the commitment given by the Government to seek <Col N="1499" /> an expanded development category and I hope something will be done about it in the near future.  A promise was also given to introduce 3 per cent subsidised loans for all farmers in the development category.  When will these 3 per cent subsidy loans be introduced?</P>
      <P>In the west and north west of Ireland much land is in need of improved drainage and the EEC has now proposed to make substantial sums of money available for drainage. If an arterial drainage scheme is to be introduced there are a number of complicated preliminaries through which the scheme must go.  The scheme must be exhibited, objections have to be taken, and there has to be circulation to the various Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally there has to be a decision by the Minister for Finance to make representations to the Government.  It takes approximately two years from the date that the scheme is decided upon for it to commence operation.  If, as is likely, that money is to be available to this country from the EEC say next year, it is vital that the planning start now with the processes I have mentioned&mdash;the exhibition, the taking of objections, the decision in relation to the various arterial drainage schemes in the west of Ireland.  It is further vital that any EEC money made available for drainage be used not merely to prop up existing drainage programmes, which are going ahead anyway, but to create new forms of field drainage which would otherwise not have occurred.  It is also important that research by the Irish Agricultural Institute in relation to the drainage of land be given the maximum possible support.  There are many new techniques being developed to find how the impermeable soils which retain water can be made more permeable.  Techniques such as the deep plough and mould draining are being developed.  The North Connacht farmers are providing an impetus for the use of such machinery in a programme they have recently announced. The Government must give maximum support to this programme.  With adequate drainage there would be tremendous potential for the development <Col N="1500" /> of agriculture on land which is now not capable of such development. I hope the Government will not be remiss in availing of this opportunity of expanding rapidly the drainage programme, particularly in the west of Ireland.  Of course, development potential of improved drainage exists in every part of the country.</P>

      <P>I am glad that, just approaching six months after resuming <Col N="1504" /> office, we get an opportunity to hear from the Taoiseach in detail about the present state of the economy.  This morning the Taoiseach gave us a detailed report on the economy and detailed the major political decisions which are being considered by the Government. It is an opportune time for the Taoiseach to return from the Heads of State Summit with such an attractive financial deal for 1978.  It augurs well for the economy that our contribution to the EEC has been agreed at the figure which the Taoiseach was successful in negotiating.</P>
      <P>I welcome and congratulate our three colleagues on their appointments as Junior Ministers.  Their appointment is an indication of the attention these Departments need&mdash;the Departments of the Public Service, Environment and Industry, Commerce and Energy.  The Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy has a senior and two junior Ministers.  The provision of energy for industry and domestic use has been brought under the Minister responsible for job creation.  No greater assistance can be given to industry than the provision of energy at an economic price.  Energy is one of the main cost factors in job creation.</P>
      <P>The setting up of the industrial development consortium will be a major contributor to job creation in 1978.  It would appear that our exports in 1977 will rise to £2,500 million, a 35 per cent increase on 1976.  The significant and rapid rise in our exports augurs well for 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most significant contribution to next year's performance is the successful and realistic conclusion of the Employer/Labour Conference.  Much has been said of industrial problems and strife and it is only right that we should put on record the favourable industrial relations that exist in 95 per cent of our industry.  Unfortunately, a few problems have been highlighted and blown up out of proportion. Over the years, Government and industry have displayed a constructive and responsible attitude towards labour relations.  Complicated negotiations are going on at present and the Government have issued the necessary <Col N="1505" /> information to ensure that the right financial mix will come out of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>The major success story of our short term in office has been the building industry. Cement sales are already showing a significant increase.  In my constituency, which is rapidly growing, the building industry have reaped the benefit of Fianna Fáil's return to power.  Building in the private sector is pressing ahead and there have been 6,000 applications for the £1,000 grant which was speedily introduced by the Minister for the Environment.  Yesterday's introduction of the home improvement scheme by the Minister for the Environment follows on that decision and will have great potential for job creation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred in detail to agriculture, with which he is familiar. I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by him, particularly in relation to the introduction of added value to our first-class agricultural products. In regard to added value, I would refer to the report of the IDA on the beef processing industry.  We now have two sectors in this industry, the co-operative movement and the private operators.  In that way we have an ideal mix of interests which should ensure fair competition.  We all agree that it is wrong to export 700,000 live-stock and that there is tremendous potential in this area if we expand existing operations and introduce new developments in the food and beef processing industries.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture is making more headway in a short time in regard to sheep by bringing about the possibility of a solution rather than a long drawn-out legal wrangle.  The beef processing industry has excellent potential and I would ask the Government to assist investment in that industry because it is a real natural resource. It is not subject to the shortages of other natural resources such as minerals and oil.  The dairy industry is an example of the way in which we should be endeavouring to introduce a quality brand name for Irish beef.</P>
    <P>On 1st January we will gain full membership of the EEC.  That has its <Col N="1506" /> challenges.  It will have its competitiveness and its potential.  It is its potential that we must endeavour to capitalise on fully.  We cannot expect to gain its possibilities without having to face its competition and that is where the present round of wage negotiations will have a major and significant effect for 1978.</P>
    <P>From the EEC we have a great degree of confidence coming in the way of financial incentives.  We foresee in 1978 a real regional fund.  In the past we have seen that the moneys from the regional fund diverted in to the Central Exchequer and never really getting to the regions they were intended for.  There is real potential for us within the EEC and other member states recognise that under the new Fianna Fáil Government funds made available from Brussels will be used to the maximum to give the necessary uplift and expansion which is possible within our economy.  The development of industry, under the guidance of the IDA, has also been fully debated here since Fianna Fáil took over.  We are all aware that under the new IDA legislation there is great potential for changing the financial strategy of that body.  We are aware that the IDA will be in a position to make a lot more money available to Irish companies, co-operatives and other organisations prepared to put in their part of the investment and work on whatever project is approved.  This is a situation where they are budgeting for 50 per cent Irish investment and 50 per cent foreign investment in 1978.  That is a changing situation from that which existed in the late sixties and early seventies.  It is a situation where Irish entrepreneurs and co-operative movements have an opportunity of doing their homework, planning and programming and producing to the IDA factual plans with a request, indirectly, for Government funds.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister for Labour, following discussions with Industry and Commerce, had Dublin city and county designated a special area for the creation of employment.  Unfortunately, the situation had deteriorated a little too far when that recognition was given to Dublin and surrounding areas.  For the IDA to <Col N="1507" /> take some positive action in this planning, financing and programming was necessary.  In the last couple of weeks the IDA have made the first real moves to assist Dublin in the employment area when in the Walkinstown-Clondalkin area, they agreed on the building of a nine factory-cluster.  Likewise, they have agreed on a development in the Liberties.  Advance factories will be erected there for Irish companies either to commence operations or expand.  There is a positive and real challenge to a number of our small organisations to produce plans and seek new markets making use of their existing capabilities.  As the IDA assess applications they want to see a proven track record and many operations can provide this.  It is a challenge to them and I hope a number of existing Dublin companies accept that challenge and seek extra factory floor space to expand their operations and create more employment.</P>
    <P>The question of young people seeking employment is a matter which is dear to us all.  Based on the fundamental shift in Fianna Fáil's educational policies when in Government we now have a good mix of technical and academic students.  It is possible that the numbers are still unbalanced.  One finds that when trying to create employment in sectors other than agriculture to get the technical expertise from new applicants is often not possible. AnCO are providing a valuable service but there is no compensation for practical experience.  This will be a problem in the future and one which needs the attention of the new industrial development consortium.  The setting up of that consortium means that for the first time Government Ministers will have a forum, with the executive charged with the responsibility of spending the taxpayer's money in investing in job creation and in exports. It is an ideal opportunity for Government Ministers to direct spending in a most constructive and positive way.  As our semi-State bodies, private companies and the Government are charged with accounting for their stewardship annually we will have in that consortium the expertise necessary to <Col N="1508" /> direct finance in a way in which it can quickly and most efficiently assist the job creation programme.</P>
    <P>It is neither helpful nor constructive to our economy that one should continually be critical when an air of confidence and optimism is necessary. As we approach the closing days of 1977 we are experiencing a restoration of confidence in the Irish economy and in our people.  That, coupled with the forthcoming budget, can mean the laying of the foundation for our policies and our programmes.  It is the duty of a Government to create the environment and it is the duty of the many capable people here to operate and improve within that favourable environment.</P>
    <P>It has been said continually by public and private enterprise that while the Coalition were in power there was not much point in making an effort because taxation had gone out of proportion. People felt it was not worth the effort.  Our task is to ensure that the situation cannot prevail where it is not in the interests of our people to work.  They must be given the opportunity to improve their own lot and that of the community.</P>
    <P>The coming year will give us an opportunity of moving forward and judging by the fact that our export figures for the year so far show an increase of 35 per cent there are grounds for cautious optimism.  This must be recognised by politicians, employers, educationalists and those charged with the responsibility of manning and operating our economy.</P>
    <P>This morning the Taoiseach dealt with those issues at length.  He mentioned many other relevant issues, one being industrial relations.  He said:</P>
    <P> If we are to prosper we must create employment in industry and services.  There can be no question that our tax and grant regimes provide attractive incentives for industrialists thinking of investing here. But there are intangible factors which can often be as important to an investor as incentives measured in terms of cash-flow and discount rates.  Social stability is one of these factors.  A pleasant environment is another.  And good industrial relations is a third. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1509" /> In 1977, social stability has led to a reopening of the potential of our tourist industry.  Tourists came back to Ireland.  It was a most successful year. In the coming weeks and months, if we can restore that optimism and co-operation in our industrial relations, there is no reason why, as in agriculture and tourism in 1977, job creation and forward movement in industry cannot be achieved in 1978.</P>
    <P>Now that we have been in office for six months, I hope all political parties will support the Government who are committed to carrying out the task for which they sought a mandate from the Irish people.  A recent poll confirmed the results of the election. The people are still of the same frame of mind.  They are confident that the Government can deliver, not on promises because this party did not make promises to the electorate.  They laid before the electorate a detailed document with short-term, medium-term and end of term policies, and strategies. To date we have lived up to that document.</P>
    <P>The £1,000 new house grant and the abolition of car tax were not promises. They were forward looking and creative policies.  We realised a financial injection was needed in the building industry. Surely it is better to create employment than to pay out large sums of money in social welfare when people want work and are willing to work.  Already the results are there to be seen.  Over 6,000 people want to buy new homes.  There is a tremendous spin-off of employment in the production of fittings and fixtures as well as the actual buildings.  It will be the task of the Department of the Environment to keep the supply of serviced land available for housing development. That will be a big draw on Government spending.  It will have to be faced up to.</P>
    <P>The Government quickly saw another need for major investment and introduced the Telephone Capital Bill. As politicians we have had representations from industry and from private individuals and we realise that major investment is needed in that area.  After our first six months in office, we are pleased to report that the Bill is <Col N="1510" /> advancing rapidly and money will be available very shortly for investment where it is so badly needed.</P>
    <P>Yesterday a group of consultants produced a detailed report on cross-Border development for the Derry-Donegal area.  There is need for an investment of £50 million in this area. The infrastructure, telephone service and communications must be improved if we can ever hope to make any progress in that area.  Positive action has been taken.  The Government and our EEC partners must make a commitment to provide the funds. Let us hope it will be forthcoming as a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I should like to look forward to 1978 as a year of real potential.  We must create an environment in which positive development can take place.  I hope the people negotiating the wage agreement will appreciate that, whether you get cash in your hand through an increase in your salary or wage or a tax relief, your net take home pay is what matters.  This morning the Taoiseach spelled out what that means in terms of finance.  I am satisfied that, given a proper wage agreement, there are real possibilities for 1978.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the weekend I listened to a radio programme in which the Leader of the Fine Gael Party was interviewed.  He was asked one very relevant question: What did he think of the performance of the new Fianna Fáil Government in their first six months in office?  His comment was very direct: &ldquo;They are still on their honeymoon.&rdquo;  I am afraid their political happiness will have to be disturbed. Concerning the Ferenka affair we were asked to let the dust settle. We cannot let the Government off the hook for the mess they made of the Ferenka affair.  When they ask us to let the dust settle, they are really asking us to brush it under the carpet and forget the whole mess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can well imagine the vicious attacks which would have been made on the previous Government if such a closure had occurred during their term of office.  Need I name the leader of the pack and the back-up he would get in exchanges on that closure?  I refer in particular to the <Col N="1511" /> Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, and the Minister for Labour, two Ministers now deeply involved in this whole terrible mess.  In no way will I remain silent.  I must be critical because I come from that region and I can now see with regret the terrible consequences of the closure.</P>
    <P>In mid-west Limerick, North Tipperary and Clare, when the votes were counted on June 17th, 13 Deputies were elected to Dáil Éireann.  Eight were Government Deputies and five were Opposition Deputies.  When the newly elected Taoiseach announced his Cabinet later, we were delighted to have four Ministers in the area.  We felt the mid-west region would go places.  When these Ministers were in Opposition they castigated the Government as being irresponsible.  I was looking forward to greater concern, greater involvement and greater responsibility from the new Government.  Where is this great concern now?  Where is the job creation manifesto?  What does this manifesto mean to the 1,450 men who lost their jobs in the Ferenka dispute?</P>
    <P>Over the weekend announcements were made about impending trade union legislation in the new year.  I wonder are we panicking.  I believe we have sufficient legislation to handle trade disputes.  Over the years there have been good relations in local and foreign firms between trade unions and management.  I am afraid the unions and workers are being put on the chopping block and made victims of the circumstances that surrounded the closure.  Perhaps the powers that be should look at this a little further. Would they not accept that there is an urgent need to draw up a code of activities and standards for non-national firms in the area of labour relations?</P>
    <P>In the ensuing debate over the past few weeks charges and counter-charges of irresponsibility have been made against trade unions from all quarters. These are unwarranted attacks on a body of men who for the last two years, because of an appeal from the then Taoiseach to control and minimise wage demands, in conscience and in <Col N="1512" /> service to their country accepted wage agreements far less than were needed to meet the demands of rising costs at that time.  These charges of irresponsibility should be refuted.</P>
    <P>Now I come to another aspect of the problem at Ferenka.  What about management? Were they wholly innocent when you come down to basic facts and the incident that led to this unholy mess?  A man was asked to clean a toilet.  Was the man who issued that order not irresponsible when he knew in his heart that he was asking a man to do something which in the normal course of his duties he should not have to do?  Was this not provocation on the floor of the factory?</P>
    <P>When the problem was resolved over the weekend, everybody was happy to go back to work and all sides said to forget the past and work would start on Monday morning.  Was it not provocation when twenty minutes after starting time the seven men involved were told to get off the premises or the management would get somebody to put them off?  To my mind this was premeditated provocation and indicates that this firm was looking for an excuse to close the concern.  These statements must be made no matter how distasteful they are, because if this unholy mess is to be put on record historically all the facts that led to the closure must be revealed.</P>
    <P>A suggestion has been made that we should let the dust settle.  Perhaps if we analyse the dust, as I see it, we can appreciate why the people in my area are so angry over the failure of the Government to resolve the problem. One thousand, four hundred and fifty jobs have gone to the wall.  So far as small towns are concerned that is equal to 28 small industries and the lives of approximately 10,000 people have been disturbed, giving a net loss to the region of approximately £10 million a year.  This has been a terrible blow to the dependants of the employees and the commercial life of the area. We must not forget the £9 million State money involved when this firm was started.</P>
    <P>Because of all these facts the Government of the day must stand indicted <Col N="1513" /> for their handling of the whole sordid affair.  I can appreciate the anger in my region and to express the feelings of the general public I must say these harsh words tonight.</P>
    <P>Last week I listened to the debate&mdash; unfortunately I was unable to make a contribution.  Before the debate I was critical of the situation but after it I was even more critical, particularly with reference to the activities of the two Ministers directly involved&mdash;the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy. In the opinion of many in my area both can be accused of a lack of courage, interest, concern and adequate expertise in their handling of this dispute.  As a window dressing operation to cover up their failures, last week the Taoiseach met the bishop, the workers and the Limerick council of trade unions.  This is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Because he comes from the region I lay the major portion of the blame on the table of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  In his contribution to last week's debate he referred to a statement he made on 21st October indicating the imminent prospects of the direct loss of more than 1,450 jobs in the industrial estate at Ferenka.  He said that as the Minister responsible he was satisfied there was a grave and imminent danger of the group closing down.  He went on to ask what clearer warning could any Minister give than that statement?  He said that if he were divinely inspired, which he was not, he could not put the matter more clearly.  Does he as a Minister and a Deputy really believe that a warning in Dáil Éireann was sufficient?  How can the people of my area accept that he was a concerned Minister and Deputy?  At no stage&mdash;and I emphasise this&mdash;did he make a genuine attempt to unite the Limerick people in an effort to save the industry.  About a month ago he did a Pontius Pilate act at a very critical and difficult stage, and bowed out of the dispute.</P>
    <P>Even after last week's debate I still have many relevant questions to ask him, and I believe the workers and the people in my area are most anxious <Col N="1514" /> to hear some answers.  First, did he inform the Government of what happened at his first meeting with the AKZO people?  Second, was there a threat made at that stage?  Third, was there any request made to him for State aid and if so, how much was requested? Fourth, was the Cabinet involved in any discussion on such a request, if made?  Fifth, why could he not have called a meeting of all the Limerick people involved in the dispute and given them the benefit of his talks with AKZO?</P>
    <P>I now come to the contribution and involvement of the Minister for Labour, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald.  I listened to his contribution last week. Basically his contribution was, &ldquo;there is machinery available to remedy such situations and I cannot be expected to be involved in every dispute&rdquo;.  Was that answer satisfactory to the people in my area?  How can they have confidence in this Minister who stood idly by as 1,450 jobs went to the wall?  Can he not be accused of indifference to the problem which beset the biggest industry that ever came to this country? There was a serious threat to 1,450 jobs and his only answer was &ldquo;I cannot interfere in every dispute&rdquo;. These were the words of a Minister who, up to last June, was a severe critic of our Government even if only one job was at stake.  Too well I remember his attitude in the last four years.  No matter what the Government did they were wrong.  On that basis his performance in the Ferenka dispute has not been up to the standard we should expect from a Minister for Labour&mdash;a senior post in the Government.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on record my appreciation of the tremendous efforts made by the executive of the Limerick council of trade unions.  Their one objective in the dispute at all stages was to keep the discussion open, and this they achieved with great patience and endurance.  They displayed a sense of responsibility and, in my opinion they validated the theory that such bodies can contribute to the well-being and development of our economy. Regretfully the two Ministers I referred to showed little interest in and regard for the efforts of the council.  In fact <Col N="1515" /> they practically ignored them.  Their attitude was incredible in view of the seriousness of the situation, and it does not indicate to me and to many people in my area that they are concerned about the employment situation. They were not concerned enough to get deeply involved to ensure that this vital industry would be saved. Indeed, their performance in the dispute can offer little solace or consolation to the 180,000 unemployed, and I am sure it will not go unnoticed by the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>Six months ago the people were given in the Fianna Fáil manifesto a set of the most seductive promises ever made to an Irish electorate.  On the whole they believed it&mdash;certainly many in my area did&mdash;and Fianna Fáil were returned to power.  By far the most attractive and important promise was that of creating 20,000 jobs in the first year.  After two years of recession the people were almost pathetically eager to believe anyone who claimed to have the answer to the dreadful problem of unemployment and they turned to Fianna Fáil. If the promise of 20,000 jobs in the first year is achieved, my region&mdash;the mid-west region&mdash;should benefit to the extent of 1,400 jobs&mdash;a most ironic figure.</P>
    <P>Even before the Ferenka dispute people were beginning to question the prospect of such a target being reached.  Even though they read in the papers daily that the recession was over it was meaningful only when their husbands and children obtained employment. Political commentators assured them that the good days were back, but they were still in the dole queues.  To say that people were becoming uneasy is an understatement. They were beginning to fear that the people who spoke so confidently last June had nothing but words to offer. Even before the Ferenka affair people were wondering if once again they had been conned by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The closure of Ferenka had a shattering effect on the people in my area.  Instead of the hundreds of new jobs promised 1,450 were lost.  This is not just another statistic.  Scores of <Col N="1516" /> these workers are my constituents, my friends and neighbours.  During the past weekend I have spoken to men aged 50 years and they have accepted the fact that they will never again have employment.  I have spoken to fathers and mothers who dread the prospect of Christmas because instead of bringing presents Santa Claus may be taking away the car outside the door or the furniture in the house.</P>
    <P>I hope an independent and unbiased investigation will be conducted into the whole sordid background of Ferenka if only to silence the chorus of uninformed comment that is presently filling the air.  To me the right to work comes second only to the right to live.  Last June the electorate chose a Government to guarantee them that right.  It is not the duty of the trade union movement or the multinationals to guarantee that right.  It is the duty of the Government, a Government who made this the number one plank of their election manifesto.  These are the people who will still assure us that they intend to create 20,000 jobs this year.  I am appalled, as are many of my constituents, at the prospect that faces the mid-west region and the country as a whole if the Government's handling of the Ferenka dispute is an indication of the urgency, determination and efficiency they will bring to bear on the much larger national problem.</P>
    <P>The Government have major responsibility to the 1,450 employees and to the community that depends on their earnings.  They cannot wash their hands of the affair or hope to make good the loss with a number of very small industries.  An industry on the scale of Ferenka is needed immediately, and if the IDA are in a position to do something they should get the full support of the Government. If they are not in a position to do something they should not build up false hopes.  The Government should come out into the open.  They owe it to the people in my area.</P>
    <P>I read in the papers last weekend that the Minister indicated that he was classifying the mid-west region as a designated area.  I hope that when he is drawing up the plans that he will include North Tipperary.  My information <Col N="1517" /> is that there are approximately 350 people from my constituency who have been affected by the closure of Ferenka.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the most alarming industrial disaster that has struck this country, I should like to deal with employment generally.  So far as industrial development and job creation in the mid-west region is concerned, for this year the only clear figure for job creation is 191.  I learned this at a meeting of the Mid-Western Health Board last Friday week.  It is a job creation programme initiated by the previous Government with the objective of creating 3,000 jobs in the health services.  For the year ending 1977 the realistic figure for job creation in my region is 191.</P>
    <P>I have listened to many speakers refer to the need to develop our natural resources.  I am completely behind this idea.  In my area we have a very valuable natural resource&mdash;I refer to our bogs.  I welcome the decision of the previous Minister to locate a briquette factory near Littleton which will give jobs to approximately 250 people.  I would ask the new Minister to consider extending the scope of operations far beyond the Littleton-Templetuohy area right across to Roscrea where there is ample scope for further development of this natural resource.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I addressed a question to the Minister for Justice on the necessity of reopening a Garda station in Littleton, one of the fast developing settlements in my constituency&mdash;either the reopening of the station or placing a garda in permanent domicile in the area.  I mention this because I believe the Minister has it in mind.  I wish him success and hope he will see this objective achieved.</P>
    <P>There is grave need for a rethink in relation to Garda stations in rural areas today.  Ten years ago, with the rush from rural areas to cities and the denuding of rural populations, there was less need for security and Garda protection.  I can assure the Minister and the people of Dublin that rural Ireland today is in grave need of better Garda facilities and the reopening of many small stations.  People living in rural areas are becoming very concerned because the emphasis at present <Col N="1518" /> seems all to be placed on resolving the vandalism problem in the city of Dublin.  We in rural Ireland are not immune from this unfortunate curse that has befallen our country; we suffer the same type of vandalism, but not to the same extent.  Many people living in isolated areas do so in continuous fear, particularly at night, of a break-in or of having some frightening experience at the hands of some wrongdoer, perhaps with the intent of robbing.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister for Health to take note of recommendations submitted by the health board of which I am a member, a submission that will be with him this week, on the urgent need for improving and modernising the services in our region.  An estimate of the total works we considered necessary amounted to something over £4,500,000.  We know that all of the promises made last June cannot be met.  We were realistic about them.  We submitted a priority list of approximately £2 million needed for the most pressing services needed in our hospitals.</P>
    <P>On a regional basis I would refer in particular to the need for improving our orthopaedic services at Croom serving the needs of the mid-western region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also the need for extra services at the County Hospital in Nenagh.  Need I emphasise again the unease felt by the people of North Tipperary at the delay in the appointment of senior staff at Nenagh County Hospital, which has been awaited since the October, 1975 decision of the then Minister for Health to retain the hospital there as a county hospital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like briefly to refer to our small farmers, the backbone of our agricultural community.  The other day the Minister for Finance introduced a Consolidation Bill giving the Agricultural Credit Corporation more money to assist farmers in building up their farms.  I hope small farmers will get sufficient assistance from the ACC <Col N="1519" /> in building up their stocks, thereby continuing to contribute to the economy.</P>
    <P>I am sympathetic to the questions of the Land League and the plight of small farmers, in particular with regard to the division of land and the farm modernisation scheme.  I urge the Minister concerned to give these matters due consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an appropriate time of the year to look back and examine progress made.  It is also an opportune time for us on this side of the House to offer our congratulations and help to the Taoiseach and his Government for the work they have performed in difficult times.  It is appropriate also that we congratulate Deputies Raphael Burke, Ray MacSharry and John O'Leary on their new appointments.  We shall look forward to their contributions in their respective Departments.  I believe they are realists in the truest sense.  We in Government must be confident that what we are doing is correct, is for the betterment of all our people or for as many as possible of them.</P>
      <P>After the last general election the most appropriate task facing us as a party in Government was to instil and build up confidence in our people.  It is a slow process but it is being done and, as the Taoiseach said this morning, the results are becoming evident. Gone are the days when we had Ministers&mdash;particularly from the financial aspect&mdash;flying all over the world borrowing money, making arrangements for loans without any positive plan or confidence that what they were doing was correct; without any confidence being felt amongst our people that what that Government or Minister was doing would be to their benefit or achieve any solidarity.  Hence the slow progress of building up confidence was the first and most appropriate task of the Taoiseach and his Government during the past six months and indeed will be for some time to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key factor in all of this is the creation of a positive jobs programme. The Ferenka affair was an outstanding one in itself.  But crying in the <Col N="1520" /> wilderness will not gain any momentum for anybody, least of all for those unfortunate workers who may have a very bleak Christmas.  But it may not be as bleak as they may think.  I remember in my town and in the city of Galway industries which went to the wall in the last four years, when there was compensation given by way of social welfare and other means.  Certainly the workers there were not denuded as they might have been many years ago.  When such a catastrophe occurs poverty is not as evident as it would have been heretofore.  Of course, there is a certain amount of sympathy to be sought in such a plight, but it does not constitute the answer to the question and we must learn a lesson from the experience.</P>
    <P>The Government can usefully turn their attention to the creation of employment in rural areas, particularly by way of small industries where enough is not being done.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, with the assistance of his new Minster of State today, might well turn his attention to this sector.  Most of such industries are family-owned.  Any one industry today employing, say, ten people could be assisted if the Industrial Credit Company loosened their purse-strings on a solid proposal to give ten more people employment with, perhaps, a grant from the Industrial Development Authority.  Indeed it would constitute a cheap way of the Minister getting over this problem of the creation of employment.  When one takes account of a small industry, the type of which I have spoken about or of proposals incorporated in a county development plan of a qualified man who might want to form a small industry employing four to ten people&mdash; were such to be given a grant of £4,000 or £5,000&mdash;it would constitute a substantial help in getting them off the ground.  Again if the facilities of the Industrial Credit Company were offered it would be an added incentive. Would it not be a cheap way of creating ten or 12 new jobs in comparison with the techniques employed by the multinationals?  The multinationals are needed to absorb much of the manpower available in say, the cities of Dublin, Limerick, Cork or others.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1521" /> A great deal more could be done for the small industry and the small industrialist.  There is a major role to be played here.  If we build correctly, we will reap the rewards.  Small industrialists will not go to the wall. They are not the people about whom questions will be asked in this House with regard to unemployment and loss of jobs.  These are family units.  There is pride in a family name, and these units should be given all the help we can give them.</P>
    <P>In my constituency we have a good semi-State body.  There is room for expansion.  The Irish Sugar Company give good employment in Tuam.  At the moment, farm machinery in excess of needs is being imported.  The sugar company know what the farmer wants and could play a far greater role still in providing more employment.  I have referred to this before.  It is a hobby-horse of mine.  You have the technical knowhow in Tuam to produce all kinds of equipment, and the production of such equipment would provide good sound jobs with no danger of the industry going to the wall.  I should like the Department to investigate the position to see if something could be done.  There is room here for solid expansion of an existing industry which would provide good jobs.</P>
    <P>Is it most heartening to hear the Taoiseach say that agricultural output rose by an estimated 30 per cent in value and 9 per cent in volume?  Over the past four years, every time something was proposed in regard to agriculture a halo was hung over the Minister's head and Government spokesmen said the Minister was the greatest thing that ever happened.  We have no halos now, but we have results, and the results speak clearly for the performance of the Minister and his staff.  Unfortunately, there are facets of agriculture which have not shown improvement.  Sheep and potatoes are two.  The Minister has intimated that he will examine these aspects.  I look forward to something really effective being done where sheep are concerned.</P>
    <P>A whole new structure is required in potato marketing.  This is an industry <Col N="1522" /> that suffers the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune because in one year there is a fluctuation in price which is against the consumer and the following year the price fluctuates against the producer.  This must not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>The advisory services must be taken out of the confines in which they have been placed over the past four years. The agricultural sector is suffering because now the advisers are locked up in offices signing forms and documents. The staff must be increased so that the advice the farmer needs will be available to him or the papers must be taken away from the advisory service. The personnel of the advisory service were trained to give advice to the farmers.  That is the work for which they are paid.  I look forward to their return to that work.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission now seem to be without a head.  We do not know where we are going.  Neither do we know from whence we are coming.  All the directives from Brussels seem to affect the Land Commission, and the Land Commission are no longer doing the work they should be doing.  They have a major role to play in the abolition of congestion.  That is the first priority.  Under the retirement scheme, land bought by the Land Commission must be given to development farmers. In my county, 80 per cent of the farmers have a poor law valuation of less than £25.  The retirement scheme is in jeopardy and so too are the congested farmers.  We must have a Land Commission with a responsible political head.  At the moment, there is great uncertainty amongst small farmers when they see bigger farmers getting land.  The Land Commission are not doing the kind of job they did up to 1970 or 1971.  Abnormalities seem to be creeping in.  There is a major role to be played.  Deputy Bruton and other speakers on this side of the House referred to the small farmers.  The Land Commission appear to be a ship without a captain, irresponsible and floating as they will.  We cannot afford this in days of rapid progress because those depending on its services cannot afford to be left so far behind that they have no hope of recovery.</P>
    <P>Great credit is due to the Minister <Col N="1523" /> for the Environment who has done a wonderful job in a difficult Department, as the Taoiseach rightly pointed out this morning.  There is great buoyancy now in the construction industry and in all its subsidiary industries. The 6,500 houses produced by the Minister for the Environment up to 1st December has been an achievement unparalleled in the private sector in my time in politics.  The local authorities schemes are still going ahead.  Deputy Tully said today that the 25,000 houses predicted by the Government would not be reached this year.  The figure will be reached in one year of Fianna Fáil administration. If the efforts of Deputy Barrett, the Minister for the Environment, in four or five months are sustained, the target will be reached.  We will have the best year yet in the building industry. These results have occurred because of the clear policy of the Government in relation to that Ministry.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Tully was speaking I felt like reminding him that he was the Minister who cut out the grants in his time.  The restoration of the £1,000 grant is the lifestream of many people and is a most welcome development. The increased reconstruction grants have contributed to a buoyancy in a section of the community which over the past number of years has been held back because the grants available were unrealistic.  Rates remission was also introduced by the Minister for the Environment and was welcomed throughout the country.  In rural Ireland a lot of work still remains to be done.  It worries me that a former Minister for Local Government would dare stand up in this House and criticise the performance of that Minister.  Car tax relief was also welcomed.  The 11 per cent increase in the rates is most welcome. It is almost 6 per cent more than the Dublin County Council allowed themselves last year.  That is a significant increase to the people of this city.  Last Monday we in Galway County Council could strike our new rate within the 11 per cent and grant practically everything that the county Manager and the council requested of us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1524" /> The Department of Agriculture could lessen the rates burden, particularly in County Galway where the committee of agriculture carries on an agricultural educational programme which costs a certain amount of money.  I believe this to be the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture. The county council should be left with more money to complete their other works.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil election manifesto has been referred to on numerous occasions by the Opposition front benches.  Almost every time I come into this House I see the manifesto on the Opposition front benches.  On almost every question and on almost every major piece of legislation, the manifesto is produced.  This is the first time in our history that there has been such unanimity.  The manifesto produced by Fianna Fáil was so unique that all sections in this House are interested in it, and it is used here daily to insist and ensure that its promises are implemented by the Government. If the Opposition remains consistent in helping us to implement the manifesto I have no doubt that at the end of this Dáil we will be in a position to prepare a second manifesto and we will have plently of time to do so.  I welcome the Opposition's performance in insisting on the implementation of every idea in the manifesto. It is a pity that they did not ask us to give them a few ideas before the last general election.  It is our job to see that the manifesto is implemented. The people voted upon it.  I can assure the Opposition that if their agreeable performance in regard to its implementation continues, the manifesto will be fully implemented and we will have the next manifesto ready well in time for the next general election.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned the regional fund in his address.  The underdeveloped areas in the West of Ireland are now included under the regional fund.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture should come together and make this blanket agreement because the regional fund will be of great benefit to the West of Ireland.  Eighty per cent of our farmers are under the £25 poor law valuation. <Col N="1525" /> We should have blanket coverage of Connacht as an underdeveloped area, because Connacht needs special help.</P>
    <P>Money from Brussels was recently allocated for drainage proposals. Drainage is a serious problem for areas west of the Shannon.  That river is causing untold flooding and the problem of drainage must get absolute priority.  The Taoiseach in his remarks referring to the health services said:</P>
    <P>to see if legislation requires revision, facilities are in need of rationalisation or other changes are necessary to improve the quality or the efficiency of the service. </P>
    <P>At last we have come to tackling the problem.  I have questioned the expenditure of the Western Health Board and how in 1971 the cost was a fraction less than £1 million and six years later the cost is £37 million.  We have no extra beds at the Regional Hospital in Galway, and despite the fact that the other hospitals have closed or have been put in danger and we must absorb their patients. There are a lot of things wrong in the health board services.  They are overladen with officials and the money is not reaching to where the services were intended.  I welcome the decision of the Government to review the position of the health services.  I do not envy the Minister who has to sit down and do it.  He has a formidable task in trying to breach this blanket of officialdom which seems to stifle every iota of good that we try to do for the health services.  I have asked in this House about the number of medical cards in my county.  I was astonished at this reply, that since 1971 we have an increase of only 5.2 per cent.</P>

      <P>There is an enormous increase particularly in the spending of funds.  The health services seem to have absolute autonomy, this right to make decisions, and yet when it comes to paying the price at the end of the year we in this House have to make this money available.  We, the public representatives have to be responsible <Col N="1526" /> for the money.  We have to look after the budget of the health boards.  We have to beg the Department for the allocation of that budget, and yet if we make one suggestion as to how at local level the services could be improved all we get is a nasty reply from the health board.  I have said that about the Western Health Board on every platform I have stood on.  I welcome the statement from the Taoiseach on behalf of the Government that this revision is going ahead.</P>
      <P>Last but not least, we have a junior Minister responsible for Posts and Telegraphs.  I do not envy him the job he has.  It is a terrible task, because he is in a Department which has been denuded of any leadership for the last four years while the man who held the post of head of that Department talked about every other Department in Government.  The new junior Minister has the unenviable task of tackling the telephone problem.  In every walk of life from small industries to big industries, agriculture, health services and so on, a phone is a necessity.  The deficiency in this service for the last four years has been appalling.  I understand that any money that was spent there was spent for political purposes. I hope that at the end of the next session we will see the progress that the end of this session has seen, and I look forward to working towards that achievement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The most important task facing us in the next ten years will be tackling unemployment and the creation of new jobs, not to mention the task of maintaining the existing level of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government were elected last June on bright promises of reducing unemployment and creating new jobs. In that context it is now fair to ask, six months later, where they stand in relation to those promises.  As part of the 1977 budget programme the previous Government undertook to create and provide the finance for 7,000 new jobs in the public service.  They also operated the youth incentive employment scheme under which a further <Col N="1530" /> 2,000 jobs were created.  That under-taking and the finance provided for it are separate and distinct from the plan put forward by Fianna Fáil in June. The area in which the Coalition jobs were planned was mainly in the public service, particularly in the area of health, where 3,000 jobs were to be created.</P>
    <P>It appears from the latest figures supplied by the Minister for Health and his colleagues that the jobs which we set about creating earlier in the year have been created with the moneys we provided and that the bulk of them have been filled.  Bearing that in mind, it is fair to look at the latest unemployment figures.  Those figures show a total of 106,930 people out of work at the week ending 2nd December in comparison with 111,292 for the corresponding week of last year. That is a decrease of between 4,000 and 5,000.  It is accepted by everybody that 7,000 jobs were created under the Coalition's programme and filled by them and the present Government.  It is fair that those 7,000 jobs and the 2,000 jobs created under the youth scheme should be subtracted from last year's unemployment figure, which would leave us with a figure for this year of 102,000.  In fact, last week's unemployment figure is still 106,900.</P>
    <P>In the Fianna Fáil election manifesto an undertaking was given that they would provide 5,000 more jobs during 1977.  It is fair to ask where the Government stand on their claim. One may well ask where these 5,000 now jobs are.  If they have been created, as is being asserted in a vague way, the unemployment figures ought to have been reduced by 14,000, that is, by the 7,000 jobs created in the public service under the Coalition's programme, by the 2,000 jobs created under the youth employment scheme, and by the 5,000 jobs that were promised by Fianna Fáil.  It is now clear that the Government are bereft of any ideas to create the thousands of new jobs that are needed, not just for adults but for the young people who have never been in employment.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, if belatedly, the Government set up a youth employment action team, ostensibly for the purpose <Col N="1531" /> of, and I quote from the manifesto, &ldquo;initiating immediately suitable employment schemes for school leavers and other young people&rdquo;.  Although the youth employment action team have been in existence for two or three months, a rather startled public was recently informed that their first report had been submitted to the Government. Its main recommendation is that 800 young people should engage in a 12-week crash course to be trained as physical fitness instructors.  Having been trained, they, in turn, are to set about the task of making tens of thousands of other young unemployed people physically fit.  A novel concept it may be, but it is hardly going to take away the 106,000 people who are officially on the live register.</P>
    <P>For some time I have been endeavouring to highlight the projected population figures for the next 15 years for the Dublin area, based on the natural growth of Dublin and taking into account a moderate figure for net immigration.  Apparently that policy is to be continued by the Government if one is to judge from the many interviews given in the last few weeks by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  On that basis, Dublin will have a population of 1,150,000 by 1991.  More disturbing is the forecast for the short-fall of jobs in the Dublin area.  The best job creation figure for the Dublin region was achieved in the decade 1961 to 1971.  In that ten-year period an average of 3,750 jobs was created each year, or a total of 37,500 jobs.  If one takes the figure for the natural growth of the population of Dublin, a moderate figure for net immigration into Dublin and if one assumes that for the next 15 years we manage to achieve the record level of job creation which was achieved between 1961 and 1971, and projects the job creation figure of 3,500 each year for 15 years, by 1991, assuming 18,000 on the live register in Dublin who do not want to work, one will find a short-fall of 50,000 jobs in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The second most successful period for job creation was from 1966 to 1971. During that five-year period an average <Col N="1532" /> of 2,500 new jobs were created each year in Dublin.  If one projects that second-best record against the population forecast for greater Dublin, one will find that by 1991, if 18,000 people were unemployed, there will be an additional job short-fall of 75,000.  In other words, the second-best job creation record in the Dublin area would show 93,000 people unemployed in Dublin, almost as many as are unemployed in the whole country at present.</P>
    <P>These figures were produced by the city and county planning departments in connection with the review of their development plan.  They are based on statistics prepared by the Central Statistics Office and are accurate.</P>
    <P>Does any member of the Government appreciate that these are the projections for job short-falls in Dublin? If they do, do they care, and what are they going to do about it?  With those forecasts on the second-best record for job creation in Dublin, I do not believe that we will be left with 93,000 people unemployed in Dublin in 15 years' time.</P>
    <P>We are not talking, then, about the options between a Fianna Fáil Government, a Fine Gael Government or a National Coalition; we are not talking about social unrest.  If we are talking about almost 100,000 people unemployed in Dublin we are talking about the survival of democracy, about whether that many people out of work &mdash;many of them never having worked in their lives&mdash;are prepared to continue to say that they accept the democratic system.  In this case we are talking about the options between democracy and revolution.  The official figures are there to be seen, and unless some Government does something about the problem perhaps there will not be any successors to the existing political parties in 15 years' time.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach touched on the problem today, and he indicated the concern of the leaders throughout western Europe.  He told the House that none of them are able to provide the expectations of young people on the question of employment.  We have the most dangerous problem because we have <Col N="1533" /> the highest percentage of young people, compared with the remainder of the population, of any EEC country. We have the lowest percentage of middle-aged people of any EEC country and we have lost the traditional safety valve for unemployment, emigration.  We must provide <i>per capita</i> more new jobs for a greater number <i>per capita</i> of young people than any other European country. That is why the task facing any Government here in the next ten years is a formidable one, but it appears that none of the Ministers, certainly not the Ministers for Labour or Industry, Commerce and Energy, have any proposals, plans or course of action to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>This fact is best highlighted by the fact that the youth employment team set up by the Minister for Labour to find new jobs and to tell him what to do could only come up with an ill-conceived scheme based on an experience in Britain of employing young people for six months or one year to give them experience.  Those young people finished up sweeping seaweed off the beaches.  The other scheme was that local authorities should employ apprentices.  That was a good idea and one I mooted on many occasions.  The proposal was to employ 150 young people.  The main proposal of the team was the most ludicrous of all, that 800 young people be given a crash course for 12 weeks to become physical training instructors to train the rest of the unemployed to be physically fit.  The fourth proposal was of a limited nature, that young people take a census in their local area in relation to specific matters.</P>
    <P>They are only some of the official proposals.  Some of the other hair-brained ideas suggested by members of that team included a suggestion that young people should be encouraged to build beehives and keep bees.  There is no way we are going to provide gainful employment or get to the sort of situation we have all been talking about if the total merit and the total output of the high-powered youth employment team is to be discussing whether we build beehives in Cork or grow shrubs in County Meath.  We are not going to <Col N="1534" /> employ young people or satisfy them that way.  We must provide real programmes of employment for them.</P>
    <P>As far as the provision of new jobs is concerned the record of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy should be examined.  So far he has succeeded in announcing, two or three times in each case, proposed new industries which were negotiated by his predecessor, agreed under his predecessor and announced by his predecessor. During the past six months he gave us a litany of repeats of the announcements that these industries were coming.  Some weeks ago, after the Ferenka debacle, he announced a new toy factory for the Limerick area, but as far back as June or July there was a public advertisement seeking applicants for managerial posts in that toy factory.  Who does the Minister think he is fooling?  He is the Minister responsible for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  Without going into the Ferenka dispute in detail I should like to point out that within six months of Deputy O'Malley assuming office as Minister responsible for industry the Government found it necessary to declare his constituency a disaster area, to be the beneficiary of the highest level of grants normally paid to the most rural and most remote parts with unskilled labour, a bad transport system, no infrastructural services and no port of entry.  Limerick has all those things and a highly skilled industrial labour force, and yet in that constituency six months after the Minister took office the Government had to declare it a disaster area.  I am told that it was said in Limerick that the Minister's greatest achievement within the last six months was that his constituency now has the reputation of being the industrial blackspot of Europe. That is not a great record.</P>
    <P>The Minister also promised, in the manifesto, to introduce a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign, a campaign that would produce 10,000 new jobs over three years and reduce the cost of living by 3 per cent.  Last week the Minister mouthed platitudes here that he meant not only for people to buy Irish but to think Irish and be Irish.  Yesterday the newspapers announced that there would be <Col N="1535" /> a bumper Christmas for spending, that there would be £400 million in circulation but where is the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign? Last week the Minister told us he had been too busy doing other things to launch the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign; he was too busy at a time of unparalleled spending when people are buying in a way they do not for the rest of the year.  There is no such campaign, no advertisements or exhortations to our people to buy Irish, but yet the Minister thinks he is going to get 10,000 new jobs out of that.  I doubt that.</P>
    <P>In the field of stimulating employment I suggested on occasions two areas which would do this.  The first was that the social welfare contribution be abolished in respect of all people under 21.  That would have two effects.  A young person under 21 often gets small wages, and a full social welfare stamp out of that represents a big cut in his take home pay.  The employer often resents having to pay the full stamp in respect of young people who may not be doing a full week's work.  Such a move would be a stimulus to employers and employees. I also suggested that employers who have part-time work available are reluctant to give such employment because they must make the full weekly social welfare contribution in respect of the employee.  People are reluctant to take up such jobs because they must make the full contribution also. I suggested the introduction of a graded stamp, graded in accordance with the number of days per week a person works.  The first time I suggested that the Minister for Social Welfare conveniently forgot to answer, and the same happened on the second occasion I mentioned it, but when I reminded him at the end of that debate he answered, as reported at column 657 of the Official Report of 1st December, 1977:</P>
    <P> Strictly speaking it is not a social welfare matter.  If my colleagues in the economic Departments and in the Department of Labour and those who are primarily concerned with employment decided upon this as a policy matter then the Department <Col N="1536" /> of Social Welfare would implement it.  Basically it is an employment matter as distinct from a strictly social welfare matter. </P>
    <P>Surely everybody in the Government, especially when one considers the theme that ran through their election manifesto, should be basically concerned with the creation of employment. It is clear that the Minister for Social Welfare sees the real dangers of Fianna Fáil's economic proposals crashing down around somebody's ears, and it is not going to be Mr. Haughey's ears.  Some time ago he took the opportunity in the House of putting a distance between himself, in his position as Minister for Health and Social Welfare, and the economic cabal of Ministers.  So much for the notion of collective responsibility, but Charlie Haughey is not going to be blamed if there are no jobs; he is not going to be blamed if a set of stimuli are not created for employment; he is not going to be blamed if the social welfare stamp for those under 21 is not abolished, because all he does is implement this.  Other Ministers for Social Welfare told us that the ideas came from them, but this fellow tells us that all he is going to do is implement things and if the other fellows do not come with the good ideas he cannot implement them.</P>
    <P>The blinkered approach to social welfare shown by the Government emanates from no less a place than the Fianna Fáil election manifesto.  In relation to social welfare the manifesto told us that Fianna Fáil intended maintaining the living standards of social welfare recipients by regular adjustments of the level of payments, at least in line with the cost of living. Lest there be any doubt that the Government did not intend pursuing the vitally necessary and socially just policy of enlightened economic reform of the social welfare code introduced by the previous Government, the Minister again took the opportunity in the course of a debate on social welfare in this House as reported at column 559 of the Official Report of 1st December, 1977, to say:</P>
    <P>...it is my intention in accordance with Government policy, to continue <Col N="1537" /> to compensate social welfare claimants for increases in the cost of living. </P>
    <P>Today the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P> It is the intention of the Government to ensure that the value of welfare payments is, at the minimum maintained in line with cost of living increases, and where possible to increase those payments especially where there is greatest need. </P>
    <P>Rather inadequate statements from the Minister responsible and from the Taoiseach in relation to an entire area which has undergone massive reform over the past four years and is still in need of a continuation of that enlightened reform.  I hope the sharp reminder I gave the Minister for Social Welfare on the occasion when he uttered those words in the House recently may have bent his political antennae if not his social conscience.</P>
    <P>The Government also undertook to work towards the elimination of discrimination against single, married and widowed women.  Yet, only three weeks ago in reply to a question I put down as reported at column 404 of the Official Report of 30th November, 1977, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>...the removal of discrimination must be achieved in a phased and orderly fashion because of the considerable expenditure and the degree of administrative planning involved and also because of the significant changes which will have to be made in social welfare legislation.  It is my intention to put appropriate proposals to the Government in the matter in due course. </P>
    <P>Not exactly an earth shattering revelation after five months in office or, indeed, the remark of one who, as Minister, would appear to have his heart consumed by the fires of reforming zeal.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, however, we should not be too surprised, because the same Minister also has responsibility in the area of health, a responsibility which has developed into a carefully orchestrated and almost daily public relations campaign, all designed to give the impression <Col N="1538" /> that the Minister is busy in revolutionising his Department.  Yet, when one carefully examines the record of what he has done, one finds that, in relation to any matter, he has merely promised in answer to questions, in debates, in Press statements, and so on, (a) to investigate, (b) to look into, (c) to favourably consider, (d) to consult with, (e) to bring forward proposals and (f) to examine in detail.</P>
    <P>He is not alone in this.  Virtually all his colleagues, including Ministers at Question Time yesterday and today and every day since Question Time started in this Dáil, have used the same clichés, the same kicking to touch, to give the appearance of being busy without actually doing anything. The most classic example of this investigative policy, as I call it, which, incidentally, has the added advantage that it costs nothing, while putting on the gloss of being very busy, must surely be the neat foot-shuffling adopted on the question of family planning legislation.</P>
    <P>In Opposition the Minister and his colleagues consistently and regularly asserted that, when they were in Government, they would introduce the necessary legislation in this field.  When he was asked about it in the Dáil the Minister's answer was that he must first ascertain the views of interested parties and a number of bodies involved in the health field.  He enumerated some of them.  Extraordinarily, every single body he mentioned already had their views on family planning on public record.  Everybody knows their views.  Last October the Minister successfully kicked to touch, and the matter has not reared its head since to annoy him.  That has happened all through the field of Government.</P>
    <P>Admittedly the Minister did three positive things.  He introduced and passed through the two Houses the Medical Practitioners Bill, a Bill he found on his desk, left there, prepared and ready for him by his predecessor. Secondly, he introduced 130 extra new public health nurses into the health service with money provided by the previous Government under their job <Col N="1539" /> creation programme.  Thirdly he promised and introduced an order to reduce by £1 a week from 1st January the social welfare stamp for those earning less than £50 per week.  When he was introducing it in the House he said it would benefit 300,000 workers. The manifesto said it would benefit 400,000 workers.  Who is right?  If the Minister is right the manifesto was wrong by 33? per cent in that single forecast alone.</P>

      <P>If the manifesto is right and the Minister is wrong, the Minister is wrong by 25 per cent.  It is much more likely that both the Minister and the manifesto are wrong.  The true figure for those earning less than £50 a week is probably in the region of 250,000 and, in the light of whatever wage increases come about in the course of 1978, it will probably be reduced to under 200,000 during 1978. I see the Minister for Economic Planning and Development nodding his head, which seems to indicate he agrees that his manifesto and the Minister are both wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us look at some of the other Ministers.  Within a few weeks of assuming office the Minister for Fisheries completely enraged the fishermen on the east coast in relation to the herring industry.  He tried to hand over the entire control of the Irish Sea for herring fishing to the Isle of Man Government.  When he managed to scramble out of that, he wed us in a most incongruous way to the British Government in an area where the previous Government had spent six months trying to establish a case of our own for an exclusive zone because our demands for a 50-mile zone were not compatible with British demands for a 12-mile zone and Britain's much more important demand, to themselves, for the right to fish in <Col N="1540" /> third countries.  The Minister wed us to the British.  We warned him he was wrong.  He spent the past fortnight trying to scramble out of that marriage, surely the most unfortunate and short-lived political marriage of all time.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Fitzpatrick said recently, the Department of the Environment got a new name, a new Minister, new notepaper and a new rubber-stamp but, apparently, no new functions. Arguably it is correct, and I would be inclined to agree with it, that all environmental functions should be assigned to one Department and made the responsibility of one Minister.  This was not done.  The Minister is unable to say what responsibility he has which his predecessors as Ministers for Local Government did not have.  He is not able to say what he is supposed to do as Minister for the Environment.  That appears to me to be the granting of a name for the sake of granting it.</P>
      <P>Through the ineptitude of that Department also, the local authorities did not know until a fortnight ago what their estimates would be for 1978. They did not know what they could spend or what areas they could spend it in.  I am confident that they still would not know if this party had not instructed their members to call special meetings and insist on the estimates being put forward.  As a result of that, the Department were stung into action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 11 per cent Deputy Killilea lauded here tonight will not be adequate.  In the case of my own local authority, it will leave us in excess of £1 million of a shortfall.  The question remains: what do we cut out?  Do we cut out the provision for increased wages and salaries next year?  Do we cut out certain works?  If the Government want to make that restriction&mdash; and perhaps they are entitled to, if they are to pay a large share of the Bill&mdash;they should say what works they do not want the local authorities to carry out.  On that basis the local authorities were given no guidance whatsoever.  The Minister will find, as the years go by, that the members of local authorities, including his own members, will indicate to him how unhappy <Col N="1541" /> they are at the power and responsibility, the real reason for their existence, being removed from them. They will find&mdash;and already a number have found, I am afraid&mdash;if I may coin a phrase, that the Government's attitude to the abolition of rates will become the cloud without a silver lining.</P>
    <P>In a number of exclusive interviews on the same topic, the Minister for Defence appears to be preoccupied with the style, cut and design of the uniforms to be worn by the new women's army.  The Dáil has heard nothing about this new women's army, which may be a good thing to create employment.  All we have read about with avid interest is the way they may be dressed.</P>
    <P>So far as the Department of the Gaeltacht are concerned there has been a deafening silence in two languages. We heard very little from most Departments. The heat and the publicity have been on Ministers who investigated, examined, consulted with, looked into and will put forward proposals. In areas of hard reality, very little has been done.  No new jobs have been created that I can see, bar the jobs created and paid for by the previous Government and filled by this Government.</P>
    <P>The bills will have to be paid next year, the bills for the rates, car tax and, most important of all, the question will be asked next year by the young people and the parents of the young people who voted for this Government last June: where are the jobs they promised?  I predicted that, if it does not happen, democracy is at risk over the next 15 years, so I hope for all our sakes the Government will create and fill more jobs during 1978 than they succeeded in losing in 1977.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Economic Planning and Development (Professor O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard some of Deputy Boland's concluding remarks.  I noted with interest yet again the extent to which the <Col N="1544" /> Opposition are forced to refer to the manifesto which we published before the election and which forms the basis of our policy.  I emphasise that point because I want to make it clear that we had not seen any alternative policy proposals from the Opposition parties in the areas not only to which Deputy Boland referred but to many other areas which are presumably of considerable importance to our people.</P>
      <P>May I, for his benefit, touch on some of the points he raised towards the end of his speech?  He was worried about the social welfare estimate and how many would benefit from the reduction in the stamp of £1 per week. That estimate which we prepared in the summer was the best estimate available on the basis of the then information. It was 400,000 in round numbers and I make no apology for it.  If the Deputy can produce a better estimate I would be glad to see it.  If the Government of the day could have produced a better one I am sure they would have, since a fair amount of time and energy after the publication of that manifesto was spent by the Coalition Parties trying to knock holes in various estimates, with a remarkable lack of success, let me emphasise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it was the best estimate we could prepare at the time.  I am satisfied that had the Government of the day been in a position to refute that estimate, I presume they would have tried, since they tried to refute many of the other estimates put forward in that manifesto.  I can only assume therefore that it was a <Col N="1545" /> reasonable estimate at the time.  The fact that later in the year there is a reference to a smaller number falling into that category tells me what everybody knows, inside and outside this House, namely, that pay rates have been rising this year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy made reference to the likelihood that it would be a smaller number in 1978.  Again I nodded my head because I assumed that pay rates would rise again in the new year.  I do not see anything very extraordinary or earth-shattering in the emergence of these different figures.  I repeat that the estimate was only an estimate.  It was not by any means one of the most detailed or sophisticated with which I have been associated.  The reason for that lay in the fact that there was an extraordinary absence of detailed statistical information on the numbers in the various income categories.  If the Deputy was worried about that he had four and a half years to do something about it.</P>
      <P>Crocodile tears have been shed about the developments on the rates issue.  Some Deputies were concerned about the effects of that proposal which we had made clear before the election, which we said we would implement and which we are implementing. They said that the maximum increase of 11 per cent in the rate on commercial property was inadequate. Let me spell out the basis on which that increase was calculated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We estimated that an increase of 14 per cent would be an adequate improvement on the rateable income to local authorities from residential property, made up of an estimate of an inflation target of 7 per cent for next year coupled with a real growth rate of 7 per cent in the economy.  I am sure any reasonable neutral observer will accept that that provides for an expansion in the level of local authority spending in line with what the economy could afford.  If somebody wants to make a case that local authorities should be permitted to expand their spending at a faster rate than is feasible for the rest of us, then by all means let us have the case made, let it be debated on its merits and let us arrive at some conclusions.  In the <Col N="1546" /> meantime let us stick with the policy we have enunciated, which provides for a quite substantial improvement in the volume of spending of local authorities next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the Minister up on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>If you take the line of 14 per cent approach to residential property, you then ask, what is the appropriate rate of increase for commercial property which is still subject to rates.  The available information sceems to suggest that there was a growth of about 3 per cent in the volume of commercial property subject to rates.  That volume growth of 3 per cent allied to an 11 per cent increase in the poundage would again produce a 14 per cent rise in the revenue from that source to correspond and balance the 14 per cent increase accruing on the residential side.</P>
      <P>The Deputy seems to think that that was a grossly inadequate increase and that in his area they wanted an extra £1 million.  I have no doubt that not only local authorities but every Government Department, probably every State agency and I suspect most private citizens, can make a very good case as to the manner in which they could spend more money if only it were made available to them.  What the Deputy is saying, if we are to take him seriously, is that his local authority would go ahead and authorise a higher level of spending of that amount.  If the rates were still present, not only would they have struck a rate increase in the region of 14 per cent on the residential property coupled with at least an 11 per cent increase on business property, but they would have added an extra rate sufficient to raise the additional £1 million.  I do not have the figures for the total spending in his area, but perhaps he could tell me how much of a rate in the £ is required to raise £1 million.  If I do the sum crudely, the Deputy is saying that he is looking for an increase in the rate of at least £1.50 in the £. Would that be right?</P>

I am surprised to hear the Deputy saying that, because I understood one of the great concerns of his party was that this abolition of rates on residential property was going to strike a mortal blow at the autonomy and independence of local authorities.  Yet, the Deputy is suggesting that we should interfere with the autonomy and independence of the authorities.  We are not doing that.  We are saying &ldquo;here is a formula under which we calculate the amount of money you get&rdquo; and I put forward the reasons why I think it is a fair and reasonable allocation of money.  We let the responsible local <Col N="1548" /> authorities decide their priorities and work out the manner in which they want to make use of the funds available to them.  Surely that is the approach the Deputy would want to suggest for any responsible spending agency, whether it is a local authority, a Government Department or a private household?</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has different theories, in the interest of proceeding with this debate, I do not want him to put them forward now.  I suggest he put them forward later and they will be examined.  I would be very interested to see such an alternative.  In the meantime I suggest that there is not such an alternative viewpoint.  It does not appear to be advocated by the Deputy's party.  I suggest he is attempting to indulge in a little bit of local point scoring about which he would be best advised to forget.</P>
    <P>On the question of indulging in local point scoring, this morning Deputy P. Barry saw fit to refer to me at one stage and to some remarks he claims I made.  I did not hear all that he said but I got the substance of it.  He accused me of making contradictory claims about the merits of a proposed 5 per cent pay increase coupled with tax cuts as suggested by the Government and of putting forward examples that could be refuted by a first-year economic student.  Quite apart from the fact that the Deputy referred to the wrong debate, the only remarks I made to the House were at Question Time.  I checked the Official Report and I see that I never got to the point where I gave any examples because there were what is usually referred to as &ldquo;interruptions&rdquo;.  I never finished the examples because people on the Opposition side expressed surprise, concern or whatever other terms are appropriate when they discovered I was saying that the tax cuts in the form of abolition of rates and car tax on vehicles up to 16 h.p. formed part of the package of tax cuts that Fianna Fáil put forward.  I am happy to say that in one respect Deputy Barry put the record right this morning because at least he admitted it was in our manifesto and, therefore, that there was nothing new about it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1549" /> With regard to confusion in the examples I gave, I am not aware of any such confusion.  On different occasions outside the House I gave various examples of the combined effect of a 5 per cent pay rise and various tax cuts, whether income tax reductions, a reduction in the social welfare stamp for lower paid workers or the effect of abolition of rates and car tax.  If anybody wants to put forward alternative examples or thinks they are confusing, I would be delighted to see the evidence.  In the meantime, just to set the record straight, there were no contradictory examples from me because I never gave them in the House, and certainly I did not give any examples in the debate referred to by the Deputy. Therefore, there is no case to be answered by any economic student that the examples were correct or incorrect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry gave a peculiar interpretation of economic policy over the past 18 months.  He said that in regard to the speech made by the Taoiseach when opening this debate when referring to the development of the economy this year, he could have made a similar speech.  He went on to say this was because of the virtuous policies pursued by the Coalition during the last year of their term of office. What were those virtuous policies? Deputy Barry made some vague remarks about the effects of sterling and its associated impact on the economy in 1976.  He was talking about the initial forecasts for 1976 being rather pessimistic and the out-turn proving much better.  Why did it prove better? It was due to the disastrous fall in sterling.  This meant that Irish products, in common with British products, became cheaper on the international markets and both Britain and ourselves benefited in that sense from an export boom in the second part of 1976.  This could not have been predicted by any reasonable person at the beginning of that year and no reasonable person would want to predict it. We were facing a calamitous decline in the external value of our currency and some of the adverse consequences of that decline were still with us this year.  That gratuitous improvement in our exports in 1976 was not something <Col N="1550" /> for which Deputy Barry or any Government could make a claim.  It was entirely outside their control and it was a direction of policy movement that we would never have advocated as a Government, that we should look forward to a policy of excessive inflation leading to a severe fall in the external value of our currency as the basis for temporary improvements in the level of our exports output.</P>
    <P>We then come to 1977.  Deputy Barry told us that everything was marvellous now because the Coalition had spent £100 million in the budget this year in putting the economy on the right track.  That was an interesting revelation.  Those of us with long memories will recall the origin of the Coalition's budgetary policy of 1977. I recall in September, 1976, when after a very long gestation period, after much agonising and to-ing and fro-ing and changing of colours, what had originally been proposed as a White Paper eventually emerged as a Green Paper on the economy.  Prior to that we had published our first version of what might now be called our manifesto. We dealt specifically with some economic proposals.  As a result of publishing that document the Government had to move back the publication date for their Green Paper and had to hastily rewrite some of its contents. There was an abrupt change of policy on the part of the Coalition so that what had up to then been all gloom and doom suddenly enabled the Minister for Finance to depart to the Philippines and the Minister for Labour to announce a £50 million package for job creation.  In the course of the following two months that £50 million was increased to £100 million in respect of job creation and tax cuts which were associated with the budget this year.  We duly acknowledged the paternity of that package when we referred to the budget this year.  Our criticism then was that although it was on the right lines it was too little and too late.</P>

      <P>The Deputies opposite should keep quiet and allow me to make my own speech.  In order to set the record right, the Coalition were acting as our agents but on an inadequate scale.  We endorsed the action they took at the beginning of the year but we said it was not sufficient. In our manifesto we put forward an expanded form of the action which we considered sufficient and which we have been implementing since we came to office.</P>
      <P>We are not backing away from any of the proposals in the manifesto.  We identified the series of measures which we said we would take in the first phase of government and we are taking those actions, whether it be to abolish rates on houses, to abolish car tax, to reduce the social welfare stamp or action to set about job creation.  There has been a Cabinet sub-committee dealing with that matter.  We started work immediately after the formation of the Government in July and we have been sanctioning specific proposals from time to time.  They all add up to achieving our target of 5,000 jobs by the end of this year which is what we promised and I see no reason why we should not continue to be on target for the total of 20,000 by mid-summer next year.  Therefore, the House can rest assured on that point also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, certainly, the Deputy can rest assured he will get the details.  The Minister for Finance, in reply to a question a few weeks ago, gave details of the job creation proposals up to that point which effectively covered the period up to the end of this year.  We shall indeed publish further statistics for 1978 as they arise.</P>
      <P>So much for the background of these measures.  Where do we go from here? The point I would make about the manifesto is that it laid the foundations for the policy we would pursue in office.</P>
      <P>We spelled out the initial measures to be taken.  Those measures are being taken.  The concern expressed by some Opposition speakers that we have not yet implemented various parts of the manifesto was rather touching but, I would imagine, hyprocritical because we have succeeded in doing more in five months than they managed in their four years in quite a few areas.  I would point out that the normal expectation of a Government's term of office is four years or thereabouts.  I would expect there is quite a deal of time to deal with many other items that call for legislation and so on in order to implement the manifesto.  One would need to be incredibly naive to expect that any government could implement a full policy programme in the limited space of a few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manifesto, then, having created the opening phase and set the policy direction for tackling the important issues of unemployment, inflation and so on, where do we go from here?  As I have already informed the House, I envisaged that we will publish a White Paper within the next few weeks setting out the general terms of economic development as we envisage them in the next three years, also indicating the main policy issues and areas to be tackled during that period.  That will be followed up by a more detailed discussion document&mdash;let us call it a Green Paper&mdash;sometime in the New Year, say, in the spring.  That will <Col N="1553" /> enable us to carry out detailed consultations with various interested groups and prepare a more elaborate plan for completion by the autumn of next year.  I regard that as a reasonable timetable.  I emphasise the link between it and the manifesto because I regard the manifesto as having supplied already a sufficient framework policy to carry us through at least the first year of our term of office.  There-fore, the House may rest assured that there will indeed be a sufficient updating and elaboration of policy for the later years of our term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There are quite a few areas which call to be tackled quite apart from the actual articulation of policy and so on that have repercussions for the reform of the Civil Service and of Government itself.  Some of those reforms have occurred already, such as the creation of a new Department for which I am responsible, the appointment of additional Ministers of State and, in the case of the Civil Service, the creation of planning units which will be implemented in all of the major Departments over the coming year.  There are other areas which still call for reform and which would be worthy of much longer discussion.  I should not like to go firm on any proposals at present. But since there was reference this morning on the Appropriations Bill to the manner in which this House deals with public expenditure, its regulation and control, perhaps I might venture a suggestion in that area: I do not believe the time of this House is best spent on what I would call the traditional accounting or book-keeping function of seeing that every last £ is spent under the precise subhead for which it was originally voted and that, provided there are proper receipts and the books add up, all is well.  I believe it far more important that this House concern itself with policy matters, with the manner in which money is spent, with the types of purposes for which it is sought, and then to concern itself with the effectiveness of the programmes <Col N="1554" /> on which the money is expended. Therefore, concern should not be for the traditional accounting or book-keeping approach; it should be much more inquiring into the direction of policies on public spending and satisfying itself, as a House, that it has sufficient mechanisms and opportunities for exploring the nature of spending policies, for reviewing the degree of success or failure attending any series of programmes.  And, let us be realistic&mdash;seeing that we are dealing with human nature, imperfect knowledge and so on&mdash;no government is ever going to pretend that everything will function perfectly.  Therefore there will always be a need for continuing review and re-examination of policies to ensure that the taxpayers indeed get the best value for the money this House votes on their behalf.  In that direction I would suggest that far more attention be given to debating the spending policies and programmes, for the House giving itself time to debate programmes before they are so far advanced that it is too late to halt any project.  Very often one finds oneself in a situation in which it would be even more wasteful to abandon an effort even though had one known beforehand one might have preferred an alternative course of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the improvements we can bring about is in this direction of enabling the House to have more opportunities for considering the longer-run policy options open to it and the longer-run implications for our people of choosing one or other course of action.  I know this is not the traditional approach of Parliament. I realise it is not often the traditional stuff of party politics because, of course, if one concerns oneself with long-run issues then one's time horizon is not bounded by the date of the next election.  I am sure the House will agree that this year the people of Ireland showed their willingness to break away from excessive concern with the past.  My final word to the Opposition might be to suggest that if they really are genuine about making contributions in this area they would be far better advised to go away, do some work on preparing their policy position, debate the course of action <Col N="1555" /> we ought to pursue in the future rather than engage in pointless, fruitless efforts to rewrite history and pretend that all was well when all was clearly not well, and all is clearly still not well with the economy.  But at least we can now argue that things are beginning to improve and it is our intention that they will go on improving in the years ahead.</P>
