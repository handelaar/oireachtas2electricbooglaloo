      <P>In relation to the Principal Act referred to here I raised a question on Second Stage as to whether the terms of section 6 (7) of the Principal Act were being complied with in relation to lodgment of particulars of the guarantees in the Oireachtas Library.  The Minister gave an undertaking that the provisions of this Act, which had hitherto not been complied with by the Department, henceforth would be.  Since that document, dated November, 1976 was lodged in the Library and given to me&mdash;it sets out a list of the banks which have given loans to An Bord Bainne in respect of which the guarantee of the Minister is in force&mdash;I do not wish to cavil unduly in relation to this matter.  I am sure everybody is acting in good faith.  However, it seems that the document given to me does not comply with the section in full.  It is <Col N="692" /> clear that particulars of each guarantee should be given if one reads section 6 (7) (a).  All that is given here is a general statement about guarantees and the names of the Banks.  But the amount of money being loaned by each bank&mdash;which clearly should be given in accordance with section 6 (7) (c)&mdash;is not given in the statement circulated and handed to me.  It may have been given in other statements lodged since, namely, in the last 24 hours.  These, if any, are not available to me and I should be grateful for an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that this information will be lodged and that the provisions of section 6 of the Principal Act will be complied with in their entirety.</P>

It was in view of the fact that reference is made in section 1 to the Principal Act that I felt I should raise it at this point.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already circulated a copy to the Oireachtas Library giving the names of the banks. I can assure Deputy Bruton that we will get the amounts being loaned from An Bord Bainne and these amounts will be given as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section I wish to raise a point in relation to the duration of the authority given to the Minister to guarantee loans by An Bord Bainne.  Section 2 (1) states clearly that the guarantees must expire on 31st December, 1979.  An Bord Bainne have a continuing borrowing requirement of approximately £30 million which they must be borrowing at any time of any year.  This is a solid core of borrowing which is always there.  In respect of such continuing, permanent borrowing obviously it is more appropriate to obtain long-term rather than short-term finance.  But, as the Minister's guarantee expires on 31st December, 1979, it is not possible for An Bord Bainne to obtain loans the duration of which exceeds the time between now and 31st December, 1979. Thus they are unable, first, to get the better terms which can be obtained by use of long-term finance and, secondly, to have the degree of confidence from their bankers in respect of this matter because I understand that banks prefer <Col N="694" />&mdash;if a concern has a continuing long-term indebtedness&mdash;that that be financed by a long-term rather than a short-term loan.  Therefore, there are two separate points here, the terms of the loan and the preference of the banks for long-term as against short-term finance where there is continuing indebtedness.</P>
      <P>In relation to An Bord Bainne's operations, quite clearly these will be continuing in an important way beyond 31st December, 1979.  I do not understand why the Department of Agriculture, the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary are not prepared to guarantee the loans of An Bord Bainne beyond that date.  We all agree that the work An Bord Bainne are doing in promoting purchases of our milk produce abroad is vital, not merely to our farmers but to many thousands of other people involved in milk processing in creameries and other plants throughout the country and that their work will be of great importance to us after 31st December, 1979 just as it is at present.  Therefore, why is the Minister not prepared to extend the duration of the guarantees beyond the end of 1979?</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that during 1979 Bord Bainne will wish to raise money in the form of loans and the duration of such loans will extend beyond 31st December, 1979.  For example, with regard to the marketing of cheese, it may be purchased by Bord Bainne during the 1979 season but it will not be mature enough for sale until well into 1980.  As a result of the cut-off point of 31st December, 1979, Bord Bainne will not be able to finance their operations even in 1979 by means of State guaranteed loans because the material purchased during that year will not be realised until well into 1980.  In effective terms the guarantee does not last the two years it appears to last when one reads the Bill; certainly in respect of cheese it will last for only 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a time, not too long ago, when the marketing operations of Bord Bainne were financed very substantially by the State.  Partly as a result of EEC regulations the State has been successful <Col N="695" /> in devolving itself of this financial responsibility.  The only assistance it gives is a very small grant-in-aid of about £25,000 per year and unless Bord Bainne defaults on the loan this guarantee does not cost the State anything. Therefore, why is the Minister deciding in this instance not to extend the guarantee beyond 31st December, 1979?  It is quite mysterious in view of the following factors: first, the importance of Bord Bainne's operations; secondly, in view of the fact that the guarantees are very important to Bord Bainne in getting loans&mdash;a State guarantee is of considerable value in the financial market&mdash;and, thirdly, the guarantee will not cost the Exchequer or the Minister for Finance a single penny unless Bord Bainne defaults and there is no great likelihood that they will.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would reply to those points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the suggestion of extending the terms of this Bill for up to five years. At the moment the cut-off point is 31st December, 1979.</P>
      <P>As I see it, Bord Bainne will be expected within a certain time to build up assets to enable them to finance themselves in order that they may get loans on the strength of their assets.  At the moment there is borrowing of approximately £30 million and, in view of the likely expansion of the dairy industry and the processing of dairy foods it is likely that the borrowing also will increase.  In my opinion guarantees will be necessary for a much longer period and that is why I suggest five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to Deputy Bruton and Deputy Bermingham that this Bill had been cleared by their Government when in office.  In fact, the former Minister, Deputy Clinton, frequently impressed on the board the need for building up their own assets sufficiently to enable them to conduct their financial affairs without having recourse to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Deputies have raised the issue of extending the period of guarantee but Bord Bainne themselves raised <Col N="696" /> this point with the Minister in the course of their discussions with him. He said he would let the Bill go ahead as it was prepared but that he would look at the matter further and keep it under review.  When the matter comes up for review in 1979, if there is need for a further extension I am sure the Government will be agreeable to consider it at that time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get very deeply into this because it is not so long ago since I was involved in it. I can understand very well the Minister's difficulties.  It would be the desire of any Minister for Agriculture to assist to the maximum in this area because dairying is such an important activity and our future depends on it to a considerable extent.</P>
      <P>The important thing is to have the guarantee because when there is a State guarantee it is an assurance that the cheapest possible money can be got at all times.  It would be very convenient for Bord Bainne if there was a five-year guarantee and, perhaps, that matter might be considered to see if it would make a significant difference to them.  I know I had my difficulties in getting the agreement of the Department of Finance to extend it beyond the time stated.  We doubled the amount.  I can see the difficulty of Bord Bainne; the better we do in milk production here, the more difficulty they will find themselves in.  The State is taking no chance whatever because there is an enormous product to back the loan at all times.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I might give the House some idea of the money we are talking about.  At one stage I visited two co-operatives in the south; one of them had £8 million worth of products in stock and the other had £7 million worth.  That gives some idea of the amount of capital required to finance the dairy industry at the moment.  The fact that the products are there and can be sold and also that there is property involves the State in very little risk.  If we are to show our confidence in the industry, the confidence it deserves, we should be prepared to give it whatever reasonable guarantee is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="697" /> At the same time, I see the need for building up a fund and for the farmers contributing to this fund in order to become independent.  Unless the Minister is fairly tough about this the farmers simply will not contribute anything they can avoid contributing at any time.  There is a need for them to take this matter seriously.  The Minister should inquire if there is a significant difference in the cost of money on a five-year guarantee and on a two-year guarantee.  The promise is there of a review if that should prove necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the previous Minister for Agriculture has come into this debate because he was associated with Bord Bainne. First, I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his appointment and I wish him many years of success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The former Minister, Deputy Clinton, has been quite reasonable in his explanation.  I was one of those people who felt very sore about this Bill when we first heard of it.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out, it was ready to come before the House before the previous Government left office.  I understood there was difficulty in getting the Department of Finance to agree to guarantee the loan over five years because they said the farmers would be shy to contribute to the board in order to finance themselves without the aid of a State guarantee.  I did not agree with it because I have been associated with farmers for a long time and I know what they are capable of doing.  They are a bit conservative but when they get something that is doing such a good job as An Bord Bainne have been doing over the years I believe they will do as the Minister asks.  I know the Minister has to be careful but I believe there should be a longer guarantee. A person can get money at a cheaper rate if the guarantee is over a longer period.  I would say the same thing if the Deputy opposite was Minister. I appreciate the honesty of the former Minister in putting forward the difficulties which were conveyed to me at that time.  The Minister might be suspicious that farmers would not look <Col N="698" /> after their own business if they thought the State would do it for them. I do not agree with that because farmers in various walks of life have to do their own business.  I believe when the farmers see that Bord Bainne are doing a good job for them they will inject capital into Bord Bainne and will be able to do their own borrowing. I ask the Minister, like the other Deputies, to have a look at this and see if a longer guarantee can be given to Bord Bainne.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make it clear that I am not looking for an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that an unlimited guarantee as to time or amount will be given to Bord Bainne.  I proposed an amendment to extend the time of the guarantee to the 31st December, 1982 but that amendment was, probably rightly, ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle on the grounds that an ordinary Deputy cannot introduce an amendment which would impose a potential charge on the Exchequer.  No such restraint applies to the Parliamentary Secretary and it is quite in order for him either now or on Report Stage to introduce an amendment to extend the guarantee to the 31st December, 1982.  I ask him, in view of all he has heard from both sides of the House about the importance of this matter, to either introduce an oral amendment now on Committee Stage or, alternatively, to give an assurance that he will introduce such an amendment on Report Stage to extend the period of the guarantee to the 31st December, 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Deputies who said that it is very important that farmers contribute to an increasing extent to the provision of a capital fund for Bord Bainne which will act as a security for their loans independently of any ministerial guarantee.  The farmers are already contributing very substantially by way of a deduction from the milk price paid to them to such a capital levy.  I understand that very recently the amount of capital levy and the amount paid by farmers towards the creation of a capital fund, which will ultimately take the place of a ministerial guarantee, have been <Col N="699" /> doubled.  There is no doubt in my mind that at the present rates of contribution a capital levy fund will not have been created by the 31st December, 1979 of sufficient size to replace the guarantee of the Minister.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary envisage that capital levy being increased to such an extent that such a fund will exist to replace the Ministerial guarantee by the 31st December, 1979?  If so, how much reduction in the milk price for farmers will be necessary to enable the guarantee to be replaced entirely by a fund raised by farmers by the 31st December, 1979?  If he is not prepared to give such an estimate and if he is not asking the farmers to increase the levy to that extent, why then is he not prepared to extend the period to 31st December, 1982?</P>
    <P>I believe that with the present rates of contribution to the capital levy a sufficient fund will have been raised about the 31st December, 1982 but certainly not by the 31st December, 1979.  If that is the case, why will the Parliamentary Secretary not agree to such an extension?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said at the outset, I consider the period of the guarantee is adequate.  I already gave an under-taking to Deputy Bruton that the matter will be reviewed at the end of 1979 and if it is found necessary then to have an extension, I am sure the Minister will bring the necessary legislation before the House.  I thank the former Minister for his contribution because he has had considerable experience in dealing with those matters and he knows, perhaps, better than Deputy Bruton or I, the difficulties involved in trying to negotiate an extension at this time with the Department of Finance and other Departments involved in this also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the under-taking has not been given.  The assurance of a review in 1979 is no use to An Bord Bainne in raising money on long-term loans now.  They cannot get five-year loans now using State guarantee because there is no statutory authority for the guarantee beyond that date.  The assurance given by the Parliamentary Secretary in financial terms is worthless.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the terms of the guarantee.  I proposed an amendment that the terms of the guarantee be changed in section 6 (4) of the Principal Act which reads:</P>
      <P>Where the Minister guarantees a loan under this section, there shall be paid to the Minister by the Society in respect of the guarantee such fee (if any) as the Minister, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance determines. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That phraseology is repeated in other sections.  I believe that the wording should be: &ldquo;provides a guarantee&rdquo;, in the first line rather than &ldquo;guarantees a loan&rdquo;.  The reason I suggest this is that I understand that there are other forms of financial facility which Bord <Col N="701" /> Bainne obtain which cannot be strictly classified as loans and in respect of which a guarantee from the Minister will be of considerable value.</P>
    <P>In my contribution on Second Stage I outlined the types of facilities involved and I briefly refer to them now. One was a facility to enable them to prefix the export refunds which would be obtained from the EEC in respect of exports to third countries.  These would be long-term contracts, some of the deliveries under which would not take place until six or nine months after entry into the initial contract.  It would be important for stability in terms of that contract to know what the export refunds would be but that is not possible because these refunds are fixed from day to day.  In order to provide a system of insurance against fluctuation in the export refunds, Bord Bainne do obtain facilities from financial institutions in order that they will be able make up the difference and ensure that a fixed export refund, as at the time of the original contract, will be maintained throughout the contract, regardless of the actual fluctuations which may take place in the refunds as a result of EEC decisions.</P>
    <P>There is a similar facility in relation to the provision of bonds.  The board may wish to obtain guarantees is respect of a bond that they may enter into, either not to withdraw a bid which they have made for a contract prior to the closure and decision as to which of the tenderers will get the contract, or, having obtained the contract, that they will perform it.  Facilities in respect of bonds require to be obtained by the board.  These are financial facilities from banks to which I understand the term &ldquo;loan&rdquo; as expressed in the original section does not extend.  I believe it should be so extended.  There are other foreign exchange facilities which the board use to insure them against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.  This is a major problem at present.</P>
    <P>I believe that if the wording of the original Act was changed from &ldquo;guarantees&rdquo; alone to &ldquo;provide a guarantee&rdquo; it would extend to the type of financial facility which in <Col N="702" /> modern international marketing is of considerable importance to Bord Bainne but to which the Act and the Minister's guarantee do not now extend. I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give an undertaking that such an amendment would be introduced in early legislation, if not in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is another point in respect of the wording of the 1973 Act which I feel merits amendment.  This is section 6 (5) which states:</P>
    <P>Moneys obtained by the Society on foot of a loan guaranteed under this section shall be used solely by the Society for the acquisition in the course of its ordinary business of dairy produce. </P>
    <P>I understand that loans may be required by Bord Bainne, to be guaranteed by the Minister, in respect of matters which are not, strictly speaking, the acquisition of dairy produce. They may require loans in respect of the marketing of dairy produce and more importantly nowadays, the storage of dairy produce.</P>
    <P>As the former Minister outlined the amount of money involved in keeping stock adequately refrigerated can be very large indeed and is a form of outlay quite independent of the cost involved in the simple acquisition of the produce.  I understand that legislation, strictly interpreted, does not extend to loans obtained for the marketing and storage of produce but merely for the acquisition of it. would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider amending the legislation to this extent.  I agree there must be some limit on the sort of purpose for which Bord Bainne can borrow money with the strength of a ministerial guarantee.  In my original amendment I proposed such a limit, accept that the drafting was not necessarily perfect but I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look at it and consider the possibility of alternative drafting in amending legislation which, hopefully, will be introduce in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill is required to give effect to the announcement made by the Taoiseach in the Dáil on 5th July last that a new Department of Economic Planning and Development would be established.  I am also preparing, and will shortly introduce, further legislation to provide for the appointment of Ministers who will not be members of the Government.  These two major developments in relation to our institutions of Government will provide a solid basis for carrying out the programme of national development which the Government are now embarked on.</P>
      <P>In considering this Bill, it is important to see, in perspective, what is being proposed, to recall the background to our current economic state and to try to foresee our environment in the coming years.  The Ministers and Secretaries Act on which our present structures of Government are based was enacted in the twenties.  It has evolved since then mainly in relation to the creation of new Departments and the re-allocation of the functions of Government as the need arose.  This present Bill should be seen against the fact that since the twenties the role of the State in economic and social affairs has developed greatly&mdash;both internationally and here at home.  There have been a number of attempts over the years to cope with this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the late twenties and thirties the concept of State-sponsored bodies was introduced to our public service and <Col N="706" /> has developed since then.  They made possible much of the economic and social development which has taken place by providing the framework whereby policies are implemented and various programmes delivered to the community.  In the late fifties and early sixties also various innovations took place.  The Government programme for economic development in 1958 and the emphasis within our public service on regional development are cases in point.  The late sixties saw an emphasis on public service reform&mdash; which is now being given renewed momentum by the Government.  With these developments during the past 50 years, as I have said, the role of the State in economic and social development has grown.  Hand in hand with this, of course, has been the resulting growth in economic responsibilities of certain Ministers&mdash;but most pronounced in the case of the Minister for Finance.  One need not dwell unduly on the very serious economic difficulties which this country has experienced over the last four years to appreciate the need for Government to reorganise itself in order to strengthen its capacity to lead and fashion the course of economic and social development.  What is now required is that government has an institutional capacity, strategically placed, to develop and co-ordinate its response to the challenge of economic and social development.  This strategic capacity must be effected at the highest level; in our view by a Government who are specifically equipped, at ministerial and Department levels to spearhead economic planning and development.</P>
    <P>Ever since the Public Services Organisation Review Group reported in 1969 a debate has, I will not say raged, but at least ebbed and flowed, on the desirability of reforming the machinery of government.  In the past few months we have seen the Public Service Advisory Council in their report for the year ended 31st October, 1976, recommend that &ldquo;... urgent attention be given to the provision of appropriate planning institutions in the public service&rdquo;; indeed the council went on to say that the plans of individual Government Departments should not only be consistent with, but <Col N="707" /> form an integral part of, a national plan.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House have for a long time been convinced of the necessity for and the practicability of separate institutions for planning.  On assuming office, the Government decided that the prospects for overall national planning would be greatly strengthened if a separate Department were established with a specific planning remit.  In deciding on this the Government were aware fully that planning is a difficult activity whose achievements, however substantial they may be, are often less considered by the public than its inevitable failures no matter how unimportant relatively.  The 10 per cent of failures may attract more attention than the 90 per cent of successes.  The planner will sometimes be discouraged and, if he has the opportunity to direct his efforts to an activity susceptible to more readily-achievable targets like financial control, he may well succumb to the temtation to abandon planning.  In sum, planning is an activity which needs to be structured in an organisation in such a way that the planner does not divert his energies unduly either to the performance of day-to-day executive activities or into other areas.  This is best secured by the creation of a specialised area of organisation which has primary and overall responsibility for planning.</P>
    <P>Lest anyone should object that this will leave the planner in an ivory tower, I would emphasise that the very real consideration which will prevent planning and development from being removed from reality is the fact that the Minister in charge of the Department will be in regular contact with his colleagues at Government meetings. Furthermore, it is our firm resolve that the Minister for Economic Planning and Development will have a very close working relationship with the Minister for Finance so that, although the function of economic and social planning will be organisationally separate from the budgetary work of the Department of Finance, both functions will mesh into the systems for co-ordinating the whole business of government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> Although most people intuitively regard planning as a good thing, there is, regrettably, little consensus, even amoung the theorists, as to what the concept involves precisely.  At one end of the spectrum the term has connotations of rigid compulsion: at the other, it is a loose arrangement for undisciplined forecasting.  The Government's view of planning places it between the two extremes.  While the influence of Government in economic affairs is not all-pervasive, few will deny that an attempt to outline the direction of the economy rationally and in a comprehensive manner is anything other than sensible.  It is thus partly to extend the time horizon of economic policy and partly to give it a higher status that central responsibility for co-ordinating economic and social planning is being assigned to a new Department.</P>
    <P>While the finer details of the whole planning process have yet to be worked out, our general design is clear.  The new Department will be the focal point for a widespread planning system throughout the whole public service. Other Government Departments will have responsibility for developing the economy from particular viewpoints and for developing and implementing policy in particular areas; the new Department, with limited executive responsibilities, will be largely concerned with the development of the overall view of the goals of the economy and with the co-ordination and development of sectoral and regional plans against national criteria. In relation to regional development, I believe that the new Department should have a major role to play.  I am strengthened in this belief by the proposals of the National Economic and Social Council in its report on &ldquo;Institutional Arrangements for Regional Economic Development&rdquo; when it says that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The primary objective of regional development is to remove, or at least reduce, regional inequalities in living standards and opportunities, within the overall national objective of full employment at rising living standards. The achievement of this objective requires the creation of employment opportunities and amenities in <Col N="709" /> particular places and regions.  This objective cannot be achieved by any single body or agency but requires co-ordinated effort by the relevant Government Departments, State Agencies and Local Authorities both at the policy-making and day-to-day executive levels.  This co-ordination is required both at national and regional levels.  There is no single body or agency at national level with overall responsibility for all aspects of regional revelopment (the Regional Development Committee which was charged with this task has not met since early 1972), while at regional level the performance of the Regional Development Organisations has been uneven.  Any proposals for institutional arrangements for regional development must try to remedy these defects.</P>
    <P>In making proposals for change in the institutional arrangements for regional development it must be borne in mind that radical institutional changes may be impossible or self-defeating, and that changes must be gradual, building on existing arrangements to work towards a more satisfactory system.  Equally, the creation of an extra layer or layers of Government should be avoided because it would in all probability exacerbate the existing problems.</P>
    <P>Given the importance of regional development it is essential that there should be, and should be seen to be, a real commitment to regional development at the very highest level. It is our view that, without political involvement it will be difficult to achieve progress towards the development and effective implementation of regional plans and policies. We recommend, therefore, that a Minister should be assigned responsibility for regional policy. </P>
    <P>Before I speak of the practicalities of the model proposed, however, I would like to make some more general comments. While an apology for planning might, for ideological reasons, have been necessary in the early 1960s, it is now scarcely necessary for me to say that the Government do not subscribe to an imposed concept of planning. <Col N="710" /> There is no doubt, however, that in all Western democracies, the State is being called upon to play a greater role in the fostering of economic and social progress.  For this it must have at its disposal the most up-to-date skills and techniques backed up by political commitment. Such techniques and skills for the planning process are essential but they are in the end only the tools and the scaffolding; the real heart of the business of Government is policy.  It is in the area of providing a service to all Departments to promote developmental but co-ordinated policy-making that the new Department may, indeed, make its most important contribution. Novel solutions and imaginative ideas will have to emerge if the economic and social problems which we face are to be overcome.  All the analysis, diagnosis and identification of problems and difficulties will not in the end solve anything unless the final step of translating the process into action is followed through.  Resolute government will also be required.  With the best will in the world on all sides, from Government, trade unions and employers, it may be that a consensus will not be forthcoming.  I cannot but agree with the National Economic and Social Council in its Report No. 32 on its work in the period 1974-76 when it says:</P>
    <P>To the extent that such discussion (between the various interest groups) succeed in getting to grips with the basic issues, differences and divisions are exposed, articulated and possibly reinforced rather than reconciled.  While the exposure and articulation of unreasonable viewpoints may not change them it could detract from their support.  However, in the last resort such differences may be resolved, or the action that is appropriate to the circumstances taken despite them, only by a political process or procedure.  This is a responsibility which in a democracy must properly be borne by the Government alone. </P>
    <P>Implementation of the policies necessary for economic well-being requires more than the whole-hearted commitment of the Government; it demands that the institutions through <Col N="711" /> which the Government discharges its responsibility be adequate for the task in hand.  The mission of economic reconstruction with which this Government has been entrusted poses a considerable challenge to those institutions, particularly the civil service.</P>
    <P>As far back as 1961 the then Taoiseach, the late Seán Lemass, was asking how far the civil service as organised then could contribute effectively to a dynamic policy of economic development.  He referred to the help given by the Department of Finance in particular in generating new ideas.  We all from time to time worry about the flexibility of old institutions and their office-holders to adapt to changing circumstances.  It was to help this process of change along the road that in the late 1950s and early 1960s the Economic Development Branch and later the Development Division of the Department of Finance were established and from the beginning they made a weighty contribution to economic policy in the 1960s and, in particular, to the change towards freer trade.  What happened then shows that the civil service can, if directed properly, be as imaginative as any other group.  This Government will not fail to provide such direction.  One result of the transfer to my colleague, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, of some of my burdens for economic policy is that I will, as Minister for the Public Service, be able to devote a greater amount of time towards the task of public service reform.</P>
    <P>I therefore see the establishment of this new Department as part of the evolutionary process first begun when the Economic Development Branch was established within the Department of Finance.  It may well be asked why we did not, if we considered a separate planning institution so important, establish some form of independent commission to look after such affairs. In my view Government Departments are more suited because they are at the very heart of our constitutional system of Government and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development will be answerable to this <Col N="712" /> House for policy matters concerning economic and social planning and development.  I can therefore think of no more suitable organisational form for such a unit of administration than a Government Department.  In seeking statutory authority for the creation of this Department, Ireland will be pursuing an organisational course which has been followed successfully by many countries, like, for instance, Belgium, the Netherlands, West Germany and Sweden.</P>
    <P>Having made these general observations I would like to speak of the functions and, in so far as they can be foreseen, of the operations of the new Department of Economic Planning and Development.  First of all, their general remit will be to promote and co-ordinate economic and social planning for the development of the economy including the co-ordination of plans for the different sectors and regions.  The effective exercise of this function will require a more professional planning and policy analysis capacity in most Departments of State to ensure that the central operations of the new Department have a reliable base in the main executive areas of Government.</P>
    <P>As regards the particular steps necessary to discharge their general functions, the first essential for the new Department is, having regard to the current position and the trends affecting the economy, to identify the policies necessary for successful economic and social development.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development will report to the Government who will decide on national aims and policies and who may from time to time publish draft plans as discussion and consultation documents. Meanwhile it will be the responsibility of the Department to review and appraise the plans and activities of individual Departments in the light of overall national requirements.  In undertaking this activity the Minister and the new Department will bear a heavy load in relation to consulting with and hearing the views of the various interests in relation to our economy.  For instance, they will engage in consultation with the social <Col N="713" /> partners and other appropriate groups, as may be desired, on matters of economic and social development and they will co-ordinate the dialogue on such matters.  They will also participate in the relevant activities of international institutions relating to economic and social development, particularly the institutions of the EEC and OECD.  Apart from the merits of this work in relation to effective policy formulation it will also ease the burden on certain Ministers who until recently had to deal with these matters in addition to an already very heavy work load.  The end product of this activity will be a set of proposals to the Government for the co-ordination of the plans of Departments, having regard to all the inevitable constraints, and their integration with national social and economic plans.  From this process, the Government will decide on their future economic and social policies.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is intended that the Department of Economic Planning and Development will review the implementation of such national economic and social plans as may be approved of by the Government from time to time and will report thereon to the Government.  We are therefore providing in this Bill for a system facilitating a continuing process of planning consisting of the identification of the measures necessary for the more effective operation of the economy, the recognition of constraints and the fixing of realistic targets in national plans, the review of implementation and the taking of corrective measures as planning cycle follows cycle.  In this task all units of Government and, indeed, all interests in the community will have their contribution to make; the prime role of the new Minister and his Department will be as central co-ordinators and facilitators of the process with a crucial role in bringing these matters before Government and reviewing their implementation after Government decisions have been taken.</P>
    <P>We are, in this Bill, laying down the structures for planning and intend, of <Col N="714" /> course, to have them underpinned with statutory authority so that the new Department will have the legal authority to get their work done effectively; we are not laying down any rigid forms for planning itself, but we are leaving it open to the Department to devise for the consideration of the Government the actual strategies to be adopted.  It is therefore not appropriate for me to deal here with any of the technical issues associated with planning and policy formation.  Instead, I am proposing to the House the necessary measures to provide a framework within the administration through which all these things will be attended to.  The creation of this new Department is seen by the Government as an important component in their overall strategy for dealing with the many economic and social questions confronting our society at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was introduced last week and I read its contents.  I had some doubts as to the effectiveness of the new Department. Having listened to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, here this morning I can say none of these doubts has been removed from my mind.  It is quite obvious from the Bill itself and has been made more obvious by the Minister now that his attitude is: &ldquo;What I have I will hold&rdquo;, that the proposed new Minister for Economic Planning and Development will be nothing more than a pleasant advisory but powerless political eunuch.  I am extremely disappointed that this innovation, which was heralded as a major break from the old traditions, is nothing more than window-dressing.</P>
      <P>Now that a degree of economic stability has been very patiently established by the Coalition Government, the beneficial effects of which were very little understood, more particularly perhaps by our own supporters, Fine Gael fully share the general public appreciation of the desirability of a national plan.  In doing so, we in Fine Gael in no way subscribe to the view that a national plan alone, no matter how well constructed, is a medicine which will cure all our economic diseases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" /> It is no accident that the economic indicators are now all moving in the right direction.  They are doing so because in an exposed economy such as Ireland the key economic factor which is under the people's control, the factor which makes us more competitive on the world's market, unit wage costs, dramatically improved during our term of office in that we got and maintained a popular consensus about the desirability of controlling it.  A little recognised element in achieving this consensus was that the Coalition Government established a generally approved sense of justice about our taxation system and our system of welfare benefits.  This may not have helped us electorally but it did facilitate the remarkable pace of the recovery from the depression which, if it does not necessarily cure unemployment, presents an opportunity of curing it, if the truth is told and the options of alternative policies are authoritatively spelt out.</P>
    <P>While we will not be opposing this Bill because it appears to favour a five-year plan and the conditions are right for that, Fine Gael believe it is defective in its present form.  The Minister who prepares the plan must be responsible for financing its cost. Even if the country achieves the desired growth in production, the present and, above all, the future increased growth in public expenditure promised during the election by Fianna Fáil, cannot continue and must be controlled. The planner's main function is to express the Government's intention concerning public expenditure and revenue over a five-year period, to determine the rate of growth in different Departments and to allocate the scarce resources within these Departments.</P>
    <P>There may be different views as to who should be the planner.  If it is not to be the Minister for Finance, he must be content to sink into the lesser role of a mere gatherer of taxes, the revenue from which is allocated by his colleague, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development. It is significant, and I would like to &ldquo;congratulate&rdquo; the Minister for Finance on the fact, that he is not <Col N="716" /> accepting this role, and if it is left as it is in the Bill, the Minister appointed under the Bill will hold office as a sort of consultant or adviser and will be in danger of becoming a very much photographed, garrulous and toothless chatterbox who will gradually recede into the distance with a sadder and sadder countenance.  I am sure the proposed new Minister will be glad to know that we will seek to give him, and his Department, the necessary teeth if only to prevent the Government's plan suffering the fate of previous Fianna Fáil exercises in planning notably the second and third economic programmes which came unstuck owing to the lack of departmental control of expenditure.</P>
    <P>Third, it is a popular belief that the present projected increases in population and unemployment are unique or arising from the first time.  This is untrue.  For example, the second programme indicated an expansion of the labour force between 1960 and 1970 of 264,000, or an expansion in excess of the recent projection by Professor Walsh for 1976 and 1986.  What is different is that Fianna Fáil, in that plan and the third programme, where the estimate related to 1966-72, planned to deal with the unemployment problem by encouraging people to emigrate.  In their second proramme Fianna Fáil planned for an emigration of 70 per cent of the expansion and in their third programme for an emigration of 95 per cent.  Of course, this is no longer tolerable. What is unique is the demand that our economy should be so managed that the increased work force get employment in Ireland.  This will be achieved only by a widespread recognition that there are no soft options, that bread cannot be kept if it is eaten, that resources are always scarce in relation to demand for them and if the unpalatable truth is told to the people by a Government with a moral authority.  This moral authority will not be substituted for by the battalions of Fianna Fáil Deputies temporarily passing through this House.</P>
    <P>It is a sad fact for democracy that the means which Fianna Fáil used to win office in June may also prove a <Col N="717" /> mortgage on their future credibility and already is an unhappy part of the background against which vital decisions affecting the future rate of growth of product and employment have to be made.  There seems to be an implicit notion in the Bill that the publication of a national economic plan will act as a general panacea for all our economic ills.  While I recognise the advantages of an economic plan, and more especially a plan for Government spending and revenue over a five year period, I am realistic enough to acknowledge that a plan alone will not solve the fundamental structural problems facing the economy.  It was clear to the National Coalition Government on taking office that previous programmes had been prepared without first obtaining the necessary degree of public consensus about the nature of the problems facing the economy and the way in which they should be tackled.</P>
    <P>The third programme was written as the Fianna Fáil manifesto for the 1969 General Election and quietly buried within a few months of electoral success.</P>
    <P>A plan must deal with the problem of maximising the rate of growth of output and with the question of the distribution of that growth.  It is possible for any given rate of growth either to devote the proceeds of growth to increasing employment for those unemployment and those entering the labour market or to raising the real incomes of those who have jobs.  Some balance must be struck and a plan must reflect that balance.  But to strike the necessary balance between real income growth and employment growth is not a mere technical exercise.  It requires the consent of the main economic agents in the economy.  Like it or not we live in a mixed economy where Government influence in the determination of wages and incomes is indirect. It cannot order a certain pattern of growth for incomes, or at least cannot ensure that such a pattern is achieved. Yet a plan that does not confront the central problem of planning in an open exposed economy like Ireland, the behaviour of real incomes, is no plan at all.  So the essential task of Government <Col N="718" /> is to seek the consent of the population for an orderly growth in incomes compatible with the desired growth in employment and the ability of the economy to grow.</P>
    <P>It is no easy task especially when the existing pattern of distribution and structure of taxation gave rise to a great deal of unrest and disillusionment. We found on taking office that the ordinary worker, the ordinary wage or salary earner, was convinced that the well off, the very wealthy, were not paying their fair share of taxes. The income tax system was considered a scandal which had remained virtually unchanged since 1960 when PAYE was introduced.  Death duties were paid by those who received quite small bequests while the owners of vast estates were able to avoid the tax. Speculators who made huge profits paid no tax while an extra hour of overtime faced a tax rate of 35 per cent.  We realised that there was no hope of a workable plan unless the Government were able to obtain the consent of the population for the moderation of income growth in order to create more jobs.  This meant that workers must feel that they got a fair deal from the tax system.</P>
    <P>We realised that this would offend some of our own supporters; but in the long run the ability of the economy to grow depends on an equitable tax system.  If we had not made the tax system fairer we would not have achieved the degree of moderation in wage costs which we did and in turn would not have made so dramatic a recovery from the world wide economic depression.  There is no doubt that without the recession our efforts would have borne fruit earlier and more visibly.  But it was inevitable that the struggle to deal with the consequences for Ireland of an enormous world wide slump in activity and rise in inflation would dissipate some of the energy that could be devoted to longer term planning.  In addition there was considerable disagreement among economists, both inside and outside the country, about the causes of the recession, its likely time path, and the appropriate policies to adopt during it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="719" /> Indeed, one of my enduring memories is the fact that it was impossible in 1974 and early 1975 to get any two economists to agree about anything in relation to the future.  Even if one got two economists to agree one could be certain that those two would disagree the following week because of the way things were changing and the sense of uncertainty that then prevailed in the world.  To prepare a long-term plan while there was no unanimity about the duration of the world recession would have been a futile exercise.  Instead we concentrated on minimising the damaging impact of the recession on the Irish economy and on ensuring that we were well placed to take advantage of any world recovery.  And we succeeded in a way which few imagined possible.</P>
    <P>When we took office we had one of the highest inflation rates in the OECD.  Indeed, we held this position for several years and our rate of inflation exceeded that of the United Kingdom.  Given the close links between the two economies and the formal parity link between our two currencies there is an underlying tendency for both countries to experience a similar rate of inflation.  But in the four-and-a-half years before we took office the rate of inflation in Ireland was 9½ per cent above that in the United Kingdom or 2 per cent per year.  In the four-and-a-half years we were in office the rate of inflation was 6.2 percentage points below that in the United Kingdom, or 1.3 per cent per year.</P>
    <P>If any justification was needed for the policies we adopted while in office those figures give it.  Under very fair weather and in calm seas a previous Fianna Fáil Administration allowed inflation here to so upset our cost balance between Ireland and the United Kingdom that we were running 9½ per cent ahead of the United Kingdom over a four-and-a-half year period.  Yet we succeeded, in the middle of a world depression, in reversing this undesirable historical trend.  The point is perhaps highlighted by the fact that in the quarter we took office the annual rate of inflation in Ireland was 2.8 per cent above that in Britain. <Col N="720" /> In the quarter in which we left office it was 3 per cent below the inflation rate of the United Kingdom.  This reduction in our relative rate of inflation was a reflection of a reduction in the growth of unit wage costs in Ireland <i>vis-à-vis</i> the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Our growth prospects depend vitally on the extent to which we can produce goods at a cost below our major competitors.  Yet in the four years before we took office our costs were rising far faster than the increase in costs in Britain.  From the first quarter of 1969 to the first quarter of 1973 unit wage costs&mdash;that is, the cost in terms of wages and salaries of producing one unit of output&mdash;rose 6½ per cent more in Ireland than in the United Kingdom.  On the other hand from the first quarter of 1973 until the end of 1976, the latest period for which figures are available, unit wage costs rose by 14.2 per cent less in Ireland than in the United Kingdom.  And this was before the 1977 National Wage Agreement, which gave an annual increase in wages of well under 10 per cent for the period to Spring, 1978.</P>
    <P>In short, our term of office saw a major improvement in the underlying trend relative to the United Kingdom of wage costs.  We more than recaptured the ground lost in the four years to 1973.  And what are the results? The fastest rate of growth of exports in Europe&mdash;indeed the growth in our manufactured exports since 1973 is well above the average of our fellow EEC partners.  We have now returned to the pre-recession trend of industrial growth.  That is, the level of output to-day is as high as if recession had never occurred and production growth had continued along its historical trend average.  Only Italy and the United States, among OECD countries, can make a similar boast.  Even the Scandinavian economies, held up to us as examples to follow, have not managed to recover so swiftly.</P>
    <P>We experienced a smaller fall in output and a more rapid recovery than nearly all other OECD economies.  In 1975 output in Ireland fell by ½ per cent.  In OECD Europe it fell by 1.6 per cent&mdash;that is, at a rate more than three times greater&mdash;while in the EEC <Col N="721" /> it fell by 1.9 per cent&mdash;that is at a rate almost four times greater.  Among smaller European countries, a fairer comparison perhaps, output fell by 0.7 per cent in 1975.  In 1976 output grew by 3 per cent in Ireland while the smaller European economies managed 2.9 per cent, OECD Europe 4.1 per cent and the EEC 4.6 per cent.  But in 1977 our growth rate continued to accelerate to a projected 6 per cent while the growth for the OECD Europe is projected at 2¾ per cent, the EEC 3 per cent and the small European economies 2½ per cent&mdash;in the case of all comparisons twice or more than twice as much.  So, although we were a bit slower than the big economies, except Britain in growing in 1976 our expansion has been sustained.  Indeed the latest ESRI projections for 1978 suggest that the new Government are inheriting an economy in the midst of a boom.</P>
    <P>The growth we achieved has not so far led to an appreciable drop in unemployment&mdash;although there are signs that the growth of industrial employment is now beginning to eat into the registered unemployment figures.  And we are one of the few EEC countries where the 1977 level of unemployment is below the 1976 level.  Much of the rise in unemployment can be attributed to the structural effects of the recession and our EEC entry.  Although the then Government knew before entry that our labour intensive industries would face competition no action was taken to prevent this employment loss occurring. We might have been able to ride out the employment effects of entry if the world economy had not gone into a recession.  But it did and so all countries were fighting for a share of a declining market.  Employment suffered especially in labour intensive industries where competition from Third World countries, desperate to get revenue to pay for oil, became acute.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Coalition Government took steps to improve the level of unemployment benefit, so long neglected under Fianna Fáil.  Pay related benefits were introduced in 1974 and persons who became unemployed no longer had to subsist on a pittance. But, as a recent ESRI study has <Col N="722" /> shown, the improvement in unemployment benefit increased the number registering as unemployed and reduced the level of emigration.  Thus part of the recorded rise in unemployment is a reflection of the fact that for the most of the 1960s and early 1970s the registered level of unemployment was kept low by having poor benefit levels which forced the unemployed to emigrate.</P>
    <P>If the rate of growth achieved in 1977 and projected for 1978 can be continued unemployment can be reduced. This will require a continuation of the favourable trend in wage costs seen over recent years.  But such a trend is obtained only if the Government tell the people the truth, put the choices facing the community plainly before them, and give a lead in pointing out the direction to be taken.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that we have heard the truth from this Government.  They were unwilling to put any choices before the electorate in June; now they are beginning to hedge their bets. We said that there were no easy options, that Government alone could not solve unemployment.  Our arguments were dismissed by present Ministers who contended that rising demand, stimulated by tax concessions and more public spending, would solve our problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure you will act in a neutral and unbiased fashion. The Taoiseach and the Minister are now beginning to hedge their bets. Somewhat shamefacedly, they are asking the people for help, saying that unit costs are important, that Government alone cannot solve the problem. You cannot prepare a plan against a background where people believe that no choices have to be made, where the answer is a simplistic appeal for higher growth.  Over the next decade we will still have to choose between higher real incomes for those in employment or more jobs.  There will always be a struggle to keep the growth in incomes in line with our employment and growth needs.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil in their election manifesto opened a Pandora's box by pretending that, at the stroke of a pen, there could be jobs for all and higher incomes.  The improvement in the economy, combined with the promises of Fianna Fáil, has led to a public belief that substantial increases in real incomes are possible.  The industrial unrest we are now facing, and will face over the next year or so, is in part a direct consequence of the present Government's failure to present the hard choices facing the people.</P>
      <P>We will not obtain an orderly growth in incomes by telling untruths; we will not secure wage restraint by overstating the likely increase in disposable income.  All one gains from such ploys is a reputation for dishonesty, which is bound to lead to public disillusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if we do achieve the desired growth in incomes it would be wrong to pretend that all our problems will be solved.  We still have to face the fact that public expenditure growth cannot continue at a rate which will contribute much to growth.  Under Fianna Fáil proposals there will be a massive growth in expenditure in 1978 and a fall, or at least a slow rate of growth in revenue due to tax cuts, but <Col N="724" /> in 1979-80 it would appear there will be no growth in expenditure while revenue will rise.  The implications of this are very serious.  Will there be no rise in the growth of public service employment in 1979-80?  Will that mean no public service jobs for school leavers, no extra nurses or doctors for an expanding population?  No more teachers to teach the 5 per cent growth in pupil numbers and, of course, no pay rises for existing public servants? Answers to all these questions will have to be spelled out in any plan if the present uncertainty is to be dispelled. And uncertainty there is.  If you ask anybody in the street you can quickly find out that there is nervousness about the future, an air of abandon.  People are making merry now in fear of the brake which they feel must surely be applied.</P>
    <P>This disquiet can be dispelled only by a forthright statement of the expenditure and revenue intentions of the Government over the next five years.  This is the only sort of plan worth having in an economy like ours. Longer term stability has returned to the economy.  All economic indications are favourable and so the publication of the Government's own intentions for the years ahead is essential.  Without this the fear of the future, fear of tax increases and expenditure cuts will continue.  We, in my party, would support such a plan.  We recognise however that its preparation would require decisions about the growth of different Departments and the allocation of resources within the public sector.  In essence a five-year budget would be required.  Hence the Minister for Finance must be closely involved or else accept the role of a mere tax gatherer for the expenditure plans of his colleagues.  It is inevitable that there will be tensions between the long term requirements and the short term needs of the economy.</P>

      <P>I think it is inevitable that there will be tensions between the long term requirements and the short term needs of the economy and that is why past exercises in planning have failed, both here and in other European countries.  It is not defence to say that the Government are all in agreement on the long term requirements. We know how rapidly beliefs about the economy can change.  I would remind the Minister for Finance that in 1974, 1975 and 1976 budget deficits under the Coalition Government were a bad thing according to him.  In 1974, the present Minister for Finance argued for a maximum amount deficit of £20 million to £25 million.  The present Taoiseach condemned the lack of any &ldquo;attempt to cut down Government expenditure&rdquo;.  By 1975 the present Minister for Finance was arguing that &ldquo;a deficit of itself is not necessarily expansionary.  In fact, to the extent that it is not channelled into productive purposes, it is directly inflationary&rdquo;.  There was no talk then of some of the &ldquo;goodies&rdquo; that were later produced in the Fianna Fáil manifesto that are obviously inflationary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="726" /> By 1976 Deputy Colley was arguing that &ldquo;a start must be made now on cutting back the deficit&rdquo; and that &ldquo;nobody with any sense of reality can expect the public sector, certainly in the short term, to provide any answer to the pressing problems of unemployment which we are facing&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>How can we in this House or indeed employers and trade unionists have confidence in a five-year plan produced by a Government that has so dramatically about-faced in 12 months? How can we have confidence in a plan prepared by a Minister who does not have the authority to allocate expenditure or prevent unplanned increases in expenditure and no responsibility for the tax structure required to finance proposed plans?</P>
    <P>What confidence can we have in a Fianna Fáil plan to reduce unemployment and meet the employment needs of the future?  Their past plans give us little faith in their ability to tackle the long-term problem.  It would be a mistake to pretend that the problems of population and employment growth facing the country now are unique in the recent history of the economy.  The work undertaken for the second programme indicated that the labour force would expand by 264,000 between 1960 and 1970, that is by 26.4 thousand a year.  This projection of jobs needed at that stage was greater than the projection by Professor Brendan Walsh recently.  In spite of that projection the second programme planned for only 78,000 extra jobs, less than 30 per cent of the required amount.  The balance were expected to emigrate, obviously.</P>
    <P>In the event only 2,500 thousand jobs were created during that period. Emigration was also below target however because the marriage rate dropped and there was more participation in education partly due to free second level education introduced in the middle of the period.</P>
    <P>These are the points I want to make to show that we will not accept a plan from the new Department or the new Minister that has as a basis for curing our economic ills the idea that a large proportion of the population must emigrate.  In fact, under the last <Col N="727" /> plan introduced for 1966-72 total employment fell by 16,000 and unemployment rose by almost 19,000.  It it clear that Fianna Fáil's past efforts in planing will not satisfy us and we will not accept plans which envisage part of the solution to our problems in emigration. I want to congratulate Deputy O'Donoghue on his appointment as Minister.  On the Committee Stage I shall be on his side.  He may not appreciate that, and I am sure he will not vote that way, but I shall be on his side because I shall be seeking to give to him and to his Department some of the teeth which I am sure they will want.</P>

      <P>I wish the new Minister and Department well.  We are taking an important step here but, having said that, I want to express grave doubts about how successful this Department can be because of the powers&mdash;perhaps I should not use the word &ldquo;powers&rdquo;&mdash;the terms in the Bill before us setting it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Immediately after the general election, when the newly elected Taoiseach announced the setting up of this Department and the appointment of Deputy O'Donoghue as its Minister, the Leader of the Labour Party, in the debate on 5th July welcomed this move.  It is only fair to say that, at that time, there was a generally favourable reception for the setting up of this Department and the appointment of the Minister.  Since then there has been a definite and remarkable movement away from the commitment given which we thought would be contained in the legislation necessary to set up the Department.  The contents of the Bill show a definite and remarkable movement away from that commitment. Therefore, we are disappointed. We must express doubts and we must <Col N="728" /> be very critical of the various sections of the Bill because they do not go far enough.  They do not give the new Department the necessary statutory powers.</P>
    <P>I had hoped the Second Reading speech by the Minister for Finance would allay our fears and explain to us something we do not see in the Bill. I am afraid what we heard this morning confirms our worst fears about the weakness of the new Department.  We are disappointed because we in the Labour Party have always advocated economic and social planning.  We have always recognised the necessity for it. We are not recent converts to the idea. As the Leader of the Labour Party said on 5th July, we do not mind the Government stealing our clothes, but it appears they did not steal all our clothes in relation to our policy on economic and social planning.</P>
    <P>I have been trying to resist the temptation to examine this Bill in a party political way, but it is very difficult to resist that temptation when we see the contents of the Bill and when we heard the Minister elaborating on its contents this morning.  The background to the Bill needs to be examined because there was no mention of the setting up of this Department in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto. It was announced shortly after the winning of the election.</P>
    <P>As I say, there is a temptation to look at this Bill against the background of the power structure within the Government. We must ask: how committed are the Government to economic and social planning?  Is theirs a commitment to give to a newly elected Deputy who played such a major part in their election victory a portfolio which would appear to have some power within the Government? Is that the beginning and end of their commitment?  For example, if Deputy O'Donoghue had not been elected to the Dáil, would we be here today discussing a proposal to set up a new Department?  I seriously doubt that we would.  I am not expressing these remarks in criticism of the new Minister or anybody personally but as showing a crack in the so-called commitment of Fianna Fáil to economic and social planning.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="729" /> This had to be thought up after the election because of the power structure within the Government.  In post-election discussions among Ministers they seem to have come up with a consensus rather that a hard and fast decision to do anything definite.  The setting up of the Department seems to have been decided on by a consensus on what Departments were prepared to surrender rather that what the Taoiseach and the Government as a whole were prepared to direct should be put into the Department.</P>
    <P>I question the commitment to economic and social planning of the Government also because of their record in the past.  I do not want to spell out once again the inadequacies and failures of the first, second and third programmes for economic expansion. In the overall they had certain good results, but in the long term sphere of economic and social planning they were a complete failure.  We still have the problem of unemployment and the problem of providing employment for those coming on to the labour market annually.</P>
    <P>That problem has not been peculiar to the past three or four years.  It has been with us always, unfortunately, despite what Fianna Fáil have been saying.  It was there even in the favourable economic conditions of the sixties but the Government of the day failed to do anything about it.  In those years of favourable economic conditions, new jobs were not created and, more important, the structures and the under-pinning were not laid down.  During the three or four years of National Coalition Government work was done to try to keep people in employment during a recession period.</P>
    <P>This Bill relates to the future and that is the main cause of my concern and disappointment at its contents.  My party do not feel that the powers being given to the new Minister will be nearly adequate to do the job we have been told he is supposed to do.  Indeed I am sure that if the Minister were free to express his personal feelings on it he would admit that he is disappointed with the inadequacy of the powers he is being given.  Even <Col N="730" /> if that is so, it will not be any excuse for him to say in the future that he had not the power or the statutory right to do this or that, to direct a Department or a departmental agency to do certain things.</P>
    <P>The immediate as well as the long-term future are of equal importance. In regard to the immediate future, the electorate in this year's general election were led to believe that there was a ready-made plan to solve our economic and social problems if Fianna Fáil were elected.  They were led to believe that the problems which have bedevilled the country for many years would be solved as soon as Fianna Fáil got back.  The more I consider what the Minister for Finance said this morning the more I realise that the Government have not got any plan for the immediate future, not to talk about a long term plan.  Of course they must produce something in December to meet EEC commitments but all the Minister spoke about today was the need for identification of the problems and co-ordination of effort.  He spoke about monitoring and co-ordination and he used other nice words like these, and he said there may be a plan</P>
    <P>This is not good enough for a Government who got elected precisely on the point that they had a good workable plan.  All that has happened is the removal of the car tax and other small related things.  That is the limit of their plan.  They appear to be treating the solution of our economic and social problems in the same way a previous Fianna Fáil Governments did</P>
    <P>A significant feature of the Bill is that, though there are references in the various sections to economic and social planning, the reference in the Title is to economic planning only. This is a grave mistake, demonstrating the Government's lack of concern and commitment to social planning which is as important as economic planning I intend to put down an amendment to the Title to rectify that omission. It is important that the word &ldquo;social should be in the Department's and in the Minister's title because without we must again doubt the Government commitment to social planning.  It has always been said that what should be <Col N="731" /> done is to plan economically and that the social planning could be left until later.  It is all right to talk about baking a big cake and not to talk about how that cake will be divided.  When small cakes were baked in the past, the amount for social purposes was not adequate.  There still has not been the necessary structural input into social planning.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development must have a clear commitment to and involvement in social planning.  He can only have that in an indisputable way by having social planning in his title.  I will deal further with that point on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>We are not discussing today an economic and social plan as such but we are discussing the vehicle by which such plans can be implemented.  We are critical of the structures in the Bill because they do not go far enough nor do they give the Minister the necessary powers.  I do not know if I would be in order in congratulating the Minister for Finance for being able to retain so much power and in allocating a relatively small function to the new Minister.  I am not saying that the function of planning is small, but that the amount of power and the functions of the new Department are small.  As a result the Department will be ineffective and will not get the very important results they should.</P>
    <P>For too long we have been treating planning in a secondary way.  People have always been suspicious of planning. Sometimes it has been misrepresented, often deliberately, as being too idealistic and that there is far too much State control, intervention and direction.  From time to time, and for their own reasons, people have often misrepresented it.  Because of that successive Governments were often slow to take a firm hand and issue firm directives in this regard.</P>
    <P>The time for being hesitant about these things is gone.  We are faced with an increasing population, an increasing and immediate need to provide more employment and an urgent need for social planning right across the board. I am not talking about social welfare only but the whole field of social planning. Some might argue that social <Col N="732" /> planning should come before economic planning because without a proper social network, particularly of technical and higher education and accessibility to education, medical services and so on, it would be difficult to attain the goals of economic planning. Social planning should go hand in hand with economic planning.  It is a failure if this Bill, particularly in regard to the title, that that will not happen.</P>
    <P>We hope our amendments, to be moved on Committee Stage, will correct that and other deficiencies.  I hope the new Minister will have a job to do and I, as shadow spokesman for Labour, also will have a job to do.  If the Minister is not given these powers I will not have very much to do.</P>
    <P>I have examined the Bill and its political background, its relationship to the power structure within the Governernment, its capabilities as a means of meeting the necessary job targets and its doubtful capabilities of being a major structural reform in public administration or in whatever social and economic plans that exist at the moment.</P>
    <P>There is a very important necessity for involvement in agricultural development. This is one of our biggest, if not the biggest, potentials for economic and social development.  I am not satisfied that the agricultural industry are providing all the employment they can.  I am not satisfied that they are playing their part in the social development of our economy.  Agricultural development has always been treated as a completely different and separate development but I am convinced that there is potential for job creation and further development in agriculture. There is, too, potential for involving more directly our agricultural development with social development.</P>
    <P>The necessity for a complete reappraisal of the land structure and the necessity to bring out as soon as possible a land structure plan should be a major and integral part of the new Minister's responsibility.  Agriculture, industry and social planning are too inter-connected and interdependent to be treated separately and there must be a more positive and definite approach to this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="733" /> The terms of this Bill give the new Minister a right to seek from the various Departments their ideas and policies, to talk about them, to bring them to Cabinet level and have further talks about them.  Something more dynamic is needed in our situation and something far more dynamic is needed for the future economic and social development of our country.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and I support this Bill.  I was amazed at the contributions of the Opposition who repeatedly refused to commit themselves to planning while in office.  The former Minister for Finance repeatedly told the people that it was not feasible to plan a difficult period such as we have experienced in the last few years. Deputy Barry will now support this initiative but his former Government failed to realise the need for planning and to take decisive action.</P>
      <P>When a country is faced with a great challenge or enormous difficulties the people look to the Government to provide the necessary leadership and commitment to meet the challenge. They expect public representatives to identify the long and short term problems and to act with urgency to provide the best remedies available. Such periods in our history became milestones in the development of our people.  Eighteen years ago we accepted the challenge of the sixties.  Dr. T.K. Whitaker presented the first programme for economic expansion under the leadership of the late Deputy Seán Lemass.  The then Taoiseach, Deputy Seán Lemass, in the Irish Farmers <i>Yearbook</i> of 1960 said that the coming ten years would be a testing time for our people, that they would bring difficult problems but that they would bring opportunities as well. No one will deny that the sixties brought their problems.  We had to adjust to the free trade area agreement with Britain and to the gradual removal of industrial tariff protection from the European free trade agreement countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These were traumatic changes for which we had to develop new skills and expertise especially in the fields of <Col N="734" /> management, marketing and more sophisticated technology.  Ireland prospered and grew in the sixties and contrary to what had been said by the Opposition emigration was reduced from 50,000 per annum to zero as we entered the seventies.  We then faced what we considered to be a great challenge&mdash;our accession to the European Economic Community.  Although this brought many difficulties it has led to a rapid expansion in agricultural incomes and a phenomenal increase in the growth of industrial exports. Few seem to fully realise that we are now full members of the EEC.  The transitional period for almost all commodities is over.  The motor assembly industry with its 12 year transitional arrangement is a notable exception. We now have free access to all EEC countries.  Consequently, we face a challenge for the next decade such as we have never experienced before.  We have never had so many unemployed while at the same time we have never had open to us such a vast marketing opportunity.  Nor have we ever had such a wealth of resources at our disposal.</P>
    <P>The principal resource which must be taken into consideration in preparing these plans is manpower.  We have never before had such a supply of trained and educated young people. Our educational base has expanded from 7,966 finishing second level education annually in 1960 to 32,559 in 1975.  The numbers finishing group certificate have increased from fewer than 6,000 in 1960 to 18,822 in 1975. Our universities and other third level institutions are bursting at the seams with personnel in training.  Meanwhile, the number of technologists working in the country has grown from an estimated 10,000 in 1960 to 25,000 in 1975 to provide a strong technological base on which to plan further expansion and development.  In 1971 the census showed that there were 21,886 scientists and technologists in the country. These highly trained personnel have increased in number from fewer than 10,000 in 1960 to an estimated 25,000 in 1975.</P>
    <P>Brave new initiatives were taken by our predecessors in 1960 and we, too, <Col N="735" /> must be prepared to make a contribution to development.  If we look at the growth and spin-offs to agriculture, industry and the service sectors which resulted from the setting up of An Foras Talúntais and the expansion of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards we can see how the Government of the day contributed to development.  Add to these the expansion and response of the Irish Management Institute, the Institute of Public Administration, the universities and the colleges of technology and one realises the valuable manpower resources we have developed.  AnCO, established in 1967, is one of the most recent examples of the growth which has been achieved in trained manpower. Total apprentices registered with AnCO in December, 1976, were 15,559.  In 1976 alone AnCO trained 10,727 adults and apprentices.  The foresight and planning of Seán Lemass and his Cabinet at that time ensured that Irish industry now has an excellent source of trained personnel.</P>
    <P>It is now our task through trained personnel to identify and develop our physical resources.  The potential for diversification in agriculture, forestry and fisheries and for new product development in industry must be fully exploited through well-planned strategies. Major decisions must be made regarding our mineral, gas, turf and oil deposits.  The infrastructure in roads, rail, port and other services must be developed to support the planned developments. How much more of our increasing exports can the port of Dublin handle?  Already, a considerable volume of drive on traffic is bypassing Dublin and going out through Larne.</P>
    <P>If we are to realise the potential in our economy and meet the target of 25,000 new jobs per annum, we must set clear-cut development objectives and be prepared to invest in the plans to achieve these targets.  This will not only involve macro-economic decisions but will call for the skilful use of management and marketing.  The key to economic development lies in understanding the inevitability of change in a technologically developed society. <Col N="736" /> No market or product is free from the effects of social, cultural or technological developments.  Those who accept the challenge of change must seek to understand society and the factors influencing its direction and dynamism.  We must respond to these needs providing the public service structures required to direct, support, initiate and harmonise these developments in the economy.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, the Department of Finance has the enormous task of treasurer and financial controller on behalf of the Government.  It provided a system of checks and balances which ensured that the finances of the State were not wasted on frivolous products or in unauthorised expenditures.  If we are to give unfettered priority to planning and economic development that the present job targets require, we must give the planning function of Government the freedom and status to operate effectively.  Nothing short of a full department of economic planning and development, directly responsible to the Government, would be an adequate response to this need. The separation of economic development from financial control is seen by some as being fraught with all sorts of dangers and imponderables.</P>
    <P>It is as if neither the Minister concerned nor the public servants in his new Department could be expected to preserve and respect the public interest in the way in which the Department of Finance has acted traditionally.  Of course, this is a nonsense view and one which has stifled initiative not only in Government Departments but in semi-State bodies also.  It is an indication that some people believe that we, as a people, are neither confident nor mature enough to risk making mistakes as we tread new and unchartered paths in economic development and job creation.  Such people prefer caution and mediocrity to courage and enterprise.  All too frequently they look for precedent and guidance to British and other mentors when they should be turning to our own people for initiative and direction.</P>
    <P>I hope the new Department will <Col N="737" /> rely heavily on and give scope and assistance to Irish nationals who propose projects and investments here. Such people exist in abundance at present.  Their commitment is to their country and they will neither give in easily when the economic going is tough nor merely use their operations here as service units or warehouses for their foreign-based headquarters.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance have the task of financial controller of our home and overseas activities.  They must provide capital for investment, protect our currency in the international monetary environment, control the supply of and demand for our currency and keep inflation within reasonable limits in relation to Government policy.  Financial control must go side by side with planning and economic development but must not be allowed inhibit it.  Therefore, the functions of financial control and economic development should be separated.  The Taoiseach, as Chairman and Chief Executive, and the Government, in cabinet, under the principle of co-responsibility, constitute the proper forum in which to decide the conflicting options proposed by the Department of Finance with their emphasis on financial control and the Department of Economic Planning and Development with their emphasis on development and job creation. Indeed the Cabinet must accept this responsibility which is timely since these will be the fundamental problems facing us in the next decade.</P>
    <P>Something has been said about the failure of the British experiment in setting up an economic department. Apart from the fact that I disagree with the constant use of British precedents for Irish policy-making it is clear that the British failure was related to short-term difficulties.  In contrast our EEC partners in Holland, Belgium, Germany and Denmark all have Ministers for Economic Development, and we all know how successful they have been in increasing their prosperity.  We have now, in the Government, an excellent opportunity to establish a new Department in view of the political stability given by the clear mandate of the people.  This <Col N="738" /> mandate is given to tackle our problems resolutely and achieve results. Let us not be afraid to make the changes we deem necessary to make this our kind of country, one in which the Dáil and the Cabinet take on a new, more meaningful leadership through the public service.</P>
    <P>I fully support this important Bill and wish the Minister and his staff every success in their task.  The time is long overdue for our economic planners to identify more closely with the detailed sectoral plans of agriculture, industry and the services.  Lack of such detailed planning and follow-through has cost us many jobs in recent years and prevented us from reaching our potential on the home and export markets.  We live now in a highly competitive community.  It is not our duty to bemoan the adverse external factors affecting our economy; rather it is our task to identify our competitive strength and resources and prepare plans which will create the jobs we need.  That is why Fianna Fáil proposed this new Department of Economic Planning and Development which I wholly support.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate Deputy O'Donoghue on his appointment and wish him every success in his new Ministry for which he is eminently suited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the new Minister and congratulate him on his appointment as Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  On his shoulders rests a responsibility about which I know very little and the statement of the Minister for Finance has not cleared the air in that regard. Indeed were I Deputy O'Donoghue I would be rather worried as to what responsibilities, if any, I might be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Woods that nothing short of the establishment of a Department of Economic Planning and Development would contribute an adequate response to the current problem.  Everybody realises that.  It is a question rather, when one gets down to the nitty-gritty, of what functions that Department and their Minister should have.  It is then that one <Col N="739" /> sees the problems and difficulties with which one is faced.</P>
    <P>I believe that the general principle of planning is one accepted by everybody as being essential.  If a Government are to succeed they must have a comprehensive plan at national level. Such plan should incorporate the activities of all Departments.  However, one must remember that an overall plan is made up of many elements. First of all it must provide the machinery with which that plan can be formulated.  I presume that is what this Bill is about.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is required the co-ordination of the activities of the different Departments and development agencies.  This Bill attempts to do this. Thirdly, there must be balance in the plan in terms of the type of development and incorporating regional development.  By that I mean that a development plan must take account of whether it is advisable to put large, industrial development into a rural, agricultural setting.  For example, to what degree can development be provided for agricultural produce?</P>
    <P>There arises a further point consequent on what I have outlined already, that is, the economic and social results of planning.  Once one decides on an overall strategy and the implementation of a development plan one's decision will have consequences, such as movement in population and the provision of facilities and services for such movement.  All of these cost money.  Therefore, we revert to the major problem, that of defining exactly what functions a Minister for Economic Planning and Development might perform.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said that in summary, planning is an activity which needs to be structured in an organisation in such a way that the planner does not divert his energies unduly either to the performance of the day-to-day executive activities or into other areas.  He added that that goal was best secured by the creation of a specialised area of organisation which is, in effect, the Ministry which, in turn, proceed immediately to divert <Col N="740" /> their attentions to where the Minister has said they should not be directed. Because of the nature of his office, to carry out his duties he must do exactly what the Minister for Finance said he should not do.  I do not see how the new Minister can co-ordinate the plans of all Departments, can know what is going on and know what other Ministers have in mind with regard to planning in their Departments, without doing exactly what the Minister for Finance said he should not do.  I appreciate that the Minister for Finance probably meant he should not go overboard in doing that.</P>
    <P>What happens if a Minister who is responsible for his own Department does not see eye to eye with the plans put forward in the overall package by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development?  The question arises as to the status of the new Department and whether the format is workable at all within the confines as we know them at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that the new Minister will have a very close working relationship with his Department although he points out he will be organisationally separate from the budgetary work of the Department of Finance.  This is the kernel of the problem.  By virtue of the functions of his Ministry the new Minister will have to work in close co-ordination and in close relationship with the Minister for Finance but in what manner can be influence the latter? If he in his wisdom and on the recommendations of his advisers draws up a plan, whether it be for a section of the community or on a regional or a national basis, will that plan not be restricted and constrained by the availability of finance which must be permitted by the Government and which must come through the Minister for Finance?  The Minister for Finance has been very careful to point out quite definitely the budgetary separateness of the new Ministry from his own Department.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister states that you cannot have rigid compulsion in planning.  He said:</P>
    <P>At the end of the spectrum the term has connotations of rigid compulsion: <Col N="741" /> at the other, it is a loose arrangement for undisciplined forecasting. </P>
    <P>There is a very accurate analogy which I shall quote as a teacher.  When the new curriculum for national schools was introduced it was referred to as &ldquo;organised chaos&rdquo;.  I have a terrible feeling there is a great danger that the new Department may be tagged in the same way.  I am not saying that the results in the case of the new curriculum for national schools were unsuccessful; I hope the new Minister's success will be able to measure up to the success of the new curriculum despite the tag of organised chaos.</P>
    <P>There are many contradictions and much vegueness in the Bill with regard to the responsibilities of the new Minister. The Minister for Finance has said that the general design is clear, that the new Department will be a focal point for a widespread planning system throughout the public service but he also uses words such as &ldquo;limited executive responsibility&rdquo;.  The limitations will be those of the availability of finance to carry out the plan.  While I appreciate that plans will be carried out by Ministers in their own Departments, the new Minister will be responsible for overall planning and strategy.</P>
    <P>We are told that novel solutions are necessary if we are to overcome our problems, that a consensus is necessary, but what happens if neither of these factors is present?  It has become evident from ministerial utterances in the past five or six weeks&mdash;much different from the utterances four months ago that the new Fianna Fáil Government would solve our problems, would cut down on unemployment and so on&mdash;that the onus is being shifted very rapidly to the community and to society.  Now we are told that unless certain sections agree to certain things the Government will not be able to deliver the goods on their own.  This is fine.  This is an acceptable philosophy to me but I do not think it is a straight or honest approach having won the election by saying the opposite.  I am referring to statements made in the past few weeks by various Ministers that if we are to <Col N="742" /> reduce unemployment we must have a wage agreement consistent with the terms as outlined in the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  The onus for reaching this agreement is being shifted to the unions and to other sectional interests in the community.  Despite that, the Minister for Finance has quoted from Report No. 32 of the National Economic and Social Council as follows:</P>
    <P>This is a responsibility which in a democracy must properly be borne by the Government alone regardless of who else might be involved. </P>
    <P>It is fine to quote that but to come along and to say the very opposite in public is not good enough and it is not honest.</P>
    <P>Everyone in this House wishes the Minister every success but if I were he I would be rather worried about the vagueness of his functions and I mean this genuinely.  In the statement of the Minister for Finance there is complete vagueness on this point and I hope that this matter will be spelled out on Committee Stage.  We want to know exactly what will be the functions of the new Minister and see how they can fit in with the overall strategy that will be expected of him in his office.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister for Finance said:</P>
    <P>One result of the transfer to my colleague, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, of some of my burdens for economic policy is that, I will, as Minister for the Public Service, be able to devote a greater amount of time towards the task of public service reform. </P>
    <P>Some of the burdens are being transferred. I hope we will be told what these burdens are and to what extent will the Minister for Economic Planning and Development be taking over some of the functions of the Minister for Finance.  We have been treated since the debate started, to a dissertation on what a Department for Economic Planning and Development should be and what it should do.  We were also told all the practical difficulties that are obstacles to carrying out those functions.  It reminds me of Euclid proving a theorum and down at the end he has <i>quod erat demonstrandum</i>, <Col N="743" /> having gone through all the logical steps to prove his point except with the difference that the Minister for Finance has not used all the logical proofs to show why the new Minister should not have the teeth he might have, as Deputy Barry stated.</P>

      <P>I hope we will have on the record his views of the powers he considers the new Department will have.  We have the words of the present occupant of the new Department, the Minister for Finance, on the record.  Deputy O'Toole quite rightly drew attention to the very significant section in the Minister's speech this morning when he said that there would be a very close working relationship between the new Minister and the Minister for Finance.  He was careful to point out that the function of economic and social planning would be organisationally separate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nub of our disappointment is with the description of the powers of the new Department.  There does not appear to be any power over allocation of resources attached to this new Department.  When one looks at the powers allotted to the new Department in the Bill one sees a complete lack of any real planning power.  One does not have to talk about whether or not one agrees with the concept of imposed <Col N="744" /> planning.  The Minister for Finance says he does not agree with it.  It is not possible in our mixed economy for the Government to impose their particular plan on industry.  I believe, if the Government are serious about the central importance of planning in the Irish context that a duty devolves on them to make clear their plans for their sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>The Government suggest that they are more in favour of planning than their predecessors.  Then, in coming before the House with the outline powers of the new Department, one would have expected a sharp, clear description of the exact powers to be given to the new Department.  We have here simply what seems to me to be the blueprint of the Cabinet think-tank. I congratulate the Minister but it seems to me that he is the head of the Government's think-tank.  This new Department, without any offence to the facts, can be described as just another satellite of the Department of Finance. The heading of Department of Economic Planning and Development is only a fancy name for what is in effect the Cabinet thinking machine.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government have a very good head of that unit in Deputy Martin O'Donoghue.  He may be the only person in any Government in Western Europe to be given such a status.  I congratulate him on achieving that eminence in his party.  When I read here the powers of his new Department I read simply what any Minister could propose round the Cabinet table.  It says here that he identifies policies that are considered necessary for general economic and social development.  He promotes and co-ordinates economic and social planning. The Minister for Finance said that the status of the Department was proved by the fact that we had a Cabinet Minister who could report directly around the Cabinet table.</P>
    <P>Everybody who has served in Government knows that any Minister is entitled to make any comments he likes on the memorandum of another Department.  If a Cabinet are working properly and if a Minister is doing his work properly, which most Ministers do, he can make his comments around <Col N="745" /> the Cabinet table.  We have in section 2 of the Bill no more than the description of what any hard working or interested Minister in the economic area should be doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department have received from the Dublin Port and Docks Board within the past week a copy of the board's recent 5-year development plan for the Port of Dublin, 1977-81.  I have not yet had an opportunity, therefore, of giving full consideration to this plan and would not be in a position to offer a comprehensive statement in the matter at this stage.  It would appear, however, from a preliminary inspection of the plan, that the proposed new works correspond fairly closely with projects in respect of which the board have already applied to me for harbour works orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the broader issues of the relationship of port development with the surrounding amenities of the bay, it may be relevant to point out that Dublin Corporation earlier this year made a special amenity area order in respect of some of the Dublin bay area.  This order has been submitted to the Minister for the Environment for confirmation, together with certain objections to the order, including one by the Dublin Port and Docks Board. I understand that these objections have not been withdrawn and that, consequently, as laid down by the Planning <Col N="747" /> Acts, a public local inquiry will require to be held by the Minister for the Environment.  I understand that arrangements for the holding of such an inquiry will be made shortly.</P>

      <P>Arising out of that reply, for which I thank the Minister, is he in a position to indicate whether plans recently received depart in any significant way from the studies published in the early seventies by the board which, because of the size of the expansion, gave rise to grave concern in the Dublin region?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the studies published in 1972 were essentially discussion documents.  In themselves, they have no formal status as plans.

      <P>My Department have had preliminary discussions with Irish Shipping Limited about the possibilities open to the company for the development of their shipping interests and the creation of additional employment. I understand that the company are considering proposals for the expansion of capacity on the Irish Continental Line's Rosslare/Le Havre route but since these proposals have not yet been finalised I am not in a position to give details.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's aim that the State-sponsored bodies should continue to play an important role in the development of the economy.  The future policy of Irish Shipping Limited and the means by which the Government can best assist their development will, therefore, be matters for continuing consultation between my Department and the company in the coming months.  Any proposals for development in the shipping sector will, of course, have to take account of the scale of investment involved in the acquisition of new vessels, the current serious slump in the world shipping industry and the need to operate on a commercial basis.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport whether any changes are contemplated in the role and functions of his Department <i>vis-á-vis</i> the State-sponsored bodies under its aegis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is one of the Departments participating in the Aireacht/Executive Unit programme of reorganisation.  This programme entails the hiving off of executive activities from Departments and the strengthening of the policy formulation and policy review roles through the creation of staff support units for planning, finance, personnel and organisation.  The function of the staff units will be to assist senior management in the formulation and review of policies and in the presentation to the Minister of alternative policy proposals for consideration.</P>
      <P>A high proportion of the executive activity in the areas for which I have responsibility is discharged by State-sponsored bodies and harbour authorities. Most of the executive functions undertaken by the Department are of a technical or regulatory nature and are discharged by units which are largely self-contained.  The Department is, therefore, already structured on Aireacht/ Executive Unit lines to a large extent.  Staff units already exist in the personnel, organisation and finance areas and I have recently taken a further step towards strengthening the Department through the creation of a planning unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> The planning unit will be of particular importance because of the extent and impact of the capital programme of the State-sponsored bodies and the vital role of these undertakings in the economic and social life of the country. The role of this unit, when fully operational, will be to assist in the analysis of aims and objectives in the tourism and transport sectors, to advise on goals and targets to be set, and to assist in the appraisal of existing policies and of the results of the State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>It is a primary aim of the Government to secure renewed and accelerated economic growth.  The State-sponsored bodies generally have played a significant role over the years in their contribution to economic development and I am concerned to ensure that the State bodies under the aegis of my Department will continue to contribute in an effective and significant way to the expansion of the economy and the creation of productive employment. This will be an important consideration in the development of the relationship between my Department as restructured and the State bodies operating in the tourism and transport sectors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The change in the title of my portfolio to that of Minister for Tourism and Transport denotes an increased emphasis by the Government on the importance of tourism and the contribution it can make to the development of the economy.  In accordance with this, I <Col N="752" /> propose to pay particular attention to the integration of effort in order to realise in full the economic value and in particular the employment potential of the tourism sector.  There is already a high degree of co-operation in most areas but I propose in conjunction with Bord Fáilte and other tourism interests to review the situation as a whole to ensure full coordination of resources and to give a new impetus to the tourism effort.</P>
      <P>This renewed emphasis on tourism should not necessitate any formal change in the functions of my Department or of Bord Fáilte.  These are already defined comprehensively in the Tourist Traffic Acts.  Matters relating to the internal structure of Bord Fáilte are of course a matter for the board of that body.</P>
      <P>There will, however, be increased ministerial attention to the needs of the tourism industry.  I intend to meet the representative bodes in tourism in order to acquire a full appreciation of their problems and policies in this revised context.  I will also be in contact with other Ministers whose functions have a bearing on tourism to secure their co-operation, and the co-operation of their Departments and agencies, in the integrated effort. Generally, I intend to give close personal attention to the problems and progress of the industry and support to the activities of Bord Fáilte.  I believe that tourism has considerable growth potential and can greatly increase its contribution in the generation of overseas earnings, the expansion of employment and the raising of living standards throughout many parts of the country.</P>

Surely the Minister has some responsibility for ensuring that the air fare structure on the north Atlantic route will operate in such a way as to be of benefit to the Irish tourist industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to a separate question today, the Government are placing increased emphasis on the importance of tourism and the contribution it can make to economic development. North America is one of our major tourist markets and has considerable growth potential.  The availability of adequate capacity on transatlantic services is an important consideration in promoting increased tourist traffic from North America and in that context it is essential that the capacity on charter services, which are mainly seasonal, should match fully the demand for such services.  The year-round transatlantic scheduled services are also essential for tourist development and for trade, commerce and communications generally and I am resolved that regular scheduled services must be maintained between Ireland and the US.  In these circumstances my policy is&mdash;and will continue to be&mdash;to allow the maximum opportunity for charter operations consistent with maintaining the viability of year-round scheduled services.</P>

Could I ask the Minister if he is aware of the vast expansion in the growth of charter traffic and the contribution this has made to the development of tourism? On the other hand, is it not a fact that the Minister is faced with a dilemma in that the growth of charter traffic could affect the national airlines? Could I suggest to the Minister that it is worth exploring the possibility of airlines following the example of other major international airlines in <Col N="759" /> setting up a subsidiary charter company?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will probably be aware of the policy in relation to this, which is that the kiosk would be expected to pay for itself. The only area where that is likely to happen is where there is a post office. As a rule, because post offices close at a certain time in the evening, applications are made to have a kiosk erected outside the post office so that there will be a 24-hour service.  These applications have been granted in most cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four applications on hands for telephone <Col N="768" /> service in or near the Black Valley. Because of the nature of the terrain and the distance from the nearest exchange, the cost of providing service would be very high and it would take a considerable time to complete the heavy construction work involved even though an ESB supply is being provided in the valley.

      <P>The County Cork Committee of Agriculture have been in communication with me on the question of extending the disadvantaged areas in that county.  The views of the committee will be fully taken into account in the course of the review of the disadvantaged areas scheme which I announced recently.  I have, therefore, invited the Cork County Committee of Agriculture to furnish to my Department details of the precise location and extent of the areas they wish to have considered, together with supporting material based on the criteria of the EEC directive.  The carrying out of the necessary detailed analysis of basic statistical and other data will inevitably take some time to complete in full for all proposed new areas, including those in County Cork.  When this has been done a case for any appropriate modifications or adjustments will have to be submitted to the EEC Commission and where a sustainable case is accepted by the Commission, the matter will have to go to the Council of Ministers for final decision.</P>

Would he not agree that the Minister should press to have the thing brought down to the level of townlands or even parishes?

No matter which area we decide on, whether DED's, parish or county boundaries, there will be the same arguments.</P>

Is the disadvantaged areas scheme being reviewed by the European Commission as part of their overall review of the structural directives now taking place and, in view of the fact that the Minister has set no time limit for his review, it may well be the case that the EEC will have completed their review before ours and our submissions, if any, will not be taken?</P>

      <P>There is a recognised way of having a debate on a ruling by the Chair, namely, by way of substantive motion.  In view of the fact that Deputy Mitchell is new to the House I shall tell him that I have carefully considered the issues raised by the Deputy's question in relation to the possible closing of the Ferenka factory in Limerick. I am deliberately making this statement. Would the Deputy please resume his seat until I have finished?  I ascertained that protective notice was given to the workers on Monday, 17th October to run for a period of two weeks from then.  The Deputy, there-fore, has ample time to put down a question on ordinary notice for Tuesday next.  Accordingly, the private notice question is not admissible. I should also add that one of the questions which I must take into consideration in coming to a decision of this kind&mdash;and I am in no way influenced by any particular person's interest nor have I discussed it with any of the interested people&mdash;is the <Col N="785" /> Minister's responsibility and since this is an inter-union dispute it appears to me that the Minister has not a direct, immediate responsibility.  I make that long statement, which is unusual, for the benefit of new Deputies including the Deputy who is raising this matter.  I shall not allow any further debate now.</P>

    <Title>Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill, 1977: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been making the point that on the evidence of the clauses of the Bill before us setting out the powers of the new Department, it would not be an unwarranted conclusion for Deputies on this side of the House to believe that this new Department is, in effect, what has been known elsewhere as the think tank of the present Cabinet.  If that conclusion is correct, the new Minister for Economic Planning and Development as head of that think tank, important function though that may be, is the only such person in Europe to be dignified with the title of Minister.  I hope this is not too hard a conclusion but it is based on the evidence of the Bill before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One cannot crib about the desirability of the objectives of the new Department which would promote and co-ordinate social planning; identify the policies it considers necessary for general economic and social development; review and appraise the plans and activities of the Departments of State giving effect to the policies for general economic and social development; make proposals to the Government; review the implementation of such national economic and social plans&mdash;all praise-worthy objectives but there is no description, in connection with the powers of the new Department here, of its relationship with the Department <Col N="787" /> of Finance.  There is no setting down of actual powers the new Department may have over the allocation of resources.</P>
    <P>The boast was made on the Government side today that the previous Government was not as enthuasiastic as they should have been about the concept of planning and that the Government we now have are more committed to that concept since they have set up a Department with the magic name Department of Economic Planning and Development.  Yet, the powers of the Department give us no confidence that the new Department in the sphere of Government influence, in the area of public planning, the area of the semi-State or the area of the budget itself has any real powers.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance introduced this fledgling Department, this rib from the side of the Department of Finance, presumably the author of this new Department, blessing this new entrant to the Cabinet team, giving it a patronising pat and explaining, of course, that the organisation of the budget was still his responsibility but setting out all these praise-worthy objectives for this new bright entrant to the Cabinet, the only Ph.D. the Cabinet has, the only academic.  Perhaps it could be said that the previous Cabinet had too many academics but to its one academic the new Cabinet has given a present of a brand new Department &mdash;no exact powers of course, just objectives.  The Minister for Finance said that lest anyone should object that this would leave the planner in an ivory tower.  We know in the language of Fianna Fáil for whom ivory towers are meant; places of imprisonment for a while for intellectuals; of course, he is not in an ivory tower but in a Fianna Fáil Cabinet which is certainly not an ivory tower &mdash;but to ensure that he is not isolated in this ivory tower, a fate which often befalls intellectuals in Government, the Minister for Finance emphasised that the real consideration which will prevent planning and development from being removed from reality is that the Minister in charge of that Department <Col N="788" /> will be in regular contact with his colleagues at Government meetings. There is an insurance that the Minister for Economic Planning and development will not lose touch with reality.  I wondered whether it was automatic that the new Minister could attend regular Cabinet meetings, but he can; we understand he will be able to attend Cabinet meetings; he will not be removed from reality; he will be in regular contact with the more realistic proponents of the policies of the party of reality.</P>
    <P>In the meantime we must record our disappointment that a Department nominally committed to planning has such very few real powers.  It has a very able head.  How long he will be head of that Department is anybody's guess.  We do not know what shuffles, reshuffles and changes will occur in this Cabinet in the years ahead.  I would not be as sanguine as many of the new backbench Government Deputies who have the happy glow on their faces of people who are facing into the year 2000 as Fianna Fáil Deputies.  I would not think their happiness is well grounded.  Perhaps this opening term in the 21st Dáil is a time for complacency on the part of such new Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Chair examines the actual powers of the new Department he will see that any Opposition Deputy should have the utmost latitude in deciphering what is meant by &ldquo;to promote and co-ordinate economic and social planning for the development of the economy&rdquo; in section 2 (2) (a).  That is set down as one of the objectives and one of the powers of this new Department.  The English could be a little improved.  Perhaps the new Minister would look at this.  Perhaps it is not one of the essential marks of a new Department but I would expect a little bit of elegance even in the setting out of what appear to me to be the very vague attributes of the new <Col N="789" /> Department.  I do not believe any English professor would approve of &ldquo;as respects different sectors thereof and different regions of the country&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If the Government suggest they are more serious about planning than others have been, the least that could be expected is that a new Department with this title would have been given powers over expenditure and over the planning of other Departments.  Those of us who have served in Government know that in any dispute about a Department all arguments must rest on the Bill setting up the Department. Here we see vagueness and a lack of sharp description about its relationship to the Department of Finance.  The general point was made in the speech by the Minister for Finance that there will be a close relationship.  I think the phrase was that they will inter-mesh, not inter-mash.  The Minister said the Minister for Economic Planning and Development will report to the Government who will decide on national aims and policies and who may from time to time publish draft plans as discussion and consultation documents.</P>
      <P>We are not here discussing the formation of a new national plan. Presumably we are discussing an executive arm on the Government side, the Department which will be primarily concerned in the formulation of such a plan.  That executive arm lacks any real executive powers in relation to other State Departments. That is the fundamental weakness of this Bill.  I have no doubt the Department will be able to advise the Government in the best fashion possible because the Minister for Economic Planning and Development has many interesting ideas which he may put to the Government.  He had many interesting ideas during the recent election. Presumably we owe to him more than to anybody else the fact that we are on this side of the House.  Whether those ideas are good for the economy in the long term I leave it to the Minister's conscience to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning the Minister for Finance made the favourite point that Governments must rule at the end of the day&mdash;the Dunkirk spirit, and so on.  The Minister quoted from Report <Col N="790" /> No. 32 of the National Economic and Social Council.  The quotation ended:</P>
    <P>This is a responsibility which in a democracy must properly be borne by the Government alone. </P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the Government to make a decision in the end despite all the analyses and all the interesting plans which may be put forward.  I agree with the Minister for Finance in that respect.</P>

      <P>Allow me to give the quality of my conversion.  If the Government come forward with a plan and, if that plan does not find agreement, they must come to some decision at the end of the day.  This is the serious charge we must make against the Government early on their return to office.  They fought a dishonest election campaign in which they attempted to suggest it was possible to expand employment and increase consumption simultaneously. That is not possible.  If the Government think it possible we will wait&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that that was the dishonesty which caused this Government's victory in the election.  Political leadership will be necessary in the period ahead to <Col N="791" /> elicit the agreement of the social partners to any programme based on expanding employment.  What will conflict with that objective will be the kind of message conveyed to the electorate in the recent general election.  I may be wrong in that.  This may be biased on my part.  We shall see.  From the optimistic message given by the Government quite recently, we hope it will be possible to construct a programme which will lead to an expansion in employment.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister for Finance. All the most fanciful planning mechanisms will not achieve the desired results unless the Government's overall programme suggests to the electorate that they are concerned with social justice and fairness in taxation.  With all the mistakes which were made, perhaps in a period of utmost difficulty, that was the characteristic of the recent Government which enabled us to bring about, in free agreement with employers and unions, the kind of conditions which made it possible for exports to increase to the point they have increased this year and to bring back growth to the point to which we brought it back in the economy.  We shall see whether it is possible, on the basis of their recent campaign, for this Government to suggest that you can have your cake and eat it.  That was the fundamental message from Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we have this new planning Department which does not have a great deal of executive power and which depends on an inter-meshing relationship with the Department of Finance.  This happens in the best ordered Governments and, heresy of heresies, it may happen in this Government even with a majority of 20.  We may find a Minister who says &ldquo;The Minister for Economic Planning and Development is an interesting chap.  I have read some articles he has written and I have heard some speeches he has made.  He seems to be a good man.  I do not agree with his ideas for the future of my Department's expenditure&rdquo;. The secretary of that Department would say to his Minister: &ldquo;You are quite correct Minister; you may disagree.  There is nothing in the Bill <Col N="792" /> setting up that Department that gives the Minister any power over your plans for your Department.&rdquo; In fact, that secretary will tell his Minister that the only man who counts in relation to expenditure of any Department is the Minister for Finance.  He is the only person one has to be concerned with. That is the weakness in the Bill and why I say&mdash;I hope without undue bias &mdash;that the Bill only contains a list of instructions that anybody could draft for a think-tank in any Cabinet in western Europe.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a very competent head of such a unit and it is a tribute to his status within the Government party that he is heading such a unit and will enjoy the title of Minister. However, we do not have here a planning Department or the executive arm of a Department which can become the executive arm of a national plan. That is the fundamental weakness in the Bill.  It is true that we have had growth in the economy but all who are serious about the subject of expanding employment here in the years ahead must accept that it will take a lot of agreement on the part of the unions and employers about their investment plans.  However, such agreement would be facilitated if the unions and employers could be convinced that the Government are certain about their expenditure plans in the areas under their control.  We do not have to enter into the intricacies of the argument of whether the plan is an imposed or democratic one.  In a mixed economy the builder who is anxious about his investment next year is entitled to know Government plans about expenditure next year.  The private businessman in our economy is entitled to know the projections of Government expenditure and revenue over the next five years.  It is a fair conclusion to say that so lacking in power is this new Department that one cannot have any confidence in it or that any plan agreed by the Government will be any different from the second and third programmes of late unhappy memory.  It will be a rolling backwards plan and one that cannot give us any guarantee about expanding employment.  I doubt whether the <Col N="793" /> kind of cash bonuses handed out in the recent contest can automatically arrange the kind of employment expansion needed in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (2) (c) states:</P>
    <P>to review and appraise the plans and activities of Departments of State giving effect to the policies for general economic and social development adopted by the Government, </P>
    <P>In reviewing and appraising why is it not open to the new Department to review and appraise all Departments? Which Departments are involved? It appears that taxation will be settled elsewhere but there is no reference to revenue.  The Labour Party have always been convinced of the importance of having a serious planning mechanism at the heart of our campaign to expand employment and we feel the new Department should have had overall control of the expenditure of other Departments over a five-year spell, at least.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance indicated that the new Minister would consult with the social partners or economic interests.  The Minister for Finance stated:</P>
    <P>For instance, they will engage in consultation with the social partners and other appropriate groups, as may be desired on matters of economic and social development and they will co-ordinate the dialogue on such matters. </P>
    <P>It was my lot in the last Government to be the Minister charged with consultation with the social partners and in that capacity I carried out, as time permitted, deep consultation with the employers and unions.  We met almost a year ago in tripartite talks and several Departments co-operated.  In my view those talks played a great part in the final national agreement reached.  It is not clear from the outline given by the Minister or the details contained in the Bill who will have the overall responsibility for consultation with unions and employers.  It is not clear whether the new Minister merely discusses with them aspects of any plan suggested or whether the Minister for <Col N="794" /> Finance will have overall responsibility. I advise that a Department be designated as the one to concentrate the Government's views and bring them forward in any tripartite arrangements that may be agreed.  In the course of our period in office we discovered that it was important to have some forum with the unions and employers on matters apart from wages and salaries and the tripartite talks fulfilled that function.</P>
    <P>It is an important prelude to any future plan that such a forum be arranged by agreement between the unions, employers and the Government but, preferably, on the initiative of the Government.  In sadness rather than in any partisan spirit I say that one cannot feel any optimism in relation to any plan that may be decided on.  One must record disappointment that the Department which presumably would be more concerned than any other Department with it lacks any real punch in relation to the Government sector.  It is still the poor relation of other Government Departments with no clearly marked functions and no status amongst other Government Departments.  It will have no real power in the investment policies of the Government.  It is my contention that, without entering the ideology of imposed or voluntary plans&mdash;obviously any plans if they are to be agreed upon in our mixed economy must be voluntary&mdash;to convince the social partners that the Government are serious the Government must be able to present their plans for their portion of the economy.  They must be able to show the powers of the lead Department dealing with the economy and its relationship with the Department of Finance.  On such a basis, and with such Department having real powers, it would be possible to get free agreement from the trade unions and employers for what-ever plans for expansion of employment that are needed in the years ahead.  Above all, we should banish from our minds the possibility, as was mentioned in the Minister's brief when he spoke of resolute government, that failing to reach agreement with the unions and employers, it <Col N="795" /> would be possible to impose agreement.</P>
    <P>We do not believe in imposed planning for our economy nor is there any success to be gained by thinking that one may impose solutions on unions in relation to wages matters.  If there is a lingering conviction in the Minister's speech that it is possible to force agreement, I would counsel him from such a course at this point.  There appears to be a recipe here for division and even more strife than we have in the industrial area, to think that such a resolution of our problems would be possible.</P>
    <P>We need an agreed plan and if we are to get such a plan the preliminary steps should have been to put before this House today a Department having real powers which could gain complete support from all sides.  We have all been forced either as a result of experience of government or of our convictions to believe that the expanding of employment is the number one objective of the country.  If that is to be brought about, a resolute attempt at planning is necessary.  If economic planning is to be successful it needs the agreement of those concerned.  To gain that agreement the Government should prove themselves to be serious.</P>
    <P>From looking at this new Department I must conclude they are not serious about planning.  We have a cosmetic exercise before us, a Department which lacks any powers.  It is only a fancy name for the intellectual think-tank for the Cabinet.  They may do good work in advising Ministers but no powers are given to this Department in the area of allocation of resources.  At this point one must conclude that this is not in any sense a Department which can inspire confidence on the part of the social partners that the Government are serious about planning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I must express my concern about this legislation on three points.  First, this may be what I would describe as the classic response of governments to problems they face, not so much of going to the root of the problem and solving it but setting up <Col N="796" /> an agency which employs more people to deal with it.  We tend to throw money and agencies at problems rather than actually solving them.  I am wondering if this is yet another exercise in the creation of jobs for the boys and the girls&mdash;I do not mean that in a derogatory sense but literallyor is it something that will actually create a new environment in the running of our economy.</P>
      <P>I am aware that already 61 officials of varying grades, some quite high, have been assigned to this Department. There is no certainty whether any of the posts they previously held will be suppressed as a result of their transfer and the transfer presumably of some of the functions of other Departments to the Department of Economic Planning and Development.  We do not know what the long term cost of what may be just a cosmetic exercise is going to be.  We do not know the size of the Bill the Exchequer will have to meet in respect of setting up this Department.</P>
      <P>There is also a considerable lack of clarity in relation to the functions of this Department.  I realise they are set out rather sonorously in section 2, but the Minister does not seem to be too sure just what those functions will be.  He said in reply to a parliamentary question today that</P>
      <P>Discussions are still proceeding in regard to the transfer of staff and functions to the new Department of Economic Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>The House is being asked to agree to the setting up of a Department the functions of which the Minister for Finance does not yet know and which are still the subject of discussion between himself and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development. I would like to ask a question of both Ministers: why did they introduce this legislation with what purport to be functions of the Department when, by their own admission as to what the real functions will be, discussions have not yet concluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, we are being asked to buy a pig in a poke.  We do not know, and again I quote from the Minister for Finance, what the long term <Col N="797" /> staffing needs of this Department will be.  I would further argue that there is a need to ensure that a proper role for Parliament is provided in plans for economic development.  I will expand on that point later.</P>
    <P>There is a further link in the Minister's statement in relation to this Department and the Government's decision to establish new and additional posts of Ministers of State.  It is fairly clear that this will involve the creation of more Ministers with more State cars, more State offices provided at considerable expense.  The question ought to be asked whether we have enough Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries already and if we really need the creation of more jobs for members of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I submit that there is strong evidence to suggest, so far as the existence of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries is concerned, that we are already not under-governed but over-governed.</P>

One is entitled to ask if we need the new Ministries which the Government proposes to set up when these other countries, with infinitely more complex societies than ours, are able to get along with a far smaller number of Ministers per 1,000 of their population.  With the expansion <Col N="798" /> of the Government we are seeing a trend towards the development of bureaucratic centralism.  We will have more Ministers and the local authorities, by virtue of transfer of the cost of rates to the central Exchequer, will be deprived of any effective say in local government.</P>

      <P>The stripping of local government of its powers and the expansion of central government is not a good or an efficient development. Will this new Department just create a dispersion of effort?  Effort is undoubtedly needed at political level in the management of the economy. Do we not have built into this Bill a source of continuing conflict between the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and the Minister for Finance, regardless of the holders of the office, and between the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and every other Minister in the Cabinet, because his functions overlap theirs?  There is no Minister with whom the buck stops in relation to any matter because the matter might be under consideration in consultation with the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, and when the consultations are completed a statement will be made.  The Minister in question will not be responsible and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development will not be responsible; they will both be responsible.  There will be confusion as to where the buck really stops in relation to economic matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The creation of further Ministries is not a solution to our economic problems.  In the twenties when this country was a fledgling state it faced the most difficult problems it has ever faced.  At that stage the Cabinet consisted <Col N="799" /> of less than ten members.  Now we have a Cabinet consisting of 15 members plus seven Parliamentary Secretaries plus an unstated number of Ministers of State who will be added to the Cabinet.  Will this new bloated administration do as good a job as was done by a much smaller team in the twenties?  We do not need more jobs for more politicians, we need decisions.  The creation of this duplication of functions between the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and other Ministers in relation to various matters will delay decision rather than facilitate it.</P>
    <P>I have some experience of Government and one of the greatest problems faced by any administration is in getting matters to the Cabinet, in getting responses from various Departments from whom responses ought to be given on the initial memorandum circulated by the responsible Department, so that their comments can be incorporated in the final memorandum to be presented to the Government. There can be considerable delay in getting comments from some Departments. If these comments are not forthcoming, unless exceptional matters are invoked the matter cannot get to the Cabinet table.  By adding an extra Minister, who will have his own ideas on everything, to the list of Ministers who have to give their comments on any memorandum circulated by any Department, we will create yet another roadblock to be surmounted by any Minister who wants to get a matter to Cabinet for decision.  A Minister will have to wait until he gets the views of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  In view of the fact that that Minister will, according to this Bill, have his finger in every pie, unless he is a superhuman able to give his views on everything off the reel, without reflection, it will take a long time to get his views in respect of every matter coming before the Government and the result will be that there will be backlogs.  This will delay rather than accelerate decision making in Government.</P>
    <P>The proper way to deal with this matter is not to create another new <Col N="800" /> Ministry but to see if the standing procedures of the Cabinet can be updated. I understand that Cabinet procedures have been under review for some time and I look forward to something being done here.  That would have a far more beneficial effect than the creation of another Ministry, another expensive office, another State car and the provision of more Ministerial facilities.</P>
    <P>One of the most important matters which the new Minister will have to attend to is the continuing alarming growth of public expenditure.  There are a number of continuing institutional pressures&mdash;expanding Government spending, expanding the extent to which the Government interferes in the ordinary lives of ordinary people and takes an ever-increasing share of the money they earn.  We have a situation where at any given time there is a majority of spending Ministers around any Cabinet table.  There is only one Minister, perhaps it will now be the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, concerned with keeping expenditure down.  All of the others are concerned, and can make their reputation, only with expanding the amount of money given to their Departments.  If the Minister for Economic Planning and Development is going to be an ally of the Minister for Finance in curbing the growth of public spending to that extent I welcome his appointment.</P>
    <P>There is also the phenomenon that the experts in any field&mdash;be it education, health, social welfare or any other&mdash;almost invariably, and they are the people whose advice is always sought, will benefit themselves monetarily by the expansion of the amount of expenditure in their fields.  For instance, if we decide that we want to examine the health services, the experts to whom we should go are the doctors.  Does the House think that the doctors will say: &ldquo;Oh, we do not need any of this money to be spent; in fact, we could do with less&rdquo; when they, the very experts who were seeking the advice, have a direct, vested interest in spending more regardless of whether it will do any good?  We also have a vested interest but it may not be one <Col N="801" /> that operates in every case.  From my own experience officials are very concerned in the spending Departments about the way in which money is spent. But the reality is that if the amount of money voted for a particular Department is expanded in any given year that will improve the promotion prospects of the people within that Department.  Therefore, that is another institutional pressure existing for the ever increasing of Government spending.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the trend is somewhat alarming.  I shall quote now from paragraph 4, page 67 of the National Economic and Social Council Report on Public Expenditure, No. 21, which states:</P>
    <P>Over the ten-year period 1963-64 to 1972-73, real public expenditure on goods, services and transfers grew at a rate substantially above that of the real GNP (6.88 per cent as against 4 per cent).  As a result, the share of total real public expenditure in GNP rose from 34.4 per cent in 1963-64 to almost 44 per cent in 1972-73. </P>
    <P>Therefore, in those ten years of Fianna Fáil rule the amount of money taken from the taxpayer by the State jumped by almost ten percentage points. Regrettably, that trend has not been reversed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me quote further from that report, page 70, paragraph 12:</P>
      <P>On the assumption that the historic trend would continue (see column 2 of Table A.1), private consumption would account for 51.7 per cent of GNP in 1986, as compared with nearly 70 per cent in 1972-73. </P>
      <P>That projection about the historic trend of public expenditure was made before the irresponsible promises given by the present Government in their election campaign&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to increase dramatically public spending still further in order to purchase support, as it turned out, successfully in the general election.  Therefore, we are faced with a situation in which to an ever increasing extent in respect of the money that was in private hands in the sixties and early seventies, being spent by private individuals, when decisions were being made by ordinary people themselves, decisions are being made for them now by the Government with their already top-heavy machinery. We need to set about reversing that trend rather than accelerating it, as has been the case since the Government assumed office and started to execute at least some of the promises they made of further public expenditure during the election campaign. There is a need for better scrutiny by this House of public expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>One function of the new Department is to review and appraise the plans and activities of the Departments of State giving effect to these policies for general economic and social development adopted by the Government.  In effect, that is to review public expenditure because all of those together involve the total of public expenditure.  The new Minister will be concerned with aggregate public expenditure. In executing the role given him under paragraph (c) I believe he should consider additional measures to keep a proper curb on the growth of public expenditure.  I believe there is need for the improvement of the procedures of this House so that Deputies will have a better say in extra money being committed and resulting in no money being spent in respect of any Estimate until it has been approved in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he would consider, in relation to his plans for economic planning, following a precedent set in France where there has been established a special <Col N="803" /> committee of parliament set up to concern themselves with planning, where the government present an annual report to parliament, through that small committee, on the execution of the plans.  If planning is to be effective here, it must be subjected to a continuous, rigorous review.  There is nobody better in a position to give the plans and their performance such scrutiny or revision than elected public representatives.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to consider the possibility of submitting on an annual basis not only a report of the progress in relation to the plan to this House but also to a committee of the House when he would be subjected to detailed questioning in relation to various matters, as has been done in France. Were that done and if, in respect of overall increases in government activity such scrutiny existed, we would be going some way towards reversing what is an historic trend and one which has applied in all governments towards the increase of the public sector and the diminution of the private.</P>

It is a good omen of how effective will be the new Department and the whole approach of the Government in tackling our present economic ills.  We might recall that a little over three months ago our people in a general election gave the Fianna Fáil Party a majority never given before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>If we did it once, we can do it twice.  I feel the people reacted in that way against the former Government on a major and some smaller issues.  Apart from the other failures of the former Government, their basic and greatest failure was that committed in the sphere of employment and unemployment.  At that time people were losing faith in the democratic process of the solution of our economic ills.  When Fianna Fáil put forward their manifesto the <Col N="804" /> people were given hope and they reacted to that hope.  Now the Government intend to honour their promises. It is not my job to lecture the Opposition but it is my view that Parliament generally would be most unwise to ignore the warning given at the last general election when the people voted so overwhelmingly to remove the former Government and install a new one.</P>
      <P>During the election campaign one aspect which struck me was the worry of so many parents for the future of their sons and daughters who could not obtain any kind of employment. I think this played a big part in the huge vote our party received.  Our party have taken note of that and as members of that party we have decided it is our duty to try to formulate a policy that will afford an opportunity to every person to obtain employment suitable to his or her ability.</P>
      <P>This will be a difficult task but it is the duty of the Government to create conditions to provide employment and thus give greater momentum to the drive towards prosperity.  In their wisdom the Cabinet have decided that this Bill is essential to generate this drive towards prosperity, to garner all our resources, so that we may achieve economic success and freedom.</P>
      <P>I do not see any reason why we cannot build an economy just as strong and healthy as those of other European countries which have an acceptable degree of employment, or indeed of unemployment.  Prosperous countries are prosperous because they work hard.  We will have to work very hard to achieve this goal but I believe the Cabinet have the ability and the resources exist in the country to do that. By wise government, by work, and with the co-operation of all sectors of society we can achieve this goal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be very easy for us to pass this Bill and when it becomes law to sit back satisfied with the creation of the Department of Economic Planning and Development and content to let them and other Departments do everything.  This would be wrong. Every man, woman and young person and every organisation has a part to play and none has a greater part to <Col N="805" /> play than the trade union movement. I am convinced there is goodwill in the unions.  They are as conscious as we are of the need to create more employment because one of the fundamental purposes of unions is to have a situation where their members and the people generally have as high a standard of living as is possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated:</P>
      <P>The new Department will be the focal point for a widespread planning system throughout the whole public service.  Other Government Departments will have responsibility for developing the economy from particular viewpoints... </P>
      <P>The Minister envisages the new Department as a wide global Department, one that will have a job to do involving other Departments also.  The Minister also stated:</P>
      <P>... it is now scarcely necessary for me to say that the Government do not subscribe to an imposed concept of planning. </P>
      <P>This is essential but there is an invitation in the statement and in the Bill for all sections to come in behind the Government&mdash;and that includes the trade union movement, employers' organisations and other groups&mdash;so that we can get on the road to full prosperity.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton gave a remarkable performance.  He started off by suggesting this Bill would enable the Department to pass the buck and to say it was not their responsibility but afterwards he demolished that argument himself by saying that the Department would be all-embracing, rather like Big Brother.  It would be fatal if that idea were to be perpetuated in other speeches.  The Opposition, in common with the Government, owe it to the people to come clean on this matter. They must reassure them that this new Department will be a major factor in building up the economy and, consequently, that there is an onus on everyone to play his part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people know what is happening <Col N="806" /> and they are watching.  They pin their hopes on the Oireachtas to prepare the way so that we will have a much better country than we have had in recent years.  I am not trying to make political points by commenting on the behaviour of the previous Government. They had their difficulties but from now on all of us must try to be constructive. I am not talking about blind obedience to every measure but we owe it to the people to ensure that our contributions here will help in the creation of the new Department so that it can play an important part in our drive towards a better Ireland.</P>
    <P>We will have difficulties but if we have the will we can overcome them. Then we will generate public confidence and this confidence in the economy generally is badly needed. When outsiders see we are in earnest we will attract more investment, our people will be imbued with a greater desire to press ahead to throw off the <i>malaise</i> that has afflicted the country for some time.</P>
    <P>This Bill contains the basis for a great drive forward.  It is a continuation of the thinking of a former Taoiseach, the late Seán Lemass.  In his philosophy there was the marrying of two factors, private enterprises and State enterprise.  If we look at continental countries with the same type of economy as ours we see they have a very high standard of living.  They may have unemployment problems but compared with our problems they are small.</P>
    <P>The idea of the late Seán Lemass of using all our resources, whether from the private sector or the public sector is a very good one.  We can then create jobs to offer our people and expand our educational services. Instead of cutting down on the number of medical students entering our universities we will be able, because of an expanding population and an expanding economy, to say to our young people: &ldquo;If you want to be a doctor you should go ahead because there will be a job for you.&rdquo; We can say the same thing to any of our young people who want to be architects, carpenters or anything else.</P>
    <P>I believe that this Bill is a major <Col N="807" /> step on the road towards creating that society which I know every Member of the House wants to see.  It is the job of the Opposition to criticise the Bill but I believe we should put trust in the Government and realise that they have put a lot of thought into the creation of this new Department because they feel that this will be a weapon against unemployment and waste.  Those of us who have seen so much unemployment and emigration should be anxious to build up the economy.  We should ensure that we give the economy the necessary weapons to fight against emigration and unemployment.  We must succeed if we have confidence in ourselves.  I would like to branch out, if I may with your permission, but I will not try it very much.</P>

I have mentioned the trade unions and the employers' organisations.  The individual on the street has a part to play.  I believe if everybody co-operates we can build an economy which will be the achievement of the dream of many people for a long time.  Now is the time, with world conditions improving and the possibility of new resources off our shores, when we should drive forward. I have great satisfaction in supporting the Bill.  I wish the Minister every success.  I have every confidence that he will use this Bill to create a better society for us.  It is such a short Bill that I feel it is a good omen and that there will be no waste of time. We are giving great opportunity to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong to say that this man will be the saviour of the economy. Nobody can do that if there is not complete dedication by every person in the country.  People must believe in the need to create conditions where we will be able to offer employment <Col N="808" /> to every person who wants to have a worth while life here.  Our greatest problem is unemployment.  I wish the Minister every success.  We should all dedicate ourselves to trying by every possible means to create conditions where we will be able to say that at last we have full employment.</P>

It is sad that we have come to such an advanced stage of this debate without the benefit of the Minister's experience and thoughts which I am sure would enlighten Members on his own side of the House as much as it would enlighten us.  It is like a performance of <i>Hamlet</i> without the prince.  I would say that with more assurance if I were not afraid that at the end of this exercise in a couple of years' time the Minister will resemble the prince less than Ophelia, or even Polonius or any other unfortunate character in that epic.  I suspect that the history of this Department may eventually make <i>Hamlet</i> look like the teddy bears' picnic.  I am usually in agreement with my colleague, Deputy M. O'Leary, but I thought he was a little bit hard on the new Minister when he referred to him in such scathing tones as an intellectual.  The word has become such a term of abuse in Irish politics that I suspect if it were repeated outside the House it would be actionable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's party may be in a better position to answer that than I am.  There is a need for a Department to deal with the economy <Col N="809" /> and with planning.  The problem is that we have absolutely no evidence that this is the Department we need.  I thought Deputy Moore was particularly eloquent in his vision of what this Department could and would do. There is no substance, unfortunately, for his belief, eloquently expressed though it was, in this Bill and in the Minister's speech.  There was not anything like the concrete information we hoped for.</P>
      <P>There is a need for an important, vital new Department because in many administrations for a long time the Department of Finance have traditionally assumed roles which were mutually conflicting.  Attempts have been made from time to time in other administrations to separate some of those conflicting roles of the Department of Finance, the Treasury for instance, and they have met with various degrees of success.  Students of economic and political history will be well aware of the efforts made in Britain under George Browne to establish a Department of Economic Affairs.  His efforts met a very sad end and at the hand of the Treasury of the day.  The person concerned may not have been the right person to carry out that experiment and the structures chosen may not have been the right ones but the idea was basically sound.  There is a need, more than ever before, for a strong Department that is independent, which will oversee the economy in a way that the Department of Finance, with all the internal, conflicting pressures, can never hope to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true, as the Minister said, that there will and must be co-ordination between the new Department and the Department of Finance but that is only half the story.  There will have to be competition as well as co-ordination, if either of those Departments are to do their job properly.  Each of them will have an individual perspective and an individual perception of their own role in the development of the economy.  It is naïve in the extreme to pretend that two such important Departments can exist forever in an atmosphere of mutual harmony, trust and forgiveness.  It simply will not happen.  This would not matter if the <Col N="810" /> forces ranged on each side were more or less equal, if the troops given to one side were more or less as powerful as those given to the other.  This certainly is not the case in this Bill or in the blueprint which the Minister for Finance has spelled out today.  The Minister for Finance has accepted that these Departments will have in many cases different functions, but even then I wonder at the seriousness with which this is being taken on the Government side of the House.</P>
    <P>One thing struck me as an extra-ordinary anomaly.  It was the Minister's statement that since economic planning and development have been hived off from the Department of Finance he will have the opportunity to devote himself with more energy to the task of reforming the public service. The reason this struck me as an anomaly is that he is despatching from the Department of the Public Service to the Department of Economic Planning and Development, as well as various roles assigned to it, the one public servant who has become almost the apostle of reform of the public service.  He is now leaving the Department in which, apparently, the reform of the public service will be carried out and going to quite a different Department with a different role and task in Irish society.</P>
    <P>We have the situation in which we have a mock battleground and a totally unequal distribution of forces.  In such a situation the inevitable and on the whole praiseworthy tension between the Department of Finance and the Department of Economic Planning and Development will inevitably favour the Department of Finance.  This is important because it will result in a permanent downgrading of the roles of economic planning and development. It may result in other political consequences for the person concerned.</P>
    <P>There is another area where I am afraid of the possible consequences and that is the area of related agencies. The new Department of Economic Planning and Development will of course have overall responsibility for a number of things.  We have already been told of the Government's intention, for example, to give it oversight <Col N="811" /> of the new National Board for Science and Technology.  This board is perhaps one of the most important agencies of its kind.  It would be a disaster if this were to be attached to a Department which would eventually go down like the <i>Titanic</i>.  It would be far better if it had stayed with the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>There is one very limited way in which I can welcome what the Minister has said.  In his speech he referred to the job of the new Department as participating in the relevant activities of international institutions, particularly the institutions of the EEC and the OECD.  The point I have to make is comparatively minor but still very relevant.  We can rely on the new Minister, no matter how much his hands are tied in other directions, to at least do something about the scandalous showing that this country makes in OECD and EEC publications with regard to the up-to-dateness of the statistics furnished by us to those organisations.  We are the laughing-stock of the OECD and in some respects also of the EEC because the statistics we submit to these organisations for their publications are so out of date.  Very often one sees surveys from the OECD of the statistical conditions in various countries and time after time in the column under &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; one sees &ldquo;Information not available&rdquo;.  Information which is available is three or four years out of date, when up-to-date  information is available at home.  Something must be done about that.  The new Minister is someone who will do it and I give him credit for this at least.</P>
    <P>I do confess my alarm that this new Department will ultimately find itself reduced to this kind of tame, statistical adjunct to the Department of Finance, a messenger boy, a general factotum and dog's body.  This is not good enough for what is needed for economic planning and development; it is certainly not good enough for what is needed in 1977.</P>
    <P>One further point made by the Minister might be referred to before I conclude. He talked in a very bland, <Col N="812" /> overall kind of way about planning. He said that at one end of the spectrum the term has connotations of rigid complusion and at the other it is a loose arrangement for undisciplined forecasting.  The Government's view of planning places it between the two extremes.  We need to be a bit more definite than this.  The Chinese have a saying &ldquo;Man who walks down middle of road gets run over&rdquo;.  I deeply suspect that at the end of the day the new Minister for Economic Planning and Development will find himself in precisely this position.  I can well imagine his emotion as he lies writhing on the roadside when he looks up to see behind the wheel of the vehicle which has almost assassinated him the faintly apologetic face of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise for the first time to speak in this House on what I consider to be the most important measure since this Government came to power.  Before we examine the Bill we should examine the background of its initiation.  We must appreciate this background in order to understand why we need this Bill.</P>
      <P>There are two main reasons for the creation of this Department.  The first is the change in the economic problems facing this country and the second I will broadly classify as the implications of the Devlin Report in 1969. It is well documented and realised by all politicians that the greatest problems facing the Irish economy and other European economies are inflation and unemployment.  These are the problems that have faced all European countries and some have been more successful than others in combating them.  The christening of this new Department will not enable it to solve these problems unless it is given the necessary teeth.  Unless it has two vital ingredients this Department will fail. It must have the powers to carry through its role and it must have the personnel and the Minister necessary to successfully achieve its objectives. I am absolutely sure that we have a Minister who is very capable of carrying out his role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="813" /> I hope the Minister will recruit people of the right calibre for his new Department.  The number of people in the Department of the Public Service with the necessary talents is very small.  I therefore urge the Minister to go outside the public service when he is recruiting staff for his new Department.  These outsiders should have the special talents necessary for economic planning and development.  The fresh ideas of these talented people would be of benefit to the public service. Through no fault of the public service radical ideas are lost before they reach the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that we must experiment with radical ideas if we are to combat high unemployment and inflation. At present economic planning rests entirely with the Department of Finance.  I suggest that the officials of the Department of Finance are not the proper people to set and oversee economic goals, as their main duty lies in ensuring that expenditure is carried out in accordance with normal budgetary policy.  I would compare this new Department with the corporate planning section of a large company monitoring the progress of other sections of the company.  The First Programme for Economic Expansion in the fifties was the basis for the growth enjoyed in the sixties.  The programmes for economic expansion were not strict plans but they did set in motion a great train of events and produced guidelines for the progress of the sixties.  I hope the Department of Economic Planning and Development will initiate plans for the eighties.</P>
    <P>The Devlin Report was published in 1969 and it suggested the setting up of separate planning units in each Department. We have made very little progress in that regard but I hope that these units will be established by the Department of Economic Planning and Development.  Even at that time, in 1969, it was recognised that it was not possible for Ministers to plan in a proper fashion and also be responsible for the daily running of their Departments. The Devlin Commission examined the public service between the years 1966 to 1969.  Since that time <Col N="814" /> the workload of Ministers has trebled because of economic growth and EEC commitments.  Because of the increased workload relating to the EEC our Ministers spend a lot of time out of the country and it would be impossible for any Minister, no matter how good, to implement a successful planning section within his Department.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (c) of the Bill provides for the Department to review and appraise the plans and activities of Departments of State giving effect to the policies for general economic and social development adopted by the Government.  It seems that planning has been left with the Department of the Public Service. The public service have never been great innovators and I am hoping that the new Department will be innovatory.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said he intends to appoint Ministers of State and I regard this as a very necessary step.  When the Opposition were in power they put forward a similar proposal but we heard nothing more about it.  I note that the Minister for Finance is now in a position to bring this important Bill before the House. The new Ministers of State should be in a position to look after the planning sections of the Departments.</P>
    <P>Social development cannot precede economic development and the lessons of the recent general election are proof of that.  It proved that people were willing to listen to a coherent plan even though certain social welfare benefits had been increased in the previous four years.  People want economic progress more than they want increased social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Bruton's speech and I was perturbed to hear him refer to the growth in public expenditure when he, as a junior member of the last Government, saw the national debt quadruple in four years.  I am amazed that he is only now beginning to worry about it.  As public expenditure has increased tremendously in recent years, I add my voice to that of Deputy Bruton in asking the Minister to consider seriously any plans for public expenditure.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that another layer <Col N="815" /> of bureaucracy will be established.  I consider the measures in this Bill as being designed to speed up policies and ideas and I look forward to a lessening of bureaucracy.  I do find that bureaucracy impedes economic development and I would ask the Minister for Economic Planning and Development to review certain aspects of the public service in order to find out whether they are impeding proper development.  The number of forms that has to be dealt with by small businessmen undoubtedly stifles development.  I would ask the Minister to consider it part of his responsibility to have regard to this aspect.</P>
    <P>Within the past week the NESC have reported on unemployment. One phrase in the report comes as a surprise.  I refer to Dr. Walsh giving as his reason for increasing the acceptable level of unemployment&mdash; one questions the concept of an &ldquo;acceptable level&rdquo;&mdash;to 5 per cent the fact that the high rate of unemployment in relation to net earnings is helping to keep down what he called the participation level.  If the State has contributed in any way to giving people the impression that it is not necessary for them to work, it will be the responsibility of the Minister in charge of the new Department to do everything possible to ensure that social progress is not achieved at the expense of economic progress and good sense.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, too, to consider the provision of a proper manpower policy, something about which we have heard very little for a number of years.  There is little point in training doctors, accountants or solicitors, for instance, if there will not be sufficient jobs for them while at the same time there are not sufficient people available who have the necessary technical skills.  There-fore, one of the tasks of the Minister will be to frame policies of a kind that will be to the general betterment of our society.  We must endeavour to provide a more coherent manpower policy.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the biggest problem facing <Col N="816" /> the Minister will be that of unemployment. The latest NESC report states that we must create between 23,000 and 28,000 new jobs per year up to 1986.  This target should be the main concern of this House during the next four or five years because whether, like myself, one is in his twenties or, like the Ceann Comhairle, in his later years, each of us must recognise that if in ten years' time we have not gone some way towards solving the unemployment problem our services as Deputies will no longer be required, that there will be no need for Dáil Éireann, because failure in this area would bring about a very different society structure from that of today. Young people will not tolerate a situation in which they cannot find employment.  That is why the Minister must be given every co-operation in tackling this problem.  I wish him well and trust that he will give us the necessary impetus with which to go forward into the eighties.  When he is replying I would like him to tell us what he considers to be his role in the new Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Economic Planning and Development (Professor O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the debate so far with a fair degree of interest but, I must confess, with a sense of disappointment also.  The Bill before the House is a measure to alter, reform, modernise&mdash;whichever term one prefersbut I see it as a measure to change by the introduction of a new Department the structure of government as we know it.  This is a substantial development in our pattern of government. It is not often that we amend the structure of Government Departments and their relationship to one another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances I would have expected the Opposition parties to indicate their views on the manner in which the structure of government should operate in the years ahead. However, that has not been the case. One of my reasons for waiting relatively far into the debate before speaking was to satisfy myself that the primary speakers for each of the Opposition parties be given an adequate opportunity to present their <Col N="817" /> views.  But the mere fact of my offering this criticism now might result in belated attempts on their part to rectify the omission.  If I succeed in flushing out some of their views, however hastily conceived they may be, so much the better.  At this stage, though, I should like to have it recorded that we have not heard any positive suggestion or proposal from either of the main Opposition parties as to how, if at all, they would wish to see reform executed in regard to the structure of government.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that point because I wish to draw attention also to the sorry history of the Coalition in this respect in the past four years.  One of my earliest involvements with the operation of government was in the early sixties when I was a &ldquo;certified intellectual&rdquo;, newly released from my &ldquo;ivory tower&rdquo; into the &ldquo;world of reality&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a quotation from the Minister's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting also the very considered remarks of Deputy O'Leary: At the time of which I am speaking I was assigned with three others to the Department of Education where for about two years we were engaged in drawing up plans for some of the modernisation and development of the education sector which have been moderately successful and which brought about a number of substantial changes in that area.  One of the proposals in our report then was the creation of a planning unit. That proposal was adopted by the Fianna Fáil Government of the day and the unit functioned quite well in subsequent years and until the advent of the Coalition who were responsible for killing the unit with the result that there is no planning unity in the Department of Education at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently in my experience with Government in the later sixties, part of the attempts to modernise the system in the field of capital appraisal and so on was the development of what were known as planning, programming and budgeting systems.  The experimental developments in that area were introduced also by a Fianna Fáil Government. <Col N="818" /> Up to the time of the change of Government in 1973 the experiment was being expanded and developed, but again the whole system was killed at some time during the tenure in office of the Coalition.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I would be permitted to digress here in order to refer to a comment made this morning by Deputy Pattison when he was speculating as to whether the proposed introduction of this Department was simply a post-election rush of enthusiasm to the head or that in some sense it represented frictions or strains within the Government.  I can set the Deputy's mind at rest.  The introduction of the Department has not stemmed from any hasty conception. That is why I am pointing in part to these historical factors.  If we look at the record we find that, in addition to the two items I have mentioned already, the present Minister for Finance introduced the first of these departmental developments by way of setting in motion the creation of the Public Service Department. That was in the later years of the last term of office of Fianna Fáil prior to the coming into power of the Coalition.  The formal record of the House will show that that Department was put on the Statute Books by the Coalition but I hope they are not going to pretend that they thought it up or had any ideas of their own on the subject.  If they had they were remarkably successful in concealing them from the House and the people. I will not go on cataloguing the way in which the whole process of modernising our structure of government was stifled and brought to an absolute standstill for the last four years.  I hope there is no need to do so.  A few examples should be sufficient to set the record straight.  I do not want to be dwelling on the past.</P>

      <P>All these references to history and to other countries such as Denmark, Britain and so on again illustrate the poverty of thought on the Opposition side of the House.  We would prefer to do our own innovating and set about modernising our own structures in our own way.  Deputy M. O'Leary, unwittingly I think, helped to illustrate that point. He was agonising and wondering about my appointment.  I was the only director of a think tank who had been graced with the title of a Government Minister in the whole of Western Europe.  Perhaps we should turn that around and say, &ldquo;Yes, we are willing to set about creating a modern structure of government in Ireland which we believe appropriate to Irish circumstances and we are willing to see it operate on its merits&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Nothing then that there are no positive proposals from the other side of the House, no views as to the direction in which the reforms if any shall come, I am simply documenting that the proposals before the House today are logically yet one more in a series of steps which have characterised Fianna Fáil's administration in the past and which will also characterise the present administration.  Having filled in the background in that sense surely it is relevant to ask what tasks, if any, should be undertaken by the new Department and what are the appropriate structures to discharge those tasks?  We have set out the more important tasks as we see them in the proposed functions for the Department. There has been very little debate or discussion on them.  The general tenor of the remarks or comments has been to imply that I will be some sort of a powerless memo-writer with some very subservient or inferior relationship to the Minister for Finance.  Indeed, I am even about to be run down by the Department of Finance at some future date.</P>

      <P>If we were to take seriously some of the suggestions offered, I hope without any careful thought, by Opposition speakers, they were trying to give me a power which no Minister has ever had and which I hope no Minister ever will have in democracy.  What were they asking?  That I would have powers over all other Government Departments, that I would have the right to veto expenditures, and not <Col N="821" /> only the power to do that for a short period but for periods up to five years.  Why do we not just appoint a dictator now and dispense with the rest of the trimmings?  Surely the whole concept of a democratic approach to these things is that Ministers as members of a Government should participate in a decision-making process.  What do you then do?  You seek to distribute the tasks or the work before Ministers in such a way that no-one is excessively burdened and no-one occupies or possesses an undue or unnecessary degree of influence in the subsequent decision structure.</P>
      <P>I will ignore all references to my role, or non-role as some people would see it, in these matters, but let me again digress for a moment to thank the many Deputies who offered their congratulations and wished me well for the future.  We are not here today debating my position in Government, in the Fianna Fáil Party or elsewhere.  We are talking about a proposed structure of government and the House should seek to lay down a structure which would be appropriate for any administration.  Surely that is the context in which we ought to consider the proposals before us.  It is for that reason that I would oppose any amendment which sought to confer on a Minister heading a Department of Economic Planning and Development powers of the kind suggested several times today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not wish to have powers to veto or regulate or direct expenditures of Departments.  What I do wish to have and what is proposed in the Bill is the involvement through my Department in analysing the various economic and social issues confronting the community at any one time, in identifying the policy options which are available for dealing with those issues, and then putting before the Government for decision specific plans or policy proposals to deal with those. I would also wish to see a Department have the necessary follow-up powers of that kind, namely, to review what has happened in the execution of Government decisions and to come back with any revised or updated proposals <Col N="822" /> to take account of change in circumstances.</P>
    <P>That surely is the kind of mechanism which enables a Department of the type proposed not to become too involved in the day-to-day activities of government.  It is important to draw the distinction between what one might term the fire-brigade approach and the think tank approach which Deputy O'Leary has already referred to in my regard. Under modern conditions we do need a Minister and a Department with that think tank capacity, with the ability to remain detached as far as possible from the immediate day-to-day pressures, from always rushing out after the immediate fire.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because they illustrate what I regard as the confusion of thought on the opposite side of the House.  Deputy O'Leary implies that because the Department of Finance has the executive responsibility on the expenditure side, this gives it some extraordinary or unique power of veto or dominant position in relation to the whole execution of Government policy.  I am saying that is not so, and should not be so.  There is certainly no statutory power of that kind.  What the Department of Finance does and should do is to make sure that moneys are spent on the various policies, plans and programmes which have been agreed in Cabinet.</P>

But certainly, as I see it, it is the Government who decide on the level of expenditures and it is the Government who also decide all the other major policy matters which come before them from whatever Department.</P>

      <P>In that case I would regard it as correct that when the proposed Department prepares any plans, when it carries out any policy evaluations for specific areas of activity&mdash;whether they happen to be at central Government level or whether they involve regional considerations or whatever&mdash;that all the basic decisions should be taken in the <Col N="824" /> Cabinet.  That is what government ought to be about.  I think the reason why this new Department should have very limited executive responsibilities is to avoid the danger of it being sucked into day-to-day executive matters which would ultimately impair its ability to carry out the more detached, longer-run assessment which is necessary under modern conditions. I do not intend to attempt to debate the reasons why that ability to carry out more comprehensive or longer-run policy formulation is needed under modern conditions because, so far at any rate, no one has appeared to challenge the need for it.  Therefore we can leave it aside, although I would have been quite willing to debate it had the issue arisen.</P>
      <P>I think that is essentially all we need deal with at the moment.  We are saying that there are these proposals to give powers to the new Department which could adopt a different perspective from the Department of Finance&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;which will then report to Cabinet&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;which will not get too much involved in the day-to-day executive activities of other Government Departments&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;and which will however seek to ensure that in the regular revision and updating of policies it works closely in harmony with other Government Departments.  Here I will anticipate just for a sentence or two a debate which presumably we will have at another time by saying that as part of the programme of public service re-form and development, it is the intention of the Government and the Minister for the Public Service to ensure that all Government Departments have an adequate planning capability, an adequate capacity for policy analysis and so forth, so that they can work in harmony with this new central Department of Economic Planning and Development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were quite a number of points raised by individual Deputies.  I am tempted to start dealing with them but I will resist the temptation to do so on this occasion.  However, there are one or two which I will not let go.  There was an inference from Deputy Pattison, I think&mdash;I am not sure, so <Col N="825" /> Deputies can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that because we were now coming forward with proposals to set up a Department with such powers, that implied that we had no plans or policies of our own to tackle the problems before the country in the immediate future.  That is not so, and again I can illustrate it by reference to some other remark that there was no reference in our manifesto to the creation of this new Department.  That is right.  In the manifesto for the election what we set out very clearly were the actions which we would take in the immediate period after the resumption of office, say, over the first 12 months or so.  Therefore there is no no need to debate or discuss those, but they give us a period within which to carry out the more substantial and the more far-reaching measures which will lay the basis for continued successful policy formation and planning in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>If we have this new Department operational by early next year, we then have sufficient time in which to be preparing more detailed plans and policies for the years 1978 onwards. In that conext statements have already been made on behalf of the Government by the Tánaiste, by myself and other Ministers that it is our intentention to publish at least an outline plan by the end of this year.  Let me assure the Deputy and the House that we do not have to wait until this legislation is passed to start finding out where we are going, what policies we want to pursue.  We have taken all the necessary short-term decisions.  We now wish to lay the appropriate basis for ensuring effective decision-making for the future, and that will be of benefit not only for a Fianna Fáil Government but for any Government that has the imagination and the capacity to use it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister and wishing him well in his position.  The Minister has been portrayed as a new luminary on the political horizon, and for that reason I was somewhat disappointed by the tone of his intervention in the debate.  Maybe <Col N="826" /> as a younger person I am a little naïve, but I found his initial contribution to be very narrowly political and to be little more than a repetition of the sin which he had accused other Deputies of committing earlier, by launching an assault on the honest endeavours of people to assess the merit of this proposed new Department and whether it is worth while.</P>
      <P>I have read the speech of the Minister for the Public Service carefully and I should like to comment on it. Firstly the speech and the proposals in it are very narrow, tending to epitomise all the nation's problems as being essentially economic, the emphasis being definitely on the economic side.  The position the Bill is designed to establish still appears to be very nebulous and very grey.  In the minds of most Deputies at this stage there is still some sort of an image of the economic Siamese twins of the Ministers for Finance and Economic Planning and Development and it is still hard to distinguish which is which.  Indeed I was mildly amused by the intervention of the Minister for Finance to protect his colleague on a point of order, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the heckling which I hope is not an augury for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an increasing danger, particularly in the wake of an international economic recession, of our portraying all the problems of the nation as being economic.  They are not essentially economic.  They are <Col N="827" /> essentially social with major economic overtones.  The emphasis which the Government are placing on the creation of this post as an effort to grasp what they see to be the national problem is to some extent misplaced. If we continue to see the nation's problems as being essentially economic there is a danger of our political institutions being forced to play a secondary role to what I would call international economic concern which is voiced and articulated usually by economic wizards in one shape or another, often merely for the interests of international commerce, putting it at its simplest, in the interests of international profit by individuals and organisations, not for the good of the community internationally, not for the good of international political institutions and the quality of life internationally.</P>
      <P>I would point to the increasing trend in education and political discussion to talk in terms only of economic issues.  Like everybody else in the House, I am concerned about the unemployment situation.  I hope the Government are successful in the creation of all the new jobs we have heard about.  Nevertheless, the issues are greater than that, and when we talk about the creation of a new Department it is vital that we get the initial formula right.  The creation of new jobs, alone and <i>per se</i>, is not the end of the matter: in some cases it is the beginning of a new problem because we must remember the quality of the jobs created and the quality of life of the whole community in the broadest sense.  We should veer away, and I would urge the Minister to do so, from the tendency to see things merely in terms of the economic problems they create.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Minister's introductory speech, which has been circulated, great emphasis has been laid on planning. I welcome that and encourage it but it worries me slightly because in the short experience I have had in the House, particularly during Question Times, one has seen a trend towards kicking to touch on all matters.  The answer to all questions seems to be : &ldquo;It is under review; my Department are looking at it and you will know <Col N="828" /> more about it in due course&rdquo;.  If we are to create another layer of overseeing bureaucracy, which may in itself be useful and have certain advantages, there is a danger that the rate of political solutions to social and economic problems will be slowed down to an even greater degree and that the answers which the Minister may be desirous to provide will be delayed rather than expedited.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly there will be a fusion of interests between the Departments of Finance and Economic Planning and Development.  The Minister for the Public Service spelled this out in his speech this morning when he said:</P>
    <P>Meanwhile it will be the responsibility of the Department to review and appraise the plans and activities of individual Departments in the light of overall national requirements. In undertaking this activity the Minister and the new Department will bear a heavy load in relation to consulting with and hearing the views of the various interests in relation to our economy. </P>
    <P>Again, it is the economy we are concerned about.  Presumably, the people who will be involved in these consultations will primarily be the articulate, the economically wealthy, the people who are highly organised, the people who have someone to speak up for them.  Those who are in the rearguard of our society, those who have not someone to speak up for them, those who are not articulate or organised into pressure groups will be overlooked in the rush to a bright new republic which presumably will be economically well for some people. I am worried that social concern appears to be lacking in the Government's approach to the creation of this new Department.  If I am not being fair I regret it, but I have read this document more than once and I do not see any emphasis on social matters as opposed to merely economic ones.</P>
    <P>Economics has no meaning unless it applies to and is about people. Although I welcome the new Department, I am afraid there will be problems in the identification of the parametres of the job.  There is to be <Col N="829" /> an overseeing role in relation to other Departments and in the long term this may have a divisive and unhelpful effect on the workings of good government, whether Fianna Fáil, the next Coalition or the next Fine Gael Government. The relationship between Ministers may also introduce new problems unless there is a very close liaison&mdash;the word in the speech is &ldquo;meshing&rdquo;&mdash;between the Departments of Finance and Economic Planning and Development.  I can foresee tensions which, in the short term I suppose I could take delight in and gloat over as being a crack in the Fianna Fáil edifice, but I do not take that delight because party politics are secondary to the national interest. Here we are creating an institution and we all know that once these institutions are created they are there for all time or nearly for all time.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said in his statement:</P>
    <P>I can therefore think of no more suitable organisational form for such a unit of administration than a Government Department.  In seeking statutory authority for the creation of this Department, Ireland will be pursuing an organisational course which has been followed successfully by many countries, like, for instance, Belgium, the Netherlands, West Germany and Sweden. </P>
    <P>I am not clear what the Minister meant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It means that you have more than one Ministry in the economic area in many countries.  I referred to the specific innovative role of this Department which will not be duplicated in other west European countries.  I may not have been very precise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>My impression is that this new post will be exceedingly difficult for the new Minister, whom I see as a sort of super-economic gadfly whose job it will be to pounce on the various Departments to see that they are doing their sums and their projections accurately.  I would imagine it to be an instant recipe for early <Col N="830" /> frustration and possibly early retirement, although I would not wish that for the Minister.  At the same time, one must welcome the idea of economic planning in itself and possibly any measure introduced to cope with the problem would not satisfy everybody.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that planning is essential and it is fair to say that not enough attention has been paid to it in the past.  I would stress that I am personally worried about a situation where in education there is an increasing tendency to try to produce technocrats, where the momentum in job training is on trying to create satisfactory entrants for industry.  We appear to be seeing the major social problems as being merely economic. They are much deeper and much broader than that and I would hope the Minister would accept the sincerity of my concern for that area.  It is not easy to try to identify the problems but there is certainly an increasing worry about the relevance of our political institutions but the tendency towards creating what is essentially a kind of economic oligarchy with power vested in the hands of the very few will further disillusion people who seek to have credence in our political institutions and in their elected representatives.  This Department there-fore, if it is to be successful and if it is to concern itself with economic planning, must be permeated by a social concern, imbued with the idea of planning for people and about people and the question of wealth in the hands of the few should be secondary to what can be summed up as a Christian concern.  Maybe it was just a few words in this document&mdash;they may conceal more than they reveal&mdash;but I did not get that Christian or social concern in the paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From listening to and watching the Minister, even prior to his assuming office, I have no doubt that he is concerned about the quality of life and the environment of our people and I would, therefore, like to think that the planning we talk about will not be merely economic planning in the narrow sense of what we know about the manipulation of the economy, essentially a question of money, but <Col N="831" /> that will be a much broader area involving people's day-to-day living and the concerns they share and planning in the long term for the satisfaction and fulfilment of the natural aspirations of people and the fulfilment of their every day desires which in many cases can be far removed from the relatively narrow economic sphere.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish the Minister again every success in his role and I thank him for the courtesy with which he has listened to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few brief comments.  First of all, I congratulate the Minister on his appointment to what I consider to be a very responsible ministry.  We welcome the Bill but we have some very serious reservations.  We are not quite sure there is enough in the Bill to go ahead and do what I firmly believe is necessary.  The Minister's task is a most important one.  Irrespective of what Government may be in office the biggest task we face is the solution of our massive unemployment problem.  I shudder to think of what may happen if we do not do something effective to reduce dramatically our unemployment figures.  In co-operation with other Departments of State and State agencies of all kinds the Minister will have to plan for the creation of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs per year.  That is what is required now. The task is a massive one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The solution to unemployment is something we have never achieved. That is one of the reasons why I welcome the appointment of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development. It is in this new Department decisions will have to be taken, crucial decisions designed to solve our unemployment problem and provide the essential employment which will enable us to survive as a nation.  The Minister said there has not been very much planning coming from others. The Labour Party have for years advocated planning.  We advocated a development corporation, a board which would have power to go ahead and start new industries, if necessary. Radical thinking will have to be implemented <Col N="832" /> if we are to achieve what must be achieved to stave off disaster. The number of jobs available will have to be doubled in the next decade.  The Minister is faced with a gigantic task. The problem will not be solved by turning over a page or clicking a switch.  We, as a people, apart from party politics or anything else will have to achieve the kind of employment we need and a great proportion of that employment will have to be provided in the next four or five years. The Minister will be there for that period.  I am practical enough to admit that.</P>
    <P>The problem of unemployment has not been with us for just the last three or four years.  It has been there for the last 20 or 30 years.  It was there when I was a small boy.  We were exporting 70,000, 80,000 and 90,000 of our people annually.  It is not a new phenomenon.  The problem was never tackled properly by any Government. Our unemployment has been at an entirely unacceptable level all down through the years.  Even though there was massive emigration we still did not produce enough jobs.  Radical policies are now essential.  Private enterprise is imbued with the profit motive.  I do not blame private enterprise for that.  I am in a small business myself and any man in business is in it for profit.</P>
    <P>The Government established the ESB, the Sugar Company, Bord na Móna and so on.  These have been successful.  Perhaps they did not achieve all we hoped they would achieve but private enterprise has certainly failed our society in general in not producing enough jobs for our people.  It is our duty as legislators to produce those jobs and to guide the economy in such a way that we will have the jobs particularly for the young people but also for the older people. There is great waste when we have large scale unemployment.  I suppose this matter should arise on another issue but I can say sincerely as an Irishman that I believe this is the kernel of the whole operation; we can do all the other things if we can provide employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" /> I hope the Minister will be successful in doing that.  It is a great task and I wish him success.  I hope the creation of this Ministry will help in that direction and if it does I shall be satisfied. I have some doubts that the Minister has the kind of radical powers necessary to do this job but I am prepared to accept the situation and wait and see.  I believe that the National Development Corporation proposed by us in the Labour Party policy document was the right approach.  What-ever may be said about the National Coalition we succeeded in having that as part of our election programme.  We believe it is the proper approach. Private enterprise has failed to do the great job that is necessary but which is not easy to do.  If we do not do it, the consequences for our nation and our people will be bitter and far-reaching.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say that idle people will naturally drift into vandalism and that people who are unemployed feel they are outcasts from society.  From a social point of view it is bad for people to be unemployed.  After a while in many cases they become unemployable. I could mention several areas where, if there was some State organisation to invest money, as in food processing, we could produce many new jobs but private enterprise is either not capable or not willing to do this because they are not sure of their profits in that area.  Naturally, an industrialist wants to make a profit in the short term and in the long term.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recognition by the Government that there is a grave necessity for economic planning.  I am glad they have appointed a Minister specifically charged with this work and with the co-ordination of all other areas of Government.  Let him get on with the job.  If I feel that he is doing the job well I shall support him.  I shall try to help and to point out where different schemes could be organised that I believe would meet the need that exists.</P>
    <P>With the creation of employment we must include the social content of our policy and our social concern for the poor and less well off.  Anything we do to create employment must include provision for social justice. <Col N="834" /> Many of the things I have mentioned were deliberately included in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto.  I hope they will be implemented.  As I have the honour to be spokesman on agriculture for my party I give the example that the manifesto said that everything must be processed.  That will have a far-reaching effect.  I hope the Minister for Agriculture with the Minister for Economic Planning and Development will stand by that statement and that we will engage in processing and not send out our produce to other countries for processing leaving the offal also to them.</P>
    <P>I say in good faith to the new Minister: there is a great task to be undertaken.  I do not believe private enterprise is prepared to do what is necessary.  I ask the Minister to take a good look at the Labour Party policy of having a development corporation within a State framework which we believe would produce the results that are necessary to save our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is significant in more than one way.  I should like to point out one very significant fact in this area generally; it is that most development since the war in organisation and administration has come about through the direct action of Government initiating action through Government Departments. The theory at least was that Governments and Ministers initiated policies and the Departments involved produced the necessary legislation and schemes to implement these policies. Very largely, however, in the past because of the increasing complexity of society and economics and so on, I rather fear the tendency became one for the initiative to slip out of the hands of Ministers into the administrative machine and many of the proposals for development were logical projections of that administrative machine.  That gave continuity but very often it did not give originality and it certainly did not react with sufficient speed to changing circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact remains that much of the organisational development of the State, the introduction of new Ministries <Col N="835" /> and so on, had that kind of origin.  The latest example of that kind of procedure that I can quote will refer to one of the three persons within the Tánaiste.  He is Tánaiste; he is Minister for Finance and Minister for the Public Service, all of which functions have become more differentiated and separated as time has gone on.  The bisection of the Minister for Finance into the part remaining Finance and the other part becoming Public Service was a natural administrative development.  Backed up by administrative investigation and report and now in implementation it is likely to throw up a number of problems which such a bisection naturally brings about.  All that was extremely natural and in practice unavoidable as time flowed but, as I said, it has some drawbacks.</P>
    <P>This Bill is in strong contrast to that way of thinking.  Here we have the result of a definite political lead by a political party, a political lead in the political field designed to meet a political need.  While in Opposition, the Taoiseach's party had the various problems examined.  Already some Deputies have referred to the programme laid before the electorate in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto, the programme on which the election was fought by this party.  One part of that programme, both as a matter of policy and as a matter of implementing policy, was the proposal to have an organ of this nature.</P>
    <P>This Bill, therefore, represents something comparatively rare in modern democracy, again because of the complexities of the administrative machine and the complexities of economics, and so forth.  It represents direct political action, democratic action, to meet a need.  It is action suited to the policy and the programme of the Government and for that reason alone, it shows the possibility of making democracy effective and of restoring balances which had become somewhat distorted, shall I say, by the complexities of modern officialdom. When I use that word I am not referring to the civil service.  I am referring to all the organisations <Col N="836" /> necessary for the running of the State. That is just an opening comment on the genesis of this Bill, but it is significant.</P>
    <P>There have been criticisms about the contents of the Bill, the role of the Minister and the role of the Department in relation to other Departments, particularly the Department of Finance.  Having made the point that the bringing in of this Bill by the Minister, in the circumstances and with its background, is an assertion of the power of democracy, it is no harm to see the proposal in its historical perspective.  I am tempted to do this because of some of the remarks made about the relationship of the Department of Finance to this Department when it is set up, and also the remarks made suggesting that some kind of a dictatorship is being set up.  Those remarks can best be answered by looking at the proposals against the background of how the State machine grew up in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Naturally I do not intend to review the whole development of the State organisations from the beginning, but I think I can summarise it in this way. When the State was set up, in the light of responsibilities conceived to be appropriate to Governments at that time, a political and governmental structure was set up in which we had the national Parliament.  That national Parliament elected, for its life in effect, a Government who were the executive power in the land and who governed. In those days the paramount interests were law and order, relations with external matters, taxation and so forth. With these requirements to be met, a limited number of Ministries were established, the executive Ministries, many of them spending Ministries.  Of course, there was the Ministry of Finance which controlled the purse and, overall, there was the principle of collective responsibility.  The co-ordinating agency was the head of the Government and the Cabinet, the Cabinet as a whole being vested with collective responsibility.  Around the Cabinet table it was possible in those days, with the limited burden then existing, to co-ordinate policies and to have concerted action on the part of <Col N="837" /> the Government in the years leading up to a convenient watershed from the point of view of this debate, the war emergency years, 1939 to 1945.</P>
    <P>During that period, collective responsibility was very proximate because every Minister in the Cabinet could have a fairly good grasp of anything his colleagues brought to the Cabinet table.  On the other hand, there was the control of the Department of Finance.  At this stage I want to point out one thing about the Department of Finance.  The control of the Department of Finance was largely negative and, somewhat on the pattern of the British Treasury, it continued in that restrictive watchdog control. It was a very necessary control but before the war, and the history of the Department of Defence will illustrate this amply, that control went very far and it was left to Ministers in their collective capacity as a Government to decide what to allow.  The problems were restricted enough for that to be a real possibility, every Minister having sufficient grasp of the situation.  Even with that the Department of Finance, exercising negative control on expenditure, had as their function to spend as little as possible, to see that there was no waste, extravagance or misappropriation of public funds.  All very proper: I do not intend to denigrate the Department in any way.</P>
    <P>The important thing for the purpose of this debate is that the traditional control of the Department of Finance in this regard quickly became stereotyped as a negative control, one which at the Estimate stage would pare down, and, in effect, disallow proposed expenditure by Departments. Its continuing control was ensured by the requirement that financial sanction for almost every expenditure not agreed to beforehand be sought.  This worked well although approaching the war years it tended to be too restrictive. During the war years in the Supply and Defence fields this bottleneck was revealed and in the emergency situation there had to be some overriding of precedent.  After the war the Department of Finance properly resumed and re-established itself in its proper role as a kind of overlord, from <Col N="838" /> the control point of view, of the Departments. As happens after all such cataclysms, after the war a lot of new situations arose for governments.  First, governments became concerned and actively engaged in things that were not regarded as proper areas for detailed government control, economically and socially.  Governments had to move into certain areas such as housing because they were urgent. Government Departments had to grow accordingly to deal with the burdens growing on Ministers.  Furthermore, as the burdens became heavier and as the different areas of responsibility became clearly segregated and defined, more Ministeries became necessary.  We had then a multiplication of Ministries with an increase in the size of the administrative machine but we were still left with the old essential control mechanism of the Department of Finance and the Cabinet in its collective responsibility.</P>
    <P>It does not take too much imagination to realise that very quickly in a situation such as that it became an impossibility for Ministers, other than the Minister or Ministers directly concerned, to be able to give independent judgments on many matters discussed at Cabinet level.  It was often the case of Cabinet colleagues telling a Minister who was pressing a particular line that they were in agreement with him because they were not in a position to argue about the project or vetoing it on the grounds of finance or expenditure.  There was little choice open to them.  That is not intended as a criticism of leaders of any Government or of Ministers; it was simply that the burden became too much for the individual mind.  Naturally in that situation every Minister had to fall back on his own Department to study projects.  Effectively one then got government by the administrative machine. I am not saying that the Ministers were reduced to being ciphers but every Minister became so dependent on his Department that in the end many decisions of importance were the result of automatic action in large part rather than critical decision.</P>
    <P>Of course I accept that the Minister who initiated the proposal was <Col N="839" /> fully versed with what he was bringing forward and, presumably, his Department would implement the policy he laid down.  However, the overall effect, when it came to the exercise of the collective responsibility of the Cabinet, was as I suggested and that was nobody's fault.  Various efforts were made to mend that and considerable thought was given to the problem but no original solutions were offered.  The last Government set up the Department of Public Service and I have no doubt that my party in Government would have been thinking along the same lines.</P>
    <P>The relevance of what I have said to the debate is that while that process was going on we still had the control of the Department of Finance which I have characterised as negative.  Even the Department of Finance, with the burden cast upon it by the expanding situation, were forced to delegate general sanction and very often in itself this tended to defeat control.  That control, with an honourable history, maybe with overweight in the past, is there and it is necessary that it should remain there but what is needed also is a positive control to balance the negative control of the Department of Finance.  That is what this proposal does.  It gives the Government of the day a positive control complementary and in no way antagonistic to the control of the Department of Finance. Between the activities of this Department and this Minister and the activities of the Department of Finance and the Minister responsible, both Departments being supervisory Departments rather than executive Departments, the positive control that the new Department can offer will restore to the Cabinet table the power to exercise collective responsibility effectively.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong in this concept but approaching this Bill from an historical point of view, I see this proposal as a very significant contribution to making collective responsibility of a Cabinet effective, politically, economically and socially.  In other words it is a step restoring to Government the direct control and power governments <Col N="840" /> once had but that practically all democratic governments lost to some extent in the social and economic developments of our time since the last war.  To say that is enough to commend it.</P>
    <P>There will be co-ordination problems between the three Departments, Public Service, Finance and Economic Planning and Development but these will be at a level that will be easily co-ordinated at the Cabinet table and in a routine way by the head of the Government whereas the co-ordination of the multifarious Ministeries with their sub-divisions, as far as I can see, perhaps is not beyond the control of the Taoiseach and the Government at present, but still it is less in the power of Taoiseach and Governments than it will be in future if this measure is made effective.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of repeating everything the Minister said when introducing this Bill.  My point is that this Bill is significant because it is the fruit of genuine political initiative by one of the political organs of the State&mdash;if you regard political parties as political organs&mdash;in contrast to the administrative way many other developments came about.  It is a control element complementary to existing control.</P>
    <P>The last point, which I need not labour but which has been the subject of most of today's debate, is one which fills a void from the point of view of integrating the economic activity of the community at present.  These points in themselves are sufficient to commend the Bill.  When one finds in addition to these points that the person who is to assume this office has made a deep study of and been actively involved in the political initiative that brought about this proposal, and furthermore when it is the fruit of the labours of experienced leaders, experienced in Government with the full realisation of the machinery and responsibilities of Government, then these facts augur well for the future of this institution and at least are reassuring when one examines the contents and genesis of the proposal.</P>
    <P>One speaker emphasised the social aspect and Deputy Bermingham was <Col N="841" /> very eloquent on the vital social question of the provision of employment. It is elementary to say that you cannot separate the economic from the social or <i>vice versa</i>.  No matter what system of Government or political philosophy you espouse, it has been amply demonstrated here and in other countries that although your heart may be in the right place, if you do not have regard for the economic realities, everything you do with the best social intentions seems to work out wrong.</P>
    <P>One of the criticisms of the Coalition Government might well be this: in their emphasis on social desirability and social aims they had not sufficient regard for the compulsion of economic realities and as a result the community which they hoped would benefit socially by their actions, were the very people to suffer.  That stemmed from the fact that there was a failure to understand the realities of life.  Whether we like them or not they are there. If they were not, there would not be problems.</P>
    <P>The problems are not altogether economic; there are social problems too.  You can bring a horse to water but often, unfortunately, you cannot make him drink and likewise in economic planning, the provision of opportunity, the organisation of economic activity, may all be nullified by a human factor if the necessary co-operation of the community and the interested elements, individual or collective, is not forthcoming.  This is a social problem.  The two cannot be separated but that does not mean that one throws one's hat at it.  A Department like this will clearly identify the problems and will raise the issues in tractable form, and there will be an opportunity for political leads from the Opposition, the Government and anyone else in the community interested in getting concerted action towards the desired end.  Collective action can be taken under war conditions as was shown between 1939 and 1945.  In times of prosperity it seems impossible to get co-operation.  The worse matters become the more likely is co-operation. That is a sad thought.  I hope that thought has been brought home sufficiently to people, so that in future <Col N="842" /> the maximum degree of co-operation will be available to make rational economic plans tie in with social requirements. The emphasis placed on the social aspect appeared to be placed in a way that suggested that economic and social matters were not complementary but conflicting.</P>
    <P>I join with those who have congratulated Deputy O'Donoghue on his appointment to this Ministry, knowing that he will undertake his responsibilities and will provide a much needed link within the Cabinet Chamber.  Before his appointment, the Minister was very much involved in the formation of the plan in conjunction with the Taoiseach and the Ministers.  When this Bill becomes law it will be immediately effective.  The real problem was how to make the collective responsibility of Governments effective and how to co-ordinate the various Ministries into one coherent group. This need was only too evident in recent times in democratic governments. The circumstances under which this Bill will become effective guarantee us a good start.  Provided general social co-operation can be obtained in relation to the implementation of the co-ordinated policies that will emerge in the programme of this Government we can look forward to an improvement in our standard of living, in the social structure and in the economy. No Government can succeed in this unless there is a basic consensus.  There will be differences of policy, but I hope the Opposition with their experience in Government, will emulate their predecessors in Opposition, in getting down to details of policy rather than <i>ad hoc</i> criticism as the spirit moves and the opportunity offers.  If that comes about, this Parliament will become an effective instrument behind an effective Government, and when the time comes to change Government the impetus could continue.</P>
    <P>We received co-operation in emergencies before and that co-operation is required for the future.  There must be constructive analysis of policies.  In addition to its primary role, as I have conceived it, and as the Minister has outlined, this Department could also be an agency to enable every Member <Col N="843" /> of the House to be part of an effective Parliament and not of a type of institution that we sometimes appeared to be, particularly where financial matters were concerned in previous years.  In other Dáils I referred specifically to these matters.  This Department's activities will enable the Ministers and other Members of the House to see that Parliament is effective in backing the Government of the day to serve the people as a Government should.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  It is vital that a further base be provided for our economic and social development. Since the twenties many structures have been relied on to provide a strengthened economy.  I doubt if the structures provided have given the service which we needed over the years.  There are many inequalities which must be eliminated and these areas must be identified now.  I am not pessimistic about the role of the Minister in this regard.  I hope he gets the necessary teeth and finance to implement the strategies he will be adopting in the future and I trust he will have the co-operation of the Cabinet in that regard.  If in the future, we have changes of Government I hope that each succeeding one will have the co-operation of the trade unions, employers and all interested groups on whom will rest the responsibility of co-operating in a manner which will bring about an improvement in our economy.  Other European countries have succeeded in having a similar type of structure or organisation responsible for overall planning. For example, West Germany, Belgium and Sweden have succeeded in this respect.  Their economies have improved because of their additional structures for co-ordinated planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Department is fully organised I hope the Minister will examine first the least-developed areas, those which have not shared in the economic development that has filtered into others.  For example, who could be satisfied with the situation in the west at present where once heavily populated, congested areas have changed dramatically?  Who could <Col N="844" /> maintain that there has been economic growth channelled into those areas? The last census indicates quite clearly that there has been a mass depopulation and a huge amount of emigration from those areas due entirely to the fact that the policies pursued by successive Governments have not filtered into them, retained people in employment there or given them the standard of living enjoyed by those in better developed areas.  This new Department should do something to improve the lot of those people who reside, or intend to reside, in those areas who, to date, have not shared in industrial development or in the ownership of fertile land.  This Department might give some indication of the areas where such growth should now take place, be it industrial, agricultural, in the area of fisheries or any other.  But a rapid decision must be made now rather than awaiting recommendations of commissions and so on which take a considerable time and which, even when presented to the Government, may not be implemented for some time.  We must eliminate this wastage of time.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill, hopefully, means that the Government are making a further effort seriously to tackle urgent problems in appropriate areas.  I am completely disillusioned, dissatisfied and frustrated at achievements to date of certain State bodies set up with the object of improving the lot of our people in the west. Despite the fact that the Litchfield. Buchanan and other reports advanced suggestions they failed to achieve economic development when one takes not of the mass emigration which has taken place in these areas. This Department affords adequate scope to lay the foundations of a national economic and social development plan capable of being achieved within a reasonable length of time. It was not that we had not structures on which we could have built in the past but they have not produced the required results within a reasonable period of time.</P>
    <P>I look upon this new Department as a structure within which there is hope, within which we can all work <Col N="845" /> in identifying the problems of our own counties.  I hope the Minister&mdash; who has already visited some of the areas to which I have referred&mdash;will treat them as top priority.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the manner in which the Government and the Minister for Fisheries have conducted national fishery affairs, with particular reference to the defence of the Irish unilateral conservation measures applied by Orders of the Minister for Fisheries, and calls on the Government to give an assurance that it will maintain the firm stance of the National Coalition Government by refusing its consent to any bilateral agreements exchanging Community fishery rights on a reciprocal basis with third countries until and unless agreement is reached within the Community on a fisheries regime that includes an exclusive Irish coastal band of up to 50 miles. </P>
    <P Just="Right">(Deputy Deasy.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I stressed the need for an exclusive 50-mile zone. I adverted to the need for other important facilities in order to improve and preserve this industry, such as better landing facilities for fishermen, improved, modernised ice plants, fish plants, adequate and well-equipped trawlers capable of competing with the large ships of the EEC.  I referred also to the need for a proper and enlightened conservation programme. I also stressed the need for a proper scheme of insurance for workers on our trawlers.  The Minister indicated some semblance of support for that suggestion on which I trust he will act quickly, that is, an insurance and pension scheme for fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also expressed the hope that the Minister and the Government would see the feasibility and wisdom of insisting, in so far as was possible, that all fish caught within the 50- to 200-mile zone would be processed here. <Col N="846" /> Such would provide very valuable, much needed employment, moreover ensuring proper monitoring of fish catches with particular reference to the size and type of fish caught.  These are some of the suggestions I make in order to further the interests of the industry and to bring back some semblance of security to those engaged in it.</P>
    <P>Yesterday by way of parliamentary question I asked the Minister what steps he proposed to take to secure a 50-mile exclusive fishing limit around our coast and I asked for a statement on the matter.  The typed statement the Minister deemed fit to make comprised three-and-a-half lines.  It stated:</P>
    <P>At EEC Council meetings and in bilateral discussions which I have had with the Fisheries Ministers from a number of member states I have pressed for an exclusive coastal zone of up to 50 miles for Irish fishermen and will continue to do so in future negotiations. </P>
    <P>From any standpoint this reply was manifestly weak and unsatisfactory. It was weak in that there was a marked absence of commitment and determination to pursue this aim.  If one is to judge from the stand taken by the EEC Commissioner, Mr. Gundelach, who spoke here last week one can but conclude that up to now the Minister's pressure has been an abject failure.  Certainly it made no impression on Mr. Gundelach who made it patently clear that so far as he is concerned the 50-mile exclusive zone for Ireland is simply not on.</P>
    <P>The most worrying aspect is that there was not even a whimper of protest from the Minister or the Government in respect of Mr. Gundelach's statement.  If the Minister genuinely wanted to push our claim, why did he not avail of that unique opportunity of repudiating Mr. Gundelach's statement, asserting in a forthright way our claim to the 50-mile limit?  One cannot be blamed for concluding that silence in the situation is acquiescence to the dictates of Mr. Gundelach and the EEC.</P>
    <P>Last night I quoted from speeches <Col N="847" /> made by Fianna Fáil members when they were in Opposition&mdash;many of them are now Ministers.  I wish to put on the record of this House for the information of the country generally the stance of Fianna Fáil in Opposition, as set out in the statement in their general election manifesto.  The manifesto in respect of fisheries states:</P>
    <P>The Irish fishing industry has traditionally been a coastal activity and, accordingly, Fianna Fáil firmly believe that to protect the livelihood of our fishermen a 50-mile offshore limitation on foreign trawlers and factory ships is of urgent necessity. </P>
    <P>All Ireland is waiting for the fulfilment of that promise.  Let us see the Government retrieve the situation, let us see them retrieve their credibility, their honour and integrity.  Doubtless so far as the Minister for Fisheries is concerned with regard to all these things they will prove to be no problem. We shall see.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have preferred to intervene after the Minister had spoken but I realised during the debate the ploy he is using.  A new Fianna Fáil Deputy was put in to take up time, thereby ensuring that the Minister would get into the debate as late as possible.  Therefore, I am forced into the situation of discussing matters which the Minister discussed outside the House, thus leaving it open to him to withdraw or to change his stance on the matters discussed.</P>
      <P>We had left him in the position where the previous Government's stance was to adopt a unilateral decision to exclude all boats of 33 metres or 110 h.p. from the Irish box as it was known.  When the court in Luxembourg had given an indication that the measure which we had introduced was against the rules of the EEC the Minister described the measure as crude and discriminatory and he removed it.  He went to Brussels with one hand as long as the other, without a bargaining ploy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that the previous Government had this unilateral measure as a bargaining counter.  There are many things it could have been exchanged <Col N="848" /> for.  It could have been exchanged for the number of boats in the Irish box at any given time; for names of boats that would be permitted at a particular time to be within the Irish box; for the types of fishing gear that would be allowed and those that would be prohibited.  All of these conditions could have been backed up by a quota system.  The attitude of the former Government was that they did not believe in quotas alone.  On five occasions in a period of seven hours I had to remind the Council of Ministers in Luxembourg that we were not accepting a system based on quotas alone.</P>
    <P>I understand that of the nine countries concerned Ireland has the best central statistics procedure.  The director of our Central Statistic Office can sign a statistic and if the Taoiseach of the day does not like it he can lump it.  A previous director of the Central Statistics Office was very proud and vehement in stating that this was the case.  There was no such situation in France or in Holland; there is something similar in existence in Britatin but it is not quite as black and white as in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows that the fishing industry and the processing industry in France are family undertakings.  All along the coasts of Normandy and Brittany cargoes of fish are brought in, are processed in small family units and are sold to the French public. Nobody seriously thinks that a French skipper who is nearing the end of his quota will not say to the factory owner in Brittany or Normandy&mdash; probably his brother-in-law or a relative&mdash;not to record the catch because he wishes to fish the following week. That is why the previous Government would not act on quotas alone.  That is why we invited the other eight countries to submit their plans in respect of the fishing industry.  We received some plans and were in the process of examining them when the election took place.  The Minister should have kept our unilateral measure; he should have gone to Brussels and used it as a bargaining counter if he wanted to change it.  Instead of that he went to Brussels with one hand as long as the other and with no weapon at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="849" /> It is not usual for an incoming Minister to describe actions of his predecessor as crude.  Usually there is a honeymoon period, when incoming Ministers are easy on their predecessors. The reference by the Minister on this occasion was not correct.  There is a direct relationship between the size of boat and the h.p.  The damage was being caused by the larger boats that could carry engines with a greater h.p.  Factors such as beam trawling and so on came into the picture also.</P>
    <P>We were ready with our unilateral measure to invite the other countries to submit fishing plans, to see what they could put forward as alternatives. However, the incoming Minister did not give Ireland that opportunity and that has left us in the sorry state we are in today.  I do not know what the Minister will have on his return from Brussels but I am sure that whatever he obtains he could have got more if he had kept the unilateral measure.</P>
    <P>It has been said that this measure was discriminatory because there were only two boats affected in Ireland.  That is so but you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs.  The boats that were doing the damage were affected by the measure.  I am glad to see that what I have described as the &ldquo;Kilmuckridge Herring Family&rdquo; have been allowed to drift net for herring.  It was an odd thing that I should stop herring fishing with one hand and on the other appeal to the Community to do their herring fishing with skiffs.  That happened at the time of the change of Government.  I am glad we were involved in that happy result.</P>
    <P>The Minister, if he has thrown aside our unilateral measure completely, must look for a 100-mile band in the case of third countries and a 50-mile band in the case of EEC countries. Any boat fishing there should be licensed by us.  They should be identified by name and number.  We should have complete command of anything the Minister gives as a bargaining ploy in Brussels when he has to go there and make his case for Ireland.  What has been offered is not sufficient.  This side of the House stand by a 50-mile band.  Our seas have been denuded, probably more by third countries than <Col N="850" /> by the eight EEC countries, except Holland.  Their harvest of fish is likely to increase year by year in the future. It was mentioned in the debate yesterday that there is evidence of such occuring in the case of cod.  I wish the Minister well.  I will back him in his efforts to get anything from the Common Market.  We should adhere to the policy of the previous Government, that is a 50-mile band exclusive to Irish fishermen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have debated fisheries on numerous occasions during the past 15 months. The House has changed now because the people who are on the other side were over here and the people on this side of the House were over there.  It is no harm to recall some of the things that were said during the past few years.  We had debates on fisheries on no less than four occasions when we had spirited statements from Opposition Deputies who are now members of the Government.  Some of those statements were quoted by Deputies Deasy and Treacy during this debate.  I have never made a habit of bringing in Dáil volumes of past debates and quoting from them.  It is unnecessary for me to do this now because I can recall very forcibly what was said on several occasions.</P>
      <P>The present Minister for Foreign Affairs, when he was on this side of the House, had no illusions about what could be got for the fishing industry, a 50-mile exclusive band.  He was not worried about the court in Luxembourg. He made it quite clear that we could not renegotiate our fisheries policy and that we could get this band if the Government were capable of negotiating properly and capable of putting our case as it should be put in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will mention you next.  You, Sir, were then deputy leader of Fianna Fáil.  Your statements were most decisive on the occasions you spoke about this matter in the House.  Your remarks are recorded in the Official Report.  You told the House there was no question of getting anything except a 50-mile exclusive limit.  You derided any mention of quotas or of any boats <Col N="851" /> coming in within that limit.  You said that an exclusive 50-mile band should be the property of the Irish nation alone and of the Irish fishermen.  I am sure during your long period in the House you are fully conversant with procedures and also with procedures in the European Economic Community. I must accept that you did not make those statements lightly and that at the time you believed that this could be achieved.</P>
    <P>We now come along to the present Minister for Health.  He contributed to all the debates.  His stand was similar to yours.  He made it quite clear to the Government that we should not accept anything less than a 50-mile exclusive band.  He said that all other members of the Community should be kept outside that band and that we should not mind the third countries.  He, like the then Deputy O'Kennedy, quoted from international lawbooks and indicated that this could be achieved.  He said we were entitled to do so legally and that there were no difficulties in achieving this objective if we had the capacity to do it.</P>
    <P>Members of the present Government made it quite clear then that if they were in our position they would have no trouble in achieving this 50-mile exclusive band.  Another Deputy who was particularly vocal, and whose remarks have been quoted, is the present Minister for Defence.  He had no doubt about our entitlement to the 50-mile band nor about accepting anything less.  My stand today is that we should look for a 50-mile exclusive band.  I disagree with the statements made, even by Deputy Deasy, that we should allow any boats inside that band.  That is the view of the Labour Party.  It was my view as far back as 1970.  I know what happened.  In our negotiations to get into the Common Market some Members of the House were passing each other out in their hurry to get us to be members of the European Economic Community and, unfortunately, fisheries were completely forgotten. We were to get so many benefits from other activities that we would not allow the fisheries problem, which the <Col N="852" /> then Government regarded as a very minor industry, to come between us and membership of the European Economic Community.  We all know that at that time there was a common fisheries policy among the six existing members which laid down right of access to all shores of the Community waters.  That was overlooked by our negotiating team at the time and that is why we are suffering now, particularly those who engage in fishing for their livelihood.  It is because of the deliberate neglect in negotiating our entry to the Community we are in this position.</P>
    <P>As a result of what was said about the advantages of the Community, 83 per cent of the people in 1972 approved of our entry.  We in the Labour Party were anxious that a number of matters should be discussed and we felt that the negotiations had been carried out in a hurried fashion. Of course, we had fisheries in mind and everybody knew that this aspect had been completely forgotten.  We must look at the background to the difficulties which confront us now.</P>
    <P>We are a small, island country, the total population of the whole island being something less than four-and-a-half million.  We are independently entitled to fishing rights all around our coast.  Other countries have limits of up to 200 miles without any difficulty. Coming up to the election in June Fianna Fáil made it abundantly clear that if they were returned to office they would give to the Irish fishermen a 50-mile exclusive band.  There was no mention of letting inside that band any boats, big or small, from other EEC countries.  I have no doubt that the majority of fishermen accepted that assurance and contributed to the Fianna Fáil victory.</P>

      <P>It is stated in the preface to the Fianna Fáil manifesto that Fianna Fáil firmly believe that to protect the livelihood of our fishermen a 50-mile offshore limitation on foreign trawlers and factory ships is of urgent necessity.  That is very simple.  It indicates what Fianna Fáil promised to the fishing industry. It supports the statements made here by Deputies who are now Ministers. These statements received a great deal of publicity and naturally fishermen felt that it would be an advantage to have a 50-mile exclusive limit.</P>
      <P>Personally, I was never in favour of quotas.  Deputy Donegan mentioned what happens when quotas are involved and the difficulty in checking on them.  It is impossible.  It would be better to have a completely exclusive band, no other country having the right to fish within it.  I stress this point to the Minister.  I wish him well in his job and I believe he is as capable as any other member of his party of negotiating in Europe for our fishing industry.  However, if he is to preserve his own credibility and that of his party he must bear in mind the assurances given to the electorate.  He must remember the comments of our learned friend, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, a member of the inner Bar who, presumably, knew what he was talking about.  He should also remember the comments of the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, Deputy Haughey, and those of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Molloy, and the present Ceann Comhairle of the House.</P>
      <P>If there was no trouble in getting a 50-mile exclusive band at the end of 1976 and up to the commencement of the election campaign, why do we not get it now?  Why did the Minister not contradict the Commissioner's statement about our entitlement to a 50-mile band?  The former Government were accused of being too pro-European and too mild.  We were told that if Fianna Fáil were returned to office they would change all that and tell those European people where to get off.  They would demand an exclusive 50-mile band.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Gaeltacht, Deputy Gallagher, was quite vocal on <Col N="854" /> that question too, his views being completely similar to those expressed by the other Deputies, all of whom are now Ministers.  We are all anxious to develop our fishing industry.  As an island country we must get what we can from the sea and try if possible to increase employment in the fishing industry.  At present there is a danger to our fish stocks because our conservation policies are not as good as they should be.  There is a difficulty in taking unilateral action but I believe that such action should be taken now. It should be made clear to the people in Brussels that we will be masters in our own house and that we will devise conservation measures for waters within 50 miles of our coast.</P>
    <P>The question of employment in boatyards has been raised on several occasions.  We have three BIM boatyards providing first-class boats and a number of private yards.  We are all concerned with the creation of employment in our boatyards.  When I was Parliamentary Secretary I said there would be no redundancies this year.  I could not go beyond that because the election was due.  I wonder is there a possibility of building boats for export?  Is it possible for us to build steel hull boats?  These matters should be examined by the Department. If redundancies occur in the three BIM yards it will be difficult to gather the workforce together again. Before one man is made redundant in Killybegs, Baltimore or Dingle an effort should be made to diversify.  It is equally important that those employed in privately-owned boatyards are kept in employment.  Whether a man works in a private or a public boatyard his job should be guaranteed. The Coalition Government paid particular attention to that question when they were in office.  Again, I stress the desirability of ensuring that employment will continue to expand in both public and private boatyards.</P>
    <P>Every effort was made to extend the processing industry.  We appreciate that it is to our advantage to ensure that fish are processed where they are landed or close to major landing areas. I stress the desirability of continuing to pursue our policy of developing <Col N="855" /> the processing industry wherever it is possible to do so.</P>
    <P>I drew attention to the plight of some of the deckhands employed on our fishing boats.  I said they were entitled to examine the accounts of the boats on which they worked, that they were entitled to examine the sales returns and items of expenditure in order to ensure that the net earnings were divided according to the agreed scheme.  I am glad that this matter has been raised by other people.  I have always been of the opinion that those employed as deck hands were overlooked. We hear a lot about the plight of skippers.  I am glad that I initiated a move to broaden our horizon so that when we talk of the fishing industry we do not confine ourselves to discussing the difficulties of skippers.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary for me to delay the House as I have made many statements on this subject, but I should like to stress that I am not a believer in quotas or in giving licences to foreign trawlers whatever their size. Once we start that we will be incapable of assessing whether these trawlers are overfishing.  I am sure the Minister will tell us that there is no necessity to provide licences for foreign boats because he has been given information by his colleagues on how to declare a legal 50-mile limit and to tell the other member States and Third World countries to go about their business.</P>
    <P>The Minister can expect the fullest co-operation from this side of the House if he is determined to ensure that our fishermen get an exclusive 50-mile limit.  The Minister's duty is to stand by the statements made by his party prior to the general election, particularly the first paragraph of their election manifesto which refers to an exclusive 50-mile limit.  The Minister's party can do this as they have a majority in the House and the co-operation of the opposition parties. I conclude by wishing the Minister every success in his office and in his negotiations with the other members of the EEC and any Third World countries.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to have this debate because it enables certain facts to be put on record, facts that will help us to understand the precise position.  The gist of the motion moved by Deputy Deasy deals with the defence of the Irish unilateral conservation measure.  This is the measure that has already been suspended and terminated for practical purposes until the final determination of the actual hearing.  This measure was introduced by the Coalition Government on 10th April, 1977, within the octave of a general election and its validity was tested in the European Court, who on 13th July last ordered that the Government of Ireland should forthwith terminate and suspend until final determination the unilateral measures that were adopted.  In other words, so far as the European Court was concerned the measures adopted by the Coalition within a few weeks of a general election&mdash;in my view, in an attempt to con the Irish electorate, including the Irish fishermen&mdash;were suspended by the European Court because of their invalidity and pending the final determination of whether they were to be eliminated totally as unilateral measures.  We are now awaiting that final determination but since the 13th July the position has been that the Coalition's unilateral measures have been suspended.  In effect, within a few days of becoming the Government we were left with a pup born out of Coalition policy decided on within a few weeks of the election and decided on for narrow and base electoral purposes.  This was a policy devised by the then Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Fisheries and the then Government.  After the Court's order on 13th July eight days after we had been returned to office, the Irish fishing industry was left with no conservation measure of any kind.</P>

      <P>The facts of the situation shall be hammered home by me time and again.  On April 10th unilateral measures, allegedly prohibiting boats of more than 110 feet from fishing in distances from 50 to 100 miles in Irish waters, were introduced by the Coalition and advanced by them as their major contribution to conservation within the 200-mile zone off the coast of Ireland.  Within three months the Court had met and decided that the measures should be suspended forthwith.  This situation left me, within a week of assuming office, facing fellow Ministers who could only shake their heads in despair at the sort of procedures that were adopted at previous Council meetings by the then Ministers for Fisheries and Foreign Affairs who were well known to be playing games with Council meetings month after month coming up to the general election in order to secure electoral advantage at the expense not only of the Irish fishermen and the fishing industry but of the Irish people as a whole.  It was a massive con job.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Lest people think that I am talking from heresay, I shall quote from a very interesting leading article in <i>The Irish Press</i> of April 6th last.  This was coming up to the time of the declaration of unilateral measures.  The <Col N="858" /> editorial refers to the dual purpose Council of Ministers bargaining between Deputies FitzGerald and Donegan.  It was headed with the following memorandum from the paper's EEC correspondent:</P>
    <P>No indication yet.  Chaos all over the place.  Just had dual briefing from Donegan and FitzGerald, but confusion worse than ever.</P>
    <P>The editorial proceeded as follows and made the very pithy comment that:</P>
    <P>... the history of these fishing negotiations, if it were not so tragic, would be farcical. </P>
    <P>There are a number of other observations of that kind but it is not my intention to quote them here because to do so would not serve best the purpose of a constructive debate.  However, such phraseology as &ldquo;tragic&rdquo; and &ldquo;farcical&rdquo; just about sums up the type of situation I inherited and had to deal with within a week of becoming Minister for Fisheries.  It is our problem to try to get out of the total mess with which we were left.  We must deal with certain realities.  In this context I quote from Deputy Michael Pat Murphy who in his more responsible days said, as reported at column 396 of the Official Report for 27th October, 1976:</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That was the then Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>&mdash;returning with a 50-mile coastal band which would be exclusive, but as Deputy O'Kennedy knows we must negotiate with eight other countries. </P>
    <P>At column 451, of the Official Report for October 27th, Deputy FitzGerald said&mdash;and here I agree with him&mdash;in replying to a legitimate query from Deputy O'Kennedy who wished to know what criteria would guarantee the expansion of the Irish fishing industry:</P>
    <P>In the middle of negotiations.  Is the Deputy mad? </P>
    <P>It is not my intention here to tell the House what is to be my position on behalf of Ireland although it was suggested here yesterday that I should <Col N="859" /> divulge this information.  I am charged with responsibility of negotiating the issue and I shall undertake this task to the utmost limit of my ability in consultation with my colleagues in Government.  That is my duty.</P>

      <P>I wish to remind Deputy FitzGerald again of the <i>The Irish Press</i> comment on his situation.  Their EEC correspondent, as reported in the issue of that paper to which I have referred, in relation to what he called the dual briefing from Donegan and FitzGerald remarked that there was confusion worse than ever, a tragic and farcical situation throughout the negotiations.  That is the real worry. However, we are getting it off the ground and away from that nonsense that went on between the Minister for Fisheries and the Minister for Foreign Affairs jumping in and out of each other's seats during negotiations, one rushing in telling one story, the other fellow coming in then, different briefings to Press correspondents, different statements to foreign Ministers and Fisheries Ministers, complete and utter chaos, a final decision to adopt a unilateral measure in the octave of a general election, and that finally suspended by the court as I have just mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Next Monday I have to go to Brussels to a Council of Ministers meeting at which I will have to negotiate on behalf of this country and it is due to the House that I state briefly our negotiating position.  It is a negotiation with eight other member countries to whom we are bound as a member of the Community.  We feel strongly that there should be an exclusive zone of up to 50 miles around the coast.  The British Government feel the same, with certain modifications in <Col N="860" /> their stance in that they have declared their option for a 12-mile limit, with a further band up to 50 miles in which they would have a dominant preference. The British and Irish will be taking similar stances on next Monday. The other seven European countries dispute the British and Irish right to any form of exclusive band. They are totally objective about this matter.  The Commissioner last week when here was merely putting a point of view in that respect.  That is also the point of view of the Commission. However, it is matter for negotiation.</P>
      <P>There are many aspects in what Commissioner Gundelach said last week which are welcome to us and I would like to reiterate a few.  Leaving aside the question of an exclusive coastal band which we insist on, there are a number of measures which are very attractive to us in regard to restriction of mesh sizes of fishing nets. To increase the size of mesh in nets fishing for white fish and prawns around our coasts would be a basic conservation measure which would also restrict a lot of heavy fishing in the areas of white fish and prawns which at the moment is damaging Irish stocks. We agree with the Commission on that aspect and our scientific input into that Commission's decision has been substantial and very rewarding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would agree with the Commission on a system of fishing plans in so far as they lead to licensing arrangements. Let us have some degree of harmony here.  I detected from what Deputy Deasy said last night that he also would go along with a licensing system which would be thorough, detailed and properly monitored.  This again emerges from what Commissioner Gundelach suggested last week, that instead of the old crude mechanism of national quotas there should be a more sophisticated version which would in effect amount to a licensing system spelling out the type and name of boat, the skipper, power, species of fish for which a boat is fishing, and so on.  If an X quota were granted to a country under that umbrella X number of ships would be licensed under a very thorough monitoring system with personnel available in the coastal areas and <Col N="861" /> in ports to ensure that catches were not exceeded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Under whose control?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This a very valid question.  We are having sensible discussion now.  It would be very strongly under the control of the coastal state. That is the British and the Irish view, and we will be pushing that point at the negotiations.  Control by the coastal state of both licensing and the exclusive zone is wrapped up, in our submission, with the essential aspect of conservation.  Here there is a divergence in the British and Irish view from that of our other partners in the Commission who do not appreciate sufficiently the importance of the coastal country having an exclusive zone for conservation purposes and also having control of the licensing situation.  By reason of proximity to the fishing grounds, of having personnel available and of knowledge of the adjacent fishing grounds, it is only the coastal state which is in a practical position to monitor, control, license and organise the management, and this all adds up to conservation.  That is our case on that aspect; it is on that bedrock of argument that our main case exists, apart from the special regional and social considerations that operate with regard to Ireland.</P>
      <P>On the latter aspect one heartening matter that was agreed in the time of the previous Government is that we do have a special case and our special position was acknowledged in The Hague agreement which was achieved in the time of the Coalition Government. To be totally fair, we are entitled now to catching facilities that will enable us to achieve that level as set out in The Hague agreement, which means doubling our catch by 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>And to continue to expand thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to say that&mdash;to continue to expand thereafter. We have that guarantee.  This means that in the last analysis, whatever system is adopted where quotas are <Col N="862" /> based on a licensing system allied to an exclusive zone, we are in a preferential position within the 200-mile zone of waters adjacent to our coast. At minimum we must get a preferential quota situation based on licensing and a strong preferential position to enable us to reach the targets that have been agreed upon in The Hague agreement.  To that extent I am relatively optimistic about what is going to emerge at the end of the day.  I have been to Brussels, The Hague. Bonn and Paris over the past few weeks putting our case and generally setting out the position, as I am setting it out now, to European Ministers of Fisheries.  The British Minister for Fisheries has been here as well.  There is general recognition of the fact that we do have a special case by reason of our regional and social considerations. One of our problems is that the British, although they have a certain interest with us in a large part of our case, do have other interests which disturb our other Community partners. One of our problems is to ensure that Ireland's special case which is generally recognised survives through the whole situation.  The best acknowledgment that can be given to that is a system of a combination of an exclusive zone up to 50 miles with the licensing system organised by the coastal state.</P>
      <P>There are other important financial matters which were mentioned by Commissioner Gundelach and from which we can take heart.  There is the contribution yet to be worked out by the Community&mdash;they say 50 per cent, but we are looking for 75 per cent&mdash; towards the cost, which could be quite substantial, of providing a protection service for a 200-mile zone.  We are talking in terms of a capital cost of £10 million to £12 million and operating costs of approximately £1 million.</P>

      <P>I have given the Deputy enough praise already.  Let us share it a little.  I have to negotiate that.  I had very detailed discussions on this aspect but, hopefully, we will get the sort of contribution we are talking about on the patrolling and also 50 per cent towards new boats and processing activities on shore.  These matters to which I have been laterally referring are all matters on which there is agreement, but there does remain the basic difference of opinion&mdash;and let us not hide from it&mdash;that we say an exclusive zone off our coasts is essential from the point of view of protecting our spawning grounds which are near the coast and that by getting that exclusive zone we can best protect these spawning grounds not alone for our benefit but for the benefit of the Community as a whole.  Seven of the Nine disagree with Britain and us on that.</P>
      <P>When I was left with this derelict situation by reason of the collapse of the Coalition Government's measure, I got agreement at the first meeting of the Council of Ministers to a number of conservation measures which have been very successful.  I refer in particular to the measure secured in the middle of July until the end of August whereby the west of Ireland spawning herring grounds were protected, when, following the suspension of the Coalition measure, the Dutch herring fishing fleet was ready to move in and sweep out the herring grounds from Donegal Bay to the Shannon Estuary.  I made a strong fight at that first Council of Ministers meeting and secured the agreement, in particular, of the Dutch to stay off the Irish herring spawning grounds until the end of August and confine the herring season off the western coast from 1st September to the end of this year.  The result has been the most remarkable herring fishing in recent years for Irish fishermen. Any Deputy who goes to any fishing port around our coasts will hear of the revival of the herring fishing since September due to the highly successful conservation measure brought in by us, resulting in the biggest money spinning bonanza for Irish fishing.</P>

      <P>No. It has nothing to do with that at all.  I am being very fair and logical about this.  I happen to know what it is due to.  In the event of not reaching agreement next week at the Council of Ministers meeting, which is what I expect, we should be active about introducing conservation measures ourselves in consultation with the Commission.  Conservation is the common ground on which we all agree.</P>
      <P>I announced yesterday substantial increases in grants for fishing boats, a 25 per cent grant for the purchase of first issues of gear, an increase of 25 per cent to 50 per cent in the grant towards the cost of converting boats to new fishing methods, and the extension of the loan repayment period for boats over 65 feet from eight years up to 12 years.  These are important practical measures to induce fishermen to purchase boats and get moving in the industry.  It is time we got rid of the chaos and uncertainty that has existed in the industry heretofore.  Above all else we must stop playing politics with the industry. The Coalition have wasted up to two years playing politics with this great industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to revive this industry we must revive grants and incentives towards the purchase of new boats.  We must introduce new legislation, as I propose to do, to bring inland fisheries under the control of regional boards.  Our salmon stocks must also be preserved by having proper enforcement of our salmon laws and regulations so as to prohibit illegal fishing.  It is also necessary to introduce legislation, which I shall be doing in a few months' time, to provide proper incentives and grants for fish farming both inland and at sea.  We must have confidence in our marine fishing industry, in our inland fishing industry and in the preservation of our salmon stocks, all of which areas were disgracefully neglected by the last Government and by nobody more than Deputy Michael Pat Murphy who handed out salmon licences right, <Col N="865" /> left and centre around our coasts. There must be an end to all that. Confidence in this industry must be recreated by taking political hands out of it and remembering that, above all else, our function here as a Government is to govern this industry as an industry that can make progress and to eliminate the sort of conmanship in which the last Government consistently engaged over their years in office.</P>

It is extraordinary to hear a Fianna Fáil Minister complaining here about Deputies FitzGerald and Donegan, as Ministers negotiating, as he said, as two people on behalf of the Irish fishing industry when in the few short months he has been in power he as one man has managed consistently to speak with two voices or, as was stated in the morning newspapers, to move like a lobster backwards and forwards.  I would prefer to describe it as moving like a crab from side to side without getting anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has the gall to say that his difficulty on taking up office was <Col N="866" /> that he had found himself in a mess of the Coalition's making and his problem was to get us out of that mess. The country knows and the fishermen know that that situation was created in 1972 when the Minister and his colleagues did not negotiate any deal for the Irish fishermen.  If a sell-out took place, it took place when, negotiated by the Minister and his colleagues, a situation was created when boats from the Community would have been allowed to fish up to Irish headlands by 1982.</P>
    <P>That is the position we found when we came to office in 1973.  That is the difficult negotiating position that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy FitzGerald, and his colleagues found themselves in.  That is the position the Minister for Fisheries at that time found himself in.  Last October, the special case of this country was eventually recognised following negotiation by Deputy FitzGerald under The Hague Agreement and on foot of which most of the measures which the Minister is now misrepresenting, as if he had anything to do with them were agreed.  The Irish public and the fishermen know that is not true.</P>
    <P>We come to the most difficult part of the Minister's policy since assuming office.  Within days of assuming office he had come out and publicly described a measure taken by us as being blatently crude and discriminatory, and that at a time before the case finally had been heard and the outcome handed down by the court. That inflammable sort of statement severely damaged the Irish case.  He did it again tonight in his remarks about that case and its likely outcome. The Minister's intemperate contribution is exemplified by his comments tonight that the court had terminated the Irish measures.  The court did not terminate the Irish measures.  It merely suspended them pending the handing down of a verdict.  It is too bad to see a Minister come in here and deliberately cut away the ground on which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He has gone out of his way to criticise our action on the conservation measures.  We have the evidence of the Commissioner who said at the meeting last week that there was no talk of a 50-mile limit.  He congratulated the present Government on the softening of their attitude to the 50-mile limit.</P>
      <P>Worst of all, we had the Minister's absolute refusal in this House yesterday to guarantee to use his veto against any agreement with third countries in relation to fishing within Community waters.  That is the single most important bargaining power we have and this Minister refused not once but six or seven times in the House yesterday to guarantee to use his right of veto. He said he would not disclose his negotiating position because he wanted to play his cards close to his chest.  As far as I am concerned, by now he has dealt himself such a hand that he does not even have a pair of twos, not to mind openers.</P>

      <P>That was our stand not merely in this Chamber or at the chapel gates of Ireland in the course of the domestic political contest that was occurring but it was our position internationally and it is internationally accepted as such.  The same report records:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish delegation is of the view that a large coastal zone is the only means of obtaining the development <Col N="868" /> objective for its fishing industry which has been recognised by The Hague Agreement, and of ensuring stock conservation in the waters off the Irish coast. </P>
    <P>When he forgot his political partisanship, the Minister recognised that The Hague Agreement had been negotiated by Deputy FitzGerald.  That had been recognised by the Community as Ireland's position until the lobster or the crab took over and found himself caught in the tentacles of the Brussels octopus.  Those tentacles are clutching him today, and if he finds himself uncomfortable it is because the Fianna Fáil Government in 1972 did not advert to the possibility that by 1981 or 1982, under the legal code that then appeared to exist&mdash;not the Rome Treaty but a regulation that was adopted in 1970&mdash;foreign fishermen could be coming up and scraping out the bottom of the Irish Sea and the Atlantic Ocean right up to our shores.</P>
    <P>Norway was fearful about it.  The bound volume of the Rome Treaty and the Protocols of the Treaty of Accession shows that the Norwegians' reservations and hesitations and fears were recognised by the Community, and undertakings were given to them that nothing would be done to worsen their position.  What do we find in relation to Ireland?  We find absolutely nothing about fish.</P>
    <P>I will not go back, because what was said by us in 1972 about this situation is already on the records of the House.  The truth is that the Fianna Fáil Government of the day sold the pass.  The seabed was sold. It was ignored and no reservation, no protection, was built into our Treaty of Accession in regard to our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>On 30th September last, I had the privilege of being a member of a deputation from this House in Brussels.  There were nine Fianna Fáil members on that delegation.  We had the opportunity of meeting the Director-General in charge of fisheries.  He told us that what he would say that day would be on the record.  He was speaking in reply to a sincere and impassioned address by Deputy Deasy <Col N="869" /> who emphasised that the seas off Ireland's coast were the property of Ireland and that we as an underdeveloped community were entitled to fish those waters without fear of their being plundered by other members of the Community or Third countries.  The Director-General said:</P>
    <P>All that should have been said in 1972. </P>
    <P>In other words, the person now charged by the European Communities with deciding what their attitude would be to Ireland's protest told us that what we are saying now is fine but we are saying it too late.  That is why Ireland's fishing industry is now threatened in the manner in which it is.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go back over the question of the appointment of the present Administration because we debated this previously but it is relevant to say that we have on record the commitment of certain members of the Fianna Fáil Party to the protection of the Irish fishing industry and their determination that nothing less than an exclusive 50-mile zone would be accepted by Ireland.  They are Deputy Haughey, Deputy Molloy, Deputy Brennan, Deputy Crowley, Deputy Fahey, Deputy Gallagher and Deputy O'Leary.  I have been unable to find, and my colleagues likewise, Deputy Lenihan on record and the question arises now why he was given this job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Mark you, he is not prone to keeping silent about anything but he remains silent on this.  Another person spoke about the matter and that was Deputy O'Kennedy, now Minister for Foreign Affairs, who accepted&mdash;this was not mentioned in the election campaign&mdash;that possibly there might be something less than a 50-mile exclusive zone and he said that on getting back to power Fianna Fáil would renegotiate the Treaty of Accession about fish.  What have we heard about that?  Was there one word from the Minister tonight that Fianna Fáil would renegotiate the <Col N="870" /> Treaty of Accession?  No, nothing. But apart from what the official policy might be we come up against the question of personal inclination on the part of the man charged with responsibility.  Now everybody knows that Deputy Lenihan never likes to be unpopular with anybody and particularly he does not want to be unpopular with any person to whom he may be talking at the time and he is never prepared to say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  He is never prepared to be aggressive or unpleasant.  He is never prepared to fight.  He always assures the other person there is no problem.  Can you not imagine what happens at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in Brussels?  &ldquo;Oh, there is no problem. Let our officials meet and all will be easy, all will be settled.&rdquo; He then comes back and meets the Irish fishermen and says: &ldquo;Yes, that is all right, gentlemen.  Just leave it to me.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now what you need in this situation is a person with determination and conviction and we have never heard one word of determined protest by the Minister for Fisheries either in this House or elsewhere that the Irish fishing industry should be protected and we should not allow people from either the other member countries or third countries to plunder our seas.  One of the weaknesses that Deputy Lenihan has is that he has very narrow horizons.</P>

      <P>Your are quite right, sir.  I am sorry.  I will refer to him as the Minister.  The Minister's personal difficulty is that his horizons are limited by whatever he sees as the opportunity to gain political advantage at home.  But when one becomes Minister one has a far greater responsibility and one's obligations are to the country as a whole and one does not therefore try to take on the <Col N="871" /> international scene a short-term advantage in the hope of getting the plaudits of one's own followers.  The Minister has suggested that the unilateral action taken by the National Coalition Government was taken in the heat and excitement of an election campaign.</P>

      <P>What happened subsequently was that the Minister under various orders has completely excluded Irish fishermen from some fishing activity in Irish waters.  It does not seem to me that he serves the interests of Ireland sensibly in doing that.  The Minister in private life was a working barrister and he knows there is little prospect of any lawyer winning a case unless he is prepared to fight the case to the end, even to the disappointing end, and the one thing a lawyer does not do is admit thing his opponent or the court that he has no faith in his own case, unless he wants to lose the case.  Yet within days of assuming his Ministerial responsibilities the Minister&mdash;I will not say abandoned the Irish case; he did not do that, but he did even worse&mdash; said: &ldquo;We will carry on with it, but we have no faith in it.&rdquo; He deliberately sabotaged it and lead the courts into making a ruling because the reality of the matter is the European Court, unlike our own courts here, take account of political nuances. Therefore Ireland's position, which <Col N="872" /> might well have been maintained pending a final decision by the court, was completely weakened by the Minister's attitude.</P>
      <P>The result is, not only in relation to that particular case but in all fishery matters, we have a soft mulch of a policy.  We have no determination, no courage and we have no willingness on the part of the Administration to fight Ireland's case.  We now find ourselves therefore in the situation that Commissioner Gundelach, who is charged with certain responsibilities in this matter, is on record as saying that the firm stance of the National Coalition Government has been abandoned by the new Administration. Obviously then instead of Ireland being in a position to fight&mdash; mark you, the Government of the day ought to be in a position to quote the Opposition as being as determined as they to fight Ireland's interests&mdash;the Government are in the reverse position.  The situation is read in Brussels now that the Government are going soft, are prepared to yield, and the Opposition at home are not even being quoted by the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as people who are determined to stand by what we were fighting for when the Government changed and our stance is very, very, clearly on record.  When the Government were in Opposition they sought to gain local advantage by calling for an exclusion.  This then drifted down to a limit.  It then became a limitation.  It is now gone to a special zone.  The nature of the concessions to be given under that arrangement we just do not know and the Minister was not prepared to give any assurance to the Dáil as to what that might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fortunately time limits us and I can therefore spare the Minister's tender feelings, but let us hope that as a result of this debate something useful to the Minister and to Ireland will come out of the debate.  We are prepared now to set aside our words of censure in this motion and <Col N="873" /> I suggest an amendment which, with all due respect to Ireland's interest, ought to be accepted, I believe, by the House.  I suggest the deletion of the words:</P>
    <P>... deplores the manner in which the Government and the Minister for Fisheries have conducted national fishery affairs, with particular reference to the defence of Irish unilateral conservation measures applied by Orders of the Minister for Fisheries, and... </P>
    <P>The motion will then read:</P>
    <P>The Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to give an assurance that it will maintain the firm stance of the National Coalition Government by refusing its consent to any bilateral agreement exchanging Community fishery rights on a reciprocal basis...</P>
    <P>and so on.  The effect of that would be that Ireland's position would be preserved, the Government would not be censured and we will be saying to the Community and to the world: &ldquo;You have no right to surrender to the third countries or anybody else Ireland's fishermen's rights in Irish waters.&rdquo; Irish waters are one of our greatest assets.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for raising this matter on the adjournment to-night is that I was disappointed with the information given by the Minister this afternoon on the progress in the discussions which took place with the relevant parties in Northern Ireland and in Britain in regard to the connection of Lough Erne and the River Shannon.  I am also disappointed at the length of time taken by the Office of Public Works in carrying out a survey on this matter.  This survey has been carried out over the past two years and it has had no results yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call urgently upon the Minister to activate vigorously the negotiations and discussions taking place at present regarding the linking of the River Shannon and Lough Erne by the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell Canal. It is of the utmost importance that these negotiations should be pursued actively.  I call upon the Minister to have them continued and to have this <Col N="877" /> canal put into operation so that these waterways can be united.  There appears to be no sense of urgency involved in this matter at the moment. A number of important matters are involved in this issue.  This waterway is a most important link between the two parts of Ireland.  If the Ballina-more and Ballyconnell Canal were put into operation, it would be possible to navigate from Fermanagh down to Carrick-on-Shannon, Athlone, Banagher and Limerick.  This is a most important waterway.  If this work were carried out we would have here in Ireland one of the finest waterways in Europe and indeed in the whole world.</P>
    <P>As the Minister and others are probably aware, this canal was opened in 1860.  Unfortunately, it went out of use in 1880 approximately.  At that time people were not as interested in boating as they are now.  It is important to put on record that there has been a considerable growth in boating and cruising along the River Shannon over the years.  In 1969 there were 110 approved boats for hire on the Shannon.  In 1970 there were 137, and in 1975 there were 262.  In 1975 a total of £2,366,000 was spent on the Shannon. This is a very sizeable sum of money.  This industry could be further developed and expanded.  A total of 12,500 people took their holidays on the Shannon in 1975 and 13,000 in 1976.  Bord Fáilte have estimated that 18,500 people will be taking their holidays on the Shannon in 1979.</P>
    <P>In 1975 German tourists on the Shannon spent £1,200,000.  The potential of this river is well known in Europe.  The holiday season on the Shannon lasts for 35 weeks.  It is a longer season than in other tourist areas.  It is a 35-week season which commences early in the spring and goes on late into October.  This is part of our tourism industry.  Last year £180 million was spent by tourists and 118,000 jobs created.  Further expansion is planed if the work I have suggested is put in hand.</P>
    <P>It is my view that the EEC would agree to give a substantial grant towards the cost of the work involved <Col N="878" /> in the development of this waterway. I am sure the EEC are anxious to help cross-Border co-operation.  The Minister must formulate plans for this development and forward them to the EEC to obtain such assistance.  He should follow that up to ensure that the plans are pushed through with all speed.  Unlimited development can take place on the Shannon and Erne in this regard.  Boating holidaymakers can travel almost the length of the country. For this reason Bord Fáilte could carry out a very effective advertising campaign to encourage people to spend their holidays here.  It is important to bear in mind that the National Coalition Government raised this matter on many occasions with the British Government and the relevant representatives from Northern Ireland.  I should like to know if the Taoiseach raised this matter with the British Prime Minister and, if so, what was the result of his representations?  It should be remembered that boating holidays are no longer confined to the wealthy.  Most people can avail of such holidays.  It is my view that in the not-too-distant future we will see peace and unity here and co-operation on this matter would be a good move.  It is important that such co-operation takes place.  If we are successful in this venture the way is open for co-operation on other projects between the two parts of our country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>An engineering study of the canal was commenced by the Office of Public Works in 1973 and discussions to date have in the main been technical.  At this stage it is not possible to say whether the restoration of the canal is feasible or what the cost might be.  Indeed, we cannot say with any certainty when the survey will be completed.  Much investigative work needs to be done over a period to ascertain the effects of drainage on adjoining lands.  Test models will have to be surveyed, studied in laboratory conditions and so on.  Obviously, our future attitude will depend on the results of the survey, whether they show that restoration is feasible or at what cost and how this cost can be met.  I <Col N="879" /> agree that there are obvious tourism advantages in linking up the Shannon and Erne waterway system.  It would give us a major waterway system of undoubted attraction to boat owners but on the other hand it might create problems for our angling visitors because of the different species of fish in the two waterway systems which are at present separated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other questions involved and these relate to land drainage.  All these matters will have to be given very deep consideration in the formulation of any future plans for the canal and it would be premature at this stage to anticipate the results of the engineering survey.  We will have to await the factual results before deciding on our future action in relation to the canal.  It has been implied that EEC moneys would be readily available to finance works on the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal but it is necessary to take a realistic view of this aspect.  The regional fund, although it is relatively small, has helped this country to finance a higher level of capital investment and job creation than would be the case if the fund did not exist but, at the same time, the level of the fund is quite inadequate to our needs and available assistance falls far short of the national input in the area to which the fund applies.  In fact, during 1975-77 the sum available to Ireland from the fund amounted to just over 1 per cent of the public capital programme. Therefore, Deputies will appreciate that the fund represents quite a small addition to our resources and that making a fund applicable is not simply <Col N="880" /> a matter of tapping an abundant flow of finance.</P>
    <P>The Government are prepared to consider the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell question on its merits but it should be clear from what I have said that it would not, on the available data, be possible to formulate an application for regional fund assistance for any project in the area let alone give it its appropriate place in the order of priorities among projects seeking Government and regional fund assistance. I should like to stress that the cost of the studies already carried out by the Office of Public Works is being assisted by the regional fund.  The prospect that the matter of linking the Shannon and the Erne would be included in the course of future cross-Border studies, financed in part by the EEC, cannot be ruled out either and such a study would probably extend to the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal. I have not had an opportunity to discuss specifically with the Northern Ireland authorities the question of linking the Shannon and the Erne but Deputies can be assured of the interest of the Government in cross-Border co-operation in all such matters.  It was one of the topics raised by the Taoiseach at his recent meeting with the British Prime Minister and developing co-operation could be extended to include a joint study of the Erne catchment which would no doubt embrace the question of linking the Erne with the Shannon.  It is reasonable that I should await the result of the survey taking place before coming to a final decision on the matter.</P>
