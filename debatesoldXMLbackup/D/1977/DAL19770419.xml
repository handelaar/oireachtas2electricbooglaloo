      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare has given the figure from time to time of the number of people living <Col N="925" /> below the poverty line as varying from 25,000 to 150,000?  Can the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach indicate how one Parliamentary Secretary can give an answer to the question while another Parliamentary Secretary has not got the information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I can.  My responsibility in doing these questions on behalf of the Taoiseach relates purely to the work of the Central Statistics Office. As every Deputy in the House knows, there is a wide difference between a departmental estimate of the kind which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare might give on the one hand and a firm statistical figure on the other hand, which is what the CSO is for, and I cannot give that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not make any reference to the Central Statistics Office.

      <P>There is no confusion. Week after week the Taoiseach is asked the question which arrives on his desk only because of his departmental responsibility for the CSO.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will consider the establishment of a transport authority for the Dublin area which would advise on the transport system <Col N="928" /> now operating with a view to finding ways and means of reducing the present prohibitive fares being charged on CIE trains and buses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Cavan) Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan):</i> I do not consider that the establishment of a transport authority for the Dublin area would be of any help in securing a reduction in CIE fares.</P>
      <P>Because of the labour intensive nature of the board's activities, CIE have been particularly vulnerable to the effects of escalating labour costs which, with other cost increases, have contributed to the substantial increase in the board's losses in recent years.  As I have already made clear in this House during the recent debate on a motion concerning the proposed increases in CIE rates and fares, increases in CIE costs, to the extent that they cannot be offset by increased productivity, must be met either by an increase in the board's subvention from the Exchequer, by increases in rates and fares or by a reduction in CIE services.</P>
      <P>The board's subvention from the Exchequer in respect of the Dublin city bus services alone has increased from £360,000 in the year 1972-73 to £6 million in 1976.  This substantial burden is borne by the general taxpayer and represents a very considerable relief to the users of the board's services.</P>
      <P>CIE have been making every effort to secure economies by productivity and other cost reduction schemes.  I have no doubt that the board will continue with such efforts and I am hopeful that with the co-operation of the unions further progress can be made in improving productivity and curtailing costs.  Improvements in this area could make a significant contribution towards achieving some degree of stability in real terms in the level of fares and subvention, without involving lowering of standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister if he had seen the latest reports of the National Prices Commission in which they suggest the provision of some kind of consumer body?  They think <Col N="929" /> this would have a beneficial effect on CIE and on our national transport policy.  In view of the fact that a further increase in CIE fares cannot be ruled out this year, the Minister might have a fresh look at this matter.  In the report the commission suggest that the consumer council or a government transport policy might help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I have seen the report the Deputy mentioned. I believe the most effective consumer protection organisation in the country is the National Prices Commission but I do not accept for one moment that there is not a transport policy, as has been suggested.  There is such a policy, which of necessity must be flexible.  CIE are required to provide a reasonable, efficient and economic rail and road passenger service which also of necessity must contain a certain social input.  The social input and the social contribution made by the Exchequer are very generous and are as much as I would be prepared to ask the taxpayers to bear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister like to comment on the reason the CIE subsidy increased from under £6 million in 1972 to £32½ million last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> As the man said, that is elementary. CIE are a labour intensive organisation. Everybody knows wages have increased substantially.  CIE are a heavy consumer of oil and I do not have to tell the Deputy that the cost of oil has at least quadrupled since the date in question.  Those are mainly the reasons which led to the increase in this subvention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that an increase from under £6 million to £32½ million far outstrips the increases in the cost of oil and labour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Speaking from memory, the Deputy will agree that the cost of 300 gallons of fuel oil has increased in that period from £18 or £19 to £20.  If he compares those figures he will see that the subvention has not outstripped the increases.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister think it fair or just that some ESB consumers were asked to pay the price increase for the month of February when the prices increases were not granted until March?

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> According to the information at my disposal there are precedents for the procedure which was adopted on this occasion.  The general conditions relating to the supply of electricity would appear to provide for retrospective increase.  The increase took place from 1st February and was announced on 8th March.  The general conditions relating to the supply of electricity, which have been operating for a considerable time, provide for increases from time to time and also for increases without notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The proposals in the Road Transport Bill, 1976, at present before the Oireachtas, are designed to reduce road freight costs in so far as they are related to the structure of road freight transport in Ireland.  I should emphasise, however, that there is already keen price competition in the road freight market and this provides a safeguard against excessive charges. Moreover, Irish hauliers have shown themselves to be competitive in international transport where they must compete with hauliers from Northern Ireland, Britain and continental countries.  Their competitiveness is illustrated by the fact that in the meat trade, which is the principal export traffic, Irish hauliers carried 59 per <Col N="936" /> cent of meat exports in 1976 against 23 per cent in 1973.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that on 16th February, the Minister for Fisheries, Deputy Donegan, stated that Ireland was now being assisted by the British in monitoring the movement of foreign trawlers and that information from British naval vessels and Nimrod aircraft was being relayed to the Department of Foreign Affairs and then to Irish fishery protection vessels?

      <P>The Deputy is confused. The Deputy is aware that both to the south-west and north-west of Ireland there is a dispute between ourselves and the United Kingdom Government as to our jurisdiction; the area to the north-west being particularly substantial.  The problem arises, therefore, of the fishery protection arrangements to be undertaken there <i>vis-á-vis</i> third countries within and outside the Community.  The arrangements are such that in accordance with international practice both countries will patrol in these areas and will exchange information in the event of coming across cases of infringement by, for example, Soviet vessels.  That exchange of information is a normal procedure. This, indeed, is the normal <Col N="938" /> arrangement where there is a dispute of this kind.  It is an arrangement which operates, for example, between Norway and the Soviet Union, members of two opposed defence blocs.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.  The person to whom the Deputies refer was detained by the British authorities at Birmingham airport on Saturday, 2nd April.  As soon as my officials were informed of the case, they raised the matter with the British authorities and maintained contact with them until the person in question was released.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second part of Question No. 14, 1,060 persons were detained in Britain under the Prevention of Terrorism Act in the year ended 4th April, 1977.</P>

      <P>I have not information on that; that is a separate question.  I can tell the Deputy that in that year we raised issues with the British authorities in respect of nine cases.  We did so at the request of the people concerned or their representatives. Since 1974 we have raised 110 specific cases with the British authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told us that 1,060 persons were detained <Col N="941" /> under the British emergency powers and I should like to know if he is aware that innocent people travelling between Ireland and Britain have been subjected to ill-treatment and bad manners by certain officials at points of entry into Britain and points of exit from Britain?  I can give the Minister the history of two such cases.

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy has specific cases he wishes to have raised I would be glad to receive details of them from him.  As I pointed out, there have been a number of complaints which we have had to take up with the British authorities but it is fair to say that the fact that there were nine cases last year out of 110 in a period of three years suggests a diminution in the problem referred to by the Deputy. However, it still exists.  Any case the Deputy brings to my attention will be investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the figure of 1,060 and I would like him to be more forthcoming in relation to the history of those cases in a general way.  There are many who do not wish to be associated with those who go abroad to create depredation and loss of life and some of those innocent people have been subjected to this type of treatment.  Can the Minister give the House more information about the 1,060 cases?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy any factual or statistical information without further inquiry but I have the impression that in the vast majority of cases the people concerned were released.  The number of cases pursued and in which charges were preferred was a small proportion of the total.  That ratio is, obviously, something which is disturbing and unsatisfactory but we have to accept that the British authorities have a serious problem.  The measures they have taken have been successful in minimising the number of cases of violent attack in Britain.  Nonetheless, it is disturbing <Col N="942" /> that the number of cases of detention followed by release is as high as it is although I cannot give precise figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if any application has been made to the EEC for financial assistance to purchase ships for fishery protection; and if any arrangements have been made with EEC partners in relation to surveillance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in reply <Col N="943" /> to a question on 27th January, the Foreign Ministers of the Community agreed at their meeting in The Hague on 30th October, 1976, that protection and control of the fishing zone off Ireland must not result, because of the size of that zone, in a charge which would be disproportionate to the volume of the Community fish resources which can be exploited in that zone by Irish fishermen.  The Ministers agreed that the implementation of available means of surveillance or those to be foreseen must be accompanied by appropriate measures to ensure that the charges which arise will be shared equitably.</P>
      <P>Since then discussions have taken place between Irish officials and representatives of the Commission regarding the equitable sharing of the cost of fishery protection, and information has been furnished by us on the additional patrol resources which will be necessary in the short and long term and the costs involved.  The position now is that proposals are awaited from the Commission for an implementing scheme to give effect to The Hague agreement.  The question of making formal application for financial assistance does not, therefore, yet arise.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, no arrangements have been made with any other country in relation to surveillance of Irish fishery waters.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have all learned with deep regret of the death of his Eminence William Cardinal Conway. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a ainm dílis.  A native of Belfast, he received his education there and displayed at an early age the great potential which was to make him a distinguished scholar in subsequent years during which he held for a time the posts of Professor of Moral Theology and Professor of Canon Law in St. Patrick's College, Maynooth.  During his period of office as Primate of All Ireland he led his flock with courage, gentleness and patience into the new era which was heralded by the Second Vatican Council.  He devoted much of his ability and energy to initiatives in relation to the Northern Ireland situation which had been a cause of deep concern to him.  I ask you, Ceann Comhairle, in the name of Dáil Éireann, to convey to the Most Reverend Doctor Lenny, Auxiliary Bishop of Armagh, to the clergy and people of the Archdiocese and to the mother and relatives of the late Cardinal our deepest sympathy in their great loss.</P>

    <P>In the passing of Cardinal Conway Ireland has lost a great Church leader. His leadership was manifest not only through the authority vested in him by virtue of his high office but also in the strength of his own faith, his humanity and the example that he gave.  His intellectual achievements need no embellishment from me.  The quality of his intellect became known worldwide as a result of the tremendous contribution he made to Vatican II.  His election to the Cardinals' College was a source of pride to the people of Ireland, the Ireland he loved so well, that such a man had become our Cardinal.  Tribute has <Col N="976" /> been paid to him by the other Church leaders with whom he collaborated and worked unceasingly for peace in the last seven or eight years.  Even before the present troubles in the North became so acute and so agonising, his annual Christmas messages to the nation were permeated with thoughts of peace.  In life he worked for it; it has not yet come, but in his spiritual home I know he will help us to achieve it.  I suaimhneas síoraí Fhlaitheas Dé go raibh a ainm dílis.</P>

    <Title>Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Bill, 1977: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I had only just started to speak on this Bill at the adjournment of the House.  I had listened with some interest to Deputy Colley's contribution and found myself very much in agreement with what he had stated.  This Bill arises by virtue of the practical failure of the present Bretton Woods Agreement and arises as a result of five years' discussions and negotiations between the members of the International Monetary Fund.  It might be well to have a look at the reasons for the present situation and the reasons for the shortcomings of Bretton Woods to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place, the Bretton Woods which was set up in 1944 did not provide an adjustment system of any kind and as a result it forced countries to fall back upon individual balance of payments policies.  There was a lack of unity, and nationalism came very much to the fore.  This resulted mainly in <i>ad hoc</i> nationalistic policies that were inimical to any concerted action in the international monetary field.  One must remember that at the time of Bretton <Col N="978" /> Woods countries were coming out of the European turmoil and a very difficult post-war situation.  Countries wanted to show their strength and viability to the rest of the world, and it was natural that the Ministers for Finance and Governments of the European countries kept as far away as they could from devaluation and revaluation of their currencies, which indeed had become very much a plaything between the political parties in the various European Parliaments, and it was regarded as being a failure on the part of a Government to have to have recourse to devaluation.  The result of these very nationalistic policies was that the rates of exchange between the various currencies became very unreal and were exacerbated by the attitude of the various nations.  This gave rise to a very unreal situation.</P>
    <P>One must realise also when looking at the situation evolving from Bretton Woods that Bretton Woods was a completely new concept.  I understand that there were about 720 people present at the setting up of Bretton Woods and at the discussions which took place.  I think it is probably very fair to say that only a bare handful of the delegates, Ministers and financiers, who were there realised what it was all about and it came down to a virtual confrontation between the late Lord Keynes and the Under Secretary of the American Treasury.  As we are talking about the immediate post-war years, it is natural enough that the American viewpoint would probably carry a great deal more weight than any view expressed by anyone else.  In particular&mdash; and this is where Bretton Woods really showed its weakness&mdash;there was no clear conception in the mind of its founders of the form which international liquidity would take under the system.</P>
    <P>Gold was to be the international unit of account but quite clearly there would not be enough gold to go around. National currencies, particularly the £ and the US dollar would augment gold and serve as reserve and intervention currencies.  Unfortunately, this ensured that the international currency system and international exchange system would become a gold exchange <Col N="979" /> standard based upon a gold-backed dollar.  The dollar would be virtually the only currency convertible to gold. Subsequent to this in gold and the currency holdings of individual currencies held as first-line international liquidity by central banks there was a meagre augmentation of that fund. Members might draw upon the fund's currency pool up to a certain amount and under stipulated conditions.  One of these which I suppose was breached more often than observed was that only 25 per cent of a nation's amount of the pool could be drawn in any 12 months.  There were provisions for exemption from those requirements and these exemptions had to be availed of. The net result was that there was a considerable amount of confusion.  All countries were expected to contribute their currencies to the fund but, in fact, very limited numbers of currencies came in demand.  Indeed, the fund became rather a waste paper basket, a repository of a considerable amount of unwanted currency, whilst its holdings of key currencies, particularly the dollar, were insufficient.  This came very much to light in the early 1960s and had a very bad effect on international trade.  It gave rise to international liquidity difficulties and considerable liquidity shortages and this then resulted in what are now called the SDRs, created at the behest of and in consultation with a group of ten.  That occurred in 1967.  There was a further amendment to the make-up of the SDRs, commonly called the basket currencies, on which the SDRs were based.  There was a tendency and an effort to get away from being tied to gold because of the limited amount and its effect of contracting international trade.</P>
    <P>There was another problem.  Europe after the war was decimated and badly needed to build herself up again.  She required the refitting of her industries and the only source from which she could get assistance was America.  The situation came about, therefore, whereby the US dollar virtually ruled the world and the availability of the dollar was all important in the strategy and policies of the western world.  There was also the disparity in size of the <Col N="980" /> member countries and, as I have mentioned, the great dominance of the United States.</P>
    <P>There are some aspects of this that one should also bear in mind.  The dollar was an intervention currency and this meant that the dollar could not be altered in relation to its par value because every currency in the world was virtually tied to the dollar. When Bretton Woods was set up it provided for this par value system but it did not provide for changes, for devaluation as such.  There is a provision for a change of up to 10 per cent but it is a once only change in par value.  I think everybody will agree that it was an extraordinarily shortsighted view at the time.  It was certainly not in keeping with the views of Lord Keynes and I think that Keynesian thinking has now more or less won out and that is why we have this new approach but it has taken a very long time to come about.</P>
    <P>If the dollar parity had been changed it would have been a major political event for the world, certainly one that the United States turned its face against.  One must bear in mind that it was also a reserve currency. Central banks all over the world would be holding the dollar as part of their reserves and the devaluation of the dollar would have very grave implications for the countries holding the dollar as a reserve currency.  Taking the years from 1944 up to the 1960's when this liquidity problem arose, the situation was dealt with by various mending operations but was largely dealt with by the United States running a chronic deficit in its balance of payments and this meant that more dollars were available outside the United States.  This was thought to be the only method whereby the international currency system could work. It has been classed as a doctrine of benign neglect.  In reality we see that the question of international liquidity is a political one.  After all, America was nursemaid to western Europe after the war.</P>
    <P>This naturally became tied up, as time went on, with national surpluses and deficits.  It became very apparent also, due to this difficulty about the <Col N="981" /> shortage of gold, that international liquidity could be created only by agreement and that that agreement had to come between the major countries, by which term I mean the major trading countries.  The dollar was acceptable to the rest of the trading world, though there is always a limitation that a major country like the US running a constant deficit may have the effect of undermining its own currency, and even though there may not be a purposive devaluation as such there may be what could be called an official devaluation of the currency. This becomes most exemplified when we look at the price of international commodities, because basically a currency has value only in relation to the commodities it can buy.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this liquidity problem is that we cannot talk merely about world liquidity.  What we are really talking about is liquidity between the trading nations and groups involved that make use of currency, and this has brought to light considerable difficulties in relation to the developing countries.  They are always short of currency.  They are always in a situation of being net purchasers.  It is necessary for them to be so in order to build up their structure.  Eventually they will have their own industries and they can become exporting countries of industrial products, which always carry the highest reward.  They may exist for a while as primary producers of one product, but that is really putting all one's eggs in one basket.  The failure of a crop can cause very serious dislocation of the economy of a country, particularly a developing country.  I am glad to see that under the Bretton Woods Agreement there is provision for the auctioning of gold in the fund and that the profit made from that will be put into a fund for the use of developing countries and developing nations.</P>
    <P>There is also a useful change in that the new system under the amended Bretton Woods Agreement takes a radically different approach from the original agreement and now each country will be free to adopt the exchange rate arrangement of its own <Col N="982" /> choice.  In other words there will be reality, maybe not absolute reality, but at least all nations will have an opportunity of looking at their situation in relation to their own currencies. This also has a corollary that, in the event of it being necessary to change the value of the currency in relation to other currencies, this will be subject to surveillance by and consultation with the International Monetary Fund.  We have seen how the dollar managed to perform its functions by virtue of co-operation and unofficial agreement.  There is an extension of this to the everyday running and to all other currencies.</P>
    <P>There is also provision under the amended agreement to go as deeply as the fiscal and financial policies of the individual member nations go.  This is very important because there can be blocs of countries where one side is deficit and the other side is surplus. It is interesting to note that the attitude of a country in relation to liquidity is very much governed by the state of its individual balance of payments.  Those countries in favour of international liquidity have deficits and those countries with surpluses are not too keen on extra liquidity.  The deficit countries are Britain and the US, and generally speaking the surplus bloc is the EEC countries.</P>
    <P>The problem may be deeper than that.  We had questions of employment and inflation.  We must remember that the EEC countries were ravaged by inflation during and after two world wars and that Britain and the US were concerned with unemployment and its dangers.  The EEC countries have also evinced a considerable fear of inflation as being a spill-over from the US and Britain.  There are two main intervention currencies, the £ sterling and the US dollar.  This is one of the reasons why one now notes a strong current of theoretical monitors' writings, which are not to be found necessarily outside the Central Bank reports.  They seem to be becoming very frequent contributors to magazines produced by banks and by central banks.</P>
    <P>These are general remarks.  They are all part of the picture.  In relation to our situation I agree with Deputy Colley about the breaking of the link with <Col N="983" /> sterling.  Other people may not share this view.  The Minister for Finance is of the same opinion as Deputy Colley. We must remember that we are a small, open economy and that the really important question when we come to consider whether or not to break the link with sterling is: where does our trade go?  It is interesting to note that in recent times there has been a considerable increase in the percentage of our trade that goes to the sterling area proper as distinct from Europe.  There is likely to be a slight swing back from that as a result of the green £ negotiations, but there is not much point in talking about the breaking of the link with sterling if a large part of our trade is into the UK.</P>
    <P>If we broke the link with sterling, the Irish pound might go down before it found its level.  This would have very serious implications for exporters to England.  It would mean that they would be getting less for their goods. It would also mean increased costings which would affect the cost of living and we would probably have to make quite severe sacrifices.  It would be a very difficult situation for whoever might be the Government of the day to explain to the Irish people that they might have to change their system of life.  Whilst a link with sterling has quite severe handicaps&mdash;we have to pay a price for it&mdash;of the options open to us that is the best at present.  If we were to break the link with sterling, being a small country with a small open economy, we would have to consider to what country our currency would be linked.  A large part of our trade is export-import trade with England. The reality and unreality of breaking the link with sterling becomes more apparent, having regard to the amount of trade that we have with England. There might be some argument in favour of a small floating margin between ourselves and the pound but it would not be worthwhile.  It would also mean the setting up of a finance market and a mechanism to deal with it.  That has its own costings and difficulties and whatever one might think about the pound sterling and its difficulties in recent times, at least it is <Col N="984" /> a known currency, much availed of in international markets, and it has a first-class finance market in London with all the facilities that go with it.  The fact that we are linked with sterling does not mean that we are politically linked.  We have our own economic independence.  It is a way of pegging our currency to some known and acceptable international currency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley referred to the floating currencies interfering with trade. This is a very big subject.  Admittedly, it is easier to plan ahead over a two-year contract period if one has a fixed parity but we have recently seen considerable speculation in currency. Despite the fact that currencies may be linked and tied to a certain value, it has not always worked out that way. There can be scarcities which give rise to other markets arising.  This could also rise, by way of implications, in the interest rate structure in different countries.  The previous governing body of the International Monetary Fund was virtually only an advisory body.  I notice that the council this time seems to have more power. Deputy Colley asked the Minister to deal a little more with that than had been dealt with in the opening statement by the Minister for Justice when introducing this Bill on behalf of the Minister.  I, too, would like to hear a little more on that aspect, where we come into it and how we would be represented.</P>
    <P>I referred to the fact that a currency is based on the commodities that it will buy and the strength of a currency is based on the goods and industry that back it.  We have seen a rather unfortunate incident in the last few years which was described as the big sale of wheat surpluses in America under what was described as PL 480.  The international financiers should busy themselves a little more about a system for control of large stocks of primary products.  This would involve crude oil and food such as wheat, soya beans, coffee and other essential primary products.  It looks as if there is a great deal of international politics behind the dealings in these goods.  It is far too risky a situation to leave the dealings in these goods in large quantities to private enterprises or to leave it in <Col N="985" /> the hands of private merchants.  I am not advocating international socialism. I am advocating international policing of the sales, purchases and distribution of vital primary products.  A wrong decision made could have just as great an effect as some new nuclear discovery or a discovery in the technical area of war-mongering implements.  It can change the balance of economic power.  It can have very serious implications for developing countries and for smaller nations.  If the international Monetary Fund is to consider further the basket of currencies, they might also consider relating the security that stands behind a currency to the international stockpiling situation of primary products.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the House for coming less prepared for this debate than I would have preferred due to a combination of circumstances beyond my control.</P>
      <P>The House should not spend much time shedding tears over the demise of the International Monetary Fund in the form in which it was constructed in 1944 at Bretton Woods.  It was a passable attempt to bring some order into international monetary affairs given the background of chaos and almost complete disorder which had characterised the situation in the 1930s, and given also the fact that the war had, to an extent, rehabilitated and placed in their proper perspective the contributions of Keynes the greatest economist of this century, to monetary policy.  Bretton Woods gave Keynes the opportunity of putting forward views which were accepted to some extent but which had been disregarded previously and almost universally rejected by his fellow academic economists, by the financial establishment, the financial press and, not least, by the central banks.  However, as central banks are invariably wrong, this latter rejection must have been a source of consolation rather than anger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous speaker has indicated that the Bretton Woods Agreement did not reflect truly the views that were expressed by Keynes at Bretton Woods and that the arrangement arrived at was imposed by the Americans, particularly by Harry <Col N="986" /> Dexter White, and that they fell far short of what Keynes believed to be necessary, first, for the creation of sufficient international liquidity and, secondly, for the creation of a situation in which governments would have flexibility to pursue their own internal domestic policies while at the same time running their economies consonant with good international practice.</P>
    <P>The original Bretton Woods agreement was built around a par-value system and the concept of gold as the ultimate reserve.  One could not possibly find two more ridiculous premises on which to base an international monetary system.  In the first place, the par-value system, operating supposedly in a market situation, runs against the very theory on which all economists had agreed universally markets should operate.  One can imagine orthodox economists throwing up their hands in horror at the concept of managed markets for any other product or commodity but yet joining hands in agreement in believing that one particular commodity should be the product of a managed market. That commodity, by universal consent, is money.  In other words, there can be a market economy provided that that philosophical idea of a free market is not allowed spill over into the more important area of money, the most important area of all so far as the economy is concerned for those who wish to profit from it, and, one suspects, for many economists who love money so much they hate to be without it.</P>
    <P>The par-value system, on which the IMF was based, was doomed inevitably to collapse at some stage. There could have been no more ridiculous restriction on the growth of international liquidity than the concept that the quantum of gold available in the world should be determined by one of the suscribing signatories to the agreement, the US, fixing the gold price and thereby determining the amount of international liquidity. Indeed, I recall in 1962 and 1963 writing identical answers to two different examination papers about the price of gold.  That is a long time ago, but I then regarded the price <Col N="987" /> of gold as a ridiculous limitation on the growth of international liquidity, which, at that time, was emerging as a serious international problem in respect of world trade.  Yet the price was being determined politically.  This was due in no small measure to the fact that the two major suppliers were politically inimical to the US. These were South Africa and the Soviet Union.  Eventually, both the par-value system and the gold reserve concept were abandoned, not as a result of theoretical insights or analysis but simply under the pressure of events, a pressure which proved greater than economists and greater than the governments those economists misadvised.</P>
    <P>I shed no tears for the demise of the IMF in the form in which we have known it but I welcome it in the somewhat new garb in which it is now presented.  It is designed to meet a set of objectives which could not be argued against even by Lucifer himself, so angelic and pure are they in their intention to create an international order somewhat just beneath the level of perfection.  We live in a human world of imperfection.  We are dealing in a world in which money, particularly at international level, is part of the realm of international policy rather than of international monetary economics.  We are dealing now with a new world economic order. We have witnessed the emergence of new and powerful economic forces and of new super powers.  We have also been brought to the new situation by the policy of former President Nixon, whom Galbraith flippantly described as &ldquo;the greatest socialist of all&rdquo;.  We are moving towards a sensible approach under the arrangements outlined in the new IMF articles, and not before time.</P>
    <P>I believe in a system of flexible exchanges.  I do not accept the horror of those who regard this as being the ultimate betrayal of the capitalist system of rationality.  The necessities of the situation have imposed a desirable international solution.  I trust that, although the new articles for the IMF make provision for a <Col N="988" /> possible return to a modified par-value system, such a road will never be travelled because there is no doubt that in the past grave economic dislocations with far-ranging economic and social consequences have been caused by adherence to values which were not justifiable economically. One can think of the return of Britain in the twenties to the gold standard, and the unemployment pressures which that induced in the UK, as an example of the lunacy that sometimes pervades this area of policy. One can recall the unsuccessful attempt of the Labour Government in Britain in 1964 to defend the then dollar value of the £ sterling.  That decision, which we understand was taken in the first three days of the Wilson administration of 1964, ultimately consigned the party to opposition and exacerbated the already serious economic problems in the UK.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this is an area in which there is a very dangerous mixture of politics and economics, where very often myth and mythology pass under the scientific guise of elaborate theories.  I should hope that on this occasion the world community will not be dragged back by some misguided economist towards a system of par-value or to the almost mythological concept of gold reserves.  We look forward to a system of flexible exchanges and to the creation of an international reserve currency somewhat akin to that which Keynes proposed as long ago as 1944.  This Bill points the road to sanity, although nobody can take credit for it since that sanity was imposed by events and not by men, certainly not by those who call themselves statemen.</P>
    <P>I want also to talk about our domestic exchange rate for the very good reason that the Minister introduced it in his speech, although very briefly, and also because Deputy Colley brought it into his contribution. It seemed to me that they agreed; and perhaps, even in a general election year, one could with impunity be tempted to disagree with both without suffering politically from a party point of view.  It seems that what we are saying is this: we are all now agreed <Col N="989" /> that it is theoretically established that in a small open economy with a fixed exchange rate with the currency of a large trading partner the small economy imports the long term rate of inflation of its trading partner.  We appear to agree on this.  The Minister for Finance stated it in his budget speech of 1976.  I think Deputy Colley came to the same conclusion speaking on this Bill.  But we then go on to talk simultaneously about domestic causes of inflation.  I suggest this is totally illogical.  You cannot, on one hand, accept the general thesis that a small open economy with a fixed exchange rate with a large trading partner imports the long run rate of inflation of its trading partner and then advert to purely domestic causes of inflation.  You can accept the fact that there may be variations around the long run trend.  This is not just conceptually acceptable; it has to happen. If it happens to be an average, one is talking about something that fluctuates around a mean in any case.  The large trading partner with whom you are linked is itself oscillating around an average and it is conceptually acceptable that you should oscillate around the oscillation.  But despite these oscillations it is inevitable that you are on the same path.  Once we are linked inflexibly to the currency of the other economy so, we cannot say, on one hand, that we can divide the causes of inflation in Ireland into domestic and external and, at the same time, agree that the rate of inflation is externally caused by the par linkage with sterling. It is true that the Central Bank have made that illogical statement&mdash;not unexpectedly.  It is true that they have got a pretty elaborate analysis to distinguish between domestically created and internationally created inflation.</P>
    <P>But if you accept the thesis I have outlined you must ask the following question: will the United Kingdom rate of inflation remain high?  Is it likely to remain higher than that which is current in our continental trading partners, specifically the other members of EEC?  Much play was made in the past 12 months of the fact that the British rate of inflation was higher than the Irish rate of inflation&mdash;as if this proved, on the one hand, that the thesis <Col N="990" /> to which I have adverted was incorrect and, on the other hand, that the Government here were performing worse than the United Kingdom Government.  But last weekend it was pointed out that the UK rate of inflation is now running at 17.6 per cent on an annual basis, with many price increases in the pipeline and therefore likely to go much higher.</P>
    <P>I see no prospect of any diminution in the British rate of inflation and no possibility of it coming down to single figures as the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Healy, seems to think possible.  Further, I think it most unlikely that phase 3 of the wages and incomes policy will be possible.  One had only to look at the television programmes of last week, as those in the multichannel area could do, and see the BBC programme in which many economic interests were involved, not least the trade unions, to judge how weak were the prospects of a phase 3 in the British incomes policy.  I said nine months ago that in the coming summer I foresaw a wage-led inflation in the UK on top of the existing rate of inflation.  There is no such thing, to quote Jack Jones of the Transport and General Workers Union, &ldquo;as an orderly return to free collective wage bargaining&rdquo;.  Free wage bargaining is a disorderly affair, as is currently being seen at Heathrow and in British Leyland.  I think that key unions, such as the AUEW, will eventually come out in opposition to the new wages policy and be added to the very large and important body of trade union opinion in that country which is ideologically opposed to it and to those who also oppose it simply on the grounds that they would get more out of free collective bargaining.  I think phase 3 will disappear as a possibility this summer.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances I believe that those with the greatest economic muscle will use it to restore differentials and that there will not only be a very high rate of inflation in the UK but also a massive increase in unemployment.  The prospect of two million people unemployed in the UK is not beyond the bounds of possibility.  The economic consequences for us, I think, are that we shall then continue to have high <Col N="991" /> interest rates, far higher than our continental partners.  We shall continue to have, in the long run, a high rate of inflation and high wage demands in national pay agreements.  There will be a continuing inhibition on investment and therefore unemployment growth precisely because of this combination of high interest rates and high wage demands.</P>
    <P>I have consistently argued that we have a way out of this situation because we have unique institutional arrangements here which do not exist in the UK for which there are no comparisons, and which are far more sophisticated than anything they have, If one wants an analogy one must go to advanced countries like Scandinavia. That provides us with the key to a very difficult economic situation and gives us the possibility of changing our exchange relationship with the UK. I refer to the Employer Labour Conference. Deputy Colley rightly made the point&mdash;and I do not disagree&mdash;that if we broke the link it would necessitate new discipline which would be tough.  I do not deny that because there is no such thing as a cost-less or easy policy in getting down from a high rate of inflation to a regime somewhat akin to the EEC average.  I accept that fact and I advance this argument of breaking the sterling link at par only because we have in the Employer Labour Conference a sophisticated arrangement for ordering incomes.  In addition, superadded to that conference, we have the tripartite talks.  The two together give us a highly sophisticated apparatus for dealing with incomes, prices, taxation policy and social expenditure, all of which must be combined, in one package so that consensus can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I say consensus could be achieved in respect of incomes policy in the light of Government policy on taxation, prices, social expenditure, and so on, which would enable us to keep the rate of income growth down to such a level that, over a period, we could slide on to a different inflation rate, and move closer to and eventually coincide with the continental rate.</P>
    <P>The recent <i>Economist</i> survey on the <Col N="992" /> Irish economy quotes the former secretary of the Department of Finance and the former Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. Whitaker, on this point. He raised doubts as to whether or not the trade union movement would buckle under the pretty iron discipline which would be required to achieve this aim.  That is an opinion.  However much I respect the individual and his opinions, I take it to be an opinion based on a false evaluation of what would be forthcoming from the Irish trade union movement.  I expressed the belief at a seminar in 1975, at which he was present, on the question of monetary alignments and economic and monetary union, that the Irish trade union movement would play their role responsibly, because the pay-off of a drop in the rate of inflation must obviously be an increase in employment. In the current unemployment context I cannot see how anyone would have serious justification in opposing moderate income increases in a situation where the rate of inflation was itself moderating and where there was a guarantee that this policy would lead to an increase in investment and therefore to an increase in employment.</P>
    <P>The question of breaking the link is a political one not an economic one. If one accepts the economic thesis, which Professor Williamson said at the symposium to which I referred is the most securely established thesis in international monetary economics, that is the linkage between a fixed exchange rate and inflation, the question is: do we believe the British rates of inflation will continue high over the medium term at a 7 to 8 per cent differential over our continental trading partners and do we want that for our own country?  I believe the British rates of inflation will continue to oscillate between 10 to 15 per cent per annum.  That is the prospect which also faces us no matter who sits behind the desk in the Department of Finance if we maintain this par value system with sterling.</P>
    <P>The par linkage with sterling is without parallel in international monetary history.  One can go to the Library and read Fetter's account of the Irish £, 1797 to 1826, and find the origins there of this policy in a report which was <Col N="993" /> chaired by a man whose portrait is outside the Library.  It is very fitting that John Foster, the last Speaker of the Irish House of Commons should be the man who to a certain extent was responsible for consigning us to this ridiculous policy.  We have pursued it without change since 1826.  No other currency in the world has been linked at par with another currency for 150 years or, indeed, for anything approaching that period.</P>
    <P>With respect to the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and those who have been the chief political heads of that Department, the onus is on those who believe we should continue to maintain this policy to prove it was the correct one over 150 years, and still remains so.  It is simply not possible that it was the correct policy in every period over 150 years.  Yet we maintained it.  There was a very strong school of economists who were derided and disregarded, particularly in the 1940s, who propounded a different policy but who, unfortunately, were beaten in the intellectual argument by the schools of economics in UCD and in Trinity.  I refer to the economists in UCC, notably Busteed and, not least, Alfred O'Rahilly.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly, I would be undismayed by the weight of authoritative advice I might hear from the Minister or anybody else as to why we should maintain the existing policy.  Authoritative advice in matters of international monetary economics has invariably been on the wrong side.  It is legitimate in my view to advance the proposition as I now do that one of the primary causes of underdevelopment in the Irish economy over the past 55 years, for about 50 of those years, has been a gross overvaluation of the Irish £ which, in effect, constituted a tax on our exports and a subsidy on our imports.</P>
    <P>Other economies have used the reverse policy deliberately, and in some cases against what was best for the international economic order, so that they could advance their own national interests.  For example, one can think of the amount of abuse which the Japanese had to put up with because of the undervaluation of the yen.  In Germany they also deliberately <Col N="994" /> undervalued the mark in order to develop their own economy.  With the most clear-cut and obvious consequences, we pursued the opposite policy.  The reality is that in terms of monetary policy, because of the linkage of one for one between the Irish £ and the British £, because we are a small open economy trading with a dominant trading partner, we have no sovereign freedom in the area of monetary policy.  In that sense, it is just the same as if the Union Jack were still flying over the GPO.</P>
    <P>It is characteristic of those who say they accept this argument that inevitably we import a long-run rate of inflation, that they always say &ldquo;Now is not the time to break the link.&rdquo; I have had this argument over two or three years with one individual and every time I met him he says, six months ago was the correct time to break the link but not now.  It reminds me of St. Augustine: &ldquo;Lord make me pure but not now.&rdquo;  We are all advocates of Augustinian economics on this matter: let us break the link with sterling but not now.  Let us get our rate of inflation down below the British rate of inflation and then we can do it.  But we can only get our rate of inflation down below the British rate of inflation over a very short period of time if we accept the fact that there can only be short-run deviations around the long-run British trends.</P>
    <P>May I suggest this is such an occasion?  The British rate of inflation is now on the increase.  In the short run, the Irish rate of inflation is on the decrease.  We have just had a national pay agreement.  The British are faced with the prospect of no agreement on the incomes front.  Their major airport is closed.  Could we wish to see any greater manifestation of the British economic disease than that? They are not likely to get out of that situation in the foreseeable future.  The £ is stabilised at the moment because of the apparent temporary resolution of the sterling balances question.  I suggest it will not be so stable by the end of this year.  If we are to be tempted into breaking the last remaining link, the umbilical cord, with Britain this is the time to do it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> It may be that this very modest and very technical Bill provides us with an unique opportunity to make this type of contribution in this House.  It is not often that the affairs of this House are so ordered that one can speak on matters of immediate and national relevance.  I thank you, Sir, for your indulgence in allowing me to stray a little outside the rather technical restrictions of this Bill because I really believe the prospects for this economy can be greatly enhanced if we take unto ourselves the full responsibility for running our own affairs and for giving ourselves the freedom to operate in the area of monetary policy without having to import, willy-nilly, British monetary policy which is invariably opposed to our needs and necessities.</P>
    <P>During the course of the past four years the Minister for Finance has been subjected, on occasion, to a great deal of criticism, indeed, one might say abuse.  He will accept the fact that I have not been silent in offering criticism of him on occasion.  When I was a Member of the other House I said, particularly in the field of taxation reforms, that I regarded him as the best Minister for Finance we ever had and I commended him for his reforms.  I hope that, in the closing days of this Dáil, he might crown his other achievements by at last taking Irish monetary policy and the Irish currency out of the tutelage of a dying and decaying currency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputies Colley, Esmonde and Halligan for their support of this Bill and for their very reasoned comments on what is rather technical legislation.  The real purpose of this debate is to consider the Bill and its background.  Deputies Esmonde and Colley asked for an elaboration of Ireland's role in relation to a possible new International Monetary Fund organ&mdash;the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council will only come into operation when there is a decision to that effect by countries which have 85 per cent of the total voting power of the IMF.  That voting power is related not merely to membership, but to the <Col N="996" /> weight of membership depending upon the resources of individual members. When it comes into operation it will be similar in composition and representation to the present interim committee in that each country or group of countries represented in the fund by an executive director would be entitled to appoint a member to the council.  As in the past, that member would be a Government Minister, or a person of comparable rank, from the constituencies.  Each member would have not more than seven associates who would act as advisers. The structure, therefore, would be quite similar to that operating in the interim committee.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of representation in the IMF, Ireland is grouped in a constituency with Canada and the Caribbean countries, a constituency in which we find ourselves very much at home.  We are in a position to understand the problems of other countries and we get them to understand ours.  We are unique in the European Community by being a member in the IMF with people who are not members of the Community and not having any other Community member in our group.</P>
    <P>The practice has been and is, in relation to other countries in most cases, that the spokesman for a particular constituency is the Finance Minister of the member having the largest voting weight.  In the past, decisions were taken in the interim committee on the basis of constituencies. This meant that sometimes a minority opinion within a constituency would not be reflected in the vote of that constituency, although the practice normally was for the spokesman of the constituency to put other members on notice of the reservations of the minority interest within his own constituency.  When the distinguished Finance Minister of Canada was the chairman of the interim committee it fell to myself to be the chairman of the Canadian-Irish-Caribbean constituency. Now that Canada no longer occupies the chair, it is probable that in the future the Canadian Finance Minister will represent the constituency as a whole.  He will be able to <Col N="997" /> cast votes separately on behalf of individual member countries where there is not a common view.</P>
    <P>The interim committee, and the Committee of Twenty before that, had not power to make decisions.  They were more advisory than controlling institutions.  The new council would be more of a controlling institution. The need, therefore, to have votes correctly reflect the overall membership of the fund has been recognised and will work in the way I have described.  Therefore, it could be said that our role in the future can be more effective and can be seen to be more effective.</P>
    <P>As far as the amendment of the articles is concerned, I would agree with those who said it is largely a legalising of the <i>status quo</i>.  It recognises that the market forces of the world have operated in such a way as to make impossible the preservation of fixed parities.  For some time past the IMF have recognised the need to depart from the strict letter of the law, although there has been a common anxiety to operate with a certain amount of discipline and consultation.</P>
    <P>It must be accepted that in legalising the <i>status quo</i> the IMF are responding to the need for much greater flexibility &mdash;a flexibility which has clearly been necessitated by the speed and extent of economic change in the seventies. It is unlikely that we will return to an era of economic global stability of the kind we experienced in the fifties and early sixties for a long time to come. It is evident now that even with the best will in the world the power value system of the Bretton Woods type, despite its very obvious attractions because of the certainties which it provides, could not have survived the turbulent conditions which have characterised the international monetary environment in recent times.  The essential characteristic of the system now proposed in the amended articles is its capacity for adaptation to accommodate the demands of this very dynamic and uncertain environment.</P>
    <P>The right of members of the IMF to adopt flexible exchange arrangements must be tempered by due regard to each <Col N="998" /> member's international responsibilities. It is only by recognising our individual responsibilities that we can continue to have a flourishing world which grows because free trade and international monetary stability are available.  It is of considerable importance in this context that the IMF will be obliged to exercise firm surveillance over the exchange rate policies of members, particularly with the object of ensuring the avoidance of exchange rate manipulation. The effective operation of this system will require vigilance by all members and, of course, a very special responsibility will fall on the larger countries in the IMF because of the weighting they have in world trade and monetary matters.  They will have all responsibility to ensure the safeguarding of their common interest.</P>
    <P>The evidence of the past six years, despite the impact of the oil crisis and a severe international recession, is that there has been little resort to exchange or trade restrictions.  This gives one reason to believe that there is today a much greater appreciation of global interdependence than heretofore and, therefore, a greater willingness to pool some sovereignty in a spirit of international co-operation.</P>
    <P>The amendment to the IMF articles does not require any change in our existing exchange rate policy.  However, as was to be expected, a number of Deputies used this debate to discuss this topic and particularly our relationship with the £ sterling.  I have stated on several occasions that the policy of maintaining the 1-for-1 relationship between the Irish £ and the £ sterling is kept under continuous review, in particular with regard to the appropriateness of achieving our own economic policy objectives.  But to imagine that breaking the link with sterling would be an easy solution to our problem would be indeed a very dangerous illusion.  I do not think anybody has that illusion.  I would not want anybody to interpret my remarks as inferring that I thought Deputy Halligan suffered from that illusion because I do not think he does for one moment.</P>
    <P>It is true that our present exchange arrangements put constraints on the policy options open to this country <Col N="999" /> in the monetary sphere and entail acceptance of an inflation rate which in the long run cannot deviate from the United Kingdom rate to any large extent.  It must be recognised, however, that inflation would not be eliminated just by breaking the link with sterling, nor would our economic ills be cured by severing the link with sterling.</P>
    <P>Until domestic sources of inflation are brought under control, and seen to be brought under control, a change in the exchange rate arrangements would not benefit this country.  In the modern world if Ireland were to decide to float free from sterling we would have to link to another currency or basket of currencies.  There would be little stability for Irish trade.  We need a certain amount of stability even in an unstable world.  We need as much stability as we can get in our international trade and there would not be much for a country that had a currency bobbing around on the oceans of the world like a cork.  I am afraid that would be the position of a country with a comparatively small economy, as has happened when countries in a position not dissimilar to ours have put a value on their currency which related to their overall trade pattern with other countries. Therefore, we would not be completely free agents in this field.</P>
    <P>We might well put a value on our currency related to our trading operations but that would not be the ultimate factor which would determine the value to be put on our currency; it would be the view of the markets, the view of the world.  Sometimes I have felt a certain sense of frustration at IMF meetings where serious decisions were being taken by Ministers for Finance, governors of central banks, individual experts, international experts and experts of the system itself.  Sometimes as those momentous decisions were being taken in reputable international institutions much greater decisions were being taken in the free markets of the world, by the businessmen of the world lifting their telephones and arranging the sale of currencies across <Col N="1000" /> the markets of the world.  Indeed, even while we are asleep in Europe exchanges are open in the United States of America and, when the American has gone to bed, we have not yet got up and the exchange markets of the world are operating in the Far East.  Therefore, there is a perpetual momentum in currency matters, in commodity prices, in all the factors that influence trade and commerce throughout the world.  It is a never-ending process.  As we close down for Christian festivals others are working in Islam and, when Islam is closed, the Christian world is still operating.</P>
    <P>The world never stands still in economic or currency matters.  One cannot determine them by simple rules and regulations in an international organisation, still less in a small country on its own determining the value which other countries may put on its currency.  I would not wish to have arise the situation that arose in relation to another country not so long ago, a country much wealthier than ours, which severed the long link it had with the American dollar and put a certain value on its currency.  In a very short time indeed that currency sank by over 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is not a decision one takes lightly.  I do not think Deputy Halligan suggests that it should be taken lightly.  I know he has given this problem very earnest consideration.  I would agree with him that it is improbable that on every occasion during the last 150 years on which the Irish £ was in the Snake with the £ sterling it was right for us to be there.  I am sure there were occasions when we might have done better to break out, that there might have been occasions when, had we broken out, we might have done better; we might also have done worse. One must look at the situation and consider how it might operate as of now and in the future.  Even though it might provide some consolation in dealing with short-term difficulties, because of the sense of patriotism which might be evoked if we called on Irish people to defend the value of the Irish £&mdash; because we would be called upon to defend it against the world, the world <Col N="1001" /> with which we want to trade&mdash;if we decided to be away on our own one could not be entirely happy that that sense of loyalty to the Irish £ would last for a sufficiently long period to enable us to establish a value on the £ suitable to Irish economic circumstances. I am not opposed in principle &mdash;and there are circumstances in which I would not at all be opposed in practice, in which I would be quite ready in practice&mdash;to make a change. But let us remember this, if we ever make the change we will be put to the pin of our collar to defend it, and defend it we will have to because there will be nobody around the world ready to defend an unrealistic value we might put on our own currency.  If we behaved in a sensible way&mdash;and this would call for a greater degree of discipline than we have been wont to keep in the past &mdash;we would have to do so not merely for a matter of months but for some years.  But, having done so&mdash;and it is possible; this is as Deputy Halligan sees it&mdash;if we succeeded some of the difficulties with which, willy-nilly, we have to live at present might tend to be lessened.  Certainly they would not be forever behind us because we live in such a continuing changing and challenging world and we have a very open economy, one which I heard recently described as being like a rural sheebeen, always small and open.</P>

      <P>I take it that the terms of the Schedule although, as the Minister said, they do not oblige us to break the link with sterling, may permit us to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Schedule would permit us to do so, may I be permitted to say a few words on the topic?  I am afraid Deputy Halligan has left us, so I will be brief in dealing with what he has said.  Deputy Halligan spoke somewhat emotionally about freedom and sovereignty.  I want to remind the House that in recent years the French and the Danes, who were members of the European Snake, were obliged to withdraw from it because the economic and political circumstances were unacceptable to them.  Therefore, it can be quite misleading to talk about freedom and sovereignty in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was also reference by Deputy Halligan to the relationship between the Irish and British currencies in the last 50 years.  He seemed to ignore the fact that it has been only in recent years that our trade with the UK has come down to approximately 50 per cent of our total foreign trade.  It has been also only in recent years that <Col N="1003" /> there has been a huge drop in the value of sterling.  These are new developments which must make us look anew at our link with sterling.</P>
    <P>My view is that it is inevitable and that we should make up our minds towards breaking the link with sterling. I have no doubts that that is the way in which we are heading and we should try to prepare for it as soon as we can. It is true that the long term effect of that relationship is that our inflation rate will converage in the long term with the British inflation rate, but as Keynes, whom Deputy Halligan was quoting, said, &ldquo;In the long-term we are all dead&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the fact is that if our inflation rate is higher than the British inflation rate, then we converge with the British rate because the higher cost of our goods and higher unemployment automatically bring us down to the British inflation rate.  If on the other hand we are below the British inflation rate we will only converge with the British rate when effectively we achieve full employment, a situation we would all like to see.  We have not been fortunate enough to reach that position in recent years and the consequences are quite clear, that the high unemployment and the high cost of Irish goods are making us converge with the British rate.  However, it would be quite wrong and misleading to suggest that one should not talk of domestic inflation, as Deputy Halligan appeared to have been saying, because of our link with sterling.</P>
    <P>There has been a very clear example in recent times of what can happen in regard to the two inflation rates because of domestic circumstances.  I refer to the 1976 budget, as a consequence of which 5 percentage points of the 20 percentage points that represented our inflation rate in 1976 came straight from the 1976 budget.  Deputy Halligan pointed out that this year our inflation rate appears to be going a little lower than the British inflation rate.  That may not be unconnected with this year's budget here, and indeed, the British budget.  In this country, the Minister finally, I hope, learned a lesson about the consequences of what can be done by the <Col N="1004" /> Government alone, and I am not saying that the Government alone are responsible for the divergence: there are other factors.  What I am saying is that it is wrong and misleading to suggest that because of the link with sterling there is not anything we can do about inflation here, particularly in the medium term.  We have a great deal of control over domestic inflation and if we do not exercise it we will never be in a position to break the link with sterling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not presume to follow the Deputy down many of the laneways he took because they are not all relevant, but I should like to put the matter right.  It was not Denmark which left the European Snake.  It was wealthier and stronger countries, in some respects, France and Italy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Denmark had gone in and had left earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Great pressure came on the Danish kroner and perhaps not unrelated to that there was a widening of the margins of deviation which were allowed and which had to be widened in order to keep the Snake from bursting itself asunder.  That is a fair indication that it is the markets of the world which determine the value at which currencies stand.  That, of course, was not always determined in an emotional way, although sometimes that can be the cause, because some of the most unstable people are those who can dictate the prices of things in the market place.  It is determined mainly by the domestic behaviour of an individual economy, and I agree with Deputy Colley on that.  There can be no getting away from the fact that people will determine the value they will put on your currency by their assessment of the way in which a particular society is behaving itself and managing its own affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a factor that is not sufficiently recognised by many of the <Col N="1005" /> advocates for an instant severance of the relationship between the Irish £ and the £ sterling.  If this country ever takes that step, that action will have to be associated with a wider acceptance of discipline for a number of years than this country has ever practised in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the kind of discipline that we had to some extent, when we had no option open to us between 1939 and 1945.  I do not mean there would be deprivation or want or scarcity of commodities or anything of the kind that was forced on us by external circumstances at that time, but there would have to be disciplines in relation to incomes.  I do not want to get into an argument but when Deputy Halligan, who is not here, was speaking he painted a rather dull and worrying picture of the industrial relations position in Britain.  There are those who are not quite as pessimistic as other commentators but we are not entirely on easy street here either, as anybody would know from reading the daily newspapers.  While we have a national agreement we need to have widespread adherence to that agreement and less attempts by any individual groups to break away from the spirit or the letter of it.  If some persons set a pattern of behaviour through irresponsible conduct in the use of muscle power against the community which gets for them a short term advantage it will simply lead to the kind of chaos here which Deputy Halligan is pessimistic about developing in Britain.  Let us not assume that we have no cause for anxiety.  We have and we have as great a need for discipline this year as last year.  We have a greater need for discipline if we want to achieve that degree of greater economic independence which would be available to us if we were free from such a close association with the £ sterling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would also be idle to assume that even if we were to sever the present linkage with the £ sterling we could ignore the future value of it.  We could not because Britain still remains our principal trading partner both in <Col N="1006" /> relation to the purchase of our own goods and services from us and what we purchase from the rest of the world.  The £ sterling will have for the foreseeable future&mdash;I do not think there is anybody alive who would see a future which would not contain considerable weighting for the £ sterling &mdash;considerable weighting in any arrangement with what is called the basket of currencies with which we would have to be associated if there was a severance of the present linkage. The important thing is that we are free to do it if we want to.  We have been in that situation for many years. Our membership of the IMF does not limit the right which we have to do that.  It is a right which we would exercise subject to the responsibilities which, as members of the IMF, we freely accepted, to consult with people who have an interest with us in the value which we put on our currency.  The IMF involves obligations for all members.  We willingly accept them because as a small country we have more to gain out of an acceptance by the larger powerful economic forces of the disciplines of the IMF than we have to lose.  It is a question of our surrendering a little theoretical economic sovereignty for the greater real benefits which flow to us by the disciplines of the IMF.  The IMF has done a great deal of good since it was established.  It has an even more important future ahead because of the many uncertainties and instabilities which exist in economic affairs. They will always exist but they have increased in number and effect over recent years and it is unlikely that the impact of this uncertain period is going to diminish for some time to come.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;7.&mdash;An Foras Talúntais will remain in its present form.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister, and the House, are aware of the general position of the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to this Bill and of the dire and disastrous measure in it, the abolition of An Foras Talúntais.  It provides for the abolition of the best agricultural organisation in the country, the abolition of an institute that has a well deserved international reputation.  One of the most regrettable aspects of this abolition is that it is being done for base reasons, unworthy reasons, by people who are not involved in the industry at all, by civil servants and a Minister who has no connection with the agricultural industry except the tenuous connection offered by political chance. As far as I know there has not been any consultation with the industry or those involved in agricultural research or with any organised agricultural opinion at all.</P>
      <P>One recalls, with regret, the failure of the agricultural Press, such as it is, to record any note of regret or apology or any restraining voice.  One must recall that the main organ of the agricultural Press, <i>The Farmers Journal</i>, that journal which used boast that it was fearlessly on the farmers' side, must now confess that they are fearfully on the Minister's side, that they are fearfully a Fine Gael organ and are allowing our finest agricultural organisation to be destroyed by a person who has no connection with agriculture except one conferred by politics.  I want to reiterate my belief that there is a base and sinister objective behind this proposal of the Minister.  I should like to reiterate that it is the intention of the Fianna Fáil Party to repeal this destructive legislation at the first opportunity. The Minister has the boots, the silent clodhopper boots that will come into the House shortly to support him in his efforts to punch this legislation through the Dáil but if he has Fianna Fáil will get the authority of the people very soon to repeal it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation strikes at the <Col N="1008" /> industry upon which this country must depend more than any other for economic recovery, for the return of the economy to something like stability, stability which was destroyed by the Minister and his colleagues in the last four years.  We know that these amendments can be defeated by the Minister's &ldquo;boots&rdquo;, none of whom was present and none of whom spoke on this Bill.  Two Government backbenchers spoke on Committee Stage and both spoke against the Bill.  No speaker on the Government side spoke in favour of the measures recommended by the Minister.  This is a shameful, squalid piece of work and we will only have to wait&mdash;we may not have to wait very long&mdash;for the opportunity to repeal this legislation the Minister is now proposing to jackboot through the House.  This is a jackboot operation reminiscent, as I said earlier, of the best days of the Founding Fathers of the Minister's party.</P>

      <P>I support both these amendments.  Nobody approves of this change.  Autonomy is being removed and powers taken away from the institute.  Nobody ever dreamt this would be the evolution in educational research.  I am surprised at the Minister doing this.  We know that there are members of his own party who do not agree with what he is doing.  They have said so openly but they are not here to say it in this House.  We at least have the courage of our convictions. No suggestion ever emanated from any body that this should be the evolution in agricultural research. Under this Bill the Minister and the civil servants will have complete control.  There are farmers on both sides of this House but no farmer on the Government benches has come in to support the Minister.  He is, of course, quite capable of making his case, but we all know that not everyone approves of what he is doing here.  The institute has done trojan work for our agriculture.  I would give no Minister the control the Minister is taking here.  This will damage agriculture. I would appeal to the Minister to accept these constructive amendments.</P>

The Minister's assertion that, because it seems to have the acquiescence of the <Col N="1010" /> leadership of the IFA, it has therefore the support of the farming community generally is not borne out.  That is unsound reasoning even for the Fine Gael Party.  I can assure the Minister that farmers on the ground whom I know well and many of whom I represent, and to whom I belong myself, have a different view.  They view with the most incredulous dismay this wanton distruction of the institute for base political reasons, and nothing but base political reasons, and I promise the Minister that when the time comes we will put this right in due course.</P>

    <P>Section 19, to which our amendment refers, has a particular effect in the case of research.  It is bad enough that absolute control repose in the Minister's hands in the ordinary affairs of the advisory services generally.  I am quite certain the advisory service will be a great deal less effective in the future under the Minister's Bill than it has been in the past, bad and all as it was.  It is not that it was terribly bad, but it was understaffed, underequipped, had been making a little progress, and now the Minister is going to wreck it all.  However, in the case of research, to have a person who has no connection with farming, like the Minister for Agriculture, sticking his nose into something that does not concern <Col N="1011" /> him and about which he knows nothing, is intolerable.  It is bad enough to have this political fooling around but to have this interference by members of the civil service, too, who are more concerned with agri-politics than with the benefits of agriculture, sticking their noses into the business of farmers, is also intolerable.  Therefore we are proposing this amendment to take away some of the absolute control the Minister proposes to give himself under section 19.  We are departing from the realms of reason, of sanity. This type of legislation is not untypical of the general approach of the Fine Gael-run Coalition Government to the affairs of the country generally.  There is a truly fascist approach pervading the Fine Gael Government, and this section 19 is a classic example of the fascist wish to control everything and to confer absolute control on the Minister even in matters about which he knows not the slightest thing.  It is a desire to impose base political control by people unworthy to exercise that control in matters that are vital to the future of the country and therefore obviously detrimental to the future of the country and to agriculture.</P>
    <P>I must reiterate my acceptance of the inevitability of the defeat of our amendments and our intention to put the matter right in due course.  We who set up the institute must undertake to re-establish it at the very first opportunity we get.</P>

      <P>I want to support this amendment even more strongly than the first one.  This is where the Minister takes over and it is very reasonable to ask the Minister to delete these words, because if the authority must have the consent of the Minister for the Public Service in order to &ldquo;approve, arrange for the performance of any activity in relation to any of its functions ...&rdquo;, there is no use in talking about having an independent body; there is no autonomy there.  I believe that provision ties the authority completely. Again there is nothing personal in this. No matter what Minister sits there, I believe he should not have that authority.  The new body should function in the interests of agriculture without <Col N="1012" /> being tied in the manner laid down in this Bill.  I want to go on record as saying that this is the most objectionable of all the provisions in the Bill, giving complete control to the Department.</P>

      <P>I have already explained that this is a matter of almost no significance.  This section is intended to provide for situations where a relatively small proportion of the duties of a Department officer would be proper to the authority and it would not be advisable to transfer him to that body.  The teaching functions of certain members of the staff of the Botanic Gardens who give courses in horticulture is an instance of this kind, and I gave this example before.  Since the effect of this section would be to put additional duties on civil servants, both the Minister and the Minister for the Public Service are clearly concerned. But this only arises if the authority ask the Department to do something on their behalf on an agency basis.  It does not arise in any other situation. Therefore the extent of the concern baffles me because, as I say, it is almost an insignificant matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 11, lines 35 and 36, to delete &ldquo;at least one member&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;at least four members&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am wondering if there was not a mistake in the preparation of the document we have from the Dáil office. Possibly the error is mine.  I do not want to ascribe any blame to people wrongly, but what my amendment had in mind here was the question of the representation on the board of the council that was to be set up under the Minister's Bill wherein the Minister undertakes to have from the committees of agriculture at least one member of the board.  This was obviously an unbalanced situation, even with the present unsatisfactory method of the election of committees of agriculture. My amendment was aimed at achieving a somewhat more equitable representation for the General Council of Committees <Col N="1013" /> of Agriculture in suggesting, instead of &ldquo;at least one&rdquo;, &ldquo;at least four&rdquo;.  It is that intent which I recommend to the Minister and to the House. The Minister must certainly be aware of the grave anxiety that exists in the committees of agriculture and in the general council itself about their representation on the new board.  As the Minister reminded the House on Committee Stage, I have my own ideas about the committees of agriculture and the general council.  I have stated these ideas publicly and I espoused them again on the Committee Stage and there is no need to go into them now.</P>
    <P>The existence of committees some members of which have no connection with agriculture is an unsatisfactory arrangement, and I do not think it would be difficult to elect people from the food industry itself at the same time as members of local authorities, county councils and corporations are being elected.  People from the food industry could be elected on a county basis or, in the case of Tipperary, on a riding basis.  The committees could then legitimately claim to be committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Committees of agriculture exist now on a purely political basis.  In my own county of Kilkenny, where Fianna Fáil could say they have a majority of the popular vote but a minority on the county council, control passes to the Fine Gael Party by the draw of a hat and the committee of agriculture is staffed by people who have no connection with agriculture.  It is a disgrace, a piece of political piracy.  It is the reduction of agriculture to the point of idiocy.  I understand that the same situation exists in County Laois.</P>
    <P>We must also admit that in the case of counties where there is a Fianna Fáil majority they can be just as ruthless. We must look at both sides of the picture.  In my own county Fianna Fáil until some years ago did control the appointment of officers to the county council and they always insisted that every member of the committee of agriculture should come from the agriculture industry.  We gave the other parties, Labour and Fine Gael, the same representation as the people had given and kept for ourselves the bare majority of one member that the people <Col N="1014" /> had given us.  A different situation exists in other counties, sometimes on the side of Fine Gael and sometimes. I regret to say, on our own side.  Be that as it may.  It emerges that the system of electing committees of agriculture is a bad one and we get the wrong people on many of these committees for party political reasons.  Although farmers have party political allegiance themselves they do not think it belongs in their industry which concerns the production and processing and selling of food.  That is what it is all about.</P>
    <P>The Minister is concerned with political domination and there is no need for me to condemn that.  There is no need for me to say any more about the need there is for some approach to a similarity in the composition of the board directors, as we might call them, and the democratic construction of the industry as represented by the votes of the people.  The Minister has indicated that he may introduce an amendment concerning the committees of agriculture. This might be a worthwhile amendment which we could support. but now we are talking about the general council and its representation on the board of the new organisation. We recommend this amendment to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say may be repetition, but we must have some in support of this amendment. If I had my way the amendment would seek eight places on the board and not four.  I feel we are asking very little of the Minister.  He will have to agree that we are entitled to four. After all, the general council consists of members of county committees of agriculture who are now being stripped of all authority.  The Minister is setting up a new board consisting of 24 people but he will not provide at least four places on the board for members of the general council.  As Deputy Gibbons has said, politics do play a part in the committees of agriculture. There are certain counties&mdash; my own is one&mdash;which are dominated by Fianna Fáil.  But it must be agreed that the general council is pretty well balanced.  The chair goes this way or that way over the years so that nobody <Col N="1015" /> could accuse the general council of being biased in favour of any one political party.  While there may be square pegs in round holes in county committees, anyone who has risen to general council level knows his stuff. The general council is well balanced politically and yet the Minister will not accept that they should be entitled to at least four places.  These are the people who are at present in charge of the advisory services.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why the benches opposite are empty.  The hottest people on the general council are the men sitting on those benches. More people have approached me from the Government side than from our own side about the representation of the general council.  Where are they today?  They should stand up and be counted.  The Minister knows that there are as many people on his own side of the House as there are on this side, if not more, who disagree with the fact that he will not provide at least four places for the members of the general council.  I should like to see more than four but they could be elected from each region.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned why he was setting up this statutory body and why he was continuing the country committees of agriculture.  He said he wanted them to be the watchdogs for the ordinary people.  What is the use of a watchdog with no teeth?  If you pull the teeth out of a watchdog he is not much good.  The Minister has pulled the teeth out of the county committees of agriculture.  Even with four places they would be in a hopeless minority on a board of 24.  I am surprised, disappointed and disillusioned. I have said this before and I will repeat it.  The Minister has brought in this Bill and he will not say that the general council is entitled to four places on a board of 24.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider.  I get very hot under the collar about this.  I have worked under various chairmen on the general council, not all Fianna Fáil, and I have worked on committees of that council, and as far as Irish agriculture is concerned they played their <Col N="1016" /> part and gave their service well.  It is a scandal that there should not be agreement on all sides of the House. They should have at least four on the new board.</P>

      <P>Deputy Callanan knows that this is the only organisation getting any such guarantee.  If I were to start putting numbers on it now in advance of having consultations with the various rural organisations that I feel are entitled to representation on this council, I do not know where we would finish.  That could be a very long argument.  It is not possible to decide in advance of having these consultations what would be fair representation. Deputy Callanan goes a little bit outside the amendment when he says I robbed committees of the power, authority and everything else that they have had.  I met representatives of the general council.  They welcome this legislation.  They are very pleased about it and so are the staffs of the county committees.  Deputy Callanan is just making his case.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gibbons also expressed great dissatisfaction about the method by which the county committees are appointed and the type of people of which they are composed but Deputy Gibbons has had his chance and during his time in office he did not see anything wrong with the system.</P>

      <P>The Minister's intervention gives a fairly good illustration of his mentality.  It will be worth reading in the Official Report. The Minister is concerned about pleasing people, pleasing the members of the general council and the members of the committees of agriculture. The one class that he is not so conscious of are the people in the industry itself, the fellows who actually do the job, the producers and workers in the food industry.  I was waiting for the Minister from the time he stood to reply to Deputy Callanan and myself to see how he assessed the way in which he proposed to go down with the farmers.  He was not concerned about them.  He was concerned about the general council, the committees of agriculture and the staffs, about everybody except the poor troops in the field, literally the guys in the field. This is something that we must expect and be prepared for from a person outside the industry.  He is foostering at something he does not understand and will never understand.  He is like <Col N="1018" /> a man who tries to play the &ldquo;Moonlight Sonata&rdquo; on a piano never having touched the instrument before; he never did it himself but he had seen it done.  The Minister is operating on that basis.</P>
      <P>I want to offer him advice.  The Minister should meddle as little as he can with things he does not understand. This Bill is a monstrous piece of legislation.  It is going to cause very great disturbance, fortunately for only a short time because we will pick up the bits and put them back where they were.  Possibly, I would have proposals to improve the business of the committees of agriculture and the advisory services generally.  The Bill the Minister is putting up now is the mixture as before, an endeavour to use an outdated and obsolete system that may have been excellent in the time of Sir Horace Plunkett when the Department of Agriculture and Secondary Education was established in 1903.  This is 1977, and the adaptation, readaptation and further adaptation of the ancient methods of the British Government in this country after the establishment of the Department of Agriculture are a waste of time.  Even in my time in farming there has been an enormous revolution.  In that short 30-year period there has been a mighty transformation.  But in the institutional changes that have accompanied it there is only one notable change and that is the establishment in 1958 or 1959 of the Agricultural Institute by the Fianna Fáil Government.  That produced excellent, brilliant results. The effects of the research work carried out by An Foras Talúntais have pervaded the whole industry, raised farm incomes, raised the quality of Irish products, have spread into every facet of land use, animal feeding, food processing and so on. The Minister and his Department in one fell swoop are going to make civil servants out of many of them and turn them into a lot of automata, and you do not get good ideas from automata. It is regrettable.</P>

      <P>The purpose of amendments Nos. 5 and 6 is to provide that one member of any panel to be set up under the subsection will be a nominee of the Civil Service Commissioners and to give the commissioners the necessary power to nominate a person for this purpose.  At present the staff of the committees of agriculture are recruited by the Local Appointments Commission and the staff of my Department by the Civil Service Commission.  A number of interested parties have suggested that since all of the new staff of the authority will be recruited by the authority themselves it would be of considerable benefit to the authority to have the advice of a representative of the Civil Service Commission on the appointments board. There is a lot to be said for this idea, and these amendments will allow the idea to be put into practice.</P>

      <P>We welcome any proposal made by the Minister or anybody else that would guarantee a fair deal to a person applying for a position in the new service.  One would have a right to be apprehensive about getting a fair deal from the present Government or any organ of the present Government, such as the one being set up under this Bill, having regard for the unprecedented exhibition of nepotism and patronage that has been the standard norm of conduct since the arrival of the National Coalition Government.  The highest office in the land was degraded and blackguarded in recent times by the National Coalition Government, but in the public service, political hacks &mdash;mostly from the Fine Gael Party&mdash; occupy the highest positions in the <Col N="1020" /> State to the lowest.  The Civil Service has been prostituted to carry briefless barristers and jobless hangers-on of the Fine Gael Party throughout the length and breadth of the country.  This fact has been demonstrated at great length by this party over the last few years. One example is the barefaced appointment of unqualified people, such as flower arrangers in Government Departments, to the permanent and pensionable staff of the Civil Service, with living accommodation in Government property.  Any small adjustment that the Minister can make in this Bill to see that this situation is not carried on would be welcome.  For such guarantees as they give, I welcome these amendments as the Minister has explained them.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;34.&mdash;(1) As soon as conveniently may be after the commencement of this section, the Board shall, subject to section 65 and following consultation with the recognised staff associations and trade unions concerned, prepare and submit a staff scheme or schemes for the regulation, control and management of the staff of the Authority and shall indicate in respect of the different grades of staff (either generally or severally, as may be appropriate) the appropriate remuneration, tenure of office, qualifications and conditions of service.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this section was discussed on Committee Stage, I said that the existing <Col N="1021" /> staff need not worry that their present rights and conditions of service would in any way be threatened by the operation of this section.  I repeat that the existing rights and conditions of service of all staff to be transferred are guaranteed in their entirety under section 65, and the guarantee is quite unequivocal.  I also explained that the reason for providing a staff scheme was to create the machinery whereby the different staff groups to be brought together in the new authority could be fully integrated as a team.  There would be no point in bringing the various services together if each was to carry on separately doing its own thing.  I am quite sure that the board would not want this, nor would the majority of the staff.  I am convinced that the staff scheme is the best way of bringing the various staff groups together. No staff scheme can be introduced without the prior agreement of the staffs.  That would defeat the whole purpose of the exercise.  I will suggest to the board, as soon as the authority is established, that some form of council which would comprise representatives of the staff and other interests concerned, should be set up as soon as possible to work out an agreed approach to the preparation of the staff scheme.  This will ensure that the staff will be involved from the outset.  Notwithstanding these assurances, and in deference to the view expressed by some Members of the House during Committee Stage that prior consultation with the staff should be expressly provided for in this section, I have introduced this amendment which makes explicit what is implicit in the whole idea of the staff scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of great concern to anybody interested in even the remnants of the Agricultural Institute.  I am concerned that the research personnel at present still in the institute, and about to be absorbed into the new organisation, should be able to retain their identity, against the day when this legislation will be repealed, so that the institute can be re-established as it had been before its demolition by the Minister. I am anxious about the position of people engaged in research and any <Col N="1022" /> member of the staff on the advisory side.  The provision in section 34, even as amended, seems to put the total control of the movement of staff into the hands of the Minister.  In this context that would be the Minister and the people who surround him, quite a number of whom would have their own axes to grind.  This puts the livelihood and the family welfare of workers in the advisory services on the block.  For that reason the gravest anxiety is felt by me and by people in the advisory services in the research institute.</P>
      <P>We know that the Minister will not accept any amendment except his own, not a single comma will be changed for any other reason.  As Deputy Callanan remarked, it is very little use talking, because we are talking to a Fascist, but we would be failing in our duty if we did not express our anxiety about the possibilities raised under this section.  The Minister could shuttle people that he does not like off to bog stations and replace them with pets of his own.  This is what I would expect to happen having regard to the record of the Fine Gael Party in Government.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 18, to delete lines 32 to 41 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `2.  Every committee of agriculture shall be composed both of persons who are and persons who are not members of the council and the number of members of every such committee who are members of the council shall be&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) in case the committee consists of a number of members which is a multiple of five, three-fifths of that number, and</P>
      <P>(b) in any other case, the number which is the next whole number above three-fifths of the number of members.' &rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that 60 per cent of the members of each committee of agriculture will be elected representatives.  The <Col N="1025" /> House will recall that during the Committee Stage debate a number of Deputies argued strongly that 75 per cent of the members of each committee of agriculture should be elected representatives. This case has been put also by a number of other interests and having considered carefully the various arguments in this regard, I have concluded that elected representatives should be in the majority on these committees.</P>
    <P>However, I am still convinced of the desirability of a strong representation from local voluntary bodies and, consequently, have decided that the best way of achieving a balance between these two objectives is to provide for the 60-40 ratio in favour of the elected members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's amendment suggests that 60 per cent of the representation on committees of agriculture be elected.  The inference is that the other 40 per cent should not be elected but rather selected in one way or another.</P>
      <P>This is not a good idea but neither do I believe that the present method is entirely right.  I have suggested before that the idea of electing separately county committees of agriculture at the time of local elections should be examined and that the electorate in respect of the county committees be limited to those involved in the food industry because these committees are primarily the concern of these people. In this way the committee would be composed of people from vocational bodies such as the farming organisations, the ICA and so on.  In that way we would have committees of agriculture who could claim truly to be representative of the food industry. In such circumstances, too, it would follow legitimately and logically that the general council of committees of agriculture made up of such people would be entitled to have democratically elected people forming a greater part of the control of that body and of the governing body of the Minister's advisory council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the Minister will not accept this idea but I do not know why he is so adamant so far as it is concerned.  Why should he condemn <Col N="1026" /> every proposal, however small, that comes from people like myself, from the inside and claim all the time that he who comes from outside in knows what is good for the rest?  That is not so.  It is an aspect of the situation we are discussing.  You have watchmakers, wheelwrights and all sorts of people on committees of agriculture who have no business there.  The Minister's situation is not very different from that.  I ask him as a person from the industry to reconsider this proposal.  The apparatus he is trying to modernise is too old; it is creaking with old age and about to collapse unless it is replaced.  I am suggesting a method that he might consider.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the change of heart on the part of the Minister in agreeing to change the representation on county committees from 50 to 60 per cent but he has not gone far enough.  I do not want him to think that I believe that there should be nobody on them but elected representatives.  We always had people other than elected representatives on them but the percentage of elected representatives should be in the region of 75.  It is a step in the right direction to have 60 per cent because with the 50 per cent proposed in the Bill we could have a position where there would be no elected representatives on the general council.  Under this Bill, the county councils have to put up a certain percentage of the money required to run the new authority.  With the 50 per cent there could be a line up of political parties with independent members and it could be an independent member of a rural organisation who would be sent to the general council and it need not be an elected representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be thankful for small mercies since we got very little in the Bill.  Public representatives must face the people.  That is emphasised very strongly.  Many things are being taken out of the control of this House, something I do not agree with.  At least, if a public representative does anything wrong he has to give an account of his stewardship whereas a man can be easily elected from some small organisation and he may be very <Col N="1027" /> much inclined to spend taxpayers' money.  He has no responsibility but an elected representative has.  If he does not act responsibly he will be dealt with when he goes before the people again and he will be put out. I should have preferred the Minister to accept amendments Nos. 12, 13 and 14.  I understand these amendments must be discussed with this one.  I want to make clear that no committee objected to or thought that rural and farming organisations should not be on county committees of agriculture. Having sat for two years, we came up with a 75-25 proportion as a fair representation between elected representatives and rural organisations. Nobody should think that the general council wanted to keep rural or farming organisations out of county committees of agriculture.  We wanted to strike a right balance between members who had to be elected and were responsible for spending ratepayers' money and members who were not. Ratepayers' money must be spent since there is no question of all this money coming from the Exchequer.  We will have to put up a certain amount and the county councils will have to do likewise and I think the Minister should therefore have accepted the amendments put down.  However, we are grateful for what we got.  The people most opposed to the 50 per cent were on the Government side and I suppose pressure was put on the Minister to get the change but if we put the matter to a vote to get 75, the people who most talked about the 75 would all follow the Minister.</P>

That does not prevent you from giving a personal view.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not complete happiness and I would not tell an untruth here.  People are better pleased to have it 60 rather than 50 but if it were 50 it would be the same story.  I hope that the agricultural advisers will be as independent and will do as good work for agriculture under the new regime as under the county committees of agriculture when these advisers were independent of everybody.  They were totally independent of politics.  I come from the west where the cooperative movement was unknown but it was set up with the assistance of the advisers who also assisted every movement for the good of agriculture, Macra na Feirme and every rural organisation.  This was done under the county committees of agriculture that are apparently unmentionable now; they are dirt.  Not as much as I personally would like was done because there was not sufficient money.  I should have liked to see the educational programme make more progress under the county committees of agriculture but one has to cut the cloth according to the measure.  If we do as well under the new authority and if there is as much freedom of action for the adviser in five years' time as there is now when he is hindered in no way in giving advice to all, I shall be a happy man.</P>
      <P>It is quite wrong for people to say we had not a good advisory service. We had an advisory service which was starved for money.  We could not do the things we wanted to do.  I had ambitions to do many things in my county.  We are doing the best we can with Directive 161, the educational directive.  We want to continue to educate all farmers irrespective of the size of their farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am worried about how the advice will be given under the new authority. Will the small farmer, the man who really wants it, get the priority to which he is entitled?  In the White Paper it was stated that priority should be given to the development <Col N="1029" /> farmers.  I want to give priority to the small man who is prepared to work to a plan.  The advisers have not got time to advise the farmers now because they are knotted up in paper work.  From now on the county committees of agriculture will have no power.  There will be 60 per cent of public representatives on the new authority.  As far as it goes I welcome it, but we were entitled to 75 per cent. I will continue to say that because I know how free the advisers were under the county committees of agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 26, to delete lines 25 to 32.</P>
      <P>This amendment refers to section 65 (4).  It is submitted to delete that subsection because, in my opinion, the inclusion of subsection (4) provides for the shuttling around the country of members of the staff of the new NAAERA more or less without any reference to their family circumstances, or the work they had been doing, whether they are advisory officers or research people or, indeed, any other members of the staff.  I would be apprehensive that, to use a phrase I have already used, cothrom na féinne would not always be forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interest of members of the staff of the NAAERA the exclusion of subsection (4) should be effected. If it is not, members of the staff and their families may be exposed to unwarranted and possibly unfair transfers to different parts of the country, possibly in some cases staff members whose families were attending school in a particular locality would have to be uprooted and shifted to the other <Col N="1030" /> end of the country.  I would have hoped that this type of possibility would have been excluded in this year of grace 1977.  I would ask the Minister to acknowledge that this subsection should be left out of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained on Committee Stage that I was not prepared to prevent the board from rearranging or redistributing the appropriate duties among the staff.  This should be regarded by everybody as reasonable. The authority must be allowed to deploy their staff to the best advantage. Deputy Gibbons' amendment would restrict the authority in this respect. The amendment I introduced to section 34 (1), together with the existing sections in the Bill, in my view give adequate safeguards to the staff in this connection.  No board or authority would be foolish enough to start kicking people around the country just for the sake of doing that.</P>

We are all aware that we have many appeals by members of the staff of the Department to be sent to various parts of the country for a variety of reasons. They do not feel they are being kicked around when they get that opportunity. This is a rearrangement of duties, not a shifting of staff for the sake of shifting staff.  We would be taking a completely wrong view if we assumed the new authority will be totally unreasonable in their treatment of people and that they will abuse them, so to speak, and abuse their own privileges.</P>

      <P>In page 28, line 20, after &ldquo;that purpose&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and agreed by the member, the legal personal representative, the staff association or trade union, as the case may be, who made the complaint&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The House will recall that every member of the transferred staff of the authority under section 65 is guaranteed no less favourable conditions in regard to salary and conditions of service than those he enjoyed prior to his transfer.  A similar undertaking regarding superannuation appears in section 66.  These guarantees are enforceable in the courts.  Following representations from certain staff associations, I agreed to provide an alternative appeals procedure for staff members who may feel aggrieved in this respect.  Section 69 was included in the Bill to meet these commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 69, as drafted, provides an alternative to appeals to the courts and a complainant electing to appeal to the Minister would be precluded from resorting to the courts.  On further consideration, and following further representations <Col N="1032" /> from responsible staff representatives, I have decided to remove the restriction set out in section 69 and, in effect, to give aggrieved members of the transferred staff the double option of appealing both to the Minister and to the courts.  Amendments Nos. 17 and 18 give effect to this decision.  As a further concession, amendment No. 16 has been put down to provide that the person appointed to hear any complaint under this section must be agreed by all the parties involved.</P>
    <P>These amendments will, I think, reassure all staff concerned that if an appeal is necessary it will be examined and conducted in a fair and impartial manner and that the widest possible means of redress is being made available to an aggrieved party.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann is gravely concerned with the continuing decline in the building and construction industry and calls on the Government to take immediate steps to remedy the situation.</P>
      <P>The building and construction industry in this country is the barometer by which the economy is judged.  It is our most sensitive industry in this respect. If prosperity is on the way, as so many Ministers would like us to believe in this election year, it must show itself in a worthwhile upward movement in the industry.  Of course, the facts are contrary to that: far from showing an improvement the industry is going steadily downhill.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House have presented the case for the building and construction industry here on many occasions over the past three years.  We have underlined the fact, proven by statistics, that the industry is in a critical condition and that Government policy was contributing in no small way to its decline.  We advocated the measures we are convinced are necessary to rehabilitate it.  It was no pleasure for us to find that our warnings proved to be true.  We now despair of getting any worthwhile or positive reaction from the Government or the Minister on this very important matter. Idleness is rife in the construction industry at a time when the queues of people awaiting houses grow longer and longer and when the roads have deteriorated to a point where they are more reminiscent of the twenties and thirties than of the last quarter of the 20th century.</P>
      <P>It is obvious to all concerned that no steps will be taken by the Government to stop the increasingly rapid decline in the industry much less put it on the road to progress.  It is equally clear that only a change of Government, which will generate badly-needed confidence in the industry, can result in a positive, constructive approach to its development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1036" /> While we await the desired intention of the Taoiseach to call a general election, we must continue in our efforts to convince the Government to accept what everybody else knows to be a fact, that is, that there is a crisis in the industry.  If this had been accepted by the Minister and the Government, some progress could have been made because acceptance of it would have generated the necessary drive to overcome the problem.  For so long as the Minister refuses to acknowledge that there is a problem in the industry, so long will we await a solution.  Meanwhile, employment in the building and construction industry will continue to fall.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has accepted that the Coalition financial policy has been a disaster and he has attempted to reverse his policy with the aid of published Fianna Fáil documents. In that situation I cannot see why the Minister for Local Government would not do likewise.</P>
    <P>The total number of houses completed in 1976 fell by 4,094 as compared with 1975, a drop of 15 per cent.  This fall was reflected in both the public and private sectors of the house building industry.  These are cold statistics contained in the Local Government Quarterly Housing Bulletin.  Does the Minister accept the figures of his own Department?  The fact is that he does not.  He says they are too low.  I would draw attention to the fact that the Department were producing high figures for house completions in spite of all the signs to the contrary, such as unemployment in the industry and a fall in cement sales. Did we ever hear a suggestion from the Minister that the high figures could be regarded as incorrect?  Far from it. The Minister defended those figures and charged anybody who questioned them with questioning the integrity of civil servants.  The facts are there and the Minister will not get away with the suggestion that figures are correct only when they suit him.</P>
    <P>He has now decided to use a new system of calculation of house completions&mdash;the ESB data on their meter installations.  Provided such changes <Col N="1037" /> are made by the ESB, this system in the long term could be useful; but in the short term it appears to me to be a very opportune change in this election year particularly if we are to use the figures which will be produced for comparative purposes.  Formerly a completed house became a completed house when the final portion of the State grant was paid, and such payment was made some time after the house had been completed and occupied, in many instances months and even years later.  With the new system a house can be calculated as having been completed when the ESB have connected it.  The ESB can have connected before the house has been completed.</P>
    <P>I could give examples of houses completed in March, 1977 which could be connected immediately and they would then figure in the quarterly bulletin in the number of houses completed for the quarter ended 31st March, 1977, although a house completed in March, 1975, would not have the final payment of the grant until a year later and would not therefore have figured in the Department's housing statistics.  Therefore, any comparisons between housing statistics for the quarter ending March, 1977, and previously would be spurious.  I have no doubt the Department will compare them with previous quarterly statistics and will say that the figures for 1976 were incorrect.</P>
    <P>While still on the matter of comparisons, might I point out that the downward trend in local authority houses completed continued at an accelerated rate in January, 1977.  In January, 1976, 580 houses were built compared with 275 in January, 1977, a fall of 53 per cent.  This, of course, was to be expected when we note the consistent fall in the number of local authority houses under construction or at the tender or planning stages from 1975 to date.  In January, 1975, 34,739 houses were at those various stages of construction.  In January, 1976, the figure was 32,015, a drop of about 8 per cent; and in January, 1977, it was 29,129, a further drop of 9 per cent.</P>
    <P>This, in my view, is the really <Col N="1038" /> serious aspect of the whole matter because when we have a sharp fall in the construction, tender and planning stages we must accept a considerable drop in the number of completions. The number of local authority houses at the planning stage fell by 2.530 in January, 1977, as compared with January, 1976, that is, 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>Whatever the Minister may say about incorrect figures in relation to completions in 1976, the fact remains that the trend throughout the local authority housing programme shows the same decline, and the same trend runs through the private sector if one judges from statements made by those in a position to know.  It is very difficult to get meaningful figures from the Department of Local Government in regard to trends in the private sector of the industry.  I have tried to get them on a number of occasions without success.  This is an indifferent way to run a Department.  It is necessary that statistics of this kind should be available to us so that we can have a clearer view of the exact situation.  It has appeared to me at times that there is a section in the Department whose main function is to produce figures with such a series of variations that unless one was to spend a considerable time trying to decipher them one would find it impossible to make head or tail of them.</P>
    <P>If we look at cement sales on the home market we will find the same gloomy picture as in the house completion figures.  Cement sales in 1976 were slightly up as compared with 1975 but we must remember that the sales in 1975 were low, and we find a return to declining sales in the last quarter of 1976 as compared with 1975, and a particularly severe fall in January, 1977 as compared with January, 1976.  In reply to a question which I put to the Taoiseach today asking for total sales of cement on the home market and the percentage fall in January and February of 1976 and January and February, 1977, I was told that the total sales of cement in the former period were 211,600 tons.  The sales for the latter period were given as 186,800 tons, the drop being 12 per cent.  I do not have to <Col N="1039" /> point out that this is a very serious matter in the context of the consequences for employment in the industry. I would point out also that sales of cement to farmers increased considerably in 1976 and although this, of course, is a good thing in itself, it did not help to build many extra domestic dwellings because the cement would have been used for other farming purposes.  Neither did it increase the number of building workers in employment.</P>
    <P>The public capital programme for housing in 1977 was not increased by a penny in the budget allocation.  It shows a fall at current prices of £13.4 million, or 11 per cent on the money made available for housing in the public capital programme for 1975.  If one were to take the relative amounts at constant prices, taking inflation into account, the fall became a catastrophic one of £39.9 million, or 35 per cent. Is it any wonder we have a crisis in the construction and building industry? Yet, despite all the statistical evidence available to the Government and the Minister, they have refused to acknowledge that there is any crisis or problem in the industry.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the public capital programme I should like to point out that the percentage of the public capital programme devoted to the building and construction industry has fallen since 1975 when the percentage was 38.6.  In 1976 it was 33.5 and in 1977 21.9, and it took an election year to prise a little more money from the Exchequer for the building and construction programme.  Even with the extra money made available in the budget, the percentage this year is still below the 1976 level in productive terms.  Let me again underline the fact that there was a considerable drop in real terms in the money made available for building and construction in the 1977 budget as compared with 1975.  In estimating the situation I took relatively low inflation rates, 18 per cent for 1976 and 14 per cent in 1977. I know now that these rates are very much too low.  In reality, the percentage fall was much greater.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank in its winter report for 1976 stated that investment in <Col N="1040" /> the industry fell, but what I consider to be of enormous importance is that the Government in 1976 deliberately chose to underspend by many millions of pounds the amounts allocated in the public capital programme for that year. And of course all of the matters I have referred to&mdash;the drop in the amount of money in the public capital programme for housing, the failure of the Government to provide anything extra in the budget, the fall in investment in the industry&mdash;have resulted not only in a severe drop in the number of houses being constructed but have had a catastrophic effect on employment in the industry.  In reply to a recent question to the Taoiseach asking for the average number employed in the industry in 1974, 1975 and 1976, the figures I got, to April in each year, were 72,000, 66,000 and 60,000, a fall of 12,000 since 1974, and the trend is continuing.</P>
    <P>The real gravity lies in the fact that the industry, properly financed and injected with much needed confidence, is the one industry that could contribute and quickly generate a considerable number of jobs and help in a positive way to ease the frighteningly high unemployment.  Since 1974, the public capital programme and the lack of adequate provision in budgets show that from a practical point of view this Government have nothing to offer.</P>
    <P>I have stated on many occasions that it is futile and thoroughly misleading to quote comparative amounts of money spent in the industry without having due regard for the horrific inflation problem from which we are suffering, the highest in the EEC.  In 1972-73. Fianna Fáil built approximately 22,000 dwellings for £52 million, and last year the Government built the same number for £112 million.  Of course, the number of pounds spent is not the basic matter but rather what the pounds produce in terms of buildings and general construction. I have no doubt the Minister will tell us that the Coalition spent £X million compared with £Y million spent by Fianna Fáil, but this has no relevance unless it can be shown that the extra money provided more houses and more jobs.  The opposite is the truth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1041" /> I have shown numbers in relation to houses built and I should like now to tell the House that the number employed in the industry fell dramatically, even though the money was more than doubled.  The gross output of the construction industry for 1974, 1975 and the estimated figure for 1976 was: 1974, £458 million; 1975, £527 million; and 1976, £627 million.  On paper this appears to be a worthwhile increase but if one takes the gross output at constant prices there is a very different picture, the figures being, for the years mentioned, £196 million; £188 million and £189 million, a fall of 4 per cent between 1974 and 1976 in real terms.  They are all official statistics, not mine.  The building and construction industry itself is convinced that the fall is in reality much greater, that the overall drop in construction work has been about 10 per cent.  The Central Bank report published in January showed a drop of 6.3 per cent in volume in house building.  I would point out again that cement sales on the home market in 1976 were considerably lower than in 1974 despite the fact that 1974 was a bad year for the building societies.</P>
    <P>In an industry which in everybody's view, except obviously the Government's, is capable of a really worthwhile development the present situation is disastrous.  Many statements by the Government, by the Taoiseach and by the Minister for Local Government at the openings of housing schemes and elsewhere that the State is providing so many millions for building construction work and building societies, banks and insurance companies are providing so many more millions have very little merit if as a result of all these efforts we have now a situation where there were 4,000 fewer houses built in 1976 as compared with 1975 and almost 25,000 building and construction workers unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Government have on a number of occasions boasted about the number of local authority houses that have been built.  But what has not been alluded to is the fact that, because the Minister for Local Government has persistently refused to increase <Col N="1042" /> the SDA maximum loan level and the qualifying income limit for such a loan and because he has removed the right to State grants from a very large percentage of those who had previously been entitled to them, he has thereby pushed large numbers of people who would normally have built their own houses on to local authority housing lists, far more people indeed than he can accommodate in the extra houses that are claimed to be built, so that the last state of these people in relation to their housing needs is worse than their first.</P>
    <P>There was a fall of over 1,500 local authority houses in 1976 compared with 1975 and that has exacerbated the whole situation.  I said before, and I propose to continue saying it, that the building and construction industry, if properly financed and directed, could provide a substantial increase in employment in a short space of time without any detrimental effect on our balance of payments.  Most of the materials used are home produced and the construction industry is the ideal industry to help counteract the effects of the recession, a recession for which the Government have a considerable responsibility.  If one is to judge by the fact that there is not one extra penny in the budget for housing then it is true to say that the Government show very little concern for the 25,000 building workers who are unemployed not to speak of the thousands of others who became redundant in ancillary industries.  A 100 per cent increase in unemployment among building workers in the space of two short years is totally unacceptable.  The only reason these people lost their employment was because of the incompetence of the Government in relation to the provision of proper financial resources for house building and other construction work.  The percentage of the total labour force in the construction industry now out of work has risen by 18.8 per cent to 22.1 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is deplorable at a time when we have well over 115,000 people unemployed to find so many people unable to get homes of their own.  The industry could do a great deal to reduce <Col N="1043" /> this horrifying unemployment figure. Any suggestions put forward by us to remedy this shocking situation are met with one answer only and, paradoxically, that answer takes the form of a question: we are invariably asked whether we are aware that there is a financial crisis.  The answer is of course we are aware of it but we are also aware that even a tiny percentage of the total amount of money now needed after four years of Coalition Government to service the national debt would be sufficient to put this industry on its feet.  We are also aware that whatever this Government may do we, in Fianna Fáil, are not willing to stand aside while thousands of our unemployed could be placed in employment. I reject entirely the philosophy of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach who said on one occasion here, when I stated what we proposed to do, that what I was proposing would not grow on a blade of grass.  In so far as we are concerned we recognise a very serious unemployment problem and we believe in taking the necessary steps to resolve it.</P>
    <P>What can we do then to help to revive this ailing industry?  The first step in my view is to adopt the Fianna Fáil policy announced last September and inject £30 million extra into the construction industry.  This would provide an estimated 5,000 extra jobs in this hard pressed industry.  I see no reason why this Government, who are clearly bereft of any worthwhile ideas, should not adopt this proposal having already stolen a large part of our policy and incorporated it in the now moribund Green Paper.  A study of our financial proposals pinpoints where the money will come from.  The confidence which a change of Government would, of course, engender would undoubtedly see a flow of home-based money being made available.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat the demand that the SDA loans and the qualifying income limit be raised to realistic levels.  The substitutes provided by the Minister have shown themselves to be ineffective. This demand which was initiated by us has now got the backing of local <Col N="1044" /> authorities, trade unions and employer bodies and even of the Labour Party at one of their annual conventions. This scheme was the backbone of the private sector of the house building industry and it has been virtually wiped out by the deliberate action of the Minister and the Government. Whole categories of people whose nominal incomes have increased above the limit while their living standards have been reduced are no longer eligible.  Large numbers of families are being forced on to the ever-lengthening local authority housing lists where many will remain for years before getting houses.</P>
    <P>There is scarcely any need for me to recapitulate the situation in relation to SDA loans.  It has been done very often here but with no effect on the Minister or on the Government. Briefly, the maximum SDA loan is £4,500 and the qualifying income limit is £3,350.  The situation has remained so since May, 1973, when the average price of an SDA loan house was £5,900.  Remember, at that time everybody was entitled to a State grant and very many to supplementary grants as well which meant the borrower had to save only a relatively small amount to put himself in the position to build or buy his own house.  Today the loan and the qualifying limit remain the same.  There is no grant of any kind available and the average price of the SDA loan house is now approximately £9,000.</P>
    <P>There is no need to dwell further on the matter except to say that understandably the drop in the number of loan applications has been catastrophic.  We had an excuse from the Minister for Finance.  He gave a rather peculiar reason as to why the number of applications for loans had dropped.  The basic fact is that these SDA loans were intended for people in the lower income group to give them an opportunity of building or purchasing their own homes.  This opportunity has now been taken from them by the Government.  My party believe in encouraging young people of initiative to develop and make progress in whatever field.  Indeed, the greatest damage done by the Coalition <Col N="1045" /> Government is the stultifying of initiative and the destruction of the confidence of the people and particularly of the young in the future of the country. When we return to Government shortly we will increase the loan limits and we will raise the qualifying income limit to realistic levels thereby giving our young people once again the opportunity to build or buy their own homes and, at the same time, give a much needed boost to the hard-pressed building industry.</P>
    <P>I mentioned before that we propose to invest a further £30 million in the building and construction industry, to raise the SDA loans and qualifying limits to realistic levels, to remove rates from dwelling houses and to make worthwhile grants available to first purchasers.  I believe that these proposals of ours will create the confidence and the drive and initiative to once again put this great industry on its feet and to provide homes for our people and much needed employment for, as I mentioned before, the very many unemployed building workers who are now lengthening the queues outside the employment exchanges.</P>
    <P>The most recent blow inflicted by the Minister on the construction industry was the curtailment of grants for housing reconstruction.  Reconstruction grants are now available only to those whose valuation is under £10 in rural areas, under £15 in urban areas and under £20 in city areas, where heretofore everybody was entitled to a reconstruction grant and a supplementary reconstruction grant.  This effectively cuts down on the number of people employed, particularly in the smaller construction companies.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this matter which should create concern.  Some years ago An Foras Forbartha submitted a report to the Minister on our housing stock which the Minister, in reply to a Dáil question by me, stated was not as complete as he would like it and had it returned to An Foras Forbartha for further consideration.  In reply to a more recent question by me, the Minister stated that he had not yet received the further report but that he hoped to have it by October.  At the moment we can only judge what our housing stock is like by a comparison <Col N="1046" /> with the situation in Northern Ireland. If we are to judge by the statistics on housing stock in Northern Ireland and if we reckon that there must be a close similarity between their stock and ours, then a relatively high proportion of our housing stock must be in a bad way and if it is not seen to immediately will have deteriorated past the point of no return.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious situation indeed and does not suggest that the present is a time when we should cut back on reconstruction grants.  The reverse is true.  Far from cutting back on grants we should be making grants available which would help bring existing houses in need of reconstruction up to modern standards.  This is something to which we shall give serious consideration.</P>
    <P>For many years we took our roads for granted.  There were relatively few complaints.  More and more roads were being improved and more and more dust-free roads were being made available. The roads were being properly maintained and the financial provision was fairly adequate.  Today there are few areas in relation to which so many complaints, and justifiable complaints at that, are being made.  Roads have deteriorated to such an extent that, as I said earlier, they are more reminiscent of the twenties and thirties than they are of the last quarter of the twentieth century.  Even major roads show potholes, while many of our major roads have deteriorated to a very grave extent.</P>
    <P>In this day and age, when road transport has become a vital sector of our economic development, this situation is deplorable.  It must be quickly rectified if we are to get our economy going again and if we are to provide for the motorist the facilities which are his due and for which he is paying dearly.  The basic cause of the serious deterioration in our roads is the lack of Government concern and the poor financial assistance for road building and road maintenance.  At a time when the Government claim to be removing health charges and housing subsidies from the rates&mdash;something which they have since, in part, reneged on&mdash;they were at the same <Col N="1047" /> time increasing the proportion of expenditure on roads with money derived from rates and reducing the percentage being made available by the State.  In real terms over the past four years the State's contribution dropped by 27 per cent.  In 1960 the total road mileage was 51,463 and by 1973 the figure had increased to 55,306, which was an increase of 3,843 miles or 3.8 per cent.  I have not been able to get statistics for 1974 to 1976, but it is obvious there was an increase then too.</P>
    <P>Over the last ten years the vehicle population has increased by 44 per cent and fuel consumption has increased by 73 per cent, all of which would indicate that roads are required to carry more traffic more frequently; this causes road deterioration, and a high degree of maintenance is necessary. However, between 1973 and 1976 1,000 road workers have been made redundant at a time when the figure should have been increased.  Not only that, but because the flow of road building material was reduced there were many more redundancies in ancillary employment such as quarrying. Again this is an area where employment could be created quickly.</P>
    <P>Grants to local authorities amounted to £21 million in 1974, £20 million in 1975 and £20 million in 1976.  If one were to take these amounts in real terms they would show a dramatic fall in the amount of money being made available by the State for road work.  This year of course, an election year, an increase was granted, but in real terms the amount given would not equal the 1975 grant and, in fact, in 1976 it would have been necessary, instead of making £20 million available, to make £34 million available if the same amount of work was to be done as was done in 1976 with the £21 million.</P>

      <P>This is construction. <Col N="1048" /> In my view, the Government have great power to influence the fortunes of the building and construction industry. Directly and indirectly, they finance a very high proportion of the total development.  There is a growing population since Fianna Fáil ended emigration, and our rate of growth in this industry must be greater than that which has taken place over the past two decades.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate of growth in the construction industry in the 1960's was 8 per cent.  The average annual growth for the first six years of the decade has been between 2 per cent and 3 per cent.  The decline in the past two-and-a-half years has cancelled out to a great extent the development under Fianna Fáil in the earlier part of the decade.  The Government are incapable of making the necessary decisions or of getting their priorities right.  As Fianna Fáil were successful before, after previous Coalitions, in putting the economy on its feet, it will take Fianna Fáil to put it on its feet once again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government willingly concede and fully acknowledge that the building and construction industry is one of our major industries and we in no way wish to diminish the importance of that industry to the economy.  It is necessary that the industry should remain in a healthy state, and I think it is fair to say that, despite the generally depressed state of the economy in recent years, the industry is still in a very sound condition and is continuing to improve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was rather taken aback by the only solution put forward by the Fianna Fáil Party here this evening, namely, that the total capital programme for the industry should be increased by £30 million.  The Fianna Fáil Party are being alarmingly conservative, because I think it is fair to say that this year the gross output of the industry should be at least £750 million.  What do we get from Fianna Fáil?  In a year of major policy innovations, when philosophical economists <Col N="1049" /> are being foisted and airlifted in constituencies, what does one get?  A suggestion that the total expenditure in the industry should be increased by £30 million or 4 per cent.  Fianna Fáil are being very conservative, to say the least.  The industry itself will generate far more than that figure this year in real terms and I have no doubt that the improvement in the general economic situation will put the Fianna Fáil figure almost into irrelevancy.</P>
    <P>Great play has been made by Deputy Faulkner of sales of cement. Home sales of cement, which traditionally offer a very good general indication of trends in output in the industry, were up about 3.3 per cent in 1976 compared with 1975 and we expect that the sales of cement this year will maintain this improvement. I would, therefore, suggest to the Fianna Fáil Party that, despite very substantial increases in costs in the industry last year and this year, nevertheless there will be a very reasonable increase in projected output in real terms in 1977.  That output increase should certainly be at least another 4 per cent in 1977.  The construction industry always tends, being at least six or eight months behind, to mirror the general improvement in the economic situation.  With the drop in inflation in the economy now and with the improvement in interest rates in the economy now, it is fair to say that by the middle of 1977 the construction industry will mirror that general improvement.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest that the construction industry will be very strongly influenced this year by direct inputs such as the Government's allocations of the public capital programme, the provisions in the various Estimates for current public expenditure, such as roads and local authority housing maintenance, and certainly the mortgage finance expected to be available both from the Exchequer and the main commercial lending institutions will give a substantial impetus to the industry in 1977. I would point out that the Government deliberately decided on a public capital allocation for this year affecting the construction industry and <Col N="1050" /> a total input of no less than £350 million approximately.  That represents an increase in current terms of 20 per cent compared with the 1976 allocation of just under £293 million.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I think the Fianna Fáil Party do the nation very little credit and give very little confidence to construction firms, cement producing firms, allied industrial firms and building workers.  They sell them very, very short by predicting and confidently asserting that we are in a state of total slump in the construction industry when in fact we are not; by confidently asserting that we are in a state of depression when we are not and that there is a major recession in the industry.  There is not.  The industry is going through a difficult period.  It is surviving and it is growing at a relatively reasonable rate.  It is not growing as fast as we would wish but it is not at all the kind of second-hand industry which the Fianna Fáil Party are making it out to be at this stage of our economic development.</P>
    <P>There has been a massive increase in the public capital programme.  It shows that the Government have kept the needs of the industry well to the forefront when allocating the scarce capital resources available.  The Government provided an additional injection of about £20 million in the recent budget in addition to the public capital allocation.  This money will be used for the construction of schools. One reads week after week of new tenders being signed and new school projects being sanctioned, of public buildings, of advance factories and factories, of roads and telephones. There have been more telephone installations in the past three years than in the last ten years of the Fianna Fáil administration.  The figures are there for all to see.  That is one example.  There has been more harbour development and more farm building in the past three years and in addition the current revenue expenditure affecting building and construction is expected to amount to £116 million this year compared to about £100 million in 1976, an increase of 16 per cent.</P>
    <P>One can see the advertisements in <Col N="1051" /> last evening's newspapers in Dublin.  I read both the <i>Evening Herald</i> and the <i>Evening Press,</i> lest there be any suggestion of partisanship.  There were at least a dozen advertisements in last night's <i>Evening Press</i> looking for bricklayers, builders' labourers and so on.  They are required by firms such as Fitzgeralds of Blackrock and Sisks. There are vacancies for JCB drivers, concrete finishers and labourers.  There are bricklayers required in Wicklow town and labourers in Castleknock. There has been a substantial improvement. There was an advertisement in the <i>Evening Herald</i> on the 16th April offering jobs for concrete labourers in Clondalkin.</P>
    <P>There has been a growth in the number of skilled workers required in the industry and it very much illbecomes Deputy Faulkner and his colleague to come into the House when in 1973 there was not a piddling whimper from them about the fact that there were 14,000 or 15,000 construction workers idle.  Deputy Faulkner is one of the few front bench members of the Fianna Fáil Party whom I regard with a degree of friendship and with a great degree of respect.  It is fair to point out to him that in January, 1972, there were 15,000 people unemployed in the construction industry.  In January, 1973, there were 14,500 unemployed and I willingly concede that that figure has grown by no less than 10,000 in the past four years.  That is a measure of the substantial degree of redundancy in the industry but one would be very foolish not to take into account that it is an indication of major productivity changes in this industry, major changes in construction techniques, and that is a factor not much underlined.  To suggest, as has been assiduously suggested by the Fianna Fáil Party, that the Coalition are solely responsible for 25,000 workers in the construction industry being on the live register is nonsense. Nobody knows that better than the Fianna Fáil Party because throughout the last four or five years of their office at any time there were anything from 12,000 to 15,000 construction workers unemployed in the industry which is an industry of considerable <Col N="1052" /> fluctuation of employment and in addition considerable labour mobility.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner referred to housing.  I concede that housing is perhaps the most important area of the building and construction industry. It accounts for no less than one-third of the total output in the industry.  In the last four years since the National Coalition Government came into power there has been an unprecedented upsurge in housing activity, and I challenge any Fianna Fáil speaker in that regard.  We in the Coalition set ourselves a target of 25,000 new houses a year and the figures that are now available show that not less than 100,000 new houses were completed during the four years from 1st April, 1973 to 31st March, 1977.  This represents an average of at least 25,017 new houses a year, and this achievement cannot be over-praised in comparison with the Fianna Fáil new house completions figure of 167,136 for their last 16 years in office.  The average of Fianna Fáil's completions in the last 16 years of their office was simply 10,446 new houses a year.  Of our total of at least 100,000 houses about 28,000 have been provided by local authorities in the past four years compared with 20,500 new local authority houses provided in the previous four years.  We have provided 7,500 more local authority houses in the four years than were provided in the preceding four years of the Fianna Fáil Government, and this reflects the Government's commitment to a proper social housing programme.  We have provided an increased number of houses for those families in need who cannot afford to provide their own houses.</P>
    <P>It must also be noted that local authority houses are now being built to very high standards of layout, design and amenity.  The low-cost housing operations of the Fianna Fáil Administration, which have caused untold problems and hardships because of their penny-pinching attitude to their social housing programme, have been ended by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Tully, to his eternal credit.  The new local authority tenants need no longer envy the housing conditions of their neighbours in non-local <Col N="1053" /> authority housing estates.  I challenge the Fianna Fáil Party to come out to the constituency I represent and I will take them to Sandyford, Shanganagh and Shankill and show them those houses.  They are the pride of those who live in them and of the members of Dublin County Council of which I am proud to be a member.  Output in housing, therefore, has increased from £117 million approximately in 1972-73 to about £222 million in 1975 and almost £256 million in 1976.  This represents 119 per cent in 1976 as compared with 1972-73, the last year of the Fianna Fáil Administration.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we are proud of our record in housing, and I would suggest that one of the most damaging statements which has ever been made in this House was made by the Leader of the Opposition when he criticised the Government's housing policies.  On 17th December, 1975, and again on 28th January, 1976, the Leader of the Opposition in criticising our housing policy programme said &ldquo;What has gone wrong is that there are too many local authority houses being built&rdquo;.</P>

With due respect, when there is a general election and when that is included in our election manifesto to all those who are still in need of houses, and the housing list in Dublin is substantially diminished, I do not think the people will be too pleased at the viewpoint of Deputy Jack Lynch on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, we have to look at a number of aspects in <Col N="1054" /> relation to housing.  One of the two major points which we have succeeded in introducing in relation to the programme for housing is that we also got rid of the unjust lending and sale scheme which Fianna Fáil imposed on local authorities and we replaced it by an equitable scheme acceptable to local authorities and to their tenants. This gave something of a boost to the industry.  Likewise, I point out that in the three years to March, 1973, 15,000 houses were vested in the tenants, an average of about 5,000 a year.  In 1975 alone 11,800 houses were vested and about 16,000 further applications to purchase were being considered by local authorities at the end of 1975. That is sufficient in terms of general housing improvement.</P>
      <P>Those who decry the efforts of the Government should go to Tallaght and visit south County Dublin and see the major local authority estates in the greater Dublin area.  It will be noted that very special steps have been taken in tackling the problem by the Government in the Dublin area.  A total of about £40 million has been allocated to the three local authorities for our needs in 1977.  This compares with Fianna Fáil's miserable £10 million in 1972-73.  Inflation or no inflation, the increase in capital allocation for housing in the greater Dublin area has been phenomenal.  To take one local authority area alone, Dublin Corporation, a total of £26 million has been allocated to that authority for house-building operations in this year.  In 1973 the amount was only £6.5 million.  In 1976 Dublin Corporation completed 1,600 new houses, which is a fantastic record for any period of 12 months, and people got those houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since there has been great play by Fianna Fáil in relation to private housing, I suggest that this year we will see completed about 14,000 to 15,000 new private houses.  That is my estimate in terms of trends this year alone.  It should be accepted as being very significant that the building societies this year alone will be financing at least 6,000 new houses.  We tend to ignore in terms of building society financing that this year the building societies estimate that they <Col N="1055" /> will be making the best part of £100 million available for private house building.  The banks estimate that they will provide about £30 million this year for private house building.  The money is being made available and Deputy Faulkner knows this.  Since the Government, quite correctly, put the screws on some of the insurance companies they have indicated that they will provide the best part of £9 million for house building this year.  That means that a great deal of money will be available this year for private house building, in addition to the money being made available under local authority loans. This year the main commercial agencies will make mortgage finance available to the extent of £150 million. That is good news of a legitimate non-Jeremiah type which we hear from the Fianna Fáil Party.  The country is not on the rocks in terms of the construction industry.</P>
    <P>Added to this is the new subsidised low-rise mortgage scheme which was announced by the Minister for Local Government.  It is a great credit to the Minister.  I am always reluctant, as a member of the Labour Party, to lavish praise on a colleague but one can legitimately say that the present Minister, and the late T.J. Murphy, will go down in history as the two best Ministers for Local Government which the country has been honoured to have.</P>
    <P>As we know, under the low-rise mortgage scheme, tenants and tenant purchasers who surrender their houses in exchange for loans to buy private houses will have loans of up to £7,500 maximum available to them, and the State subsidy is very considerable in that regard.  There is also a local authority subsidy available under that scheme.  All the indications are that there is a great deal of interest in the low-rise mortgage scheme.  Its principal advantage is that it will enable persons of limited means to buy their own houses rather than depend on a local authority exclusively to provide accommodation for them.</P>
    <P>I have been one of the major critics <Col N="1056" /> of the building societies but I can indicate a substantial improvement in their overall economic contribution.  I deplored and bitterly resented the way in which some of the building societies reacted recently to the dropping of interest rates.  They were very quickly and very properly brought to heel by the Minister for Local Government.  I welcome the recently announced reduction in the mortgage interest rates to 11.5 per cent.  In 1977 this should be a considerable incentive to house builders.  Although it appears that the higher rate of almost 14 per cent in operation since November, 1976, did not apparently deter a substantial number of new house buyers, the very considerably reduced commitments which are now available with the lower rate should boost demand for houses.</P>
    <P>The inflow of funds to the societies for the first three months of this year totalled £21.2 million compared with £20 million for the same period in 1976.  If this level of inflow is maintained the societies will be in a position to pay out at least as much in 1977 as their record achievement in 1976.</P>
    <P>Employment is a key indicator but the construction industry has always had a substantial level of unemployment as evidenced by the fact that in 1972 and 1973 there were between 14,000 and 15,000 unemployed in the industry.  Our stated public commitment is to put every unemployed construction worker back to work without incurring excessive capital loan national commitments.  Money pumped in must be paid for at an interest rate. We will certainly pump as much money as is prudently desirable and as is available into a public housing programme. I am confident that the builders need have no fear of the policies being followed by this Government. For the first time in half a decade, in relation to the 30,000 local authority houses which we have built in the past four years, the taxpayer is getting value for money on every local authority contract.  We have ended land speculation.  Land prices have levelled off.  We have ended the gross speculation in private housing whereby people were making a profit of several <Col N="1057" /> thousand pounds per house with certificates of reasonable value.  We have stopped a lot of the nonsense which went on in the construction industry. It is now a much healthier industry. Construction workers can look forward now with a substantial degree of confidence to having decent well paid jobs.  It will not be the fault of this Government if these opportunities are not there in future.  I can assure the Fianna Fáil Party, which has been long in rhetoric and short in memory in relation to this debate, that we have the measure of the problem in hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>For the past few years the trade unions of the building industry and even the Minister's colleagues and local authorities have been calling on the Minister and on the Government to aid the industry, which is capable of considerable expansion and which could quickly provide many new jobs.  Nevertheless the general position is deteriorating as each month passes.  The Minister instead of assisting this industry is by his very actions destroying it.</P>
      <P>One of the major setbacks to the industry was the delay in increasing the income limit in respect of qualification for SDA loans.  Since 1st January, 1976, it has become almost impossible for the ordinary person to get a grant.  The county council worker or the ordinary industrial worker no longer qualifies for a State or a local authority grant and such people are not in a position to avail of bank or building society loans because of the high repayments. The effect of this is that increasing numbers are seeking local authority housing so that the waiting list for this sort of accommodation becomes longer.  This situation is the kernel of the problem in regard to housing.  How can the Minister justify his policy in respect of grants or in respect of SDA loans?  People with the courage and initiative to build houses for themselves should be given every facility to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond referred to the low-rise mortgage scheme.  I have supported this scheme.  At the time of its inception I proposed at a meeting of Kerry County Council that it be adopted.  It is a very good scheme but, <Col N="1058" /> unfortunately, it is difficult to sell it to people on the waiting lists of local authorities.  There are a number of reasons for this, one being the non-availability of grants.  In addition, it is not easy to qualify for participation in the scheme because one of the conditions is that an applicant must be either a tenant of a local authority house or must have been on the local authority waiting list for at least 12 months.  Generally people interested in this scheme are in the process of making up their minds whether to apply for local authority housing or to build houses for themselves.  It is reasonable to assume that an applicant who had been on the waiting list for at least 12 months would have a family, so that it would be almost impossible for him without the aid of a grant, and even with the benefits of the low-rise mortgage scheme for the initial ten years, to build a house for himself.  At that stage he may not even have the price of a site and there is also the consideration that his family would then be at a more expensive stage.  I have done my best to sell this scheme to people whom I think might benefit from it but I have not been very successful.</P>
    <P>Another factor mitigating against the construction industry is the serious cutback in real terms in the allocation of money for services.  There is a slackening-off in the development of water and sewerage schemes and there is a cutback, too, in schemes for access roads and for electricity to areas zoned for the development of housing estates. This is particularly noticeable in provincial towns, especially when one recalls what the position was a number of years back.</P>
    <P>The question of financing the sanitary services and water and sewerage schemes generally for industrial sites should be resolved between the Departments of Local Government and Industry and Commerce.  Through the IDA, the Department of Industry and Commerce should finance such schemes.  Local authorities should not have to carry this burden from their capital allocations.  The argument in favour of this practice is that industry is of benefit to the community in which <Col N="1059" /> it is located.  While there is a basis for this argument, it can be argued also that there is a great loss to a local community when the local authority must finance development schemes.  I am aware of at least a few industries that could have been developed in certain towns were it not for the inadequacy of services, in particular the inadequacy of proper water supplies.  However it is difficult to know whether the country as a whole has suffered as a result of this situation.</P>
    <P>In addition to these problems the local authorities are not now in a position of being able to purchase additional land adjacent to towns and villages for group schemes.  Primarily the reason for this is that they must now be able to pay for such land almost immediately, and they will not be recouped by the Department of Local Government until such time as their capital allocation for the year in question is being made or, alternatively, until such time as the housing scheme has been completed.  Therefore not only are all those difficulties contributing to the serious decline in the construction industry but they are auguring badly for the development of housing in the years ahead because of the likelihood of a lack of serviced land.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to the millions of pounds being spent on housing, but the real test of the situation so far as housing is concerned is the number of people&mdash;tens of thousands&mdash;who are on the waiting lists for local authority dwellings.  In Kerry alone there are about 1,500 people on the county council's list for rehousing.  I tabled a question to the Minister on the 30th March which he answered by way of tabular statement. He said that, in all, the sum of £1,080,000 had been allocated to Kerry County Council, that £630,000 was to meet existing commitments and that £450,000 was allocated for new works which would commence up to 30th June, 1977.  The position with Kerry County Council is that £650 000 was required to meet existing commitments, more or less to meet the <Col N="1060" /> bills which accrued on 31st December&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and also to complete the houses which were incomplete at the time of the capital allocation.  Also, out of the £450,000 the council could only start and complete about 63 to 65 houses this year because it costs on average £7,000 to build a local authority house in Kerry. The position at the moment is that Kerry County Council cannot start another house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The position now is that they cannot start another house. I find it very difficult to accept that Kerry County Council returned £300,000 to the Department in respect of last year.  I do not think that happened. At the same time we were told that the Minister will review the situation on 30th June.  Does this mean that the council cannot start more houses until then?  Or can they proceed with the building in anticipation of a capital allocation on 30th June or before or after that date to meet the cost of all houses that would be started before that date?  I would like the Minister to clarify that.  I am sure there are other local authorities in the same position as Kerry County Council. When I tried to get further information through supplementary questions I was not allowed to proceed despite the fact that I asked only two supplementaries on that occasion.</P>
      <P>The reality is that Kerry County Council&mdash;and I am sure other housing authorities are in the same situation&mdash; cannot start any more houses this year. I know at least one other housing authority that cannot start a single house before 30th June, before the position is reviewed.  I should also like the Minister to tell us how much money he has for reallocation among housing authorities on 30th June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This will be a very irrelevant figure.  The Minister should prepare some scheme for the extension of council houses to relieve overcrowding. I understand some local authorities have submitted such schemes.  This is a very worthwhile exercise and these proposals should be sanctioned because there is serious overcrowding in local authority houses just as in private houses.  It might solve a problem and save local authorities and the Department the expense of building additional houses if extensions were allowed to local authority houses under a particular scheme.</P>
      <P>The Minister will not cod people who require houses by quoting figures and comparing the amount spent this year with what was spent years ago on housing.  That is completely irrelevant in the present situation and of no interest to the tens of thousands of people today with young families living in overcrowded conditions in tenement flats, caravans or in mobile homes with no sanitary provision.  What really matters to those on the waiting list is: is it a fact that the waiting list is being held by each housing authority to its 1973 level?  That is the acid test.  The answer, of course, is in the negative and the fact that the waiting list is increasing daily in the case of many local authorities means that enough is not being done by the Government to rehouse those in real need.</P>
      <P>Two vital factors apply to the housing crisis which the Minister and the Government do not wish to speak or hear about: they have neither the capacity, the ability nor the courage to tackle them.  One is the everincreasing cost of building materials over which there appears to be no price control.  It is hard to understand this.  In a short period the price of cement went up from about £18 per ton to £35 per ton.</P>

      <P>The applicant's income in 1975 exceeded by £115 the maximum allowable in the case of a single person with no dependants.  As this included a substantial amount of overtime earnings, it was decided to assess his income on the basis of his average overtime earnings over the three years prior to application. Even on this basis his income was £66 above the limit for eligibility.</P>
      <P>I regret that, in these circumstances, he cannot qualify for a new house grant.  However, a certificate of exemption has issued to him enabling him to qualify for the ancillary benefits of exemption from stamp duty and the graduated rates remission.</P>

      <P>The only available information relates to net emigration, that is the outflow less the inflow. Estimates of net migration are compiled for intercensal periods by relating successive population figures compiled from censuses of population to date for births and deaths in the same periods.  The following are the average annual net emigration figures in each intercensal period since 1956: 1956 to 1961&mdash;42,400; 1961 to 1966&mdash; 16,121; 1966 to 1971&mdash;10,781.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Revenue Commissioners are responsible for the administration of taxation laws.  They inform me that the expenses deduction included in the taxfree allowances for the current year in this case is £200 (not £300).  The deduction is considered by the Revenue Commissioners as adequate and consideration cannot be given to increasing it unless the taxpayer submits a detailed claim, supported by the necessary documentary evidence.  The figure for the year 1976-77 was £240, the <Col N="969" /> additional £40 being in respect of a non-recurring expense, namely, the cost of damage to the taxpayer's ordinary clothing as a result of an industrial accident.  That additional amount may not of its nature be included in the tax-free allowances for 1977-78.</P>
      <P>The deductions referred to are granted under Rule 3, Schedule 2, Income Tax Act, 1967, in respect of expenses of travelling, and other expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred, in the performance of the duties of the employment.  The taxpayer has been requested by the Revenue Commissioners to produce the full details necessary in support of his claim to an increased deduction, but he has not done so.  The inspector of taxes has also explained to the taxpayer that it is open to him to have his case for an increased expenses deduction listed for hearing by the Appeal Commissioners.</P>

Increases in restaurant prices in UCD since 1973 have been less than price increases in public restaurants and less than the increases in the consumer price index food.</P>
