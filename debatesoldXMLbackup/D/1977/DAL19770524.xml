      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he has received a copy of the proposed scheme of the French Farmers' Union for a common agricultural policy for sheep; if he finds the proposals acceptable in part or <i>in toto;</i> and the steps he proposes to take in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is yes.</P>
      <P>The proposals in question have been submitted by the French sheep producers' association to the French Secretary of State for Agriculture and accordingly do not call for any official cognisance by me.</P>
      <P>My position in the matter of the restrictions operated by the French Government against imports of mutton and lamb from this country is that these restrictions are contrary to the Treaties and that, in any case, they must, under the terms of the Treaty of Accession, cease as from 31st December, 1977, the date on which the transitional period ends.  To establish the former contention the Government has initiated proceedings against the French Government in the European Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows this is nonsence.  The prices for lamb and sheep meats over the past 12 months have never been equalled here before; they are higher than ever before.  There was nothing more I could do to get a common organisation of the market for sheep meat.  As long as two countries remain definitely and absoulutely opposed to such a common organisation of the market there is no way I can get it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that sheep prices were good last year and encouraged people to go back into sheep?  The people who had sheep and who have lambs now are not getting the same price that they got last year. Last year a low land ewe cost up to £35 and is selling at less than £40 now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree that this year they started by getting excellent prices and it is only in the last couple of weeks that there has been a drop in prices and I expect that drop to be very temporary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

There are statutory safeguards, however, to ensure that cattle are transported in such a manner as to avoid injury or unnecessary suffering to them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>My note says that a soil survey of the bay was carried out by this Department in the early fifties for the purpose of determining its potential for agricultural purposes and a report on the findings was published in 1954.  The survey showed that reclamation of the area would present a number of difficulties because of the high saline content of the soil.  It was also clear from the survey that the drainage of the bay would not be an economic proposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the advances made with the type of machinery needed for the building of the embankment, would the Minister consider having another survey carried out with the purpose of having the work undertaken?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of this survey being completed, will the Minister consider having compensation paid to the many farmers and others who live around the bay because they make a very good living saving seaweed? They supply it to the local seaweed factory which depends almost entirely on the weed obtained from this bay to remain in operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that an inter-departmental committee are at present carrying out a wide-ranging review of existing land policy and no doubt they will deal comprehensively with the question of leasing.  Any recommendation they may make in this regard will be seriously considered by the Government when plans for future land policy are being formulated.  For myself, I would very much like to see a big expansion in long term leasing in the interests of greater land mobility and of meeting the land needs of potential development farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's supplementary reply regarding the acquisition of land, is he aware that in his recent directive to the Land Commission officers to draw up schemes to distribute 40,000 acres, inspectors will not be available for the acquisition of further farms and that it looks as if, for the next period, they will distribute rather than acquire?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that it does not seem to be sensible, with that size of pool of land on hands, to concentrate more on acquisition than on redistribution. Every week I come into this House I am being pressed for redistribution of land that is on hands because it is too long in the hands of the Land Commission and I agree that is so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">

      <P>The erection of buildings for the Turbot islanders had to await the acquisition and development of suitable sites.  In November last a contract was placed for the erection of a dwellinghouse on the only site then ready, but the contractor subsequently withdrew without carrying out any work.</P>
      <P>Seven further sites are now ready and tenders have been invited for the construction of buildings on all eight sites.  The closing date was 18th May and the tenders lodged are now being examined.  Subject to the receipt of an acceptable tender a contract for the work will be placed as quickly as possible.</P>

Cuir i gcás b'fhéidir dhá bhliain ó shin go bhfuair Gaeltarra suíomh do mhonarcha, gur déanadh forbairt uirthi agus anois tá tionscal ar siúl sa bhfoirgneamh sin.  Tá sceideal iomlán agam anseo a bhaineann le clár tógála Ghaeltarra Éireann do 1977 agus 1978, an t-am a críochnóidh an obair sin, an méad airgid agus gach rud mar sin a bhaineann le gach ceantar Ghaeltachta.

Maidir le Cill na Martra tá dul chun chinn an-mhaith déanta ann i gcuid de na bailte fearainn nach bhfuil fós ins an Ghaeltacht.  Bhuail mé le toscaireacht ón áit sin bliain ó shin tar éis scrúdú a bheith déanta ag mo Roinnse ann.  Bhí chuid de na bailte fearainn ann ag staid sásúil ach do mhol mé leo leanacht ar aghaidh leis an iarracht go mbeadh an chuid go léir den pharóiste réidh.  Ní raibh aon mhaitheas bheith ag tarraingt cúpla baile fearainn isteach.  Ón eolas is déanaí atá le fáil, tá dul chun cinn an-mhaith déanta agus níl aon amhras orm ach go mbeidh an chuid eile de pharóiste Chill na Martra mar Ghaeltacht lá éigin.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Barrett</b> asked the Minister for Transport and Power the studies, if any, that have been made regarding the desirability of laying pipe lines so that natural gas may be distributed on a country wide basis from the immediate areas where the gas may have been found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I would refer the Deputies to the reply of 4th November, 1975, to a question by Deputy B. Desmond on this subject. In deciding on the allocation of the Kinsale Head find the Government had regard to a study carried out <Col N="1321" /> on its behalf which indicated, <i>inter alia</i>, that the size of the find would not justify a grid distribution system. There have been no further finds of natural gas but exploration is still being carried out.  An inter-departmental working group is at present studying the possible uses of any future finds of oil or natural gas.  This study will encompass all aspects of this matter including the feasibility of distribution of any future finds of natural gas by way of pipelines on a country wide basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that, in view of the very high cost of naphtha and the inability of the Dublin and Limerick gas companies to get an alternative source, plans should be initiated to make natural gas available immediately, particularly to Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I agree with the Deputy that the cost of the raw materials for gas makes it essential that the best use possible be made of natural gas.  In regard to the Kinsale find, we got all the best advice available and I am satisfied it was the right advice in regard to that find. Prospecting is going on in the Kish Basin and if that proves fruitful there will be very little problem in regard to piping it.  I can assure the Deputy that there is a study going on with a view to deciding on the best possible use of future finds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): It would depend on where the natural gas came ashore and where it was proposed to use it.  For example, if we considered the Kinsale Head find for use in places as far away as Dublin we would find it would be unthinkable because we are not a densely populated country and the cost of piping the gas 160 miles would be prohibitive.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that Britain and most European countries have been doing this and <Col N="1322" /> that calculating the cost should not therefore be so difficult?  Should not some comparisons be made with a view to utilising the natural gas from Kinsale?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the ratification measures to be taken by Ireland in respect of the Treaty Amending Certain Financial Provisions both of the Treaties Establishing the European Communities and of the Treaty Establishing a Single Council and a Single Commission of the European Communities. This new amending treaty provides for the setting up of a Communities' Court of Auditors and was the subject of the European Communities (Amendment) Act, 1977, which, having been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, was signed into law by the President on 29th March, 1977. <Col N="1324" /> With the appropriate steps to make the treaty part of the domestic law of the State thus completed, the Government subsequently prepared the necessary instruments to enable Ireland to ratify the treaty.  These instruments of ratification were deposited with the Italian Government on 23rd May, 1977.  It is for the depository state, in this case Italy, to notify the institutions of the Communities that the instruments of ratification have been deposited by Ireland and no further action is required by this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that the Court of Auditors cannot come into operation until our nomination is made?  In view of the long and undue delay in introducing the legislation here only after requests from the President of the European Parliament, does the Minister not think we are further compromising the operations of the Court of Auditors in so far as it involves financial control in not ensuring notification of ratification earlier than we did?  It was done after a two-month delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstands the position.  There is a certain time scale which starts operating from the moment of ratification, the moment when the Court of Auditors was established.  A number of other member states were not ready to make nominations to the Court of Auditors and we had a request that we should not deposit the instruments of ratification at an earlier date which would make it impossible for them to meet the deadline.  It was in deference to the views of certain other countries that we held it until this point to ensure that all would be ready to make their nominations.</P>

Owing to inadequate financing the Irish telephone system never reached that stage of development but as a result of the unprecedented investment of over £150 million in the service during the past four years, it is well on the way towards achieving it.  Continued investment will be necessary over the next few years to enable the waiting list to be steadily reduced and eventually eliminated.  As the Deputy is aware, a new Telephone Capital Bill was introduced last week for this and other telephone development purposes.</P>

The best test is that the number of connections made this year&mdash;45,000 <Col N="1328" />&mdash;is almost double the figure for 1972.

    <P>I want to give the House a few brief details of the history of the Finance Bill, 1977.  The Bill was circulated on 27th April, which is nearly four weeks ago, and the Second Stage was, on the same day, ordered for 4th May subject to the Whips' agreement as has been frequent practice in the House.  As Whip, I could not get agreement for the Bill to proceed on 4th May&mdash;the Opposition required more time before <Col N="1344" /> taking the Second Stage&mdash;and the Bill ultimately began its Second Stage on 10th May, two weeks all but a day after it was circulated.  It has now occupied 22 hours, 35 minutes of debate and, assuming it gets some more debate this afternoon, before a vote is taken on the Second Stage, it will have occupied roughly 24 hours.</P>
    <P>In order to put that figure into perspective, in case anybody thinks that is not enough for the Second Stage of a Finance Bill, I want to tell the House that I have gone back as far as 1957 and that the Finance Bill on Second Stage has now beaten all records in terms of the length of time it has taken to debate in this House.  I did not go back any further than 1957 because it was less verbose in the earlier days not more and I have no doubt, although I cannot give the House definite figures for earlier years, this record will not have been exceeded.  The longest debate on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill before this year was that on the Finance Bill of 1963.  That Bill contained an extremely controversial and new taxation proposal, namely the turnover tax, which was bitterly opposed by the then Opposition.  Notwithstanding that bitter and determined Opposition the debate on that Bill on Second Stage was concluded in 19 hours, 45 minutes.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill at present before the House, far from containing any new, controversial or far-reaching taxation proposals, consists very largely of taxation reliefs.  Notwithstanding that, the length of time spent on it has already substantially exceeded the time spent on the Bill 14 years ago, which contained the turnover tax.  While the Government appreciate that in normal circumstances the curtailing of debate is undesirable they have to observe their own programme as well.  While I regret having to move this motion I feel&mdash;I say so without being contentious&mdash;that the motion before the House is the motion which the Opposition were aiming to force us to produce and to that extent their strategy has succeeded but in succeeding it will of course enable the Press and the public to discount at its true worth the indignation which our motion today will generate. <Col N="1345" /> I hope it might be in order for me to say a short personal word, on completing a little more than four years as Government Whip.  I would like to thank the two Opposition Whips, Deputy Lalor and Deputy Browne, in my own name and I feel I should say in the name of my party and that of the Labour Party for their courtesy and their consideration.  They worked very hard for their own side at all times but never drove their devotion to their own side to the point of unreasonableness or inhumanity.  Their attitude has made every Deputy in the House, not just on this side, their beneficiaries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be in order if I commence by thanking the Attorney General on behalf of my colleagues, Deputy Lalor and Deputy Browne, for the kind remarks he has just passed and wish him well in his record short term as Attorney General.</P>
      <P>It is significant that the Attorney General referred solely to the Finance Bill in proposing this motion.  Of course, the motion proposes to guillotine not only the Finance Bill but also some other quite important measures, including the Prisons Bill, the associated Resolutions with the Finance Bill, the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Labour, including the now notorious provision for the self-aggrandisement advertisements of the Minister for Labour and the Friendly Societies Bill.  I will refer to those matters in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also significant, in dealing with the Finance Bill and in going back over the record, that the Attorney General did not discover what was really relevant in regard to previous years and what happened regarding Finance Bills in the House.  First, I believe it is no harm to recall that in the week following the budget I asked the Taoiseach when we could expect the Finance Bill to be circulated and his reply was: &ldquo;In about six weeks.&rdquo; Eleven weeks later I pointed out to the Taoiseach that he promised that the Finance Bill would be circulated in about six weeks and we still had not got it and asked him when we would get it and he said: &ldquo;Next week.&rdquo;  It <Col N="1346" /> came towards the end of the following week.</P>
    <P>The clear implication in what has been said by the Attorney General and indeed in what has been fed out by the Government in recent days, not least, at the jamboree in the Mansion House, was that Fianna Fáil engaged in obstructing the Finance Bill.  If there was any obstruction on this Finance Bill it was done by the Government and nobody else.  The record to which the Attorney General omitted to refer shows that there has not been, certainly in any recent year, any comparable delay in producing the Finance Bill with what occurred this year.  This year, from the date of the budget to the commencement of the Second Stage took 104 days and from the date of the budget to the date of circulation of the Bill took 90 days.  Last year the corresponding figures were 68 days and 61 days.  In the first budget of 1975 the corresponding figures were 41 days and 27 days and in the second budget of 1975 the figures were 27 days and 27 days. If we go back to the last budget introduced by Fianna Fáil the corresponding figures were 69 days and 61 days.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly clear that this year the Government held back the Finance Bill a length of time that has not been exceeded in recent years.  I doubt if it has ever been exceeded. If there was any obstruction of the Finance Bill it occurred from the Government benches.  We all know pretty well why this obstruction occurred. The Government were in difficulty with certain parts of the Finance Bill. They were trying to placate a number of their backbenchers.  They were trying to meet various interested groups to satisfy them and were holding back the Bill until they could hope to reach some kind of agreement with the groups concerned.  They failed in that. The relevant fact, when this guillotine motion is introduced, is that it was the Government who held back the Finance Bill not the Opposition.  The record shows just how strenuously the Government exercised their prerogative in holding back the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I am subject to correction on this but eventually when the Bill came before <Col N="1347" /> the House and was debated I believe that of approximately 25 speakers, eight were from the Government side.  It is clear enough, therefore, that there was no question of the Government simply waiting for the Opposition to finish the debate on Second Stage.  The Government took part to a degree which, perhaps, is not usual in relation to Bills of this kind. In these circumstances there can be no justification for any allegation that the matter was simply obstructed on the Opposition side and that the Government were waiting patiently for the Opposition to finish speaking to Second Stage.</P>
    <P>There are certain statutory time limits concerning the passing of a Finance Bill but these limits do not apply, for technical reasons, to this Bill.  If they so applied, the Bill would have had to be dealt with much more expeditiously than was the case. Since the statutory limits do not apply in this case, the Government are under no compunction to pass the Bill.  Consequently, we are entitled to ask why they are introducing a guillotine motion to steamroll it through.  At least one political commentator has put forward a reason for the Government's action. It is clear that, although this may not be the whole story, it is a true explanation of the situation but there may be more to it than this.  The reason that commentator gave us was that the Government are afraid, that going into an election without having passed the Finance Bill, some of their candidates on being subjected to pressure will waver and, consequently, the Government want to be in a position to have their candidates say that the Bill has been passed and that nothing more can be done about it.  In terms of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties that is a legitimate approach.</P>
    <P>I would not object to it from a party point of view but I object strongly to it from the point of view of the business of this House and of the country.  It is purely a party tactic. It is dishonest to suggest that the business of the country requires that the Bill be guillotined through.  If there is any reason for it, it is purely for the <Col N="1348" /> assumed protection of the Coalition candidates in the general election.</P>
    <P>If the Government wish to approach the Bill in that way, they should say so but let them not pretend that Fianna Fáil are obstructing the Bill's passage or that the motion before the House is necessary in the public interest. It is not necessary in the public interest.  The Bill need not be passed now.  It can be dealt with in the next Dáil.  The only reason for forcing it through is that of party political advantage as conceived by the Coalition.</P>
    <P>The Government propose to allow a few hours for discussion of the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, a Stage which at the best of times would take a number of weeks especially at a time like the present when there is a virile and active Opposition.  There may be precedent for a Finance Bill being rushed through in a few hours on Committee Stage but not at any time while this party were in Opposition. Contrary to what the Attorney-General has said, if one examines the Bill one finds that it contains a number of provisions which, in the public interest, should be teased out.  Let us take one simple example to which I referred on Second Stage.  There is slipped into a small section of the Finance Bill which purports to relate to a specific narrow situation a general provision affecting all taxation measures.  This provision is slipped in surreptitiously.  It is in the public interest that this Bill be examined in detail on Committee Stage and that points like these be brought out so that the Minister might either justify or amend them.</P>

      <P>The Minister will get his opportunity of replying very shortly to the public who are about to make up their minds about the whole performance of this Government in <Col N="1349" /> relation to this and other matters. There are a number of other measures included in the motion.  Apart from the Finance Bill and the associated resolutions there is the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Labour.  This includes provision for various items but in particular it includes provision for the cost of the advertisement by which an effort was made to improve the tattered image of the Minister for Labour.  I understand that there has been a change in that advertisement.</P>
      <P>Although I have not seen the changed advertisement, I welcome the change.  The fact that this has occurred underlines the necessity for subjecting the Minister and the Government to the full disclosure that would be required in a full-scale debate on the Supplementary Estimate when they would have to tell us what is the alleged justification for the change.</P>
      <P>The Prisons Bill is being guillotined also.  I can understand the reason for the Government trying to guillotine that debate.  It must be most uncomfortable for the Minister for Justice and for some of his colleagues to have to listen to what they said when the original Bill was introduced and having to compare what they said then with what they are saying now when, by implication at least, they must acknowledge that in dealing with problems of this kind and with subversion in general, they are faced with an Opposition who are responsible and who, unlike the present Government had to face subversion on the one hand and ignorance and worse in this House on the other hand.</P>

      <P>The record on the debate on the Prisons Bill shows exactly what was done by the Members opposite when they were in opposition. Naturally, they do not want further discussion on the present Bill so as not to draw public attention to the disgraceful performance of which they were guilty then and to what a shocking contrast there is between their performance in Opposition and the performance of this party in Opposition in matters of that kind.</P>
      <P>The Friendly Societies Bill, too, is being guillontined.  I concede that that measure would not be regarded as a matter of major political importance by either side of the House but it is being guillotined for one reason only, that is, that it contains something which would make any Government worth their salt hang their heads. Deputy O'Malley in this House pointed out at least eight errors in that Bill after it had come from the other House.  It is extremely doubtful if the procedure adopted as a result of that has any legal basis but it is even more doubtful as to whether what is proposed now has any legal basis whatever&mdash;a situation in which it was to be sent to the Seanad but is not now being sent there.  There is no provision in the Standing Orders of this House for dealing with that Bill. It is in such a mess that the only way of dealing with it now is to withdraw it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A purely procedural problem has arisen, but it has arisen because of carelessness on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  As a result the opportunity is being taken to shove through this Bill and hope to conceal or reduce as much as possible the exposure of, in the vernacular, the messing, that has gone on in relation to the Friendly Societies Bill.  What we have before us is a guillotine motion in regard to a number of measures which I have touched on.  The merits and demerits of each of those measures can be considered in more detail, but it is appropriate when we are discussing <Col N="1351" /> this motion to consider a somewhat wider aspect of the matter and that is the whole attitude of this Government to guillotine motions.  This Coalition Government have guillotined more measures in this House than have all of the previous Governments in the history of this State put together.</P>

      <P>That is a record of which, no doubt, this Government will be proud.  There are others who will be less than proud in that regard.  They have even guillotined measures which have not been introduced and which the House has not seen.  Of course it is not an accident that this Government have been guilty of such an approach and such a readiness to drop the guillotine on discussions in this House. It is not due to pressure of business.  It is due to a mentality which is very obvious in certain members of this Government.  In all fairness I must say that it is not in all members of this Government but in sufficient of them to give people very serious cause for disquiet.  Remember that this is the Government who tried to guillotine the newspapers in a Bill they introduced here.  This Government contains a Minister who acknowledged publicly that he is keeping a file on letters to newspapers, and in all probability if the Government had got their way criminal proceedings would have been taken against the writers of some of those letters.  This Government are led by the man who whipped up an &ldquo;Up the Blueshirts&rdquo; climate in the Mansion House the other day.  This is typical of what we get from Fine Gael in particular and from some members of the Labour Party in this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not an accident that we have this motion here today.  It is not an accident that this Government have been guilty of an attitude which says &ldquo;if it is a discussion which we do not like we will shut it up and we will steamroll this measure through.  If it is the newspapers we will put them in the dock.  If it is somebody who writes to the newspapers we will silence him, we will charge him in the courts and that will shut his mouth.  If it is the <Col N="1352" /> Opposition, bring in the guillotine&rdquo;. Nobody can suggest that a guillotine motion is never appropriate, but equally nobody can suggest that a guillotine motion can be appropriate so often on so many measures by this Government in their term of office, when every Government in the past were able to manage with little or no resort to the guillotine.  It is something that the public in general are becoming aware of and are apprehensive about and are looking forward to the opportunity of dealing with in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Taking individually the measures proposed to be gullotined here, it can be shown that there is no justification for this motion.  Taking them collectively and viewing them in the context of this Government's record on the guillotine and of their attitude to criticism they do not like, there can be no justification at all for this motion, and this party intend to oppose it.  We know the Government will steamroll it through but we also know that the time is very close when they will not get the opportunity to steamroll through their measures to guillotine anything that they do not like or any opposition they cannot stomach.  Thank God we are still a democracy and the people will get their opportunity soon to ensure that proper democratic procedures are going to be followed in this House in future.</P>

      <P>There have been proposals in recent years that television should be introduced into Dáil Éireann.  It is a pity that television is not already in the Chamber because I would like the Irish electorate to have seen Deputy Colley's clenched fist and the arrogant face of him, and the viciousness with which he opposed the Government's reasonable proposal that there be an end to the nonsense of the debate on this year's Finance Bill.  This year's Finance Bill, as all reasonable people know and are ready to admit, is a Bill of concession.  It gives the taxpayers very substantial reductions in tax, to encourage them to work harder.  The Fianna Fáil Party have no wish to <Col N="1353" /> see this legislation on the Statute Book before the electorate are consulted. Even if this House were to sit from now until 27th February, 1978, it is clear that Fianna Fáil would wish to pursue the policy of obstruction that they have clearly adopted in the course of the financial debate.  We have had a most ridiculous debate.  Deputy Dowling referred to the blood count of people over 65 years of age.  Whatever relationship that has to the Finance Bill I cannot imagine, nor could the Chair understand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had the time to go through a long range of items&mdash;I have not, I have far more important things to do for the nation&mdash;I would find that the Chair during the course of this Finance Bill had to reprimand the Opposition on more occasions than ever in the past for an irrelevant contribution to a debate.  There has been some reference by Deputy Colley and others to what they alleged was a long period between the budget and the introduction of the Finance Bill.  We came in as a Government of consultation and we have endeavoured to practise consultation.  There were two items in this year's budget which involved very detailed consultation and calm consideration.  One was a unique incentive to promote employment and increase industrial efficiency.  That was the incentive of providing a 25 per cent corporation tax rate as compared with the 58 per cent corporation tax rate of Fianna Fáil.  This new rate would apply in the event of a 3 per cent increase in employment or a 5 per cent increase in production.  This involved not weeks but months of detailed consultation with the Confederation of Irish Industry, the accountancy profession and other people in a position to advise and to give information.  I could certainly, as Minister for Finance, have curtailed such consultations and brought in and rushed through a measure which would not have been generally acceptable to people whom we were seeking to encourage and to incite to further production, to investment and to increased <Col N="1354" /> employment.  I make no apology that over many weeks and months we engaged in patient consultation with those best in a position to advise what should be the appropriate employment and production targets for 1977.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, we had changes in this year's Finance Bill in relation to the taxation of farming profits.  As we introduced those changes once again we undertook to have consultations with the farming organisations and their advisers as to what was the most appropriate form of tax to deal with the special problems and indeed the opportunities and challenges presented to the agricultural community. These consultations involved not merely meeting the hierarchy of the professional or vocational organisations involved but also with their tax experts. These involved many weeks of patient, calm and profitable consultation.</P>
      <P>There are occasions when there are time constraints in relation to the introduction of a Finance Bill.  Those are years in which there are new taxes imposed, in which the validity of Financial Resolutions adopted on budget day has to be confirmed by the passage of the Second Stage of the Finance Bill.  That problem did not arise this year because the budget was one of tax reductions and incentives. One might fairly ask: why is it that an Opposition deliberately set out on a campaign of obstruction in Parliament to prevent the quick passage of a Bill which would confirm the tax reductions given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the only positive aspect of the Finance Bill debate was that some very rare contributors to the House appeared&mdash;I had difficulty in recognising some of them&mdash;possibly there were one or two maiden speakers.  The Opposition sent in 25 people to contribute to the debate.  Most of their contributions were irrelevant because they did not even understand Finance Bills or taxation.  Certainly, as Minister for Finance, I have never seen them here before contributing to any Finance Bill, not that that is any reason why they would not come in now&mdash;better now than never because some of them may never come back <Col N="1355" /> again.  It is about time there was some sense of reality and sincerity in relation to the comments of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>The Attorney-General has pointed out that going back over 20 years there has been no Finance Bill debated for so long as has this one.  But there was never any occasion when a Finance Bill gave reliefs and did not impose any taxation on which the debate went on for more than one day. Deputy Colley considers it to be a virtue that the Government's proposals should be opposed, that they should be delayed at great length&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that they should leave in doubt and uncertainty the passage of the legislation.  For some months past we have heard very brave challenges being thrown down by the Opposition seeking to have an early general election.  Last year they pleaded with the Government for an early end of summer term so that Deputies could leave on holiday early. They were mighty grateful when we brought the proceedings of the Dáil to a conclusion before the end of June. We presume that is still their attitude, that they would wish to see the proceedings of this session of this Dáil concluded before the end of June but at the rate they were going we would not get away until August or September. I am not certain whether it is now an expression of their unwillingness to face the electorate that they are opposing the Government's wish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to terminate the pantomime travesty of their performance on the Finance Bill or whether it is that they really wish to sit during July.  As far as the Government are concerned we are anxious to see the passage of the Finance Bill, 1977 because it confirms what has been almost universally accepted&mdash;the wisdom of the budget of 1977.  It has not yet <Col N="1356" /> statutory effect but we are giving the tax reductions pending its passage.  We would consider it intolerable that the Opposition should delay any further the passage of the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley raised one or two technical questions on some sections of the Finance Bill in the course of his remarks.  It would not be relevant for me to deal with them now&mdash;I could if the Chair would give me permission to do so&mdash;but I do not think it relevant to this motion.  I am only too willing to answer queries that have been raised.  I believe that Deputy Colley as a lawyer and, I take it, as a sincere Member of Parliament would be only too happy to accept the replies I have to give, but I am not being allowed to reply to the Second Stage of the Finance Bill because it has been drawn out in an unforgivable manner across a whole field of irrelevancies.  How on earth can we get to the Committee Stage unless we terminate the Second Stage?  Deputy Colley knows, as a Member of this House of long standing and as an ex-Minister for Finance, that the main debate on a Finance Bill occurs on the Committee and Report Stages when those who have some skill, knowledge and experience in the intricacies of fiscal laws get down to the nitty-gritty. I want to reach that stage.</P>
      <P>Since I had the privilege of entering this House 18 years ago I can remember two occasions only on which this House sat through the night.  One was in relation to the debate on the arms trial and all the embarrassment connected with it in 1971.  The other was an occasion when the Opposition insisted on dragging out the debate on the Finance Bill and challenged the House, and myself in particular, to sit all night.  They were laying bets in the bar the night of the all-night debate on the Finance Bill and the bets were that Richie Ryan would not stick it out until the morning.  I do not care how long it takes to pass the Finance Bill; we are prepared to stick it out. We want to see the benefits of this year's budget and Finance Bill passed for the benefit of our people.</P>

      <P>We now face this nonsense, that once again in a area most people do not understand because it is complicated, Fianna Fáil want to pretend there is something sinister, difficult, which we want to cover up in the Finance Bill.  If they would now just hold their whist I believe I could give them replies on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill which would satisfy even them and which would certainly satisfy the ordinary Irish citizen, because they would not see in the proposals in this year's Finance Bill any of the sinister suggestions of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>On the contrary they would see that this year's Finance Bill is probably the most unique in the history of the State because of the reliefs and incentives it gives to taxpayers as a whole.  I find it very interesting that we were the first that I know of, certainly in the Western world, to build in special incentives for the increase of employment and production. I find it very interesting indeed that the new Administration in the United States have now seen fit to imitate our example because they see how very positive, creative and unique are the incentives we have provided in this year's Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley referred to other matters, including the recent advertisement which drew people's attention to the incentives provided for employers for increasing the number of employees they engage.  It is relevant to say that the advertising firm that designed that advertisement has a very long and well-known association with the Fianna Fáil Party.  Perhaps they have a certain flair; they have certainly drawn attention to the availability of the incentives. <Col N="1358" /> However, I will not go into the merits or demerits of a particular advertisement; I shall leave that to those who are expert.</P>

The picture on that advertisement was of Mr. Lynch signing one of the EEC Treaties.  It is extraordinary how some people can change their dispositions towards advertising and other matters when they move across the floor.  This, of course, may be another case of faulty memory.</P>

      <P>The amount of time left between now and the ordinary summer recess at the end of June, in accordance with the agreement which was reached last year, is now comparatively short and we have had enough waste of public time in unnecessary and futile debate. I am anxious to get down to the objective aspects of the Finance Bill.  They can best be dealt with on the Committee and Report Stages.  With the greatest respect to the Opposition, the best thing they can do by Ireland is to get down quickly to the debate on the Committee and Report Stages of the Finance Bill.  We are ready to answer all their questions.  If they give us a chance, they will find that their genuine fears are answered and that they and the people of Ireland will recognise that the 1977 Finance Bill and the 1977 Budget are unique in Irish history in providing encouragement and incentives, the power to produce growth in our economy, and the jobs and the resources for social improvement that we badly need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his speech took it on himself to decide whether or not those who spoke from this side of the House spoke relevantly. The Minister should have another look at the script of his speech when introducing this political Finance Bill. A more political speech was never heard in this House.  If any Member from this side of the House spoke irrelevantly, he did not even match up to the wide-ranging political coverage in the Minister's introductory speech. I invite anybody to examine the records side by side with the speeches delivered here.</P>
      <P>When I first came into this House we had long lectures from Fine Gael parliamentarians, particularly Mr. Dillon, who was a great exponent of the democratic rights of the parliamentarians elected to this House.  The cheek of the present Minister to suggest that anybody coming in on this side of the House had not the right to speak on his Finance Bill.  That is going a bit too far.  There are over 30 people who have yet the right to speak on this.  It is the right of every Member to speak on anything he wishes that is relevant and before the House. That is exactly what we were doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If bloomers were made in this House in the past four-and-a-half years they were not made on this side. The period now coming to a close will be characterised by some of the most unique incidents ever recorded, such as when the Taoiseach trooped into our Lobbies to vote against his own legislation.  These are the people who would lecture us on how to behave as an Opposition.  Every Member elected to this House and those who will come in after the 15th June, or after whatever date the election is held have the right to speak.  I believe that the haste in relation to this election is an effort to beat the publication of the new consumer price index and to hold the election before the new school leavers flood the streets in riot.  The guillotine is being applied here in order to circumvent these problems which lie ahead, which are serious obstacles in relation to this Government's mismanagement of the country.  As the days go on, the promises that have <Col N="1360" /> been made and the goodies that have been dropped like manna from Heaven in the last few weeks will backfire and will be seen by the people for what they are worth.</P>
    <P>There is no regard for what this House can or should do.  The Opposition mean nothing.  This is the most scandalous example of arrogance by any Government.  For their own convenience, in order to avoid the impending disasters that might upset their election estimates, the Government are prepared to guillotine four important pieces of legislation and to tell the Opposition that they have no right to speak, that 25 people spoke already. We have 25 more who would like to speak and who have the right to speak. The Government blatantly tell us that because they are the sole arbiters of what is right and wrong, that because the Government have decided that this must go through, it does not matter a damn whether the Opposition speak or vote on it, that they are going to put it through anyhow so they might as well use the guillotine.  That is the attitude from the Government side of the House.  I sincerely hope that those who are really concerned with the meaning of democracy, those who are watching the behaviour of this Government who seem to abhor completely any attempt at opposition from any direction, will give them the answer they deserve on that score alone.  I believe they will.</P>
    <P>I remember occasions when we sat through the night in order to give the Opposition every moment they wanted to discuss any matter in relation to anything.  The Minister for Finance actually made our case when he reminded us of that.  In those days, according to my recollection, we regarded the use of the guillotine as the last resort, and only when there was positive evidence of filibustering did we use it.  There was no such evidence on this occasion.</P>
    <P>It is only natural that, in the last session of this Dáil, Deputies would wish to contribute on a Bill which relates to the entire spectrum of our economy and, as the Minister did in his introductory speech, cover a wide range of subjects in relation to the <Col N="1361" /> economy.  The Minister told us one of the reasons why the guillotine is being introduced is that he felt our contributions were not relevant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has the sole responsibility for deciding that, although at times one can observe an attempted influence in that direction, to put it very mildly.  The Minister has no right to tell us we canot speak on any Bill he produces.  This Parliament consists of the two sides of the House. The Opposition are just as relevant and just as important as the Government. In fact, in this context the Opposition are more important, and the Minister has no right to tell us we have no right to contribute on the four important items on which the Government are now using the guillotine.</P>
      <P>They are doing it for their own personal benefit.  They want to fix the date of the election before a time when it would be very embarrassing for them to hold it.  That is exactly the reason why they are applying it.  The world knows that in the Finance Bill the Government are easing some of the burdens they imposed over the previous four years.  If they considered it was marvellous, as the Minister put it, why did they not produce it earlier and allow discussion on it?  The more discussion there was on it, the better it would be.</P>
      <P>We have the right to propose amendments, even though we might have little hope of having them carried because of the arrogant Government we are dealing with.  The public have a right to see an analysis of the legislation and to hear our proposals and the reasons the Government would give for not accepting them.  That is what debate in this House is all about; to expose to the public what is in the mind of every Deputy and to show what may be the weaknesses in what the Government are proposing.  We are being deliberately deprived of that opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are using the guillotine to suit their own political tactics.  This type of thing has been a characteristic of the Government since <Col N="1362" /> the day they first took office.  The arrogance grew with the weeks, months and years.  Now they have reached the stage where they think it is only a matter of form to bring in a Bill and get it through as quickly as possible. The fact that they get Bills through because they have the majority does not mean the Opposition should not be allowed to tease them out for the public and to use their democratic right as Members of this House to speak on them.</P>
    <P>I am shocked and dismayed at the approach of the Minister for Finance in accusing, as he did, backbench Members on this side of the House of speaking in the House as if they had no right to do so.  When I spoke on the Finance Bill&mdash;and I defy contradiction on this from the other side of the House&mdash;I said it was the greatest piece of political cajolery ever to come before the House as was evident from the Minister's statement on that occasion.  We never saw in the introductory speech to any Finance Bill as much politics as we saw in the first nine pages of the Minister's statement which dealt with wide-ranging political issues which were irrelevant to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill is an important measure.  It gives effect to the monetary and fiscal adjustments the Minister is making.  The Minister is now taking from the people more money in taxes than ever was taken from them in the history of this State, and we have a right to take a long look at the Finance Bill which gives effect to those measures.  The Minister seeks to play down the serious damage he did over the years and surely we have the right to expose that.  At least 30 more Deputies on this side of the House have the right to speak on this Bill unless the Chair tells them they have not.  The Minister has not got that right.  It is in keeping with the arrogance of the Government that he should try to assert he has that right.</P>

I congratulate the new Attorney General on his blowing in for a short time but he sought to justify the action he has taken, cutting down on the entire business of the House, by saying we are getting out of here.  They cannot afford to stay too long before the school leavers get on the streets again and before the consumer price index in blazoned across the headlines of the newspapers.  They must have the election before that happens. We would not care if they held it tomorrow.  The Government know what their fate will be.  The writing is on the wall.  It is a foregone conclusion. The person who would go into the polling booth to endorse the mismanagement of the past four-and-a-half years would need to have his head examined.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Irish people I want to lodge a protest. The Government have prevented <Col N="1364" /> them from seeing the Finance Bill being analysed, debated and properly screened, as well as the other important measures about which they know nothing.  I remember once, at an inter-parliamentary conference abroad, the subject being discussed was the control of parliament over the Government and we noticed that in some of the countries which were moving rapidly towards Fascism the Parliament met only occasionally and the Government passed measures on their own.  They could not tolerate coming into Parliament to hear their measures being discussed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One of the measures included in this guillotine motion&mdash;in poltical terms it is probably the least important&mdash;is a Bill that does not have any great consequences except to a small number of people who are immediately affected by it.  It is No. <Col N="1365" /> (iv) on this list but the fact that it is included in this motion raises doubts and suspicions which are a great deal more important than the terms of the Bill itself.  The Friendly Societies (Amendment) Bill, 1976, was dealt with here in Committee regarding the amendments which were made to this Bill in the Seanad.  It was originally a Dáil Bill and that debate took place on Tuesday, 29th March last.  On that occasion the debate was rather short-lived. One of the amendments was passed and then we went on to the next one.  I pointed out that there seemed to be a number of errors in the Bill.  You, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, were in the Chair and I drew your attention to these errors.  The Parliamentary Secretary agreed that the errors existed and a debate took place as to what should be done.  The errors were called out by me and when they were added up they amounted to eight.  Their existence was agreed.  They should have been rectified by the Seanad and this had not been done.  I suggested that the Bill should be sent back to the Seanad as it was not fit to be passed and that was agreed.  Finally, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you agreed to that yourself and it was sent back to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I quote from Volume 298 of the Official Report at column 520.  You, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, stated:</P>
      <P>On the points made by Deputy O'Malley it would seem that the appropriate thing would be to adjourn consideration and send a message to the Seanad in regard to the errors that have been made and send the Bill back to the Seanad for the correction of these errors.</P>
      <P>I then stated:</P>
      <P>That was my original suggestion and I think it is an excellent one. Since I suggested it, I thoroughly agree.</P>
      <P>At column 521 the Parliamentary Secretary stated:</P>
      <P>This matter will be considered by the Seanad in any case and I do not know that it is necessary to indicate the number of errors at this juncture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1366" /> Earlier, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you had referred to the fact that the errors could not be corrected in this House.  I quote from column 515:</P>
    <P>Standing Orders rule it out.</P>
    <P>Later you said:</P>
    <P>Standing Orders do not seem to leave scope for that.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, is that this Bill has been sent to the Seanad.  The Seanad is now seized on it, in the technical, legal sense of that word, and it is a matter of some doubt to me whether this House had any power to send a Bill to the Seanad in those circumstances.  Standing Orders have no provision for it and as far as I can see the Constitution has no provision for it.  In any event it was done.  I wish the Attorney General, in the more senior office which he now holds, could control himself better than when he was Whip and stop interrupting people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Page 506 of today's Order Paper has a list of Bills which are headed &ldquo;Dáil Bills with the Seanad&rdquo;.  The first of these is the Friendly Societies (Amendment) Bill, 1976.  That Bill is in the Seanad.  It may not be there legally or properly or constitutionally but it is there for the purpose of Standing Orders of this House and of the other House.  I do not have the Seanad Order Paper with me but I understand that Bill appears on it. Could the Chair or the Attorney General or anyone else explain to me how a Bill which is in the Seanad&mdash;<Col N="1367" /> at whatever stage&mdash;can be plucked from the Seanad and brought down here and placed on the table of this House for the purpose of being guillotined into so-called law?  That, I submit, cannot be done and all the guillotines in the world will not make law of something which is patently not law.  All the guillotines in the world will not bring within the Standing Orders of this House and the proper constitutional procedure of this House a proposed procedure which is patently outside Standing Orders and was never contemplated by the Constitution.</P>
      <P>People may not be very worried about this and they may think it is not very important.  The Friendly Societies (Amendment) Bill is not in itself a matter of any consequence. There was no controversy about the terms of the Bill.  I suggested amendments but there was no fundamental disagreement on the terms of the Bill. The amendments were of a drafting and legal type.  We got on quite well with it. The fact that the Bill is not politically important does not matter; it is the principle being established here that if someone wants to force something through one can pluck it from the Seanad, bring it down here and guillotine it and call it law.  If that procedure for making law is allowed and if we have any more of this Government who are prepared to do things in that way, then it is a poor look-out for this country.</P>
      <P>The only redeeming feature is that this is taking place before a general election and the people will have the opportunity within the next few weeks to pass their verdict.  This is a clearly improper procedure and it must be remembered, as Deputy Colley has said, that the guillotine has been used more often in the 20th Dáil than in the other 19 Dála combined.  It is appropriate that this Dáil should go out on the note of patronage and the guillotine because these have been the hallmarks of this Administration over the past four-and-a-quarter years. While this is being done and while we purport to make law in this way, I suggest we are not making law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know the jurisdiction of <Col N="1368" /> the High Court or the Supreme Court in inquiring into the non-observance of the Standing Orders of this House or of the other House in the purported or alleged making of law.  If they have any jurisdiction in these matters I hope that they will exercise it.  It is clear for them to see, as it is clear for any member of the public to see, that the proper procedures have not been followed.</P>
    <P>It is worthy of note that, with all the resources at his disposal, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, whose appointment to that position four-and-a-quarter years ago was hailed almost as the Second Coming of some kind of Messiah who was going to save Ireland, was so incompetent, despite all the resources of the huge Department behind him, that it was left to a Member of the Opposition, with no resources at all, to stand up here and point out no fewer than eight errors in the Friendly Societies (Amendment) Bill and those eight errors were agreed by the Chair and by the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary as existing in the Bill and it was agreed that the Bill could not be passed with those eight errors in it.  It is most inappropriate, therefore, that the Friendly Societies (Amendment) Bill should be included in this guillotine motion because it is forcing into law, not by the democratic process but by a guillotine motion, a Bill in which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the latter being the promoter of the Bill, agrees there are eight errors and this motion is, therefore, forcing the Bill into law with those errors.</P>
    <P>It will, therefore, be a totally defective Bill.  As well as being defective because it contains all these errors, it is also defective because Standing Orders of neither this House nor the Seanad have been complied with.  It is not far-fetched to visualise a situation where the Government of the day had, for example, lost their majority in the Seanad and there was a Bill up there bogged down on Committee Stage and the Government of the day, with a secure majority in the Dáil, decided they would do what was done in 1977 with the Friendly Societies (Amendment) Bill and apply the guillotine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley mentioned the Finance Bill and the Prisons Bill.  I want to deal with the latter.  The Prisons Bill has an interesting history. It is a re-enactment for a further three years of a Bill I introduced in 1972 in the immediate aftermath of a serious riot which wrecked Mountjoy Prison, the biggest prison in the country, and in which more than half the prisoners in the country were held in custody at that time.  Its speedy passage was necessary in order that a very large number of very violent and subversive prisoners would not have to be released.  That Bill was passed but only after the most strenuous opposition from both the Fine Gael and Labour Parties.  The opposition of the Fine Gael Party was purely verbal because, when it came to a vote, they did not vote against it, but about half the Labour Party voted against it, including members of the present Government.</P>
      <P>At that time I accepted an amendment designed to limit the operation of the Bill to a period of two years.  It was argued that one year would be sufficient and that Mountjoy could be restored in one year.  Several speakers, who are now members of the Government, said the Bill should not be kept in operation for one day longer than it took to repair Mountjoy.  It is now five years later and Mountjoy has long since been repaired.  As well as that, various other prisons have been established. I provided most of them.  I got Arbour Hill started.  I got Cork started. I got Shelton Abbey started.  All these are now available.  They were not available in May, 1972.  The number of prisoners held in military custody at the moment is, according to the Minister for Justice, 30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also gave the figures for the number of prisoners in all the other civil prisons.  There are considerable, if one may use that description, vacanvies in almost all these prisons and there would not be the slightest difficulty in accommodating a further 30 prisoners in the civil prisons.  Indeed, 130 could be easily accommodated in <Col N="1370" /> them.  It is not necessary, therefore, that this Bill should be passed by 31st May which is the date on which the authority to hold people in military custody expires.  It is not necessary because 30 of them could be transferred to no fewer than four other prisons and held in them without any difficulty. The people in the Curragh are not by all accounts violent people.  It was alleged by the Minister they were. He gave a long account of violent acts in recent years, but that account was confined to activities which took place in Portlaoise.  It is a civil prison.</P>
    <P>It seems to me extraordinary that the most violent prisoners we have can be held in civilian custody and that very much less violent prisoners, so far as one knows&mdash;in fairness, one must assume this is the case&mdash;cannot be held in civilian custody.  They are in military custody even though there are ample vacancies throughout our civilian prison system.  It is not necessary, therefore, that this Bill should be passed before 31st May or before any date in fact but, as Deputy Colley said&mdash;and I thoroughly agree with him &mdash;there have been only five speakers and I do not think anyone spoke for longer than half an hour or 35 minutes. I was the longest; I think I spoke for 35 minutes, and there were four others, including the Minister and one of his backbenchers&mdash;that debate was uncomfortable and embarrassing for many people on that side of the House because they were reminded of the attitude they took up five years ago at a time when they were giving encouragement and succour to people who were seeking to act in an extremely violent way.  I think it is fair to say now that it is not necessary to include the Prisons Bill in this guillotine motion because it does not have to be passed at all, certainly not for an indefinite period.</P>
    <P>As I said, it is most inappropriate to include the Friendly Societies (Amendment) Bill for the reasons I stated. This is a matter that would worry people interested in the democratic system and in the proper working of Parliament.  Unfortunately, such people do not include the members of the present Government and it is not, <Col N="1371" /> I suppose, surprising that they should be now trying to force into law in this undemocratic way a Bill about which there is no controversy.  Because of the eight errors in the Bill it will be impossible to implement the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley has dealt with the position in regard to the Finance Bill. We had all sorts of selective figures from the Attorney General.  He gave us the times for the Second Stages over various years.  What he did not give us was the total length of time in each year and, of course, the Committee Stage is in the normal way the longer part&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of a debate on a Finance Bill.  Very often there was quite a lengthy Report Stage lasting over a day or two, lengthy by usual Report Stage standards.  The position now is that we may have, perhaps, an hour or so for Committee Stage and that will be quite useless.  There will be no Report Stage at all.  The time spent by the House on the current Finance Bill will probably be shorter than the total amount of time spent on any previous Finance Bill in the past 15 or 20 years.</P>

      <P>The total length of time that will be spent on this Bill will be shorter.  I am glad the Attorney General agrees with that and in spite of that fact&mdash;none of us has the exact figures but we can take it that my statement is correct&mdash;and that this House has spent less time on this Finance Bill as a whole than on any Finance Bill nevertheless it is chopped it is guillotined.  We are told: we will do without parliamentary democracy; we will do without parliamentary discussion. Having seen a bit of what happened last Saturday and Sunday&mdash;I did not inflict myself to look at it too much&mdash;it does not surprise me that the organisers of last Saturday and Sunday would be the people who would carry into effect what we are now about to <Col N="1372" /> witness happening here today, the guillotining of everything that does not suit, the cutting off and the making redundant of a Parliament here.</P>

      <P>Peculiarly enough, it is rather appropriate that the 20th Dáil which has been marked by a preponderance of guillotine motions should be approaching its dying hours with a discussion on another guillotine motion. During the course of a debate on the most recent appointment of a Minister by the Government I found fault with that appointment on the basis that there was a man more qualified for the Ministry concerned than the person appointed and on this occasion I should like to express to the mover of this motion, the Attorney General, my congratulations to him on his appointment.  While we may have a pile of political differences, from the point of view of arranging the business of the House I found him an extremely honourable man.  I also wish to acknowledge his expression of appreciation and goodwill to my colleague, Deputy Browne, and myself.  I always admired the Attorney General's capacity to be able to present a case as a straightforward black and white justification. He has managed to do the same in moving this motion on behalf of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>It is remarkable that the man selected to lead this Parliament always had the capacity to be so silent within the House while he could be so loudmouthed outside it.  It is possible that the Taoiseach's colleagues in the Government advised him not to move this motion because they were afraid he might lose his head as he did last week-end. Is that the reason why they asked the man who was not present at the Ard-Fheis last weekend because he was pleading our case in Europe to make a case in justification for this final guillotine&mdash;it may be the second last guillotine because we could have a further guillotine between now and 7 o'clock.  Nothing surprises us in relation to a guillotine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We listened last weekend to a Taoiseach <Col N="1373" /> who had gone wild.  He went out of his way to quote figures&mdash;the Attorney General quoted the same figures and it is possible he is due credit for having presented those figures to the Taoiseach as part of his scripted contribution&mdash;which showed the number of hours the 20th Dáil sat and the volume of work it completed.  It should be remembered that it takes two sides to do that amount of work.  I should like to draw the attention of the Government, and the Attorney General, to the fact that while the Dáil sat for the number of hours quoted by the Attorney General he always complained that the Opposition were holding up the business of the Dáil.  This open Government have made that complaint since they were formed.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General must accept that we conveyed to him the view that if it was necessary to sit longer hours in order to get the work completed we would prefer that to the sort of fascist-type guillotine motion we have become accustomed to.  A big song and dance has been made of the fact that five days have been spent on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill.  The Attorney General told us he researched the position over the past 20 years but I was surprised he did not go back further.  At the weekend the Taoiseach categorically said that five days was the longest time that had been spent on the Second Stage of a Finance Bill, since the foundation of the State. I hope that was researched.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear him say that.  I did not research further back than 1957 but I am almost certain it is correct because the tendency has been for debates here to get shorter and shorter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance had something to say about debates on Finance Bills since the twenties.  The Attorney General said he was speaking from experience gained over the last 20 years and I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the sixth Finance Bill to be discussed here over the last four-and-a-half years.  There was a statutory requirement in relation to four of the last <Col N="1374" /> five Bills&mdash;which does not apply to this Bill nor the first Bill&mdash;that the Bills be completed within a given time. The Attorney General will recall discussing with me the problem of agreeing to finish the Second Stage of the 1975 Finance Bill when we had many more people anxious, willing and capable of speaking on it.  Under a statutory requirement the Second Stage of that Bill needed to be cleared within so many days following the Financial Resolution, which was the initial budget. Two years ago that requirement was altered to give more time.  The co-operation of which the Attorney General spoke earlier required that certain statutory commitments be adhered to.  He always got the co-operation of the Opposition in this regard.</P>
    <P>The end product of the 1977 Finance Bill, in spite of the squawking of the Minister for Finance and the croaking of the Taoiseach over the weekend, is that this will be the shortest debated Bill on the records of this House. Normally it is the Committee Stage that takes up time.  Last Tuesday week we started debating the Finance Bill. Since then we have had six sitting days and debated it for five.  We still have many speakers.  I reported progress.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Colley said, the establishment of government will not stop because of the non-passing of the Finance Bill at this stage. If I were a member of the Government I would be anxious to see if we could get to the stage of agreeing. The Attorney General made no reference to the Friendly Societies (Amendment) Bill or the Prisons Bill but he said that he had tried to get agreement with the Opposition Whip to finalise the Finance Bill and we were not ready to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The only approach made to us last week was to know if there was any hope of reaching agreement for finalising the Finance Bill.  If I had said to the Attorney General last Wednesday night that we would finish the Finance Bill on Thursday and have a vote at some stage that evening, he would have asked me <Col N="1375" /> to postpone it until today because neither of us would have had the troops to vote on it if we intended opposing it.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach stands between the people and anarchy.  He made a remarkable statement that the blowins here could be blown out for all he cared.  The office of the Government whip may have been in a disturbed state last week.  Over the last four-and-a-half years, most of the closure motions appeared on the Order Paper arising from agreement.  This open Government have been famous for their guillotine motions.  The description of a closure motion and a guillotine motion is the same.  It all depends on whether there has been agreement beforehand.  If there has not been agreement, a guillotine motion is introduced.</P>
      <P>No approach was made to the Opposition Whip asking for agreement with a view to finding time to finish our business.  Perhaps the date of the dissolution of the Dáil had to be kept a secret but notice of the guillotine motion was not conveyed to the appointed elected Members of this House until Monday morning, although the media had the information on Saturday.  Open Government, how are you!  It is open to the extent that it is for political worth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I examined the envelope in which I got the copy of this motion yesterday morning.  It was posted in Dublin at 9.30 according to the postmark.  There is no post delivered in the greater Dublin area on Saturday; we have that benefit in the country and will have it, provided the Government are not reelected and the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs decides, as is predictable, that nobody in rural areas should enjoy anything that those in Howth have not got.  I received the post from the Dáil on Saturday morning, the post that would be sent out normally at 5.30 or 6 o'clock or whatever is the latest time for posting.  I had post redirected to me on Friday to my home address in Abbeyleix and I got it in proper time on the first post on Saturday morning.  Press representatives were in touch with me to <Col N="1376" /> know if I had any information on this guillotine motion and I confessed I had not.  I learned that the information was freely available at the Mansion House.  The Attorney General smiles but this is so.  On Monday morning it transpired that the information freely available in the Mansion House was factual; the Press had the story right.</P>
    <P>The only explanation was that the motion from the Taoiseach's office was deliberately handed in at the Dáil office at a time on Friday night to qualify under Standing Orders to be taken today but so as to keep Members of the House&mdash;particularly the Opposition Members because Government Members had the opportunity of getting the information on Saturday morning&mdash;without the information until Monday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It was an amazing coincidence. My information from three different pressmen who were in touch with me on Saturday was that they could not get the information or confirmation of it.  If it was not deliberately withheld, why did the Government Information Service not issue it?  They never sleep.  The outgoing Government had two successes, the Government Information Service and the Government Whip.  They were great and only for them we would not be at this stage now.  The Dáil would have dissolved a year-and-a-half ago and we would have beaten the Government by a vote in the House.  We had the amazing situation where I heard&mdash;I think it was the Minister for Finance&mdash;talking about forgetfulness today in his usual snide way on this motion.  It is rather remarkable that the Taoiseach on Saturday when he was conveying the information to the reformed mongrel foxes that the Finance Bill would go through this week despite the Opposition because anything the Government brought into the 20th Dáil the Government saw it through.  He forgot about one very important measure that the Government brought into the House and did not see through.  There is no need for me to <Col N="1377" /> remind the present Attorney General what that important measure was.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General, for some reason, was concluding that we were proposing to filibuster on this motion. This is not so, but we want to put some things on record and that is being done.  The situation would have been different if a decent, proper gentlemanly approach had been made by a Government representative to the Opposition last week-end.  The Taoiseach felt it was necessary&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;to appoint an Attorney General but not to appoint a Parliamentary Secretary: he should have appointed somebody to act on his behalf who could have approached the Opposition Whip.  Perhaps it is unfair to say this but if the Government Whip did want to discuss business with the Opposition Whip confidentially, he probably appreciates that he could do that.  But no approach was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My point is that if the Government had approached the Opposition and said: &ldquo;We are now about to answer the demands you have been making for four-and-a-half years for us to get out.  We propose to get out next Wednesday night.  Could you talk to your leader with a view to clearing the Finance Bill, the Prisons Bill and the Friendly Societies Bill?&rdquo;  I do not know what answer I could have given but I think this would have been a far more honourable way to have done it than to have sneakingly&mdash;or as the Attorney General says, mistakenly or by oversight delivered this motion to Leinster House last Friday night too late for the post.  The Attorney General is liable to react by saying: &ldquo;If you are willing to do that through a normal, gentlemanly approach why are you opposing it now?&rdquo;  I am opposing the jackboot method so consistently used by the Government.  I say without fear of contradiction that we have had more guillotine motions from the present Government in the last four and a half years than we have had from the former collective Fianna Fáil Governments over their 16 year period.  If the Attorney General is in a position to contradict this, I am sure that during the election campaign either himself or the Minister for <Col N="1378" /> Finance can do so.  I doubt if he would bother to do the research during the election campaign.  In the context of what the Attorney General has put on the record of the House and put in as part of the Taoiseach's script last weekend as regards the volume of work done, I want people to appreciate that you do not get through that volume of work, get those longer hours, unless you have the wholehearted co-operation of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>I strongly suggest that the Attorney General should research the volume of contributions from the Government side on all those measures through all those hours by comparison with the contributions from the Opposition.  I suggest that if he did he would find that even with the long hours, during the term of the 20th Dáil, Government contributions fell far short of Government contributions in the past.  I think this is wrong.  It is a terrible thing that Deputy Molloy had to come in here some moments ago, two days short of the dissolution of the Dáil, and ask for a quorum.  He had to try to get these cocky Fine Gael and Labour backbenchers into the House to listen to the debate.  They are doing their best to stay out of the House but, at the same time, they are trying to talk the people into sending them back.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate in these dying days of what has been a lengthy and businesslike session with plenty of hard work done by both sides that the Government have adopted the course of action now proposed without making any effort to reach agreement. In tribute to the Attorney General, irrespective of whatever way he might have worked it out with Deputy Browne and myself, I think he would have tried to reach agreement with us.  Now he has the good fortune of being promoted to the position of Attorney General&mdash;a promotion that quite wrongly was delayed&mdash;but if he were still the Government Whip I think he would have suggested to the Taoiseach before the guillotine motion was sent out that he be given permission to make contact with the Opposition Whips to see if a deal could be done with regard to finishing the Finance <Col N="1379" /> Bill this week.  Perhaps the suggestion was made; perhaps the Taoiseach on Friday had not got as far as opening his mouth as wide as he did on Saturday until somebody told him on Sunday to try to close it.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the last major contribution of the man who is now Attorney General should have been the indignity of having to move this guillotine motion.  The Taoiseach owed him more.  It is regrettable that the Attorney General was the man who had to perform this fascist act.  The Taoiseach put his name to the motion and if he had mumbled in his inimitable manner the words &ldquo;I move&rdquo; with regard to the motion it would have been more fair to the Attorney General.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to contribute to the debate on this motion simply to add my voice to those of my colleagues in protest against the procedure which has been adopted.  We have now a situation where constitutionally and practically the most important piece of legislation which this Parliament is called on to deal with in a year is being guillotined.  That is reprehensible conduct on the part of the Government, conduct which is being engaged in by them for their own political reasons but more important it is a procedure that does not auger well for the future of our parliamentary democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Finance Bill is the most important legislation we are called on to deal with in any year.  The power of the House, representing the people, to decide all matters relating to taxation of the people is something which is fundamental to democracy.  In the old days when the American colonies were emerging into nationhood the maxim and principle of &ldquo;no taxation without representation&rdquo; became almost biblical in its significance.  In the complexity of the governing of a modern state these fundamental basic principles may tend to be overlooked but we do so at our peril.  In a modern state there is a special onus on the Government to adhere scrupulously to these basic consitutional democratic tenets.  It is that <Col N="1380" /> aspect of the move by the Government that disturbs me more than anything else.</P>
    <P>I suppose if the results of the general election are as we and most people expect them to be, as a Government we will have plenty of opportunity to deal in our own way with the technical provisions of the Finance Bill, to repeal anything we do not like in the legislation and to make provisions which we think should be included in it.  The fact that we will have another opportunity of dealing with these matters is not really the basic issue. The basic issue is the attitude and approach of the Government to legislation in this House and particularly to taxation legislation.  I do not think there is anything that affects ordinary citizens in their everyday lives so directly and immediately as taxation and if a Parliament has any one function which over-rides all the others in importance it is the function of deciding on taxation, the level of taxation, the people to be taxed, the manner in which the tax is to be levied and so on.  These things go to the very root of the processes of a parliamentary democracy.  Therefore, this House should be very jealous of its power in regard to taxation and legislation.</P>
    <P>Throughout the administration of a modern state today there is constant erosion of the control of the people directly over their affairs.  Because modern government is so complex and difficult, more and more the taking of important decisions is being syphoned off into non-elected areas.  For instance, the area of our economy which is controlled by the State bodies is enormous and increasing every day.  Those State bodies, to a large extent, are not directly amenable to democratic control and are not immediately subject to the scrutiny of Members of this House. This is the case right through the administrative machinery.  More and more, because of the nature of things, because of the pressures of modern society and modern administration, the daily routine decisions are being taken in an executive way by officials and by members of the bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>The one thing that is left to us as a Parliament is the ultimate power of <Col N="1381" /> deciding on the taxes people pay.  We should never part with that power or lessen it in any way no matter what the temptations are.  When we are confronted with a complex tax Bill like this there is great temptation for the ordinary Deputy who is not a tax expert, an accountant or a lawyer to leave it to somebody else to deal with it, to send it to some select committee, to leave it to the experts to tease it out and come to decisions about it.  I suggest from the point of view of democracy, that if we ever succumb to that temptation it will be fatal from the point of view of parliamentary democracy.  Even though it may be tedious and difficult to plough through Finance Bills we must always discharge our duties in regard to them, understand what they are about and take decisions about what is included in them.  That is not always as difficult as it might seem.</P>
    <P>Taxation legislation, because of its very nature, must appear complex and difficult and must be couched in very technical language.  Nevertheless, behind that there is always some very reasonable, simple, straightforward proposal which any of us can understand if it is explained to us.  I believe that rather than do what we are doing on this occasion we should go in the opposite direction.  We should try to devise procedures whereby every Deputy can comprehend what the implications of every section of this Finance Bill are even though he has no understanding of how those implications are derived from the technical language involved.  It is very upsetting for anybody who cares about this House, its status and its prestige, and wishes to see it function properly and fully in those difficult, modern times, to be confronted with the procedure which the Government are resorting to here.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Colley, gave a very clear and explicit outline of the situation in regard to this Finance Bill.  He proved completely to my satisfaction, and I think to the satisfaction of everybody listening, that there is no basic parliamentary need for what the Government are doing here.  I could add that the Government <Col N="1382" /> are doing this because of their inefficient aproach to the situation in the early months of this year but that is not the point.  We are now in a certain situation and the Government are trying to exact some short-term political electoral advantage.  In order to do that they are resorting to this totally unacceptable parliamentary device of bringing in this guillotine motion to rubber stamp the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>There are a few specific aspects of this Finance Bill that I would have liked to go into at some length on Committee Stage.  There are a number of things on which I would have liked to have the opportunity of arguing about with the Minister for Finance and perhaps succeed in some cases in persuading him that without any great detriment to the revenue position some changes could be made and some injustices could be relieved.  I wanted to talk about the situation of commercial travellers who are supplied with motor cars by their firms.  It is quite clear to many Deputies that the provision in regard to benefit is working very unjustly so far as the vast majority of commercial travellers are concerned. Those provisions, which were introduced for a particular reason, are having the side effect of seriously injuring the financial position of commercial travellers.  If we had time to develop this argument and discuss this matter I believe there would have been sufficient Deputies interested in this matter and we would have succeeded in persuading the Minister to make some change.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the current taxation legislation about which I would like to have argued at some length with the Minister is the allowance of Health Act contributions as deductions for income tax purposes.  If I had time to develop this argument and go into all the circumstances I believe I would have mobilised considerable support among Deputies on all sides and perhaps we would have been able to achieve something.  We might have been able to persuade the Minister at least to look into the situation if not to meet us immediately on the point of view we put forward.</P>
    <P>That is the way taxation measures <Col N="1383" /> should be discussed in the House.  We should take time over them; we should go into all the merits and we should try to get, outside of the Minister and the Executive, a consensus of what is reasonable and fair, what improvements can be made and what concessions should be considered.  The procedure which the Government are engaging in this year rules out any possibility of that.  It transforms legislation into a simple straightforward Executive act, no discussing, no teasing out, no examination, no consensus but simply the Minister and to a large extent the Revenue Commissioners. One is quite convinced these days that a great deal of the stuff that is being processed and channelled through the House in a slot-machine fashion comes out of the minds and off the desks of the Revenue Commissioners without any real understanding by the Minister for Finance of what is involved. The situation now is that the Minister for Finance, as far as the Revenue Commissioners are concerned, is the greatest automaton, the greatest slot-machine they have ever come across. They process him and programme him along certain lines.  He comes into the House and what is put before us is machined through the House no matter what the views of the ordinary Deputies are.</P>
    <P>Perhaps that is an efficient way of doing things.  From the point of view of textbook taxation structures it may be the right way to act but from the democratic point of view it is not right and is merely storing up trouble for the future.  For the Government to do this as their last act is thoroughly reprehensible and is very dangerous in terms of our parliamentary democracy.  It is something that bodes ill for the future. Apart from the provisions of the Finance Bill the principle of resorting <Col N="1384" /> to this sort of tactic is undesirable and unacceptable.  I suppose that in any parliament or in any debating chamber there must be included in the rules some provision for guillotine procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I was dealing with the Government's failures as illustrated in this Bill and previous Finance Bills and I was referring specifically to the amount of taxation the Coalition have put on petrol in their term of office.  That evening I heard a radio programme in which a Welsh tourist spokesman was endeavouring to attract Irish tourists to Wales.  He referred to comparative prices in the UK, and part and parcel of his campaign was what he called the comparatively enormous cost of petrol here.</P>
      <P>It is a great change from Fianna Fáil days when one of the great things Bord Fáilte had going for them was that tourists from all parts of the world could be assured that such costs were less here than anywhere in the world, with the exception of Spain.  Now the reverse is the case and it is the direct result of the Coalition's reneging on promises to stabilise prices and to halt inflation. I suppose they will be renewing such promises in the coming weeks and I cannot help reminding Deputies of the solemn statement in the House by the present Attorney General that nobody can be expected justifiably to believe promises made by party politicians.  I hope the people will be mindful of that statement and the integrity of his colleagues in the near future when they make similar promises.</P>
      <P>We have had statements from the Minister for Finance on the amount of money being provided to subsidise foodstuffs as a consequence of the devaluation of the green £.  The taxpayer is paying an enormous sum to meet food subsidies but he still has to shoulder outrageous prices for all commodities. As Deputy Haughey has just said, the Irish taxpayer is taxed out of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government were ill-advised in their allocation of time for the debate on this Bill.  I agree that we have been debating its Second Stage for five days but it is most important that we would have adequate opportunity to examine it in Committee.  The financial resolutions associated with it will be discussed <Col N="1390" /> this evening and we will have only from 10.30 a.m. and 1 p.m. tomorrow to debate Committee Stage. This is a disgrace</P>
    <P>There is no provision in the Bill which will help to tackle inflation.  We have been borrowing money consistently for non-productive purposes.  We on this side do not regard it as improper to borrow money provided it is used intelligently but this Government have been borrowing money to be used to rub people in the right way, and that is not what I would call governing in the national interest.  It is self interest.  The Minister for Finance has no compunction about making outlandish statements.  His only object is to be last to speak and the sky is the limit.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill, in itself, probably constitutes one of the greatest justifications in that it carries no provision for additional taxation.  It could be construed as a step in the right direction but too little and too late.  In this Bill the Minister is implementing something we have been endeavouring to persuade him to do for the past three years.  The most extraordinary thing about the Minister is that, when we offer him advice, it is not accepted. It is Fianna Fáil advice and it cannot be any good&mdash;in the tradition to which the Taoiseach appealed on Saturday last, that of the hate relationship with Fianna Fáil.  The Minister for Finance epitomises that hate relationship to such an extent that no matter what advice our spokesman on Finance may offer it is regarded as being ridiculous, nonsense, accounting for nothing and would have no beneficial effect.  Yet, the following year, through the back door of the Finance Bill he has adopted the suggestions of Deputy Colley over the last three years, presenting them as his own brainwaves. There was the instance of our suggestions on food subsidisation and that made two years ago in relation to petrol.  The extraordinary thing about the Minister is that, when he is offered a suggestion, he dodders with it for fear anybody would think it is somebody else's except that of the great little Minister for Finance and then he offers it as his ingenious idea.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1391" /> I shall be anxious to make some points on Committee Stage.  There might be some possibility of reaching them but it appears to be a fairly negative exercise.  Napoleon was regarded as the little dictator.  Whenever I read about him I think in terms of the Minister for Finance because he too makes up his mind that he is right and Waterloo is just around the corner.</P>

      <P>Deputy Colley raised a number of specific points.  He referred to a provision in section 3, which is a technical amendment necessitated by the passing on 31st March, 1976 of the Corporation Tax Act, and asked three questions in relation to it.  The first was: why was the amendment not included in the Corporation Tax Act? Secondly, why is the amendment to take effect from 31st March, 1976 and thirdly, has some case arisen in which the existing provision has been found to be defective?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Minister that the answers to these questions&mdash;and I am somewhat interested in this Act because I was chairman of the Special Committee on it&mdash;are, to the first that an appropriate amendment was overlooked in the drafting of the Corporation Tax Act which repealed section 530 of the Income Tax Act, 1967. That section was concerned with a tax charge on undistributed income of certain private companies but was replaced by the new provisions in the Corporation Tax Act dealing with closed companies.  Consequently, section 530 was repealed without adverting to the fact that in section 59 of the 1974 Act there was a reference to bodies corporate &ldquo;within the meaning of section 530, subsection (6) of the Income Tax Act, 1967&rdquo;.  This reference is meaningless since the passing of the Corporation Tax Act and is being replaced by a reference to closed <Col N="1392" /> companies.  I hope that disposes of the first of Deputy Colley's questions.</P>
    <P>The second question he asked was why is the amendment to take effect on 31st March, 1976.  The answer is that the amendment is expressed to take effect on 31st March, 1976, that is, from the date on which the reference became inappropriate.  His third question was: has some case arisen in which the existing provision has been found defective.  The answer to that is that no case has come to light in which this reference has been of consequence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe dealt with section 7 of the Bill and asked the number of people who would be removed from the tax net as a result of its provisions. I thought the Minister had dealt with that in his introductory speech on Second Stage.  However, it is as well to clarify the position because many people are interested in it and there should not be any confusion.  In his introductory remarks on Second Stage the Minister referred to the fact that 10,000 pensioners will benefit from the provision and that, of those, some 5,000 would be taken out of the tax net altogether.  Deputy Briscoe made the additional point that a school warden who is also in receipt of a contributory old age pension could be chargeable to tax.  As I understand the position, school wardens are paid at a daily rate of £3.72, that is £18.60 for a five-day week.  The amount a warden can earn in a year depends on the number of days worked by him. However, if his earnings, together with his contributory old age pension, exceed the limits set out in section 7&mdash; that is, £1,000 for a single person and £1,800 for a married person&mdash;he will be chargeable to tax, subject to marginal relief where that is appropriate. That is a normal provision in tax laws where there is a figure mentioned for a higher level.</P>
    <P>I understand there has been some criticism by the Opposition of income tax reliefs mentioned in the budget. One of the points grabbed in desperation from the sky by the Opposition was that they unduly favoured the higher paid and did not give sufficient relief to middle management.  As I read <Col N="1393" /> it, the personal tax concessions include the removal of the temporary 10 per cent sur-charge imposed on the standard and higher rates in 1975.  We all know that was a very difficult year. When account is taken of this factor, the balance of the reliefs do not unduly favour the better-off.  Of course, the personal tax concessions must be considered in the context of the national pay agreement.  What is important to employees in this context is not the reduction in tax payable but the combined increase in take-home pay arising from pay increases and tax concessions.  In the case of a middle manager earning, say, £120 per week, the increase in take-home pay is 10.6 per cent if he is married.  That is not significantly different from the 10.8 per cent increase applicable at the £200 a week level.</P>
    <P>This amounts to the fundamental fact that this Government reduced the lower income tax rate from 35 per cent to 20 per cent.  That is a drop of 15 per cent.  The top income tax rate was reduced from 80 per cent to 60 per cent, a drop of 20 per cent.  The most imaginative incentive ever given to people to work is to work and invest. People who are in the higher tax bracket have spent many years getting to that stage.  Most of those people are people who are on in life, who have made sacrifices and have got themselves there by ability, hard work and application.  Ability must be recognised if we want the proper brains in management in this country.  No Minister for Finance and no Government need apologise for that principle.  It is recognised the world over.  Anybody who has looked at certain television programmes concerning the English labour and executive market had it driven forcibly home to him the other day when people changed their standing in society from being employees to setting themselves up in specially made mini-companies.  That means that pay structure is going wrong somewhere. Therefore one must give fair reward for fair work and ability.  That has been the principle stated by the Minister for Finance and by the Taoiseach on numerous occasions in this House and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1394" /> Deputy Colley referred to the desirability for special treatment of loans for house purchases, particularly for young married couples.  The Deputy probably had in mind that the limit of £2,000 allowed for interest payments on borrowings for the purpose of tax relief was not sufficient. The limit of £2,000 was imposed by the Finance Act, 1974, with effect from 10th January, 1974.  In adopting that limit, the position of people buying their own houses was kept specially in mind.  At the time the imposition of the limit was announced, 9th January, 1974, the building society rate was 11¼ per cent and £2,000 interest represented borrowings of almost £18,000 from building societies. In other words the £2,000 limit of interest would have covered borrowings up to £18,000 on a house purchase.  Assuming a loan equivalent going up to over 80 per cent of the purchase price, a house costing over £22,000 could be bought with the aid of a loan the total interest on which would qualify for tax relief.  One must bear in mind the fact that a fall in interest rates has occurred.  It goes very close to restoring the position which existed in January, 1974.  It would be unrealistic to regard the limit of £2,000 as any brake on the efforts of newly-weds to buy even a moderate priced house.</P>
    <P>This new provision in the Finance Bill, the 25 per cent corporation tax incentive scheme, is completely new to the western world.  It was a principle hard to conceive of and hard to execute and put on paper in legal language.  Some Deputies have inquired about the general philosophy of the thinking behind the requirement of the two target increases, that is, the employment 3 per cent increase and the output 5 per cent increase.  The incentive is designed to encourage manufacturing industry in creating employment.  It is, therefore, logical to have the two tests for the incentive.  This arrangement should encourage firms which can do so to undertake quickly genuine expansions. The incentive is necessary for results achieved.  The existence of two tests both at quite reasonable levels should also have the incidental effects of <Col N="1395" /> making difficult any artificial manipulations not related to genuine enterprise or growth merely for the sake of qualifying for the 25 per cent rate of corporation tax concession.  One of the difficulties that Ministers for Finance always have when they want to do good is that people do not think Ministers for Finance have the intention of doing good.  There will always be wily merchants, lawyers and other experts ready to help those who are not within the spirit of the policy of the Minister.  While increased output may automatically produce extra employment, this is a short-term measure designed to give an early and significant stimulus to the manufacturing sector in order to accelerate the economy's upward progress.  It is reasonable to require minimum employment increases for firms seeking to qualify for the incentive in 1977, 1978 and 1979.  The Bill confines the incentive to manufacturing industry because it is quite reasonable to look to that sector to play a basic and prime role in stimulating economic activity.  The effects should be felt outside that sector.  We all realise that there is always a wash-off from any progressive or productive activity.  The services industry and others benefit from the main productive centre.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to cases where increases in output and employment were not maintained.  The Minister's speech fairly adequately covered the basis of the incentive.  This Bill sets a standard in judging where the baseline is.  The year 1976 will be the standard year throughout the three years for established industry.  The qualifying target levels will be announced year by year and qualification will be determined accordingly.  Each year will be separately considered.  The position of new manufacturing firms setting up in 1977 or subsequently is hardly likely to arise in connection with this incentive because of the large package of industrial tax incentives in some cases.  If necessary, the Minister will probably propose to give further consideration to the matter in 1978 when the conditions for that period <Col N="1396" /> are being framed and likewise for 1979.  It is the sort of proposal where there cannot be fixed rigidity.  There are bound to be changes in markets and other conditions and in particular sectors of industry and perhaps also in relation to values or specific currencies where firms are trading which would have an effect on a particular company's wellbeing or growth prospects.</P>
    <P>As regards tax credit, the proportion of company tax to be imputed to shareholders, the rate of 35 per cent which has obtained hitherto will obviously have to be looked at by reference to the new rates of corporation tax provided for in this Bill including, of course, the special temporary 25 per cent incentive rate. The Minister said this matter will be dealt with appropriately next year.  As I said in my opening remarks dealing with this corporation tax incentive, it might be of some interest to Members of the House to know that, while we have initiated this new type of incentive, the American Administration at this moment are trying to copy or set up something on the same lines as the Minister has set up in this Bill. It must be a matter of pride to this House that an Irish Administration have broken new ground and that, with the advice of our public servants, we have done something completely new.  This is rather flattering.  Imitation is the best form of flattery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>A little line was quoted from the Fianna Fáil policy document which made very unhappy reading.  We must realise we are in a market.  We are competing with other Governments to get industries into Ireland.  Therefore, we must be in the race and make the right moves at the right time.  The Government have made the right moves.  This will be a great incentive to established businesses and new businesses.</P>
      <P>As is natural, when one is dealing with taxation and finance in this House there is bound to be a reference to capital taxation.  We have various sets of capital taxes.  Some Deputies referred to reviews of capital taxation thresholds.  It might be no harm to repeat a rather important statement made by the Minister for Finance on 15th May, 1974, in a speech to the Confederation of Irish Industry.  He was speaking about wealth tax.  I have been asked this question several times possibly because people knew I took some considerable interest in the working out of the Wealth Tax Bill and the run up debates to that Bill before it finally became law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said thresholds will be reviewed every three years to take account of inflation and valuations initially agreed will remain valid for three years.  That is a guarantee given by the Minister on the parity situation. That should be repeated because people are inclined to forget these things.  When a Government have been in power for such a long time, you like to remind them of what was said earlier on in their term of office.  Section 12 of the Wealth Tax Act freezes the agreed valuation of real property and unquoted shares for three years, that is, 1975, 1976 and 1977 in the first instance.  In the circumstances, a remission of thresholds before 1978 would not be warranted and, taken in conjunction with exempted property such as private residences, bloodstock, <Col N="1398" /> farmers' livestock, woodlands, works of art, gardens, and so on, property whose valuation is frozen under section 12 represents a large percentage of wealth.  These are what one would describe as fixed assets.</P>
    <P>When that section was being debated, there was a very pressing request to the Minister to gear capital tax to some other method, an automatic evaluation.  Every Member of the House must realise what has happened since May 1974, in relation to all the currencies of the world.  They have virtually gone up and down like yo-yos.  The various parities which then existed are things of the past, and a matter of wonderment when one looks back and sees what the then parities were, and when one looks back and sees where the flow of trade has gone.  There has been a big change. One country which consumed 19 per cent of imported goods might have increased their consumption of imported goods to something like 30 per cent. It would then depend on where these goods come from.  If you tag capital assets to the consumer price index with that sort of a background, you might get a very peculiar result.  The fair suggestion as put forward by the Minister is that it is a matter for review in the light of the circumstances existing at the date when the review takes place in 1978.</P>
    <P>As regards the other capital taxes, the White Paper on Capital Taxation at paragraph 122 states that a review of thresholds would be less necessary in the case of the threshold for liability to capital acquisitions tax by the immediate family in view of the high exemption figure proposed while, as regards proposed capital gains tax, allowance has already been made for the inflation factor by not subjecting these gains to the full progressive rates of income tax.</P>
    <P>I want to make this quite clear.  It may be a little difficult to take, but it is very short.  On their re-election the National Coalition Government will honour their undertaking to review capital taxation thresholds.  That says enough.  I do not need to expand on it any further.  I should like Deputies who are so keen on talking about <Col N="1399" /> rising prices and such matters to bear in mind that the cost of food in England has risen 30 per cent higher and faster than the cost of food here. Secondly, we, as the Government, removed VAT from the necessary daily foods for the average family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very interested to hear Deputy Esmonde quoting from what I took to be the manifesto we may expect before the election.  He said that on their re-election the Coalition Government will honour their promise to do something.  Considering the fact that they issued a 14-point plan prior to the last election in which they promised to reduce prices, to control unemployment and to increase employment, and when we look at what has resulted from four years of Coalition Government, the public can hardly be expected to believe they will honour the promise mentioned by Deputy Esmonde or, in fact, any other promise.</P>
      <P>One of the purposes of the Finance Bill is to increase taxation and permit of its collection.  It is equally important to know how it is spent.  We have seen during the past few weeks an advertisement in the newspapers by the Minister for Labour purporting to offer £20 a week to employers who reemploy people.  We regard this advertisement as misuse of public funds. We said so in this House and we were very critical of it.  Now I note that the Department of Local Government appear to find it necessary to publish large advertisements at this time, immediately before the election, about housing grants and certificates of reasonable value.  I sincerely hope that the people will study these advertisements very carefully.  They will find that a young man or woman wishing to buy or build his or her own home will get a grant from the Department of Local Government provided that his or her income is under £38 a week. I would be ashamed if I were in charge of a Department of State to advertise that no housing grant is now available to any person unless his income is below the princely sum of £38 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1400" /> I also note in the advertisement a reference to reconstruction grants for the improvement of houses.  Under Fianna Fáil, reconstruction grants were available from the State irrespective of the valuation of a house and supplementary grants were available from the local authorities irrespective of income and the valuation of the house.  The Minister for Local Government is advertising that from now on no reconstruction grant will be available in the city for houses over £20 valuation; no such grant will be available in the country for houses over £15 valuation or over £10 valuation in rural areas.  It is extraordinary that the Department should find it necessary, just before an election, to publish this kind of advertisement.  I hope that it will be read very carefully by the people so that they will see the enormous change since the days when Fianna Fáil were in office and grants were available to all, irrespective of income and valuation.</P>
    <P>Year after year the Minister for Finance introduced budgets and Finance Bills, all of which increased the rate of inflation and were, therefore, responsible in themselves for price increases. Each budget and Finance Bill resulted in higher unemployment.  In 1976 Fianna Fáil published their emergency economic document outlining the methods by which we proposed to get the economy back on an even keel. The Minister for Finance made derisory comments about this document almost before the ink had dried on it. He proceeded to adopt the ideas in it and tried to put them into effect in this year's budget and Finance Bill. It is fortunate that we published this emergency economic document because I am convinced, as are the people, that had we not published it the Minister would have continued with the type of budget he had introduced in previous years which increased inflation and unemployment.  It was surely a conversion worth noting.  Of course, the problem still remains that while his advisers recognise the merits in our proposals the Minister himself has neither the will nor the conviction necessary to effectively put these proposals into operation.  It would clearly <Col N="1401" /> need the return of a Fianna Fáil Government to office to get the necessary drive and impetus behind these proposals so as to ensure that the benefits of which these proposals are capable will be achieved both in relation to controlling inflation and reducing unemployment.</P>
    <P>Only a Government which know their own mind can effectively deal with the shocking mess in which we find ourselves after four years of Coalition Government, with escalating prices, exceptionally high unemployment and immense foreign debt.  We have been pointing out for years that the major issues facing this country are unemployment and inflation but we have been doing very much more than that.  We have been unique as an Opposition in that we published long before an election the remedies which we believe could effectively control these evils.  As I pointed out earlier, some of these policies were stolen by the Government.  A Government made up of groupings basically opposed to one another ideologically could not take the decisions necessary to overcome our problems.  Instead of facing up to these problems they resorted to excuses, the main excuse being that the fault was not theirs and lay with external factors, the oil crisis and so on.  It is a fact, as Deputy Colley <Col N="1402" /> clearly showed in his statement here and on the radio, that these excuses do not hold water.  He pointed out that the increase in the price of petrol was due more to the extra taxation imposed by the Minister for Finance than to the Arabs or any outside factors.</P>
    <P>There is in my view a very serious aspect of the matter.  It is a psychological one which could retard our return to stability for quite a long time.  If the Government continue to fall back on excuses rather than face up to the problems which beset the country, then the prospects of our overcoming our difficulties are nil.  I believe it is vital that the Fianna Fáil Party, which produced quite a number of policy documents, should be returned to power in the next election so as to put the proposals in the emergency economic document into effect to bring down inflation and increase employment. This is essential at the present time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that I am not in any way suggesting any criticism of the Chair but it is an illustration of the kind of difficulty into which we are forced because of the guillotine motion.  The amendments were tabled in accordance with Standing Orders immediately on the conclusion of Second Stage but it follows, because of what happened, that they have not yet come to the attention of the Chair or the Minister.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 33, to delete &ldquo;£95&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£105&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section proposes to increase the income limit for qualification for the dependent relative allowance which is <Col N="1412" /> welcome but it does not do anything to increase the amount of the allowance which it is proposed will remain at £95.  If we bear in mind that the allowances for a married man, a widow or a widower and a single person are all being increased under section 6 by approximately 9 per cent I suggest that the amount of the allowance for the dependent relative should be increased by the same per cent which I believe would give an allowance of £105.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section secures that in future the income limit for purposes of the dependent relative allowance, under section 142 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, will be an amount equal to the maximum old age non-contributory pension, that is, the personal rate payable to persons of 80 years and upwards.  For this year the limit will be £727 but any future increase in the pension will automatically raise the income limit by the amount of that increase.</P>
      <P>The section is being given effect as from 6th April, 1976.  Since old age pensions were increased in October, 1976, the existing income limit for 1976-77 must now be raised to the level of the pension for that year&mdash; £591.  From now on, however, it will not be necessary to bring in a special Finance Bill section to raise the dependent relative income limit each time old age pensions are increased.</P>
      <P>The basic provisions of section 142, of the 1967 Act, as now rewritten, secure that if, for any year a taxpayer maintains at his own expense a dependent relative having no income other than&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  a non-contributory old age pension, personal rate, including a pension carrying the supplement of £1 per week for pensioners over 80 living alone, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  an income of equivalent amount from any other source, he will be entitled to an income tax allowance of £95.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £95 allowance will be reduced by a £1 for each £1 by which the dependent relative's income exceeds the maximum old age pension, at present £727.  I want to emphasise that <Col N="1413" /> the threshold is £727, not £95.  People might think that the effect of the section, as amended, would be that the actual allowance would be £95 and that is not so.  The area of exemption is £727, not £95.  That means that some part of the dependent relative allowance will be available to the taxpayer for 1977-78 unless the relative's income is £822 or more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for outlining the provisions of the section but, as I pointed out, what is involved in the section is an increase in the income limit for the dependent relative allowance.  The section does not propose to increase the actual allowance, whatever the income limit may be.  The amendment is designed to increase the allowance in roughly the same proportion as it is proposed to increase in section 6 the allowances for single persons, married persons, widows and widowers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the object of the Deputy's amendment.  I suggest that by increasing the exemptions of the threshold that we are meeting the objective which the Legislature have always tried to meet of exempting such income as is related to old age pension.  Therefore, while I naturally sympathise with all ambitions of the Opposition Members to relieve the tax burden&mdash;I have given proof of that in this Finance Bill by doing it rather than talking about it&mdash; I am afraid it is not possible to accede to the amendment at this stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 2 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;Section 119 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is hereby amended by the substitution of `£6,500' for `£1,500' in each place where it occurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be appreciated that I, under the guillotine motion, like the Minister and other Members, find it rather difficult to deal with these matters in present circumstances.  I <Col N="1415" /> have a little difficulty in locating my notes on these amendments.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to increase from £1,500 to £6,500, the sum which was laid down in 1958 as the test of what is a higher paid employee.  I repeat this figure was fixed in 1958.  Over the years it has been dropping but in the last few years because of inflation the figure has become unrealistic.  To suggest that somebody earning £1,500 a year is &ldquo;higher paid&rdquo; is so ludicrous that I do not think anybody would attempt to argue the case.  I have drawn the Minister's attention to this matter on a few occasions&mdash;on the budget debate and on the Second Stage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 relates to the method by which benefit in kind from the use of cars provided by employers is assessed. To suggest that somebody with an income of £1,500 is higher paid and, therefore, any benefit in kind he gets from a car provided by his employer is clearly a perk over and above his already high salary and should be treated accordingly for taxation purposes, is self-evidently a ridiculous proposition in today's terms.  I hope the Minister will not have any difficulty in accepting, having regard to the enormous rate of inflation in recent years, that it is simply not justifiable in any circumstances to leave the figure at £1,500.</P>
    <P>The suggestion in the amendment of increasing this figure to £6,500 is reasonable having regard to the fall in the value of money since that time. If the Minister wanted to haggle about the figure, I would not haggle too much with him, but I hope he will have no difficulty in accepting the proposition that the figure of £1,500 needs to be substantially increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in relation to the last observations of the Deputy, every tax argument considered in isolation looks very convincing, but you have to try to strike a balance. If you were to correct each anomaly on its own isolated merits you would soon end up with the situation in which there would appear to be no revenue at all.  I am sure the two <Col N="1416" /> former Finance Ministers present, Deputy Colley and Deputy Haughey, know what I mean.  Even if you try to correct one anomaly, you would probably generate another one.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the Seventh Report of the Commission on Income Taxation published in 1962.  It said:</P>
      <P>If we are to apply provisions in an even-handed manner to all taxpayers there should be no specific limit.  We should not say that we will not look at benefits in kind if they are under a certain figure. Benefits in kind could be so inflated as to be of far greater value than the nominal income received by people.  The proper thing to do is to look at the benefits in kind, to see what value they have and putting all those things together, to see if a person is within a certain tax bracket and to tax him accordingly</P>
      <P>I should like to make a correction there; those words of wisdom were spoken by me last year and are not actually in the commission's report itself but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The merit of all argument is to be judged on the content of the argument not on the person by whom the views are advanced.  Section 119 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, certainly provides for benefits in kind legislation to apply only to those employees whose emoluments amount to £1,500 or more.  Certainly, frequent representations were made to Deputy Colley, as I know, and to Deputy Haughey also on the question of increasing this threshold and the threshold has been increased in an adjacent island but the question was very carefully considered by the Commission on Income Taxation in 1962 and they considered&mdash;I am sure very properly&mdash; that there should be no artificial limit, no limit selected out of the air as it were.  We all know that if the Oireachtas <Col N="1417" /> ever attempt to strike what they consider to be at that time the right limit, that limit seldom remains the correct one for any significant period.  The correct thing is to leave the matter in such a way as to enable the Revenue Commissioners in assessing a taxpayer's liability to take account of various movements that have taken place since the legislation was first passed.  I would hesitate, from the point of view of general principle, in putting an artificial limit into the legislation. Deputy Colley may say that the £1,500 is itself an artificial limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is.  He says it has now little relevance to present day requirements but it is closer to the objective set out in the Report on Income Taxation which said there should be no artificial limit.  The best argument to be advanced in favour of setting a limit is that it is administratively convenient and therefore reduces the load of work which an inspector has to discharge.  I do not regard that as unimportant because if you can reduce the administrative load it relieves the taxpayer just as much as it may relieve the burdens of the Revenue Commissioners.  But the ideal is not to be building in artificial limits which will inevitably generate anomalies and vexations of some kind but to leave everybody's tax position to be assessed fairly and openly according to the particular circumstances of the person's trade or occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is trying to be ingenious but I do not think he is succeeding very well.  If he thinks there should be no limit he should be providing for the abolition of the £1,500 limit.  Clearly, he does not think that or he would have a section in the Bill deleting it.  If, on the other hand, there should be a limit, as I believe there should be, then it should be adjusted substantially from the level fixed 20 years ago.  It was fixed on the basis that somebody at that time earning £1,500 a year and having the use of a car provided by an employer was regarded as having an extra perquisite <Col N="1418" /> to his employment which was sufficiently valuable to justify taxing him.  If he was regarded as being in the higher income bracket there was all the more reason, perhaps, for taking that course.  The Minister has not attempted to suggest that there is now any justification for regarding somebody earning £1,500 a year as being in the higher income bracket but the fact is that many lower paid workers have a motor car which is essential to their business or occupation and they are being taxed artificially on this alleged benefit in kind.  The Minister cannot justify what is happening at present.</P>
      <P>It is fair for him to say that representations were made to me and probably to Deputy Haughey but I would point out that if the position was bad then&mdash;I assume it was&mdash;it is far worse now because since the present Minister became Minister for Finance the rate of inflation has gone out of hand.  We have been suffering a rate of inflation in excess of 20 per cent for a few years.  That makes an enormous difference and if the Minister cannot agree to do this he should say &ldquo;I cannot afford it&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am not prepared to do it at the moment because I had not thought of it originally&rdquo; but he should not try to tell us that it is a bad idea theoretically to increase it. If he wants to stand on theory let him abolish the limit altogether and try to justify that.  I do not think he could. but at least that is more justifiable than saying that you should not have a limit but that he is going to have a limit of £1,500.  It is quite unrealistic as it stands at present and cannot be defended, I suggest.</P>

      <P>I am gratified to find the Minister at this late hour accepting the principle of discretion for the Revenue Commissioners which I have so often advocated here.  Better late than never.  This net is so wide in many ways and the resources of the Revenue Commissioners are so limited that what in fact is happening is gross inequity where some people get away with it and others on a more or less spot check basis are being nailed.  This is a problem in regard to benefits in kind generally and particularly <Col N="1419" /> in regard to this type of benefit in kind.  As Deputy Colley says, we are very constrained for time and there is not time for reasoned arguments but I would just make these three points which I have no time to support with arguments (1) the necessity for discretion; if you do not have it you will have evasion unless you have a very strong policing organisation which the Revenue Commissioners at the moment do not have: (2) in fact, the spreading of the net so widely has the effect I have mentioned: (3) it seems that on comparison Deputy Colley's figure is more realistic than the Minister's.  The Minister stated that the £1,500 was nearer the intention but that argument escapes me.  I presume the Minister, like the rest of us, does not feel he has time to elaborate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>While we are constrained for time I should like to pursue this argument further but it is very significant that the Commercial Travellers' Association who have made very strong representations in this regard themselves observed last year that when they circulated their own members only five per cent of them signed the petition seeking an adjustment of the benefits in kind tax legislation. Most people when asked to sign something that will confer benefits on them or will do them no harm are prone to sign instantly but that did not happen in this case.  We have had a considerable amount of theoretical argument which has little basis in fact.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider that people are very cagey about signing in case it comes to the notice of certain authorities? In the present situation there is such selectivity that nobody wants to lay his head on the block.  Perhaps the Minister might consider it from that point of view.  A closer look into the administration of the complex situation <Col N="1420" /> the Minister has brought about with his legislation might do no harm.</P>

      <P>There are two ways in which one can get precise payment of tax.  One is by setting up such a huge policing system that the cost becomes prohibitive and the return is not worth the effort.  The other course, which many administrations have adopted, is to pursue cases of suspected substantial under-return of income. Word soon gets abroad that it is unwise of people not to make adequate returns because the penalties are even greater than any &ldquo;profits&rdquo; that might be gained by making fraudulent returns.  Frankly, I see nothing wrong with this system which puts the onus on people to be honest if that is going to mean lower adminstrative costs.  Ultimately it means a relief to the taxpayer because he has not to get individually involved in complicated returns every year and it also means lower administrative costs.  If there is the occasional case which comes to notice which causes the &ldquo;victim&rdquo; to make others aware of what befell him.  I do not regard that as bad.  It is probably a good thing if it means we have lowered administrative costs.</P>

        <i>Pro tanto</i> the Minister has my agreement but when you have penal laws that press very hard to the extent of really being bad laws they in themselves tend towards demoralisation and they bring about the situation which I have outlined. We cannot pursue this debate much further.  In practice, because of the sudden and heavy burden imposed on a certain class particularly with regard to cars discrepancies have occurred in the last two years.  It is widely known that it is difficult for the authorities to catch up with them and, although I agree completely with the Minister's principles, these principles can be completely destroyed in working practice by having the wrong legislation.</P>

It is a perk but that word does not appear in the legislation or in the fiscal code.  What we have done recently is to provide an easier system of assessing the value of that perk and it is interesting that only 5 per cent have protested about the change.  If the anxiety and opposition to it were as strong as some people have made it out to be, I believe there would have been a higher proportion of protesters.  My experience as a public representative, &mdash;I am sure this is shared by many other Members&mdash;is that most people cannot resist putting their signature to any petition that is put before them. When only 5 per cent bothered to do it, I think they realise the legislation is fair and they have no genuine cause to protest about it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 2 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;Section 25 of the Finance Act, 1973 is hereby repealed with effect from the 6th day of April, 1977.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment does not deal with the full problem that is adverted to in it but I think it enables us at least to open up the problem which relates to the restriction on the expenses of <Col N="1422" /> business cars.  In recent years the Minister has introduced the most Draconian measures in this regard and they have led to an enormous amount of frustration and inequity in many cases.  On the winding up of the budget debate I asked him if it was intended to use this measure as a revenue raising provision or whether it was intended as a form of discrimination against a particular form of business or professional activity.  By that I meant if there was any theoretical notion that this discrimination produces equity or something like that.  The Minister is capable of that kind of argument so I have to put the question.  I also asked if he could indicate the amount of revenue derived from it and the cost of administration.  I have not got that information and perhaps the Minister would give it to the House now.  He can be under no illusion that the provisions involved have led to enormous frustration and annoyance on the part of taxpayers and, I would imagine, on the part of officials in the Revenue Commissioners office.  A great deal of time and energy have been devoted to arguing the liability of taxpayers under this provision.  Before I pursue the matter I should like to give the Minister an opportunity of telling us something about the facts of the situation in so far as it relates to the amount of revenue and the cost of administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy to give the Deputy that information because he will quickly see how justified we were in bringing in this provision in the 1973 Finance Act. The figures reveal what was happening in relation to the provision of cars of a very high market price to people who were lucky enough to be the recipients.  Deputy Colley said that the limit of £3,500 was causing frustration and he has suggested again today that it makes the administration of the income tax system much more difficult than it need be, with little or no benefit to the State.  I am quoting from what the Deputy said.</P>

      <P>The current yield is of the order of £5 million a year.  It is very considerable.  I believe I am talking in pre-1977 Finance Act terms and obviously it will be somewhat less now that we have lowered the top rates of tax.  That is the value in revenue terms of the benefits enjoyed in respect of very big cars.</P>
      <P>Let us remove it for a moment from the Exchequer and revenue fields.  It is of particular relevance in a Finance Bill but in another very progressive society we have seen recently where a newly elected popular president has proposed measures to discourage the use of large cars as a very necessary step towards energy conservation.  We have a similar need.  It is an even greater need than in the United States of America, which has a greater proportion of domestic sources of energy than we have.  If a consequence of the Finance Bills which we introduced was to discourage the use of large cars I would consider that a very good thing.  The reality is that there has been a marginal reduction in the use of large cars but there has been, from the figures I have quoted, a very substantial increase in revenue which certainly justifies from a revenue point of view&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Everybody knows we have an increasing population.  The larger proportion of those people will in the next decade be under 30 years of age and they need to be provided for.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was increased to £3,500 to take account of increases in the price of cars.  The greater proportion of those increases was attributable to circumstances outside our control because they were dictated by world circumstances as also was the price of energy which large cars use wastefully. They have been called &ldquo;guzzlers&rdquo; in the United States.  We do not believe in encouraging the use of huge &ldquo;guzzlers&rdquo;.  What are those changes worth in revenue?  They are worth £5 million.  I believe we were justified in collecting that.  I establish the justification for it by the fact that the revenue has been of that dimension.</P>

      <P>It is the package of measures of 1976 and the yield from the limit of £3,500 on company cars. That produces £5 million.  We believe it is entirely justifiable.  I would find it <Col N="1425" /> very hard on grounds of equity, which Deputy Colley despises, to make any modification in this field.  I do not believe it is necessary.  I believe we have proved our point by the revenue which this adjustment made.  Deputy Colley asked me what the cost of the administration was.  It is not possible to put a price on the cost of administration because this element is only a tiny fraction of the cost of assessing the tax liability of the beneficiaries of large company cars.  It certainly is not possible to estimate what portion of an inspector's time is applied to assessing the value of a car and all perks relating to that and anything else.  I feel satisfied it is quite small in relation to the revenue returned.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I said to the Minister that there are so many involved in the category that all those people are caught.  If one listens to the Minister's argument one would think that it is just a handful of people with very big cars paying a very big lump sum each who are involved but that is not the position.  The £5 million is made up of a large number of elements spread over a large number of people.  The employee who needs the car for his business is also caught.  The people in that category are the hardest hit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no way of judging how that revenue is made up.  The Minister is in a position to give it.  I repeat two things I said before.  The first is that it is not surprising that very few signatures were received because people will not sign a document like that for fear of attracting particular attention in general, whether they are right or wrong.  There is a healthy fear generated through the <Col N="1426" /> Minister of certain State activities.  I think the Minister knows my attitude to one Department which he has put in an impossible position.  The second thing is that notwithstanding his £5 million which he has got over this wide area there are still a lot of misses as well as hits, there are a lot of honest people making returns and I am sure that there is a certain amount of fiddling going on.  The fiddlers know that the Revenue Commissioners are not able to get on top of it.  This is all the result of ill-conceived, theoretical and bad legislation that could be dealt with otherwise.</P>

      <P>I cannot, quite frankly, regard it as bad legislation to say that we have stopped a practice under which some well-heeled people were able to have cars given to them, worth £8,000 or £10,000, and had the value of those cars and the cost of running them set-off as a business expense and got all that without paying taxation on it. It is quite clearly a very substantial benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am being frank as far as the information available to me allows me to answer these specific questions which are being put.  I am concerned, as every Minister for Finance ought to be concerned, with endeavouring to make all people equal under the law.  That means equal under the tax laws too.  When one considers that the vast majority have to provide their cars out of after-tax income one must look to the situation <Col N="1427" /> in which some people have cars available without having to pay tax on them at all or as under our law now, paying a certain amount of tax in respect of the availability of their cars. Deputy de Valera makes the point that it is still open to people to act in a human way&mdash;I shall not say &ldquo;fiddle&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to adjust the system to their own advantage in a way which legislatures are unable to avoid totally.  At least we have produced a fairer package as between one group of taxpayers and another than that which existed previously.  I make no apology for that although some people who previously enjoyed certain perks now find that they must pay something towards those perks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to emphasise that my vehemence is provoked by shortage of time rather than anything else.  One is somewhat constrained when one is talking against the clock, as it were.  However, the Minister mentioned cars in the £8,500 to £10,000 range and he mentioned also a figure of 25 per cent.  If he takes 25 per cent of £5 million and ascertains thereby how many cars are involved, he will realise how basic socially the problem is.  Let him then take the remaining 75 per cent of the £5 million and he will realise that this is spread among the people who are hit badly by this provision.  Deputies Haughey and Colley have amendments tabled in this regard.  It was not the person who was paying tax of up to £1,000 on the value of his car who was victimised.  I would agree with the Minister that such people could afford to pay but we are talking about the smaller man, the commercial traveller, for example, because we suspect that that is where 75 per cent of the £5 million came from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a contrast between paying no tax and now paying £4 million on the category of car the Deputy is talking about.  There has always been a liability to pay tax in <Col N="1428" /> respect of the availability of a car but interminable arguments went on with the result that some people paid more to accountants than to the Revenue Commissioners in order to have their arguments processed.  All that has happened is that we have brought to an end the argument that went on and I think that is why so few people, when asked to sign the petition, bothered to put their names to it. They realised that we have provided a very simple instrument for putting an end to much argument which required the keeping of the most appalling detailed accounts and which often left people in such a way that for several years after the year of trading, they were not aware of their tax liability.  We have produced what is accepted by most people as being fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has the advantage in having the accurate information at his disposal but I still contend that the reason for many people not signing the document was that their mere name on it would pinpoint them for query, regardless of whether they deserved to be queried. I could instance many such cases that came to my notice as a Deputy.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the Minister is right about benefits in kind in the past and about people paying accountants but these were people in the higher income bracket whereas those who have been captured by the Minister's legislation are the ones who never had to resort to accountants.  To have signed that document would have been regarded as tantamount to giving notice to the police.  Nobody wishes to draw attention to himself in that way particularly in so far as the Revenue Commissioners are concerned, knowing the wide ramifications that are involved.  In addition, on the Minister's own admission, 75 per cent of the £5 million is in the area that up to now would not have been affected seriously by the benefit in kind for the simple reason that most of that expense is very justly attributable to the job and was more in the nature of a necessity than a perk.  The Minister should not have confused the two categories.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy would wish me to put it on the record that, in the first place, the names of the persons who signed that petition were never made known to the Revenue Commissioners.  The petition was referred to in a bulletin of the organisation in question in which it was recorded that only 5 per cent had signed but their names were not made available to the Revenue Commissioners. Consequently, nobody was put in peril as a result of signing.  If such a protest had come to me I would have, as would have any Minister for Finance, respected such confidences and would not have revealed names to the Revenue Commissioners.  Conversely the Revenue Commissioners do not reveal names to Ministers.</P>

      <P>We have come close to the truth, that is, that this set of measures affects in the main, not the well-off people with the big cars but those with small cars by today's standards who are deemed to have any use of these cars.  The Minister introduced an artifical method of calculating the value of this use.  He said it would save expense from the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners but it seems to me that the difficulties that have been created are a result of this artificial approach which is imposing a heavy tax on people who cannot afford to pay.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that the Minister cannot see his way to doing something about this.  From what he has said it is clear that he is set on continuing on this very unsatisfactory course.  However, in due course&mdash;not very long, though&mdash;it will be dealt with in another way.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to the Revenue foregone in reducing the top rates of tax in 1977 to 60 per cent. the amount of revenue foregone is minimal, about £4 million out of £540 million in income tax, because most income tax is gathered from the masses of the people who are on lower incomes.  The fact that 25 per cent of this additional revenue in respect of cars is collected from those at the upper income level is clearly established as a justification for the measures we took.  It is a much higher proportion of the revenue collected than is collected from the same people at the income tax level.  There was never a fairer law, and the basis of it is what I have said and what the Deputies opposite will not acknowledge: that most people have to pay for their cars after after-tax income. This puts them at a very serious disadvantage against people who have their cars supplied to them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 2, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;Notwithstanding anything contained in any other enactment the amount of any compulsory health contribution made by any taxpayer shall be allowed to be deducted in full from the total income of an individual for the year 1977-78 and subsequent years of assessment.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister knows, people are allowed voluntary health insurance contributions and social welfare contributions as a deduction, but the self-employed, who are obliged compulsorily to make a contribution to the health services, are not allowed to deduct the money.  Of course, if they could pay the money involved, which is now about £15 a year, to voluntary <Col N="1431" /> health insurance and get the tax allowance on it they could get much more value for their money.  This amendment seeks to allow such contributions to be deducted in full.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Colley in this amendment.  I indicated during the Second Stage debate that I would draw the attention of the House to this matter on Committee Stage.  I have seen a letter which was issued from the Revenue Commissioners' office to a taxpayer endeavouring to indicate to him why this contribution under the Health Acts could not be allowed for income tax purposes.  It was the most forced piece of logic I ever came across.  It attempted to make a distinction between an application of income and some other word, but in any event the argument as set out by the Revenue Commissioners was totally academic and totally untenable.  I regret that I have not the letter with me this evening.  I did not expect that the Committee Stage of this Finance Bill would be coming up for some time, and like my colleague, Deputy Colley and others, I was taken unaware by having to debate these matters now in the very short time at our disposal.  That persons are compelled by statute to make these contributions is a great injustice.  They do not wish to make them but they have no option.</P>

      <P>I am not arguing about whether people would wish to pay them or not.  They are compelled by statute to pay them.  If one is a certain category of worker, one must by statute make these contributions. Whether one gets value for them or not is another matter.  In my view one does not.  The whole administration of this part of the health service is complicated and ridiculous, but that is not what we are debating here.  We are debating that other persons in the community who make contributions of an exactly similar nature, sometimes in a voluntary capacity, are allowed to deduct these payments in full from their income for income tax purposes.  These payments for limited eligibility under the Health contributions Act are not allowed by the Revenue Commissioners as a deduction. The case put forward by Deputy Colley in support of this amendment is unanswerable.  The Minister should in all fairness accept that these contributions, because they are compulsory, should be allowable for income tax purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is something that will have to be looked at at some time or other, but immediately we have to consider that to give the reliefs sought here would cost £3 million.  If it is going to cost £3 million that is £3 million which the Exchequer would forego, and therefore the Exchequer would have to collect that £3 million elsewhere.  There is little point in giving this in order to bow towards the theoretical justification of the argument advanced here and then increasing the contributions so as to recover the £3 million foregone.  That is what would have to be done then. If we arrive at the stage where very substantial reductions in taxation become possible because we have massive oil revenues like the OPEC states for instance, then we can consider quite a number of items in the tax code and adjust them in order to meet the individual arguments advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime we must face realities and realise that, whatever be the anomalies that we may identify in the tax system we cannot relieve one <Col N="1433" /> anomaly at the cost of substantial revenue without transferring the burden to somebody else, or so adjusting the tax system that the burden has to be carried by those you pretend to be relieving.  I can certainly meet the point straight away by providing that we would increase the contributions and allow them as a set-off for tax purposes, but the net position would be precisely the same.  While that might end the debate here it would not end the sense of grievance, annoyance, frustration or disappointment which Deputy Colley says is felt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are progressing. It is a very interesting admission by the Minister for Finance that this is something that should be done and the only reason he is not doing it is the cost.  In all sincerity I put to him that if that is the consideration which motivates him in this regard there are many considerations which he has given in this year's budget which are less desirable and less defensible than this one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has lectured us from time to time, and again this evening, on equity and on his overwhelming desire to preserve equity between all section of the community.  Does he think it is more equitable in this budget &mdash;and it is this year's budget we are talking about, not that of next year or the year after&mdash;to give substantial reductions in income tax at the higher income bracket than to give this concession which would be availed of largely by lower income people?  The Minister has walked himself into a very difficult, tight corner if he admits that he would like to do this because it would be relieving an anomaly but the only reason he could not do it is that it would cost £3 million.  He has given £50 million in income tax concessions of one sort or another to individuals in higher income brackets <Col N="1434" /> and to corporations in regard to corporation profits tax.  These concessions might be more justifiable on the basis of giving incentives to different sections of the community, but certainly, on the grounds of equity, they would not compare with this concession to the category of people in which Deputy George Colley and I are interested.</P>
    <P>This is a contribution which is levied on a wide section of the people who are very much in the lower income group.  It is totally unfair and anomalous that this contribution should not be allowed for income tax purposes when similar contributions are allowed. If the cost is only £3 million in this year's budget, the Minister should not hesitate to grant this now, because the way Exchequer returns are going these days, I do not think the Minister will be within £1 million in accuracy in his forecast this year on either side of the budget.  Therefore, to cavil at rectifying an anomaly and an injustice for the sake of £3 million in this budget is not logical.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the benefit of the tax reductions in this year's budget go to people in the lower income group. They are receiving considerable benefit far in excess of what would be achieved if this resolution was to be accepted. However, I am prepared to accept that, like Rome, Ryan's taxation reform cannot be built in a day or even in one term of Government, but when we are back in office we will have a look at this and do the best we can.</P>

      <P>I said when I moved the amendment that I hoped we would not have to argue about the justice of it and, as Deputy Haughey has pointed out, we have at least made that progress, that the Minister cannot defend the inequity of the situation. I do not intend to prolong the discussion by going back over what he said, except to point out that, faced with such an inequity and faced with, in the context of this year's budget, the relatively small sum involved, the Minister should accept this amendment. There are very many people affected by it, and it is for many of those <Col N="1435" /> people a very important matter.  There is a principle of equity involved and I would urge the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <P>Following the receipt of the report of the local social welfare officer referred to in my reply to the Deputy's previous question of 29th March last regarding the application for unemployment assistance of the person concerned a deciding officer decided that on and from 30th March, 1977, the applicant's <Col N="1330" /> means assessed on a factual basis exceeded the statutory limit applicable in his case.  Accordingly he was not entitled to payment of unemployment assistance.  He has been notified of this decision and of his right to appeal against it if he is dissatisfied.</P>

      <P>: The person concerned was being paid unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £9.00 on the basis of his weekly rate of means of £19.15, being the estimated income which he as head of the household could reasonably expect to receive from his wife's earnings while she was in wage earning employment.  Following his requests for reinvestigation of his means a deciding officer reassessed his weekly rate of means at £6.35 from 23rd February, 1977, to 25th March, 1977, and at Nil from 26th March, 1977, and authorisations of payment to him were revised accordingly.  All arrears of unemployment assistance due were paid to him on Thursday last and further payments at the weekly rate of £28.15 being the maximum weekly rate payable in his case will continue as they fall due.</P>

The number of invalidity pensions in payment in the Dublin area on 30th April, 1977, was 1,634 of which 324 were in the Dublin county area, including Dún Laoghaire.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to pay-related benefit of the person concerned depended on the amount of his earnings in the 1975-76 income tax year.  Information regarding his earnings in that year was not available to my Department. He has been requested to supply particulars of his earnings during the period in question but has so far failed to do so.

A pension book containing pension pay orders payable from 7th April, 1977, was issued on 19th May, 1977, to his local post office for collection by him.

      <P>The person concerned made an application for unemployment assistance on 7th March, 1977, following the exhaustion of his unemployment benefit entitlement.  Particulars of his case had been forwarded to the local social welfare officer for investigation of his circumstances.  Necessary inquiries into his circumstances were somewhat protracted as the applicant was not available for interview on a number of occasions when an officer of the Department called at his home. They have now been completed, however, and unemployment assistance has been awarded to him from the date of his application at the maximum rate applicable in his case.  All unemployment assistance due less a refund of home assistance amounting to £8.00 due to the Eastern Health Board was paid to him on Friday last.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan)</i>: The Government's energy policy has been the subject of debate in this House on many occasions over the past four years, most recently in connection with a motion moved by Deputy Barrett during Private Members' Time on 29th March, 1977.  As explained on that occasion and as reflected in the motion, as amended and passed by the House on 30th March, our energy policy is aimed at optimum development of the country's natural resources, ensuring adequate and secure supplies of energy at reasonable cost and promoting rational and efficient use of energy, while making adequate provision for the protection of the natural environment.  This policy, the constituent elements of which have been outlined from time to time, affords us maximum flexibility to cope with developments in the energy situation at domestic or international level.</P>
      <P>The general energy situation is kept under constant review in my Department but the publication of a White Paper as suggested by the Deputy would not, in my opinion, serve any useful purpose at this stage.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 78 to 80, inclusive, together.  During the past 12 months, my Department have received requests from various sources for the provision of a total of 20 telephone kiosks in the following areas of County Clare: Ballinacarra (Kilfenora); Bealaha (Doonbeg); Cloonanaha; Corbally (Kilkee); Doonaha; Dysart; Ennis; Ennistymon; Killimer; Kilmurray McMahon; Leeds (Miltown Malbay); Miltown Malbay; Noughaval (Kilfenora); Parteen; Six Crosses; Spancil Hill; St. Brigid's Well (Liscannor); The Hand Cross; Toovahera (Lisdoonvarna) and Toonagh.</P>
      <P>Clare County Council have accepted the terms quoted to them for the provision of a kiosk under the guarantee scheme at one place in County Clare, that is Cloonanaha.  It is hoped that the kiosk will be erected within about four months of the formal agreement being signed.  Terms have been quoted to the council recently for the provision of guaranteed kiosks at two other places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Excluding guaranteed kiosks, it is planned to provide telephone kiosks in <Col N="1340" /> the following areas of County Clare this year: Ennis, Killaloe, Kilmurray McMahon, Parteen and Querrin.</P>
