      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Agreement Establishing the International Fund for Agricultural Development adopted in Rome on 13th June, 1976.</P>
      <P>In November, 1974, the World Food Conference proposed that an International Fund for Agricultural Development be established to finance agricultural development projects, primarily for food production, in the developing countries and that the Secretary-General of the United Nations be requested to convene urgently a meeting of all interested contributing developed countries, principally the OPEC states, and potential recipient countries in order to establish the fund.  This proposal was endorsed by a United Nations General Assembly resolution in December, 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a series of preliminary meetings of interested countries, a plenipotentiary conference was convened in June, 1976, for the purpose of getting the fund under way.  The conference adopted the text of the agreement establishing the fund but it was not possible at that time to open the fund for signature.  This was because a provision of the agreement, which required that the total of contributions pledged to the fund should amount to at least one billion dollars, could not be met at that stage.  The Government pledged £500,000 to the fund at the plenipotentiary conference, subject to parliamentary approval, and later increased this amount to £570,000.  This additional contribution was made in response to an urgent appeal by the Secretary General of the UN addressed to the Taoiseach&mdash;and to the heads of other governments contributing <Col N="305" /> to the fund&mdash;that we make an increase in our proposed contribution so that the target of one billion dollars could be reached as soon as possible. As other governments&mdash;and particularly our EEC partners&mdash;also responded to the Secretary-General's request the target was reached on 20th December, 1976, and the agreement was, accordingly, formally opened for signature on that day.  Ireland signed the agreement on 28th April.</P>
    <P>The opening clause of the preamble to the agreement establishing the fund states that &ldquo;the continuing food problem of the world is afflicting a large segment of the people of the developing countries and is jeopardising the most fundamental principles and values associated with the right to life and human dignity&rdquo;.  One of the chief objectives of the fund is to promote agricultural development, primarily food production, in developing countries, and thereby gradually to curtail if not, ultimately, obviate the necessity for short-term action such as food aid.  The World Food Conference resolution which called for the establishment of the fund referred to the need for &ldquo;a substantial increase in investment in agriculture for increasing food and agricultural production in developing countries&rdquo; and went on to say that the &ldquo;provision of an adequate supply and proper utilisation of food are the common responsibility of all members of the international Community&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The content of that resolution corresponds to Ireland's traditional policy in this field.  We have consistently taken the view that food aid is of its nature a temporary measure: the solution to world food problems lies primarily in a rapid increase of food production in developing countries. This is why we believe that the establishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development is the most far-reaching attempt yet undertaken by the international community to come to grips with this problem and we trust that it will be a success.</P>
    <P>Membership of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, which is open to any member State of the United Nations, is divided into <Col N="306" /> three categories.  Category I comprises the developed countries, Category II the OPEC countries, and Category III the non-OPEC developing countries. The provision of a special membership category for OPEC countries is one of the novel aspects of the agreement.  It reflects the new importance of these countries in international councils.  It reflects also their commitment to international development co-operation, as can be seen by the relatively high share of their GNP which many OPEC countries devote to assisting the poorer developing countries.  The total of their pledged contributions to the fund amounts to approximately 435 million dollars, which is only a little less than half the overall pledged figure.  The fund will therefore, be an instrument for development created in large measure by the developing countries themselves rather than the traditional type of fund financed solely by the developed countries of which the developing nations were passive beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>According to Article 2 of the agreement the &ldquo;objective of the fund shall be to mobilise additional resources to be made available on concessional terms for agricultural development in developing Member States&rdquo;.  Article 7 of the agreement stipulates that the fund &ldquo;in allocating its resources should be guided by the following priorities: (1)  the need to increase food production and to improve the nutritional level of the poorest populations in the poorest food deficit countries; (2)  the potential for increasing food production in other developing countries. Likewise, emphasis shall be placed on improving the nutritional level of the poorest populations in these countries and the conditions of their lives&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These objectives and priorities provide the basis on which the fund's lending policies and criteria will be evolved.</P>
    <P>As regards the organisation and management of the fund, article 6 of the agreement provides for the setting up of a governing council and an executive board, and for the appointment of a president and such staff as may be necessary to carry out the functions of the fund.  Each member <Col N="307" /> state will be represented on the governing council, while the executive board will consist of 18 members elected by the council.  These 18 members of the executive board will consist of six members from each of the three categories of countries members of the fund.</P>
    <P>Pending the entry into force of the agreement the administrative structure of the fund is being elaborated by a preparatory commission, which was set up last year at the plenipotentiary conference to which I referred at the outset.  When the agreement enters into force this preparatory commission will be replaced by the executive board.  In the meantime, the composition of the preparatory commission is the same as that prescribed for the executive board, that is, 18 members, six of whom belong to each of the three categories.  The Catagory I countries members of the preparatory commission are Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden and the USA. Members of the preparatory commission represent &ldquo;constituencies&rdquo; in which other countries contributing to the fund participate.  Ireland is a member of the Netherlands constituency together with Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland.</P>
    <P>The preparatory commission has met on three occasions; the most recent meeting took place earlier this month in Rome.  A large part of the commission's meetings in 1976 was devoted to the question of mobilising the additional funds necessary to enable the fund to attain the one billion dollar figure of pledged contributions required before the agreement could be opened for signature.  Since this important condition was met in December last the preparatory commission have been considering such questions as, for example, the draft rules of procedure of the governing council and of the executive board; the draft relationship agreement between the United Nations and fund&mdash;since the fund will be a specialised agency of the UN; and the lending policies and criteria of the fund.  A large measure of agreement on these questions has now been reached <Col N="308" /> and it is hoped that this work will be completed very shortly so that the commission can hand over their functions to the executive board once the agreement enters into force.</P>
    <P>To date the agreement has been signed by 44 countries, who like ourselves, are now taking steps to have it ratified.  The agreement will enter into force upon receipt by the Secretary General of the UN of instruments of ratification from at least six states in Category I, six states in Category II and 24 states in Category III provided that the aggregate of initial contributions by donor countries which ratify the agreement amounts to at least $750 million, and provided also that the entry into force takes place within 18 months, of the date on which the agreement was opened for signature, that is, from 20th December, 1976.  If the operational figure is not reached within the 18 months stipulated, such states as have deposited ratification instruments may decide by a two-thirds majority of each category to determine a later date and to notify the Secretary General of the UN accordingly.  The agreement provides that members' contributions may be made in a single sum or in three equal annual instalments; Ireland will avail of the latter course. The single sum or the first annual instalment shall be due on the 30th day after the agreement enters into force with respect to any particular member; second and third instalments shall be due on the first and on the second anniversary of the date on which the first instalment was due.</P>
    <P>As Ireland's participation in the fund will involve a charge on public funds, the approval of the agreement by Dáil Éireann is required before ratification.  From the outset Ireland has taken a favourable attitude towards the establishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development and it is the Government's view that we should arrange to ratify it as soon as possible.  I therefore recommend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This side of the House welcomes the introduction of this motion and supports it without any reservation.  The fact that a number <Col N="309" /> of related motions have been coming before the House in the last few years is some proof of the development of the world conscience in the area of development aid.  It is important that whenever the international agencies and organisations come to agreement, as this motion before the House indicates that they have done, we should enthusiastically and as quickly as possible give effect to the terms of that agreement and give it our immediate support.</P>
      <P>This agreement we have been asked to ratify this morning is another step in the right direction.  It is only a step because, as we have said so often in the House before, for each step forward the community of nations take, unfortunately starvation takes two steps backwards.  I should like to highlight some of the commendable aspects of this.  Even what we are doing here today, and presumably what has been done in other parliaments throughout the world, is only trying to stem the tide of starvation.  We are not really effecting a major breakthrough.  Nonetheless it is to be welcomed very enthusiastically.</P>
      <P>This motion gives effect, so far as we are concerned, to Recommendation 13 of the World Food Conference which was held in Rome in 1974. What must be commended in this agreement is that, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, it places the emphasis on food production and assistance towards food production and international projects towards maintaining food production in the developing countries or what are otherwise known as the food deficit countries as distinct from food aid programmes.  I agree entirely with what the Parliamentary Secretary said in that connection&mdash;it is understandable that here we are all of one mind&mdash;that our priority must be in the areas that are mentioned here, encouraging food production in those food deficit countries as distinct from relying on food aid from the developed countries of the west and other countries that are in a better position than they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing, apart from the desirability of encouraging food production as distinct from food aid, that <Col N="310" /> must commend itself to us is that it concentrates in the agricultural sector on food as distinct from other products such as cotton and tobacco, which are obviously of some significance to many of those developing countries.  However, the markets for those products are in the developed world and sometimes the economic benefits they derive from that other type of agricultural production, which is not related to food, is very often limited by the market conditions which the developed world can impose on them.</P>
    <P>This major breakthrough, for that second reason, concentrating as it does on food production in the developing countries, is to be welcomed.  Thirdly, one of the significant things about it, as in all of those areas, is that it is being established on a voluntary basis. I do not suppose we have yet reached the time when we can impose on the international community an obligation to contribute for two very good reasons.  First, each of us sees our obligation rather differently depending on what our own economic and financial conditions may be.  Therefore, each nation around the world takes a different view of its obligations, first, to its own people and then very often cannot look at its obligations abroad without saying: &ldquo;Look at our position at home.&rdquo;  Perhaps that is understandable.</P>
    <P>We have no international organisation at the moment and we are unlikely to have one except through organisations such as the European Community, through which one can impose obligations.  Organisations such as the United Nations can only work on a voluntary basis.  They can only achieve what the common will of the members is prepared to allow them to achieve but they cannot impose obligations. It is understandable that in this agreement we are talking about voluntary commitments.  Some nations will inevitably contribute, <i>pro rata</i>, more than others and some nations will not contribute at all to the extent that they might.  It has advantages and disadvantages and we are limited to that possibility at the moment.  So far as it is being done on a voluntary basis there is <Col N="311" /> an obligation on everybody who is contributing to this fund to contribute as much as possible and support the aims of the fund as effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>One hopes that as the fund develops and as the agencies and the management structure of the fund are established, it will be possible over the years&mdash;this is a long-term aim&mdash;to establish what one might call regular, constant and even to some extent obligatory levels of contribution.  However, that is in the long term.  Very many of the countries have opted into this new commitment.  I hope that they will by their example encourage others to involve themselves in this absolutely crucial obligation on the world at large.  I will give some examples later of how absolutely crucial it is.</P>
    <P>There are one or two matters about this that in its early stages one would like to question.  I am not sure if the Parliamentary Secretary has the answers at this point.  As a member of this new development programme there are questions we should ask now which will help to establish proper criteria as to its management and as to the disbursement of funds.  It is important that the disbursement will generally be through internationally recognised institutions, such as the World Bank and the Regional Development Bank and that when it is permanently established its governing body will be a specialised agency of the UN.</P>
    <P>We are told that for a three-year period the total contributions are of the order of one billion dollars.  It appears from previous reports and from the recommendations of the Rome Conference that our contribution during that period will be in the region of $1 million or roughly, one-thousandth of the total fund.  That is a significant contribution having regard to the extent of the resources of our nation.  On the other hand, it indicates the level of the contribution we can make.  Each extra contribution we may be able to make towards reducing that fraction to one-seven-hundred-and-fiftieth will make us a more effective and persuasive member of this and other organisations in their <Col N="312" /> attempts to tackle this constant problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Our contribution is a little better than the ratio which our population bears to the total population of the globe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of the extremes of wealth and the extremes of poverty, it represents a fair contribution. I am merely saying that there is room for improvement not only from our point of view but to the extent of alerting others to the fact that there is room for improvement, an improvement which obviously so far as some other countries are concerned would be much more significant than any contributions we could make.  Later I shall give some figures to indicate the huge gap that exists between the developed and the development countries.</P>
      <P>One very encouraging aspect of this agreement is that the OPEC countries are contributing $435 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is almost half.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is almost half the total fund during a three-year period.  It represents a major breakthrough. Those of us in the developed western countries must acknowledge this as a sign of a greater awareness in the OPEC countries of this problem. Some of those countries have not always been recognised as being wealthy.  They still have some problems of poverty to tackle but as they have the resources the question is one of government management.  However, it can be described as a fantastic achievement for them to have agreed to commit this amount of money. Perhaps the fact that they have been able to commit so much is an indication that they can commit much more.  Also, their commitment represents a challenge to the rest of the developed world as to how much they can commit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some worth-while aspects of this agreement but, perhaps, the most encouraging is the fact that we are talking now of a long-term solution in the sense that we are talking in terms of food, of development and of <Col N="313" /> projects in the food deficit countries. It is reassuring to find the international community tackling the problem on this basis.  This is a very commendable aspect of what we are doing.  However, there are one or two other aspects of the agreement and, particularly, of the negotiations that led up to it, that are not so encouraging. For example, the original hope and intention was that the figure which would be available during the three-year period would be $1.2 billion and not as has transpired, $1 billion.  In other words the contributing countries in a period of two years have cut back by one-sixth on their initial contribution. This is not so much a cutback as an indication that it has not been possible to raise funds of the order contemplated originally.  But if we can reach the target again of the original contribution we will at least have shown that the original commitments were entered into seriously and that the world community of nations have a very definite obligation and a determination to reach not only the target they have set themselves but to reach even more ambitious and commendable targets in other areas.</P>
    <P>A noteworthy aspect, too, is that these contributions are additional to other funds being contributed through other specialised agencies.  In other words, we are establishing a new fund additional to any other fund in operation. When he is concluding, I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to confirm that this is so.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to make this debate the subject of any kind of inter-party rivalry but from our own point of view I should like to hear whether the funds now being committed are to be additional to the commitments we have entered into already or will they simply be a part of our existing commitment, with the difference that we are now providing the money through another agency, albeit a better agency.  In other words, are we, like the rest of the world community contributing in addition to that to which we have already committed ourselves or are we simply diverting from what we have committed already by way of our global commitments?  I do not wish to <Col N="314" /> imply that there is a holier-than-thou attitude on this side of the House but this is a matter on which we should have clarity.  As I have said so often, the more we can find it possible to contribute, the better it will be.  To this extent we should contribute even to the point where it hurts.  I should like to think that we would reach a point where there would be a bipartisan approach so that neither side would claim credit for or take advantage of decisions taken by the government of the day in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to another aspect on which I should like clarification also.  It is something on which I do not expect he can give a precise answer because new funds develop their own criteria in operation.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to Article 7 which stipulates that the fund in allocating its resources should be guided by the following priorities, and I quote:</P>
    <P>(I)  the need to increase food production and to improve the nutritional level of the poorest populations in the poorest food deficit countries;</P>
    <P>(II)  the potential for increasing food production in other developing countries . . . </P>
    <P>What I want to know is&mdash;I know I will not get a complete answer and I do not expect one&mdash;to what extent the governing body will have regard when these criteria are being applied to the need in the poorest food deficit countries?  For example, to what extent have we any indication as to how these criteria will be applied to Bangladesh which will obviously need considerably less by way of projects with a return on investment than one would expect from, say, Kenya?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean because of weaker organisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Weaker organisation, weaker structure and so on. There will be a tendency naturally to establish some criteria, such as return on investment, but, at the same time, one can expect equally naturally that <Col N="315" /> there will be a lower return on investment in countries with the lowest rate of fertility and with the most serious food deficits.  It will be vitally important for the operation of the fund as it develops to establish that stringent criteria will not be applied based on the capacity of the country to show a good return for the loan investment. If that is not the evolution, then the fund will defeat its own purpose.</P>
      <P>Article 7 can be interpreted in two ways because it sets out that it will take account of the need to increase food production in the food deficit countries&mdash;that is fine&mdash;but then it goes on to talk about the potential for increasing food production.  That, too, is important but where there is an apparent conflict we will need to know what priority will be applied.  At this transitional stage before the actual governing body is established the Government should ask these questions. So far as we are involved these are relevant questions which the governing body will be posing for themselves and we would like to know how these apparent and understandable conflicts will be resolved as the fund is operated.</P>
      <P>In so far as it will work through an established international organisation, such as the World Bank, there is likely inevitably to be a tendency to apply established criteria, such as return on investment, by which these international agencies have been guided in their operations in the past and it would be important for these institutions to be a great deal more flexible in their attitudes and in their programmes than they would otherwise be because, if they operate according to established criteria, that may limit the effectiveness of the operation of the fund and it will be important, therefore, for these organisations to qualify and modify their procedures to ensure they are entirely appropriate to the need of this particular fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect.  I do not want to be too critical about this but, unfortunately, starvation can become big business for the multi-nationals.  I am not saying they are so ruthless they do not care and will live on other <Col N="316" /> people's famine but the fact is that they are involved in global problems and in global opportunities and to a considerable extent they have been involved in relief agencies and in various assistance programmes to the developing world.  I would like to know to what extent will the fund operated here be channelled through co-operative movements in the beneficiary countries and through other, shall we say, agencies of the marketing economy countries, namely, the multi-national corporations.  Will there be any guidelines as to how much will be channelled through A or B?  I do not expect an answer to that question now but these are questions we should be asking at this particular stage because it is not clear from the agreement before us as to what limit, if any, there will be on the contribution channels we are supporting here. If one talks in terms of return on investment, I am quite sure a considerable amount of money would be channelled through efficient multinational corporations as distinct from native co-ops in these food deficit countries.  However, if one talks in terms of encouraging self-sufficiency and a sense of international concern and co-operation, then one would possibly channel the funds through these national co-ops or through national government programmes.  It is a question of balance but it is one that needs to be looked at in the earliest stages and throughout the operation of the fund.</P>
    <P>Statistics are useful in giving an indication of the problems and of the gap which has been created in the last few years between food deficit countries and the developed world.  I have here figures from the United Nations World Health Council for 17th April, 1975.  They are very revealing. Taking the base 100, food production in western Europe had increased by 1970 to 110, by 1971 to 114, and by 1974 to 116 <i>per capita</i>, a very considerable increase from 1965 to 1974.  In North America it had increased by eight points to 108, again a very considerable increase.  If we take as a block the Far East, food production per head in the same period, <Col N="317" /> 1965 to 1974, had decreased by two points from 100 to 98.  That is some evidence of the gap which is constantly widening between the developed countries and the undeveloped countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very interesting. I do not make any point about this but the discrepancy would probably represent the discrepancy in birth rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has made a good point and possibly the figures reflect the discrepancy in birth rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The population in the East is growing by millions, whereas it is static in Western Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the precise figures and, perhaps, there was a huge increase in population, but for the last years of that period there are signs that the food deficit is decreasing to some extent simply becauses of early deaths, deaths through lack of nutrition.  This may be a neutral factor, but certainly in India and Bangladesh the early death rate and the very high mortality rate is in its own way a reason for the decline in the food deficit in these countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been talking about the <i>per capita</i> food production, but let us take the total food production of Western Europe for the same period.  With base 100 for 1961 to 1965, it increased to 126 from 1965 to 1974.  That is a commendable increase of over 25 per cent.  Possibly we have played our part in that in the operation of the common agricultural policy.  In Latin America the total food production increased simply by 2 per cent from 100 between 1961 and 1965, to 102 from 1965 to 1974.  However, in the Far East the total food production in that period decreased by 4 per cent, from 100 to 96.  Again, that may be neutralised according to whether we are talking about a greater or lesser population; I am not sure, but if the total population had grown and the total production had diminished by 4 per cent, it indicates the huge discrepancy that has been emerging between <Col N="318" /> the developed and the developing countries.  These are figures which are all too precise and horrifying in their implications.  As we go down through these figures we recognise that as we have become consistently richer the developing countries have become consistently poorer.</P>
    <P>Can we accept that this situation should continue simply because we do not see it every day?  The fact that people in Ireland do not see it every day does not make them oblivious of the need to contribute to a solution. That is why I believe that we here in this House are in a particularly strong position in making whatever contribution we can towards easing that horrible burden under which so much of the world is labouring.  Organisations such as Trócaire, the Commission for Justice, Peace, and Concern and all the other voluntary organisations in every town and city of the country, deserve the very highest commendation, and they are the proof&mdash;if we needed proof, and we do not need it&mdash;that the Irish people are deeply concerned and will support us, their political representatives, in anything we can do to increase our contribution but, even more important, anything we can do to make our partners in the European Communities and the other international organisations more determined to solve these problems on a long-term basis.</P>
    <P>I have given some examples of what has happened up to 1974, but I want to highlight what we may be facing in future years.  Must we say this problem is insurmountable?  Do we just throw up our hands and say: it is going to continue, because what I am about to say indicates an even worse position?  The FAO have estimated that the cereal deficit in these food deficit countries will have increased from the early '70s, say, between 1974, where I left it, and 1985, from about 16 million tons per annum to 85 million tons per annum.  This is an estimate, which was taken prior to the establishment of this fund, but if the cereal deficit in those countries increases to that extent, it is an indication of the appalling rate at which the problem is being aggravated and of <Col N="319" /> what we must face up to in the developed community.  Perhaps it will help us to see that, while our problems may be severe by our own standards, they are relatively of very little intensity by comparison with what the rest of the world have to tolerate at the moment.</P>
    <P>However, as I say, if there is one sign that the cereal deficit may be somewhat less than the figure estimated, it is simply the recent indication that in Bangladesh and in India particularly, the death rate is so high that there will be fewer mouths to feed than was anticipated.  In other words, there will be still more and more every year, as the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out, but the population growth will be less, not through birth control but through the high mortality rate that has been emerging over the last number of years.  We do not want to solve the problem as our own famine problem was solved at one stage, if one can call that a solution, by death, desolation and emigration. Emigration as such is not open to these people.  Therefore, it would be a sad reflection on the developed world if we were to accept that a high mortality rate in itself was an effective solution.  I know we are not that ruthless, but if we find next year that the food deficit is somewhat lower than anticipated we know it is due to the high mortality caused directly by the food scarcity.</P>
    <P>I come back to the point I made originally, that what is being done in this resolution is highly commendable, particularly as it is promoting agricultural production and food self-sufficiency. It may not be going very far along the way, but it is going in the right direction.  I agree with what the Parliamentary Secretary has said and that the Government priority, and ours would be, too, to support more and more this type of assistance as distinct from food aid which is in a way a bad second best for practical reasons.</P>
    <P>First of all, it has been but too obvious that down the years the political strings attached to food aid to the developing countries have been as much <Col N="320" /> in the interests of the developed countries applying the aid as to development countries receiving it.  In America, for example, during the run in for the presidential election, generally food aid was regarded as an instrument of diplomatic and political persuasion from America in the developing world.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on record that certainly the present Administration under President Carter have fairly clearly rejected that approach and now recognise that food aid must not be used as an instrument of political influence or pressure from the major developed countries on the undeveloped countries.  Competition was being applied to food aid from America and to a very considerable extent still is from the USSR on the developing countries.  The tags associated with food aid were of no benefit to us or the developing countries. There was understandable disillusionment in the US when they found that the countries they were assisting most, as they saw it, as often as not would appear to turn first&mdash;and this applies particularly to the African States&mdash;to the Communist countries in their political associations.  If one expects too much by way of political return from food aid programmes, one can be very disillusioned indeed.  I am not saying that the aid should be stopped but the disadvantage is there.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the political strings within the country being assisted also have obvious disadvantages because many of these countries have not developed democratic structures and have little experience of the democratic process. In the application of food aid many people at senior Government level in many of these countries grew very fat, indeed, on the commissions which they got from the food aid being supplied by the developed countries to the countries in which they were employed in Government.  It is tragic but true that while others of their fellows were starving many of them grew very fat through the manner in which they channelled the aid supplied to them from other countries.  That is an understandable problem which can be overcome only through education <Col N="321" /> and the development of the democratic process.</P>
    <P>In this connection our own semi-State agencies who have been helping so much in some countries in Africa have done a lot to educate these emerging nations into the democratic process and particularly to abolish the inherited trends of corruption&mdash;and I use the word &ldquo;inherited&rdquo; deliberately because in many cases they were inherited from the colonial powers before them&mdash;that operate in Government there.  I have heard from some very distinguished people from our own country, whose names I will not mention though the Parliamentary Secretary will be aware of them, who have operated in some of the African countries, that the biggest problem they faced initially within the civil service in these countries was corruption.  It is encouraging that they have found that the greatest contribution they have made in their work programmes in these countries was the fact that they have been able somehow to reduce this level of corruption by making the people concerned aware of the fact that it was basically wrong.  Many of the people had not thought it was.  They thought of it as a right of theirs in a certain position to channel off a certain commission for themselves.  That is something which applies in food aid by definition and we have to keep tackling that.  Our country is doing a good job in that direction and our specialist agencies through the semi-State bodies are making a significant contribution.  Food aid will be with us for a very long time and it is important that we recognise that.</P>
    <P>Another practical problem of food aid is the physical impossibility of transporting food of that order from one corner of the globe to another.  The need of, say, Bangladesh and India is so great that if we were relying simply on food aid programmes in themselves to meet that need we would not have the shipping capacity in the developed world to cope with their problems. Even if we were suddenly to say &ldquo;We will export more and more&rdquo; the sheer impossibility of transporting such a huge amount of food by direct food aid transfers makes it obviously important <Col N="322" /> that the other approach we are taking this morning be adopted and promoted as quickly and effectively as possible.  One can imagine transporting in terms of, say, 85 million tons.  That is an awful lot of cereal.  Where is it to come from?  Where is it to be stored?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>How is the storage going to protect it from vermin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has said, in the countries which it will eventually reach how is it to be protected from vermin?  There will be disease, housing conditions, over-population and so on.  Even if tomorrow we decide that we will contribute so much food from our productivity every year we still could not provide the answer in food aid directly.  I agree with the Government and with the Parliamentary Secretary that our priority must be encouragement of food production in the developing countries as distinct from relying on transfer of foods from developed countries to the developing ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor worth mentioning&mdash; and this is not intended as a criticism of the US&mdash;is that President Carter recently reminded the people in the US of the major consequences for all in the western world, particularly in America, of the increase in the consumption of energy.  He reminded them, first, of the huge increase in the cost of this and, secondly, he reminded them of the fact that oil was not in inexhaustible supply. When he turned to the cost, he was able to illustrate that this had increased the import bills of the western countries to a huge extent.  At the same time, in 1975 the US gained more from higher food prices in the world than they lost from higher oil prices.  They gained more from export of food in terms of balance of payments than they had to suffer a loss because of the huge increase in oil prices.  We all recognise how much the increased cost of oil has meant to their economy, but we had not thought that the increased price of food exported from these countries more than offset the increasing cost of oil being imported from other countries.  I am <Col N="323" /> not saying that a lot of this food was going at market price, but it was going to countries that could least afford it. This is another indicator of this continuing gap.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the US has this as a central element in its policy.  I acknowledge that under this administration there are very obvious signs of a very definite commitment from the US to tackle this problem as a leader of the developed world.  Even tackling it as they are, and as we are trying to this morning, we still find that the gap between us and them increases all the time, and we find that sometimes we gain more, as America did from higher food prices than she lost in 1975, through the increased cost of oil.  As we gain these other countries lose.  I mention this as a measure of the problem that we must face.  It is true that when one talks in terms of <i>per capita</i> food production in India, for instance, one is dealing with a country that has had a huge increase in birth rate down the years.  Although the population in India is increasing by about 14 million per annum, that is less than it otherwise would be because of the high mortality rate.  There are 14 million more mouths to be fed per year in India alone.  Possibly they will not be fed and the mortality rate will increase. This underlines the fact that the kind of programme we are talking about today must be developed as a matter of great urgency.  The food aid programmes that we have been operating have not been effective in narrowing the gap between developed and developing countries.  In fact, the gap has not even been maintained.  It has widened.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary might note some questions that I will now ask although I do not expect an immediate answer.  The Parliamentary Secretary might be able to refer these questions to the governing body of the fund through the constituency in which we will operate.  The Parliamentary Secretary indicated that this body is now operating through a preparatory commission. I presume that this commission would welcome any queries or suggestions at this stage from members <Col N="324" /> of the fund.  Will our contribution be in sterling or dollars?  If it is to be in sterling and if the rate of exchange falls, as it has been falling over the past number of years, effectively we will be contributing less at the end of three years than we would otherwise have contributed.  The same question applies to the other currencies of the other member states.  What will be the unit of contribution which will protect against the fluctuation in international exchange rates?  That protection must be central to the successful operation of the fund.  I note that the governing body of the fund will represent the recipient countries, the donor developing countries and the donor developed countries.  I know that on a preliminary basis we are in a constituency with Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Switzerland.  That is a very enlightened constituency.  Very few countries have as good a record as the Netherlands in this direction.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister and I will have an opportunity shortly of attending a seminar organised by the Netherlands government in the Netherlands on reshaping the world order pending the outcome of political developments here and there.  However, this constituency seems to be an interim arrangement for us.  Our place will almost inevitably be with the other members of the European Community or is it intended that this interim arrangement will be maintained?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if it will be maintained.  I am told that this is still an open question.  It looks as if the Community boundaries are not regarded as Switzerland is part of this group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that each group should have criteria established for themselves.  There must be permanent constant commitment within whatever group we will operate so that there will not just be a haphazard and incidental reaction to proposals coming from the governing body.  I would like to think that Ireland will play a very positive role in this.  I do not know what part we played in the discussions which may have taken place <Col N="325" /> within the European Communities on the establishment of this fund.  The European Communities should have had something to say on this as Communities. Each member state probably had something to say as a Member of the United Nations.  I do not know whether or not the Community had something to say about this.  It is important that, as we are members of the Community, we make our views known through the Community which is the only Community through which we can effect binding obligations on ourselves and on other member states.</P>
      <P>We cannot do this through the United Nations or through this fund that we are establishing for obvious reasons.  Our views generally and the criteria which I have suggested this morning should be channelled through the Community so that there will be consistency in our programmes.  The opportunities Ireland will have to make a personnel contribution to the aims of this programme do not emerge from the agreement we are discussing.  I know that the development agency and the State bodies are well geared to do this, that this agreement cannot set out all the guidelines and operations of the fund but, at the same time, it could indicate how we can make a considerable impact.  The experience we have been gaining down through the years through our State bodies can be of immense benefit to these developing countries trying to establish appropriate projects within their own states whether or not they adopt exactly the procedures that we have had in our state bodies.  These are questions we should pose through our constituency to the governing body of the fund.  There is great scope for an effective contribution in that direction. I have already asked the Parliamentary Secretary if our contribution will be additional to or part of the Government's committed contribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The point we are reaching this year, which I think is .14 per cent&mdash;and that is an increase on last year and a fairly hefty one&mdash;includes this sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was envisaged last year that this would be included. We all need to improve on that.  We are behind the figure we hoped to achieve.  I do not want to compare one Government's record with that of another, but I hope we will recognise there is great scope for improvement and endeavour together to bridge the gap.</P>
      <P>When I was doing some research and trying to get some information from the UN programmes, I was surprised to see that, in the past ten to 15 years, only about 5 per cent of the official development assistance being applied to United Nations programmes was devoted exclusively to agricultural production.  That is very low.  Taking the average over that period, it has increased considerably. It increased to 10 per cent by 1972 and to 16 per cent by 1975.  Presumably this programme will increase it even more.  There are many other important areas also such as education and medicine, but it highlights the fact that such a small percentage of our development fund assistance is going to an actual increase in food production.</P>
      <P>These things need to be put on the record.  I want to quote a few other figures which highlight the need to bridge the gap to which I referred.  The increase in the developing countries' food production was lower in the seventies, roughly of the order of 1.7 per cent, than it was in the sixties when it was running in the order of 2.7 per cent.  Because of the population increase plus the higher purchasing power of the £, an annual increase of 3.6 per cent is needed to keep up with increasing demand.  If that were reached, it would still leave 500 million people undernourished.  We are nowhere near reaching it, and that shows the enormity of the problem we have to cope with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The developing countries generally have to feed approximately 60 million extra mouths each year from diminishing resources.  That is equal to the <Col N="327" /> population of West Germany.  This shows how the problem is being aggravated. That is excluding China.  I do not know whether these figures have been quoted in the House before.  Food production per head in the developing countries was down in 1974 as compared with 1961-65, especially in Africa and the Far East, and the Far East in particular contains most of the world's undernourished people.  It is almost impossible to think that food production per head decreased to that extent.  Unfortunately, the trend in the past 20 years has been towards increasing food deficits as distinct from decreasing food deficits.</P>
    <P>All of this highlights the need for the implementation of a fund such as the one we are being asked to adopt this morning.  We on this side of the House enthusiastically support the Government's motion.  I want to make two final points in relation to the terms of the fund which may have particular application to this country. I suppose it is always to be expected that, when we talk in terms of a new agency under a new organisation, we in Ireland will say one of them should be established here.  We said it about the European Community and many other agencies.  If there is one organisation more than another which should be established here, it is the organisation we are talking about this morning.</P>
    <P>Pending the determination of a permanent seat for the administration of this fund I note that the temporary provisional seat will be in Rome. Shannon is a very good example.  This area has built up a whole new attitude towards the contribution which semi-State organisations can make to national economic development.  The experience gained in turning a relatively depressed area into a thriving economic area is of considerable benefit. People in that area played a very significant role in development in the sixties and in the seventies.  This is vitally important.  The direct experience some of the senior personnel in that area have had in the development of projects could be of immense benefit to the developing countries.  What they and the other State bodies have done <Col N="328" /> through their personnel contributions has generated goodwill of an order which perhaps we do not realise.</P>
    <P>We have come through relatively difficult economic times.  I am not talking about the recent past.  I am talking about earlier years.  It would be marvellous if we could be seen to be the centre of this bridge between the East and the West, and between the North and the South.  The commitment required is there and the goodwill is there.  In a sense we are half way between the developed and the developing world.  We need to encourage our own people to be more and more involved in these types of programmes for our own benefit and for the world's benefit.  There may be insurmountable problems but, in Government, we would be exploring the possibilities.  I am asking the Government to explore the possibility of having the seat of this fund located permanently in Ireland, perhaps in the Shannon region.  The potential development of the estuary is now being talked about.  This could be of immense benefit all round and it could activate an awareness of the problem at home and, through us, an awareness within the European Community and America with which we have very close ties.</P>
    <P>To the extent that the aim of this motion is to enable us to make an effective contribution towards solving this problem, we support it enthusiastically. The Parliamentary Secretary can be guaranteed that whoever comes back to this House&mdash;either from this side of the House or from the other side&mdash;looking for further support for the development of programmes under this fund will be given that support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief on this motion.  I have never listened to a better speech than the one given by Deputy O'Kennedy.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the questions I wanted to ask have been put by him.  All of us agree with the fund which it is proposed to set up but I was a little worried that this was not discussed within the EEC group.  The general principles of the fund are excellent. <Col N="329" /> It is much better to help people help themselves rather than sending them food over long distances. It also helps the dignity of people in underdeveloped countries if they can produce food for themselves.  That is one of the reasons why everyone should support the fund.</P>
      <P>From what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, it appears this project is just getting off the ground.  We should ensure that money is not used for purposes other than those intended. We should make sure that the various agencies proposed to be established will not eat up all the money allocated. I accept that the Parliamentary Secretary may not be able to answer all our queries now because at the moment we are setting up a provisional committee to administer the fund but I would point out that the greatest difficulty will lie in the way the fund is administered.  Many funds have been established throughout the world to help people in underdeveloped areas but by the time the necessary agencies were set up the amount of cash going to those really in need was much smaller than the original allocation.</P>
      <P>Consideration will have to be given to conditions obtaining in the various countries that will benefit.  We are setting up a fund to increase agricultural production in a country that would otherwise be given food subsidies. If we were to set up a fund in this country and if we gave a certain amount to the poorer parts we could not expect the same return.  The people who administer the fund we are discussing now may think that they should administer it where they will get the greatest return and the largest production but we should not allow that to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What sort of soil tests will be carried out in the various countries to see what kind of production is required for the necessities of life?  Many people might consider livestock in that category but this may not be possible in some countries because of the type of grassland there.  The fund should not be administered on the basis of returns for the money spent.  Much depends on the country concerned and the soil.  Many people may shelter <Col N="330" /> behind the argument that the country concerned will have a low production and, consequently, that money will be wasted.  We must guard against this. There should be experts available who will ensure that it does not happen.</P>
    <P>I am completely in agreement with setting up the fund and my only criticism is with regard to the way it may be administered.  I realise it will be very difficult because of the differing conditions in the countries we hope to serve.  Although it would be far better for the dignity of the recipients of the fund to be given help to produce their own food, I realise that in some cases that may not be possible and it may be necessary to send food to them.</P>
    <P>I could never understand why the EEC allows stockpiles of food to accumulate while people are starving. We may not be at the top of the EEC league but we have plenty to eat.  I do not understand why there is not some way to send food to those in need instead of letting it rot as has happened.  I would urge our representatives in the EEC to make sure that the fund works.  Everything will depend on the agency that is set up to administer it.</P>
    <P>My reason for speaking in the debate was to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary the different rates of return that will be obtained from the various countries.  We cannot condemn a country that cannot yield a good return because this will not be their fault.  If the proposed agency has a strict set of rules we will fail in what we hope to achieve.</P>
    <P>I am 100 per cent behind this project.  Today the world is preoccupied with material things and it is gratifying to know that there are people who think about the unfortunates who are dying of starvation. I do not know why the people in the developed countries would not decide that they would not allow people to starve in the midst of plenty.  I hope the points I have made will be kept in view.  I hope Ireland will play its part in relation to the committee which is being set up to discuss how the fund will be administered.  I hope <Col N="331" /> Ireland will see that it is administered fairly and that it does not all go to the agencies and none is left for the people who need it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the formal ratification of the agreement to establish this international fund for agricultural development.  This is very close to the hearts of many people. The media in recent years has brought home poverty needs to each and every house in the developed world.  I am delighted that this is a fund of at least 1 billion dollars to be spent on development.</P>
      <P>The world today is facing an ever-growing crisis, that of starvation, poverty and the lack of job opportunities. We talk of the lack of job opportunities at home but our minds boggle when we look at the figures we have from abroad.  In 1974 we find that in South Asia alone around 350,000 people a week were seeking new jobs.  Large numbers of people are coming into the urban areas.  At least 75,000 people come in from the countryside every day.  Those people have to live in slum conditions.  Their conditions are so bad in the countryside that they are forced to live in those dreadful conditions in the towns.</P>
      <P>This is a development project and we hope that it will enable people to provide for themselves.  This will not be very easy because we know it will require a massive change of attitudes and obsolete techniques in the undeveloped world.  People who have been reared in a certain tradition do not want to see a change.  Those people have managed to get by for generations with hard work and little or no return.  They sow with great effort but they only reap a very small return for it.  One of the difficulties is to try to break down the attitudes entrenched in people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that this fund will enable new skills and techniques to be introduced into the third world which will help people to look after themselves. It is at a very preliminary stage but at least it is off the ground and we all wish it well.  I, like other <Col N="332" /> speakers, hope that the administrative costs of running this scheme will be kept at a minimum.  Could the cost of administration be funded from some other source so that this money can go directly into agricultural development? Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will let us know if this has been considered.  It would be wonderful if administrative costs could be kept separate from this fund.</P>
    <P>A policy of world food aid is vital. We will have to see it increased.  There is no way it can be curtailed.  We will have to make a two-pronged attack on poverty.  I know there are difficulties in any food aid programme but in spite of them we must continue to expand in this field because this is the lifeline for many people.  I taught in a third world country and I saw the poverty of the people.  I heard of children being born deformed so that they would be better able to beg.  This is a shocking situation but there were very few opportunities in that country.</P>
    <P>We have all seen what happened to food that was to be used for a certain source.  It went to other sources and might have been sold in the local markets.  This food was donated in charity but while it did not get to the people in the exact form of a grant in line with what the donors wanted at least it got to them.  What would have happened if it did not come to the people at all?</P>
    <P>While there are difficulties in relation to food aid, I would like to put on record how food aid through the EEC has built up over the years. Under the 1976 Food Aid Convention the EEC were committed to supply 1,035,000 tons of cereal per annum in food aid.  This increased, with the entry of Ireland, Britain and Denmark, to 1,161,000 tons.  This commitment, according to the last figure I have, now stands at 1,287,000 tons.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the food aid policy are very laudable.  They are (1) to aid countries hit by natural disasters, (2)  to raise the nutritional level of people in third world countries and (3) to assist economic development in third world countries.  Deputy O'Kennedy pointed out how those <Col N="333" /> objectives might be abused because of diplomatic pressures and governmental policies along the way.  They are side issues to trying to combat poverty, to feed the needy and to look after those people.  It was very necessary for various groups to introduce a title such as the Third World which certainly brought home to people poverty and need.  It also tended to create some people apart.  I suppose that might not be a bad thing because they are apart in being underprivileged and in need.</P>
    <P>The mind boggles when one thinks of the huge number of people involved. People ask how they can help, and, in this respect, perhaps there is a need to define the term &ldquo;aid to developing countries&rdquo;.  Very often this phrase is accepted without any questioning of what it involves.  Largely, it is good that this is the situation because it indicates the readiness of people to help those in the developing countries but it would be no harm to know whether what is involved is help by way of loans or grants and, in the case of loans, whether these are repayable during a certain period.  Our people have an excellent record in terms of responding to the needs of the Third World.  One of the reasons for this may be the knowledge that our people, too, experienced poverty in the famine years but there is also the factor that so many of our missionaries and lay people alike have gone out to minister to people in those deprived areas and who, consequently, have been able to instil into those at home the need for helping those other people.</P>
    <P>In his brief the Parliamentary Secretary, having indicated the objectives of the fund, said that these objectives and priorities provide the basis on which the funds lending policies and criteria will be evolved.  I trust that in so far as lending policies are concerned, there will be flexibility regarding repayments, Of course, it is necessary that a check be kept to ensure that monies lent are utilised fully and properly but we must have regard to the fact that many countries are beaten in their efforts at self-sufficiency because of the servicing of loans.</P>
    <P>Earlier I referred to the question of the percentage of the funds that <Col N="334" /> may be utilised by way of administration costs.  One can only hope that this aspect may be financed separately elsewhere.</P>
    <P>On the question of our home situation, there is the impression that when many people are out of work there is less money for those in the Third World countries on the basis that we must maintain our own people first. There is nothing wrong with that thinking but it is only right that we have an adequate fiscal policy, one that not only enables us to look after our own people but also to help those other people of whom we are talking.  Inflation is one of the great evils of our time and the poor are those affected most by it.</P>
    <P>The efforts of the developed countries should be aimed at teaching peoples in the developing areas to cater for their own needs.  This path will be long and difficult but a start is being made by way of this international fund.  In the meantime, we must continue with the food-aid programmes. The oil crisis put into perspective many aspects of everyday life both for the developing and the developed countries.  It showed clearly our dependence on these poorer countries.  In 1974, for instance, 47 per cent of imports to the EEC originated in developing countries.  In this regard one thinks of the Irish proverb &ldquo;ar scáth a chéile a mhaireann na daoine&rdquo;.  That crisis made all countries realise their interdependence.</P>
    <P>Climatic conditions play a major role in terms of the development of a country.  For instance, there are areas of much water while there are other areas in which water is very scarce. Although there are so many large areas of water in the world, much of it is of little use because of its saline content.  Consequently, there is a need for the storing and the transportation of surface water.  There are huge problems of this sort that will be with us for a long time yet.  This agreement is an important stepping stone and I wish this agricultural development programme every success.  I hope that the programme will be implemented fully in the shortest possible time and I hope all the money will be made <Col N="335" /> available for development work and not used to cover secretarial or other expenses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the House for the way in which this motion has been received and to thank Deputy C. Murphy, who has just spoken, and Deputy Callanan, who preceded him, for their contributions. I would like to thank Deputy O'Kennedy for yet another of his extraordinarily fine contributions on a subject about which I know he feels strongly and genuinely.  Several points were raised by these three speakers and I will try to deal with them as precisely as I can.  Because of the sequence in which I have been collating their points, I shall be working backwards.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy mentioned loans and hoped that because developing countries have already a debt burden these loans would be made on the easiest possible terms.  I said this morning that the intention is to make the loans on concessional terms.  I take that to mean that the interest rates and the intervals for repayment will be as easy as it is possible to make them consistent with development in the countries concerned.  Those who administer funds like this are well aware of the problems and they appreciate that there is no point in making the problems worse by adding to a debt burden which it is already a major world problem to reduce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Deputy Murphy and Deputy Callanan were concerned that this money would not be absorbed in administration costs but would find its way quickly in its entirety on to the ground.  The intention is that funds will be administered by a secretariat which will be as small as possible.  The agencies which will administer indiviual projects are in fact already established, such as the World Bank and the FAO, with its headquarters in Rome, plus the United Nations Development Programme.  These are existing institutions and Deputies need not be apprehensive that another enormous bureaucracy will be developed with an <Col N="336" /> acronymic title which will run away with a large proportion of the funds in administration expenses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan mentioned the problems of soil character.  He comes from a farming constituency.  He is an acknowledged expert who frequently contributes here on technical agricultural subjects and I am diffident about discussing this with him, but I am advised the FAO, which has been administering individual projects over the years, has developed a very large body of expertise in all these matters and particularly in the matter of suitability of soil for different projects. Deputy Callanan need not be apprehensive about this fund being used to carry out unsuitable projects, such as growing bananas in Finland, or something of that sort.  That simply will not happen.  The established agencies are sufficiently expert in these technical matters to avoid wasteful or unproductive projects.  What is measured against the importance and the size of the project is a relatively modest sum of money.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy mentioned the possibility of locating the administration of this fund in Ireland even if it is as slim and as lean as it is.  I would be very anxious to see that for all kinds of reasons.  I am told the fund already has a temporary headquarters in Rome, which is a natural location because of the existence there of the FAO.  I am told also there is some prospect of the ultimate headquarters being sited in Teheran.  Off the top of my head I would have thought Teheran a relatively inaccessible place, perhaps less accessible even than Shannon, but the Iranian Government are very heavy contributors, and, perhaps, their claim to have the headquarters in their country would be preferred on that ground.  However, the Deputy can be assured we will keep our eye on this question and, if it becomes open, we will be looking for consideration for the reasons the Deputy gave.</P>
    <P>As I said, the money will be calculated in sterling and I am not aware of any mechanism except the mechanism of a hand-to-mouth Government allocation by way of Supplementary Estimate, and so forth, to <Col N="337" /> increase the allocation in the event of a significant further devaluation of sterling.  As the House knows, sterling has held up reasonably well since its plunge last year, and I do not think there is now any apprehension that this money will be worth appreciably less because of currency fluctuations. If that is the evolution, then we shall have to cross that bridge when we come to it.</P>
    <P>The intention is that we will participate actively in consultation inside what we are calling the Netherlands constituency.  This consultation will affect and govern the day-to-day operations of the fund and, quite apart from the Netherlands constituency which is not related to the EEC because it includes Switzerland, there will also be continual consultation in the framework of the EEC, in particular in the development council of that body, which will obviously have an effect on the deliberations within the Netherlands constituency and there the Irish role will be just as vocal as we are able to make it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it envisaged that this temporary constituency will, in fact, be a permanent constituency to which we will be attached?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is still an open question but, either way, the Deputy can take it that the Irish role in consultation and effort will be an active one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing Deputy O'Kennedy said struck me very forcibly.  It is something with which I strongly agree.  It is that we might play an active part in this fund.  I would like to relate that to a get theory of my own as to the way this country might work in future.  I have often advanced the idea that localities here might be progressively encouraged to show a responsibility for their own economic development, and their own employment capacity for the young people they are rearing, and this responsibility would be more or less institutionalised in the same way as small areas have a certain responsibility in regard to certain aspects of local government and quite a number of very significant voluntary organisations&mdash;<Col N="338" /> sports organisations, cultural organisations, and so on&mdash;are organised on a local basis and could not be effectively organised any other way. I would like to see the institutionalisation of what I describe as a total co-op, a structure inside every community which would be progressively economic in scope and object and would be invited and encouraged by central Government to carry a specific responsibility and to exercise foresight for the finding of jobs for its own young people and for the economic development of the area, rather than expect a larger, more distant authority to carry that burden for them.</P>
    <P>I envisaged this sort of structure in an Irish locality as being not one solely restricted to pushing up the crude output of pigs or sheep or cattle or grain, but as having cultural&mdash;I do not like using these expressions because they mean different things to different people&mdash;perhaps even moral dimensions towards trying to realise the ambitions we have for Ireland but which because of our size, position and other things are unrealisable in terms of military and imperialist expansion or the other criteria by which countries in the past in other parts of the world have been recognised as great or as successful.  If we look for other ways of leading our lives we are more likely to be great and successful on different criteria and ones which are more appropriate to us.</P>
    <P>To get back from that digression, I would envisage and very strongly support locality structure of that kind which would have a responsibility for the economic development of the land which it could see from its own church steeple and for the economic future of its own sons and daughters. I would like to see each locality, and not just the State, accepting an obligation towards localities in other parts of the world where the people do not know how they are going to feed, clothe and house themselves beyond the day that is passing over them.  While it is easy to talk in a general and, I must admit, in an uninstructed way technically about the benefits of twinning or pairing, I think <Col N="339" /> that contacts like those in the old days via the Christian missions with certain parts of Africa and of Asia would make it possible and a familiar idea for Irish districts to take upon themselves a continuing commitment to an identified part, a parish, province or section of population, of the developing world, with the physical characteristics which could be understood in Irish terms.</P>
    <P>In order to relate this to what Deputy O'Kennedy was saying I would like to see us forgetting our old prejudices against emigration.  Emigration, in any case, is not the kind of final separation from one's family that it was in the days when there were the Queenstown wakes.  Modern travel makes it possible to fly back and forth from Nigeria or somewhere like that to Ireland in a matter of half a day.  I would like to see Irish communities encouraging their sons and daughters to technical education and, in particular, technical education of a kind which could be exploited by these young people in going out, not necessarily for a year, but perhaps to make their livelihood as a vocation, not in religious terms, although in a way of course they are religious but not in a confessional sense religious, in countries very far away from us, compared with which we are pampered and spoiled by fortune, even though we tend to think of ourselves as poor.</P>
    <P>Perhaps what I am saying lacks something in lucidity.  It is hard to make this relevant within a limited debate of this kind.  However, I do support very strongly the idea of Irish personal, individual man and woman participation in the development of agriculture, of food production and all the things which go with it and will flow from it if it succeeds in the poorer parts of the world.  That is something we should think strongly about in our own educational system and in the way we encourage the organisation of our own society to unfold.</P>
    <P>As I say I am very strongly behind the idea that Irish communities should seek&mdash;I have various ideas how that might be done but this is not the <Col N="340" /> moment to produce them&mdash;some way of identifying themselves with some manageable small part of the developing world which they can help to put on its feet and keep on its feet.  That is the object of this development programme.  It is not a food programme. It is not simply, as Deputies recognise, a matter of sending large quantities of food which will be devoured by tomorrow evening and which will immediately need to be replaced.  It is a question of trying to train people into organising themselves and organising the physical resources among which they live in such a way that they will become able to feed themselves for good.</P>
    <P>Even people who do not share what is the shining commitment of people like Deputy O'Kennedy to try to do something for the people who are badly off in this world&mdash;and that means about two-thirds of the world's population, if not more&mdash;even people who are indifferent to it or who feel that natural forces, starvation and disease or war should be allowed to solve these problems, even these people might be compelled by self-interest to help the developing countries.  Although the people in these poorer countries are unable to organise themselves in such a way as to raise crops and breed viable herds of animals for food, they are well able to handle rifles and they are well able, as we have seen, to lay on man-sized wars that even the modern sophisticated methods of western powers are not able to keep in check or in control.  People that were sunk in unimaginable barbarity and backwardness once upon a time are now the terror of whole continents. It requires only a few plane loads of advisers in bush suits from Cuba, paid for by Russian money, to turn even a recently emerged and barely emerged colonial area into a serious threat which the whole world has to take into account.  Therefore, even if compassion or interest in other human beings did not push us in this direction, self-interest at the very least must do so.</P>
    <P>I believe we must look forward to the time when the population of Africa and the population of the under-privileged parts of South America&mdash;and that means virtually all <Col N="341" /> of South America&mdash;and of Asia will be staring us in the eyeball militarily and politically and that the ogres that we have tended to see around us in the western democracies since the second world war, Soviet Russia and so on, will themselves be cowering face to face with these resurgent peoples who will be in no good mood or good temper to be sparing the people who rode high on the hog themselves and let their children starve.  I would like us to be an exception from the rule of indifference&mdash;if it is fair to say that people are indifferent; perhaps it is not fair to say that&mdash;and even if only for the sake of national self-interest, to have friends among those populations and make ourselves sufficiently known among them for good work and for help out of our own limited resources, so that it can be said: &ldquo;The Irish at least cannot be blamed for this.  They did their best to help when nobody was forcing them to do so, when they could quite easily have put the money in their own pockets.&rdquo;  I think it would be wise, if not something dictated by charity and ordinary human solidarity, for us to take that line.  I thank Deputy O'Kennedy, as I have often done before for his point of view on this matter, and I commend the motion to the House.</P>

    <Title>Industrial Development Bill, 1976: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly) (for the Minister for Industry and Commerce) John Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly) (for the Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Bill are explained in the memorandum which was circulated to Deputies on 26th November last.  I would like first to discuss the objectives of the Bill and then to make some comments on industrial development generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objectives of the Bill are, first, to introduce two new incentives dessigned to encourage new enterprises and to facilitate sectoral restructuring; secondly, to provide an additional function to the Industrial Development <Col N="342" /> Authority concerning technical assistance to developing countries and, thirdly, to make a number of technical amendments to the existing legislation mainly in the matter of limits on certain incentives.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to introduce a new initiative to encourage first time entrepreneurs to set up industries.  Native entrepreneurs have not been coming forward in sufficient numbers.  This means that a vital spark is missing from Irish industry, despite the good results being achieved by the overall development programme and more particularly the very welcome upsurge in the development of small industries which was one of the more noteworthy and encouraging aspects of industrial development in 1976.  I have no doubt that there is a great deal of latent business talent which could be tapped with the right encouragement.  Many Irish people, both in this country and overseas, have the qualifications, the experience and the ideas to make successful industrialists.  The authority have informed me that they have had contact with a number of people who had ideas for seemingly viable industrial projects, but who were unable to raise the working capital to get the projects off the ground.  Such people, with the talent and ability to become successful manufacturers, should be given every encouragement to get into industry; there is a clear need for a new initiative to help provide that part of the financial package which the first time entrepreneur cannot supply on his or her own.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, this Bill proposes that the authority's power of loan guarantee and interest subsidy be extended to working capital borrowed for such ventures.  Of course, facilities relating to fixed assets will continue to be available in the ordinary way.  Projects assisted would generally be small in size initially and the financial package would be determined in the light of the needs of the project, and of the finance available from outside sources.  The House will note that the new guarantee facilities are limited to £150,000 in any one case, but the Government may permit a higher figure.  This type of scheme is <Col N="343" /> new in this country and is frankly experimental, but the indications for its success are good and the Minister has every confidence that it will become a useful generator of new industrial activity.</P>
    <P>The enterprise development programme will complement the present small industry programme in that it will develop projects which in time will move into the small industries category.  I should add that the small industry programme has been remarkably successful especially last year when projects approved under the programme had an employment potential of 3,000, the highest level ever.  But the number of projects established by first time entrepreneurs has been small.  The new facilities proposed in this Bill will help to fill this gap in our incentive system.</P>
    <P>It is an essential part of our industrial strategy to strengthen and develop our existing domestic industry.  In this way we will be able to get the maximum possible number of jobs from existing firms and to reduce our dependence on prospects generated abroad.  Therefore, every effort must be made to assist the home sector and especially the weaker parts of it.  The re-equipment grants scheme for example is geared to promote investment in new plant and machinery to enable industry to become more efficient.  Re-equipment, however, is only one aspect of modernisation.  For some sectors re-equipment alone is not the answer; there is also a need for reorganisation and restructuring.  The proposal in the Bill concerning sectoral restructuring is designed to meet this need which has been accentuated by the recession.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to examine in detail how specific industries might be restructured, but it is obvious that the present powers of the authority are inadequate to encourage desirable amalgamations and acquisitions in problem areas.  The existing financial incentives are confined to projects involving new fixed asset investment. In many cases of amalgamations and acquisitions no new assets are required, merely financial reconstruction. The additional measures to aid <Col N="344" /> restructuring of industry proposed in the Bill would extend the powers of loan guarantee and interest subsidy to capital required for amalgamations and acquisitions.  It is just the type of enterprise that the Bill is directed at, which often has difficulty in raising finance from the commercial institutions. I would hope that the new measures will encourage the financial institutions to be more forthcoming in financing industrial restructuring.</P>
    <P>The Minister believes that the benefits in the form of savings to the Exchequer would be significant.  When firms close down which might have become viable under stronger management and more secure financing, the cost in capital grants to the State of creating substitute jobs in new industry is considerable.  On the other hand, the new incentives in themselves are unlikely to demand extensive financial commitments by the State. The industries for which the proposed scheme would operate are not capital intensive and units within those industries tend to be medium to small scale in size.  The Bill would set a limit of £500,000 on the amount of borrowings the authority could guarantee without Government permission. This limit is the same as that introduced in 1975 for ordinary guarantees.</P>
    <P>The second objective of the Bill is to provide an additional function to the authority, that of giving assistance of a limited nature to developing countries.  I would like to stress at the outset that the kind of assistance I have in mind is of a purely technical nature.  Furthermore, there is no question of this work interfering in any way with the principal functions of the Industrial Development Authority.  The demand for this assistance has developed in a rather <i>ad hoc</i> manner.  In the past, visiting groups and individuals from developing countries have been provided with information and data concerning various aspects of industrial development organisations such as the World Bank and the EEC Development Fund award development contracts under which technical assistance is provided to developing countries by bodies possessing the appropriate skills <Col N="345" /> and experience.  The Industrial Develment Authority have extensive expertise in the promotion of industry and in the assessment and planning of projects.  They have also been involved in the assessment and planning of labour requirements, infrastructure and services.  This knowledge and experience could be valuable to developing countries.</P>
    <P>The authority have no legal power to undertake work of this kind and to enable them to provide such services the Minister proposes that the functions of the authority as set out in existing law be amended to provide that the authority may, with his approval, give assistance of a technical and advisory nature to developing countries.  The cost of this assistance is expected to be met, in practice, from funds already available to international institutions, such as the World Bank and the EEC Development Fund, to buy consultancy services for developing countries.</P>
    <P>The third objective of the Bill is to make a number of technical changes to the existing legislation, particularly in the matter of limits on some of the present incentives.</P>
    <P>Expenditure and financial commitments made under the present Bill are brought within the scope of the present limits in the existing legislation, that is £400 million for grants of a capital nature, which includes interest subsidies, and £100 million for loan guarantees.  In addition moneys spent on equity, which formerly were not covered by any ceiling, are also brought under the ceiling for grants of a capital nature.</P>
    <P>For the avoidance of doubt, the term &ldquo;current expenditure&rdquo; for borrowing purposes is defined to cover all types of expenditure by the authority. I should add that such borrowings are exceptional and have arisen mainly from the exhaustion of the maximum amount the authority have been entitled to draw upon from the Exchequer pending further legislation.</P>
    <P>The authority have been empowered to give training grants.  These have proved very useful in direct industrial promotion.  A more important aspect is that they have helped to upgrade the level of skills in the community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="346" /> Existing legislation imposes no limit on the amount in training grants that can be paid to any one undertaking. Recently, however, single grants for training have become much larger, partly due to the scale of enterprises, and partly also because of the IDA's programme for services or non-manufacturing industry.  All other types of financial incentives are subject to a maximum limit per individual case which can be exceeded only with Government approval and so the training grant provision is now being brought into line with the limit which applies to fixed asset grants, that is, £850,000.</P>
    <P>Investment in research and development to improve or develop products or processes is essential if Irish industry is to remain competitive in free trade conditions.  Over-dependence on one product or on a limited range of products can leave a firm vunerable to changing market requirements. New production methods can reduce manufacturing costs significantly and many Irish firms have been reexamining their production techniques in the light of rapidly escalating costs of labour, energy, and raw materials.</P>
    <P>Since 1970 the IDA have approved R + D proposals for over 350 projects. In the last three years the authority have tried to convince firms of the need to get new products or to adapt existing ones, and the response from Irish industry has been very positive. In many cases too, overseas parent companies are now delegating R + D work to their Irish subsidiaries.  However, <i>per capita</i> investment in R + D in this country remains low by European standards: it is roughly one-quarter of the EEC level.  The authority have found that because of inflation and technological change the upper limit of £15,000 on grants for a specific R + D project is now inadequate. These grants cover the personnel, equipment, buildings and materials mainly for commercially-oriented product development programmes of Irish companies.  Accordingly, it is proposed to increase this limit to £50,000.  Grants in excess of this figure will require Government approval but the absolute maximum <Col N="347" /> of 50 per cent of the total approved costs will continue to apply.  The Minister thinks the new limit is a realistic one and will help to advance technological development in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The authority in the past have taken equity stakes in a number of industrial projects of particular commercial interest.  Since, however, it is sound principle that the total commitments of the Exchequer should be quantified and planned for, the Minister proposes a limit of £1 million on the amount the IDA can commit without Government approval.  I should stress here that provisions which bring the limits of various IDA facilities, without Government permission, into line with one another are simply in accordance with good administrative practice and do not in any sense imply a criticism of the scope of the authority's functions or of the manner in which they have been discharged.</P>
    <P>The proposal regarding sealing of documents is, quite simply, based on the authority's experience that the required presence of two members of the authority to seal hundreds of documents per year leads to practical difficulties and delays.  This applies particularly when documents have to be sealed at short notice to facilitate urgent transactions.  In a recent two-year period, over 1,000 such documents had to be sealed and, since the members of the authority are fairly busy in their own right it is easy to see that some change in the present provision is necessary.  It is intended to give the Industrial Development Authority power to delegate to two of their officers authority to authenticate the seal.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the provisions of the Bill.  Planning and promoting industrial development is a dynamic process, and the authority must be able to adapt their methods to changing needs and economic conditions.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority have performed well during the seven years of their existence in their present form.  In the period 1970 to the end of 1976 they approved grant assistance to projects with an employment potential of about 110,000 new <Col N="348" /> jobs at full capacity.  The Minister is pleased to see that for 1976 the authority exceeded the target of 17,000 new job approvals by more than 1,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the importance of getting the maximum contribution to job creation from existing domestic industry.  This task is not of course confined to the IDA; progress in the industrial field depends on the combined efforts of many different organisations at national and local level.  In the context of this debate, however, we are discussing matters relating to the authority and in that connection I would like to mention the principal activities that are especially directed towards domestic industry. These are the re-equipment scheme, the small industries programme, joint venture unit, product and process development, and the service industry programme.</P>
    <P>Since the re-equipment scheme was introduced, 2,700 re-equipment projects have been approved and assisted.  The total approved investment was £330 million and the total of grants approved was over £78 million.  The money spent on re-equipment does not immediately translate into jobs, but in terms of maintaining jobs and strengthening our industrial fabric to create more jobs it is a very important incentive.  It ensures that enterprises remain efficient and competitive and provides a strong basis for future expansion.</P>
    <P>The Minister is especially pleased with the development of the small industries programme.  As I mentioned earlier, the programme had a record number of 3,000 job approvals last year.  The success of the small industries programme is perhaps one aspect of industrial development that is insufficiently appreciated.  Since its introduction about 1,400 enterprises have been supported with a job potential of about 15,300 jobs.  Many of these industries have developed by taking advantage of the ancillary business created by foreign industries established here.  In this connection it is appropriate to mention project identification.  This is a new approach in which the IDA take the initiative and identify manufacturing opportunities <Col N="349" /> for Irish firms.  There are many opportunities to supply materials, components and services to the new industrial firms setting up plants in Ireland as well as to a large number of Irish firms expanding their production.</P>
    <P>In the past 18 months the IDA have gone to about 400 Irish firms with specific propositions.  Many of these projects are aimed at an initial import substitution market, but they have strong export potential.  About 20 projects have been brought to the final approval stage; in the case of 50 others negotiations with Irish manufacturers are taking place.</P>
    <P>Joint ventures is an area of considerable opportunity for Irish manufacturers. In 1973 the authority set up a special unit to help Irish firms seeking further opportunities through partnership arrangements with overseas companies.  This unit acts as a broker in matching suitable Irish firms with an overseas partner who has a good product idea, the technology to make the products and access to markets.  Since April, 1973, 19 joint venture projects representing 1,500 jobs at full production have been approved for grant assistance.</P>
    <P>Since 1973 the IDA have been actively promoting product and process development in Irish industry. There has been a very positive response.  In 1975 alone, the number of proposals from industry doubled to almost 150, half of them for product development, the other half for more efficient manufacturing processes.  This progress was maintained in 1976 when 151 projects were approved.  Grant commitments under the scheme have increased rapidly from £100,000 in 1970 to almost £1 million in 1976.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the service industries programme in 1973, 38 projects with an employment potential of almost 2,900 new jobs have been approved for grant assistance.  The aims of the programme are to create jobs for highly skilled people many of whom might otherwise emigrate, and to generate extra invisible earnings from export work.  By encouraging Irish companies selling export services to expand their operations overseas <Col N="350" /> very significant opportunities are being created for graduates, professional and technical personal and people with commercial and business experience.</P>
    <P>One of the encouraging results of these and other initiatives is that the share of industrial investment by existing industry is increasing.  The share was just over 50 per cent of the total planned investment in industry between April, 1972, and December, 1976.  In the food industry, for example, approved investment during the past five years totalled £152 million the greater part of which was committed by Irish firms.  Domestic industry has also featured prominently in new investment in the drink, tobacco, paper and printing, chemicals and engineering sectors.</P>
    <P>Our industrial base has been strengthened and extended during the last few years.  This is reflected in the volume and variety of the products which we now export and in the range of technologies which we possess. Nevertheless, an integral part of our industrial policy will continue to be the attraction of overseas investment.</P>
    <P>Foreign firms have contributed 43,000 actual jobs in Irish manufacturing industry since 1960.  New overseas projects approved for grant assistance between April, 1972, and December, 1976, have an employment potential of over 44,000 at full production. Overseas firms which began production here between 1960 and the end of 1976 invested over £548 million in fixed assets.  It is particularly significant that the vast majority of the firms which in 1973 and early 1974 announced plans to set up factories in Ireland have carried out those plans. The fixed asset investment of overseas industries which began production here last year is about £200 million.</P>
    <P>Although we still rely to a considerable extent on the attraction of overseas investment, we are selective about the kind of investment which we want to attract, in terms of the quality of jobs created, use of our resources, protection of our environment, new technology, marketing strategy creating work for existing firms and downstream manufacturing opportunities.  The <Col N="351" /> attraction of overseas investment also involves keeping under constant review the effectiveness of the instruments of our industrial policy.</P>
    <P>We can be under no illusion as to the magnitude of the task with which we are faced.  Our population and labour force will grow significantly in the years ahead.  Added to this there is the need for the expansion of employment to absorb those who lost their jobs from the severe cyclical downturn of 1974 and 1975, and to make progress in tackling our long standing problem of structural unemployment. All of this is in the context of net immigration far removed from the emigration pattern of recent decades and centuries.</P>
    <P>The achievement of even medium term employment targets up to 1980 requires a variety of policies and methods.  A high level of investment in productive projects, both in the private and public sectors and by way of joint ventures will be of central importance.  Training and infrastructure are also vital elements and it will be essential to ensure an adequate level of industrial training so that new industries can draw on skilled workers without poaching on existing industries and to ensure that our physical infrastructure keeps pace with the needs of industry.</P>
    <P>It is well recognised by the Government that adequate profitability throughout industry is essential if sufficient funds are to be ploughed back into employment-creating projects. The taxation provisions of the budget demonstrate our serious intent in this regard.  We will maintain an environment that encourages enterprise &mdash;what we need is more of the type of enterprise that will evolve into viable manufacturing businesses with a potential for employment expansion.  In turn, we now look to existing industry for investment in Irish projects to make a major contribution to the generation of employment.  Indeed, the Minister hopes that the entire work force, employers, employees and service agencies, can organise themselves to work effectively for the benefit of the economy. If we are to make progress <Col N="352" /> towards the solution of our problems, rapid economic growth is essential in the years ahead, and this cannot be achieved without maximum growth in manufacturing industry.  The Government, I can assure the House, will continue to encourage vigorously the development of Irish industry.  Ultimately, however, even with significant State aid, the ability of industry to expand will depend on its competitiveness in terms of wage-costs, management performance, marketing skills, customer service and capacity for innovation and technical adjustment. The challenge before us is immense; there will be need for shared sacrifices and a common determination not to take out today in incomes and other rewards what today's performance cannot sustain.</P>
    <P>The new level of technology, managerial skills and investment in plant throughout the entire spectrum of Irish industry inspires reasonable confidence for the future.  We now have the emerging opportunity for the rational planning and development of industries based on our mineral resources.</P>
    <P>Our structures and policies will be designed to accommodate this.  There has been, in addition, a definite recovery in industrial output and exports from the latter part of 1975.  Our performance in 1976 was remarkably encouraging; manufactured output increased by more than 11 per cent and the volume of manufactured exports increased by some 20 per cent.  The over-riding requirement is for investment in projects that will stand the test of time in competitive home and export markets.  It will require a major input of resources and skills from domestic Irish industries, foreign industry, public sector companies and State agencies such as the IDA.</P>
    <P>The IDA, as they have shown in the past, are capable of responding in a flexible and coherent manner to the changing industrial scene.  This Bill adds to their range of instruments in support of industrial development.  I am confident that the passage of this Bill will be facilitated so that the authority can better carry out their increasingly demanding task of <Col N="353" /> creating new employment.  I accordingly recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary can be assured that anything proposed in this House which would lead to an improvement in the employment position will meet with our support.  This Bill to give the IDA further powers is understandable and welcome.  I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the IDA again on the work they have being doing in difficult circumstances.  This organisation is like a gem set in a base metal. It is working against mighty odds and without the necessary support services from the Government and without the necessary co-ordination from the other institutions which could lead to the planned development of our economy which is now more necessary than ever.</P>
      <P>Industrial incentives in the form of grants are useful, but they are not the whole answer to our problems in attracting industries, expanding existing industries, and developing new techniques and processes for the further expansion of our industrial arm.  More significant than anything which can be provided by way of monetary incentives is the environment in which industry is set.  What is necessary to encourage and attract industry is much more than to pass legislation which merely places at the disposal of the IDA the necessary funds to provide capital for industry.</P>
      <P>The complete failure of the Government to produce an economic plan, the absence of any reference whatsoever to such a plan in the Minister's statement which the Parliamentary Secretary has just read is, in itself, to say the least of it, most discouraging. It is appalling to think that, at a time when economic planning and planning for industry was never so essential as it is now, we have not even attempted at this late stage to come up with any sort of plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a lot of rhetoric which is a poor substitute for action.  Recently somebody on the Coalition side of the divide referred to a State development board as the panacea for all our ills. <Col N="354" /> I am not in a position to know what was envisaged for such a board and I will not comment on whether it would be useful or otherwise.  At least it showed some recognition that people on the other side of the House were conscious that some type of plan was necessary.  That was the only feeble reference we had to any move towards an overall plan.</P>
    <P>Presumably this State development board would be charged with responsibility for doing what the Government and other agencies of the Government have failed to do up to now, that is, the responsibility of monitoring or planning the economy.  I am not sure but I think that was the intention.  It was part of the cosmetics we have been getting in lieu of action over the past four years.  When we talk about the absolute necessity for a better industrial environment we can only conclude that these sort of half-hearted statements thrown out and not pursued must have the opposite effect to planning and must create a good deal of frustration in the minds of the people.</P>
    <P>When we in Fianna Fáil talk about the necessity for a plan we have not in mind, as some people try to insinuate at times, a straitjacket, or some sort of magical formula which would in itself provide the necessary industrial expansion and guide us into channels of prosperity without the necessary follow-up of action.  A plan without action is not of much use, but action without a plan is even more useless.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no action and no plan.  We have people sitting back, moralising, criticising, estimating, guesstimating and making statements from day to day in accordance with what they think are the political requirements.  We find ourselves in a labyrinth of industrial indecision and there is a complete lack of direction on the part of those responsible.  A plan provides the framework within which society can work.  It must be flexible but it must also indicate the policy and thinking of the Government <Col N="355" /> of the day.  It is a guide for those who wish to invest, both domestic and foreign, and without it real progress cannot be made.  We are not going to have such a plan.  The Government could not provide £1.5 million for a census which would form the basis of any proper planning and they can ill-afford to make excuses for what has gone wrong in the past few years.  The right economic environment is most important but this is lacking at the moment.  The Government must take responsibility for monetary and fiscal policy and since they take so much of the people's money they cannot avoid accepting responsibility for its proper use.</P>
      <P>The IDA have powers to deal with many aspects of industry and, to some extent, this Bill extends those powers. What we need most at present is a service to rescue industries that are short of working capital in order to keep them in existence until a better economic environment will enable them to make progress again.  This is not being done.</P>
      <P>In the 1930s we set out to industrialise this country and we encountered much opposition to our radical proposals.  It was frequently pointed out by those responsible, particularly by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, that the main requirements of industry were, first, to have a product; secondly, to have a market; thirdly, to have the know-how to produce the product.  The fourth requirement was capital but this was the easiest of all the requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If somebody has the technical know-how to produce a product and a market in which to sell it, he should not be deprived of the means of financing it.  With regard to small industries, this Bill is a step in that direction and for that reason I commend it.  Although the criteria are not set out with regard to qualifying for the proposed assistance&mdash;up to £150,000 &mdash;it is a step in the right direction provided the requirements which I mentioned are filled.  When we were in office, we ensured that if an individual could produce and market a <Col N="356" /> profitable product he was not deprived of the necessary finance.  Many industries went into production and continued quite successfully, even though they did not have adequate working capital at the outset.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary in his reply to refer to the criteria necessary to qualify for the grants or financial assistance by way of guaranteed loan interest for the promotion of industry by private entrepreneurs.  The House would like a more definite idea of what the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary has in mind with regard to such criteria.</P>
    <P>As was admitted by the Parliamentary Secretary, our small industries programme has been an outstanding success despite the fact that industry has been grouping in the dark for some considerable time.  There is one type of industrial development that has found it difficult to get any support by way of capital from any source and the IDA did not take a favourable view of them in the past.  I am referring to the kind of industry where a person or a number of persons in a small, primitive way manufacture a particular commodity or article and by their dedication and effort the business expands and is the basis of a viable industry.</P>
    <P>When these people approach the IDA or the local development team they are looked on as people seeking capital to expand an existing industry. Better recognition should be given to efforts of that type.  Many industries which began as workshops became factories.  The most outstanding example of this is in the joinery and woodworking industries and in concrete products.  These find great difficulty in getting capital when they have proved that expansion is possible and when something has grown from what might have been a quarry operation to an important source of employment for male labour as a result of a small beginning or something which has grown from a carpenter's shop into an outstanding woodworking industry.</P>
    <P>Those things are not favourably looked on by any of the people administering the scheme at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="357" /> This is just simply requiring more faith and confidence in our people to do something well.  The scheme which the Minister proposes here is merely an extension of our small industries programme which he calls the enterprise development programme.  Does that scheme take cognisance of this particular type of industry which grows out of small beginnings into an important industry?</P>
    <P>I would like Deputies on the other side of the House, particularly Deputy Halligan if he speaks on this Bill, to tell us more about the State development board to which the Taoiseach referred at the IMI conference recently.  Has this been a bone of contention among the conflicting ideologies of the Coalition?  What did it envisage in the first instance?  Is it to replace existing organisations?  To what extent is it a dead duck now? Was it originally intended that it would promote the nationalisation of industries? Would it be charged with doing what the Government have failed to do, produce an economic plan?  Will it be inimical to private enterprise? What type of agency is proposed?  Will it get off the ground?  These questions remain unanswered.  The Taoiseach's reference to the State development board at the IMI conference was indecisive and left industry wondering if it would come about and what it would be about.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to clear the air and let us know if we are not to have this State development board, will we have a plan.  Are we to continue groping our way in the dark waiting for something to turn up in world affairs that might give us a tailwind for the next election?  We expect action not comment or rhetoric of which we are utterly sickened at the present time.  Action can only come if a proper plan is formulated to point the way.  A planned programme for economic development is an essential framework within which industry and every sector of the economy may work.  The target set may not be attainable but the necessary flexibility in a programme at least shows what the economic thinking is for those who invest their <Col N="358" /> capital in the future.  I believe the necessary progress cannot be made without this.</P>
    <P>I believe that at one stage the excuse was given that due to the international economic climate it was not possible to have a plan.  That is a ridiculous statement because this is a time when a plan is most needed.  We should set a course for ourselves.  We had economic plans in the past which were the main source of expansion in our economy.  They may not always have been achieved.  We may have had to change course but flexibility was permitted to do so.  At least those plans provided a framework within which every Department of State knew what was expected of them.  It enabled those responsible for providing capital, whether personal capital, that provided by financial institutions or by the Government, to know the direction in which we were going and they could invest accordingly. It is an essential blueprint and guide for any economy without which no civilised country can make progress.</P>
    <P>We talk about the incentives and grants available to industry at the disposal of the IDA and other ancillary agencies.  But these are of little relevance if the overall industrial environment is not right.  In the past few years industry had been in the position of not knowing from one day to another what would be the effects of inflation.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to quantify for us the extra charges on industry as a result of the increases in postal and telephone charges, in ESB charges and in the cost of other fuels as well as the increase in rates on premises.  Can he tell us what has been the overall effect on industry of the inflationary spiral with which they have had to contend and which was created mainly by the new taxes introduced by the Government?  At least one quarter of the 20 per cent inflation rate in 1976 was due to the budget of that year.  There are statistics to prove this.</P>
    <P>During the past three and a half years the Minister has placed every obstacle possible in the way of industrial development making it virtually <Col N="359" /> impossible for any expansion to take place.  Then, on the eve of the final budget before the general election he tells the Dublin Chamber of Commerce that we are too highly taxed and in the budget he endeavours to undo some of the hardship inflicted on us since this Government came to office.  To this end a small contribution was made but this was after Fianna Fáil had issued their policy document on the way to deal with the economic emergency.  Anybody who doubts what I am saying would do well to read our economic policy document of September, 1976, and, in addition, to read the comments of the Minister for Finance a couple of days after the publication of that document when he sneered at us.  However, he implemented some of our suggestions in this year's budget.  That was the best example I can think of in the history of government here of a poacher turning gamekeeper.  To the taxpayers the Minister said: &ldquo;you have been banging your heads against the wall for some time: it would be nice to give you some relief&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Instead of voting money to the IDA for the purpose of providing for other industries, our first priority should be the provision of working capital for those industries which, although viable, are tottering on the brink of ruin.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to endeavour to locate the Minister for Industry and Commerce in whatever part of the world he may be with a view to requesting him to come home and have a serious look at the industrial scene.</P>
    <P>It takes a lot of money to keep even one person in industrial employment but let us not forget what it costs in terms of redundancy and social welfare payments as well as in terms of the amount of money required to create alternative employment in a new industry when workers are made redundant. The Minister would be well advised to request the IDA to examine those industries that have endeavoured to come through the crisis of the past few years and to give them some degree of assurance that they will be enabled to maintain at least most of <Col N="360" /> their existing complement of workers. There is not much point in saying that industrial output increased last year while there are no signs of any impact being made on the serious unemployment situation.  The Government blame the world recession for the difficulties we have been experiencing but what have they done to offset the effects of that recession?  What action have they taken to control that part of our inflation that is due directly to domestic causes?  These are the matters with which we should be concerning ourselves.  Instead of asking the IDA to give more money to somebody who may have an idea about a new industry, we should be creating an environment that is conducive to investment, thereby making possible the more rapid provision of jobs for the almost 200,000 people seeking employment.</P>
    <P>We look forward to hearing what the Minister, through his Parliamentary Secretary, has to say in reply in regard to planning for the future.</P>
    <P>Although there were difficulties on the international scene during the past few years there was some compensation for our exporters to the extent that the weakening £, compared with non-sterling currency, gave them a decided advantage but they were unable to profit to any great extent from that advantage by reason of the increasing costs of production at home.</P>
    <P>With unit costs rising any advantage they might have enjoyed in that direction was eroded and outbalanced by the extra costs.  In the face of this and of the serious unemployment situation we have a Government who say it is not possible to have a plan.  They do not even provide a census of population because it would cost £1.5 million. We have spent considerably more than that in promoting missions abroad to talk about industrial development in the future.  Here I refer to globe-trotting generally.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says we have a strong industrial basis.  We must have a very strong industrial basis to withstand what industry has experienced in the last four years.  If it were not for the fact that the Minister for Finance saw fit to undo some of the <Col N="361" /> damage he did during the last four years industry would be in a state of despair at present.  Industry does not just encompass what comes within the the sphere of the IDA activities alone. All industry is complementary.  One of the greatest industries is the construction industry.  It has more spin-off than any other industry.  It responds immediately to an injection of funds. It is sensitive to the industrial climate to a greater degree than any other industry.  It is the one industry that has been totally neglected.  If the Government were serious about tackling the unemployment problem, even in the absence of a planned economy, the building industry could now be employing twice as many.  I am talking now only of the employment directly in the industry.  When one builds houses, offices, factories, schools, harbours and so on many other things are required.  A house requires fittings and that gives a fillip to many other industries.  If we were giving the necessary thought to what the overall economic position will be in the years ahead we should be giving more consideration to keeping the construction industry and complementary industries in a virile state.</P>
    <P>When we became a member of the EEC, membership opened up new possibilities for us.  We were aware it would create some difficulties but, on balance, the opportunities were far in excess of the difficulties likely to arise. When one looks back on what has happened since one must come to the conclusion that we went in at the deep end without being conscious of what was necessary to exploit and take full advantage of the things entry made available to us and we did not take the necessary steps to counter the difficulties which were inevitably going to arise as a result of entry.</P>
    <P>When I was last in Government, sitting around the Cabinet Table we had advice from different institutions and agencies.  There were many such available to the Government. They had their finger on the pulse of the economic situation.  Well in advance we were made well aware that we were facing a period of world inflation and certain action was required <Col N="362" /> to ensure that that inflation would be kept to a minimum in so far as it was domestically controllable and, secondly, that our main objective should be to ensure that it did not affect our employment situation except minimally. We were talking action accordingly.</P>
    <P>The present Government on taking over the reins did all the wrong things to arrest inflation and the fact that they did all the wrong things is amply demonstrated by the action of the Minister for Finance in his last budget.  He admitted then that the obstacles he threw up and the difficulties he created over the previous three years were all wrong.  Things had gone too far then to take really effective action and so he went about things in a half-hearted way.  Can anyone explain to me why the Minister for Finance imposed taxes on industry, making it difficult for industry, and then suddenly, in 1977, he announced that industry is too highly taxed?  Has he at any time apologised for his mistakes? Has he at any time admitted he was misled?  The people will have their own comment to make on his behaviour when the time comes.</P>
    <P>It is with that background we are here today discussing a little Bill to give the IDA some extra powers to do things within the framework of a rather serious economic set-up.  There are things which would certainly make the provisions of this Bill acceptable to industry if the Parliamentary Secretary would tell us now that the Government are going to produce a plan.  Call it a &ldquo;State Development Board&rdquo;, if you like, who, in lieu of the Government's lack of effort, will produce a plan to point the way to what was their proposed programme for future development.  That is not known.  Many industrialists today do not know whether it is the socialist element or the conservative element of the Coalition that will prevail ultimately, and in that ideological dilemma you cannot expect the progress which should have been made.</P>
    <P>That is the important point in relation to development in the years ahead.  The Government must give some guidance.  They cannot just sit back and say: &ldquo;That was a good <Col N="363" /> year.  The American economy is improving.  There are better times ahead.  Things are improving in some other countries.&rdquo;  This is Ireland.  We have our own cultural, social and fiscal policies, or should have.  We are taking from the people a huge amount of their income and while we do we should be able to do more than just say: &ldquo;Wait and see what happens abroad.  We will get a tail wind yet for the next election.  Things will improve on the international scene&rdquo;.  The Government must do what is necessary to do here.  There is a great deal that could be done and is not being done and which the Government are not even attempting to do.  Micawber-like, they are waiting for something to turn up and hoping that it will. The Minister covered many matters in his statement, but mineral sources are barely mentioned, as follows:</P>
    <P>The new level of technology, managerial skills and investment in plant throughout the entire spectrum of Irish industry inspires reasonable confidence for the future.  We now have the emerging opportunity for the rational planning and development of industries based on our mineral resources.</P>
    <P>That is the total reference in an IDA Bill dealing with industrial development: &ldquo;the emerging opportunity&rdquo;. The opportunity has been here for the last four years and in the greatest do-nothing atmosphere, the people have been wondering what is happening. The Irish people are expecting something more when the opportunity presents itself, and that is now with the introduction of this legislation.  It is an opportunity for the Minister to indicate to what extent planning for our future development has advanced both in relation to mineral resources and manufacturing industry generally. I do not know to what extent the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to speak for the Minister in respect of that, but that is what we want to know, not just the provisions of a Bill which makes available some new monetary adjustments in regard to the provision of industry.</P>
    <P>I notice that in any part of the Minister's speech where favourable <Col N="364" /> figures were required in connection with the establishment of industries or the starting of new projects, he takes the period 1970 to 1976, and in one case he takes the period from 1963 to 1976, a fairly safe period to take because it overlaps one of the good periods.  I would like him to have confined himself to the period during which he has been responsible for the mismanagement of the economy and give us factual figures for that.</P>
    <P>When we entered the EEC it was generally accepted that as far as industry generally was concerned this country would become a desirable place for non-member states to establish industry.  There was a huge number of inquiries.  I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary if one per cent of them materialised.  We were entering on a new era as a suitable place for industrial development.  This applied particularly to a number of things, mainly to the fact that people based here would have free entry to the 250 million consumers in the EEC, but it was also concerned with the industrial environment here, particularly the tax free holiday and the fact that our taxes were not then, in relation to other countries, so high, that we did not apply all the schemes that have since been applied to industry.</P>
    <P>There was also encouragement to be found in the fact that we were proceeding in an orderly manner with national wage agreements.  This held out the prospect of industrial peace. Why has all that been blown sky high in such a short time?  We did not turn out to be the desirable venue for investment by other countries in industrial development.  Only a fraction of what we anticipated came here.  That is due to one thing only, to the attitude of the Government then in power.  I am totally opposed to individual examples of personal experience in debate, but I know of a firm which was negotiating a formidable industry here two years ago, and they may be still interested.  I will not mention their name but they can be easily identified if I say they are a major industry. They made approaches to us.  They <Col N="365" /> had naturally to contend with the long-term position and their attitude was then, and now, that the attitude in Ireland was not very encouraging when the Government were comprised of different factions; what was the Opposition's view with regard to the long-term position?  An essential part of any Government is their likely stability.  I should repeat that because we had two Coalitions here previously. This is the third one.  Coalition Government is not new to us.  That absolute ruination did not result in the industry I refer to was due to the fact that there were adequate people to take over and man the works.  That happened and it will happen again.</P>
    <P>Of more importance to the industrial environment than the Bill we are discussing is the attitude to the future of the present caretaker Government. That is why we propose to outline to the people our plans and programme for the future in black and white. They are not a straitjacket in which one must work.  They are no magical formula which will bring about prosperity overnight but they will be the essential guideline.  People will realise the philosophy of the Government and the direction in which they propose to go and the desirable goals they hope to obtain.  This programme will be supported by the necessary action and fiscal assistance to support it and only by that means will we take up the slack of our increasing population which is contributing to the huge, devastating line of employment at present.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to training.  I was considerably concerned about and deeply involved in the improvement of training facilities, but when we set about to expand the scope of AnCO we foresaw the need for training at all levels in relation to both the services and industrial manufacturing.  We knew that training would be only as good as those to whom it was entrusted as trainers and we set about securing the best.  We had to be content with what was available for a start, but it rapidly improved and expanded and we got tremendous co-operation from industry who were the first to identify the areas where advanced technology <Col N="366" /> called for better training and better realisation of the need for improved skills if unit costs were to be kept down and quality was to be of the standard required to compete with the difficult conditions of free trade.  In that knowledge and with that background we set about improving the facilities provided by AnCO.  There was the question of what degree of co-operation they should have with the technical schools and colleges of technology generally, and at least we succeeded in steering a course where conflict was avoided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary dealt to a considerable degree with training and the Bill makes extra provision for it.  It sets a limit to the amount that can be allocated to training and for that reason I thought training was very relevant.  I submit to the ruling of the Chair.</P>
      <P>I was pointing out the importance of getting the base laid, and I was afraid that there would be conflict between the different people charged with training in the different directions &mdash;the colleges of technology, the technical schools, AnCO and other agencies&mdash;but we succeded in avoiding any conflict.  There is still room there for greater co-operation.  I believe a number of institutions are doing the same thing, perhaps in a different way without the necessary co-ordination.  In the matter of the technical schools we succeeded in having a block release scheme to AnCO from these schools and there is liaison there.  The universities have their own schemes in the higher education plane in relation to training, particularly in management, and I do not think they are properly co-ordinated with institutions like the colleges of technology and with the IMI.  Some co-ordination is still required there.  These are some of the fundamentals in relation to training to which the Minister should apply himself now.  A high degree of co-ordination could easily be achieved to the benefit of technological skills in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> We are at the moment training many people for whom there is no work, but it is desirable to train them now.  I am on record in this House as saying that years ago, when we were being taunted by the then Opposition, &ldquo;What are you training people for? To emigrate?&rdquo;.  Today it can be said, &ldquo;What are you training them for?  To draw the dole?&rdquo;.  My answer to that was that skills are no burden no matter where one goes after obtaining them. The trained person has an accomplishment, has achieved something and when circumstances make it possible for him to apply his training, he is equipped to go into a world which has little place for an unskilled person and will have less place in the future.  We are right to go on.  We provide people with the skills.</P>
    <P>In the serious unemployment situation, particularly in relation to young people, it is better that they be involved than that they be on the streets in desperation which would lead to a serious social problem.  I have covered most aspects of what comes within the ambit of the IDA and the Minister's speech.  The monetary incentives that we may provide in this Bill to enable the IDA to do something more are infinitesimal and of little relevance in relation to what the real inducement to industrial development should be.  We should create a better industrial environment.  The Parliamentary Secretary should ask the IDA to use some of the funds at their disposal to help Irish industry instead of concentrating on getting people from Japan to come here.  That is all very well in its own way but we must get our priorities right.  We must make sure that those in production at the moment will be kept in production and we must reduce the number of redundancies.  Industry has gone through difficult times and has only got a little relief in the last budget. We will await the Minister's reply with greatest interest.</P>

      <P>I am in support of the extension of the functions of the IDA.  The IDA have recently received considerable commendation from various international publications in respect of their work, not least in <Col N="368" /><i>The Economist</i> survey of a month ago. It also received commendation in <i>The Financial Times</i> survey which preceded the other by some weeks.  While I may have some tough things to say about Irish industry generally, I do not wish to denigrate the work of the IDA. Their work has proved absolutely vital in the maintenance of an industry base and in securing employment.</P>
      <P>An industrial development Bill should be considered in the context of the existing economic background. This debate is taking place in the week immediately after the IMI conference in Killarney which was entitled &ldquo;Opportunity&rdquo;.  At the close of that conference the President of the IMI said that never at any time had there been better opportunities for industrial development, that never was the climate better and that never was there more capital available.  This debate comes also on the trail of the CII and the ESRI survey of the Irish economy which shows that industrialists have never been more optimistic than they are now.  We are talking about industrial development in the context in which the climate for industrial development has been shown to be very favourable.</P>
      <P>The picture which the previous speaker painted does not correspond with reality as industry sees it.  We must also remember that we are talking about an industrial development Bill in the context of 114,000 people who are unemployed and in the context of a population explosion which is unique not just in terms of magnitude. It is unique for this country because the population are staying on the island.  We now have a problem in respect of immigration.  This desirable turnabout cannot be credited either to the previous Government or to this Government.  It is a profound sociological trend for which there is no immediate explanation but for which there must be rapid economic solutions.  This Bill must also be considered in the context of a continuing world recession.  I will not be as sanguine as the previous speaker in dismissing the severity of that recession or its impact upon our economy and others nor am I sanguine about its continuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="369" /> This weekend there will be an economic summit in 10 Downing Street which the nine major industrialised countries in the world will attend and will, in effect, decide the future of the industrialised nations and in the long term will decide whether or not parliamentary democracy as we know it is viable.  This Bill is for an economy which is linked more closely than any other comparable economy with a partner which has suffered from severe depression which has had most deleterious effects on our industrial performance.  It is an economy which has seen a tripling of its unemployment rate and which has seen its inflation rate gallop into double figures.  This has had inevitable spin-off effects for us in terms of industrial development and inflation. This Bill was not brought in in the context of past success which has somehow temporarily disappeared but in the context of past national failure. There has never been a successful industrial development strategy here and there is not yet one in train.  Statistics will bear out the unreality of the picture painted by the previous speaker in respect of the sixties.  During most of the decade he was in office the industrial labour force grew, but it did not grow at such a rate as to permit the total number at work to grow.  We suffered from the indignity that our industrial development was so poor that the number at work in the economy at the end of the decade was precisely the same as it was at the beginning of the decade.</P>
    <P>When we come to consider industrial development in the context of this Bill, it is absolutely futile to do so against the supposition that in the past we had success which has temporarily evaporated for whatever reason one likes to advance.  The reality is that we did not have and never had a successful development policy, whether it was in the 1920s and the early 1930s under the system of free trade, or from the 1930s to the 1950s under protection, or during the 1960s under a process of free trade again during the Lemass era.</P>
    <P>There are a number of features in this Bill I want to comment on <Col N="370" /> specifically.  They are valuable in themselves and conceivably can add up to an important package which will provide part of the answer but not the whole answer.  The Minister said he was introducing a new initiative to encourage first-time entrepreneurs to set up industries.  He said there were not sufficient entrepeneurs in the past and &ldquo;this means that a vital spark is missing from Irish industry&rdquo;. That in itself is a very revealing comment.  It makes the point I have consistently made in an analysis of the Irish economy that the reason why the Irish economy failed where others succeeded was the lack of enterprise from indigenous industry.</P>
    <P>A singular characteristic of Irish industry and of Irish private enterprise which separates us out from others is a complete lack of enterprise.  The Minister made the point that the State has to encourage enterprise to be enterprising.  In other words, the system is built on the theory that, if left alone, people will be enterprising. Yet here we have this Bill before us and the State has to use the taxpayers' money to encourage people to be enterprising and to engage in industrial activity.  The State is not doing this because it sees any value in the products this enterprise may produce.  We do not know what they are.  The State is not doing this because it sees any value in enterprise in itself, but because it wants to encourage the creation of employment.  That is why the State is being empowered through the IDA under this Bill to invest money to create employment.</P>
    <P>We must see that there is a conflict of interests in this Bill from the beginning between what the State actually wants and what is going to happen.  What it wants is employment and what will happen is the attempted stimulation of enterprise which, hopefully, will lead to an increase in employment. The increase in employment becomes merely a secondary by-product of people establishing industries for the primary purpose of making money.  As Ian Morrison said at the IMI last week, as industrialists and business people we are not in business to create employment but to <Col N="371" /> create money.  The State has a different objective.</P>
    <P>The State has the social objective of seeing to it that people have work, and seeing to it that so far as possible they are not unemployed.  The State has a social objective which is completely different from the financial objective of those who run enterprises and decide that they may be set up at the outset.  In so far as the private enterprise system has had any justification at all, it has been that at all times in an economy there is sufficient latent enterprise to employ everybody who wishes to be employed.  Yet, we have here in respect of our own economy a statement by the Minister that in this vital regard that element has been missing from the Irish private enterprise system.  The vital spark has been missing.  The rush of first-time entrepreneurs has not been sufficient to keep the flow of new employment prospects.</P>
    <P>The reality has been that Irish private enterprise unaided by the State has been lamentable in its performance, and has been completely pathetic.  Even aided by the State under the most generous system of grants and aids, and so on, it has only provided about half the jobs we require if we are to provide full employment. There is probably no system of private enterprise anywhere in the world which is so cosseted, so helped, so aided and assisted, as private enterprise here. Yet, it is probable that there is no private enterprise in any economy which has failed so lamentably as it has here.</P>
    <P>If this initiative, which is to be welcomed, will lead to an increase in employment, I most certainly welcome it wholeheartedly, and I do so without reservation.  I also welcome the initiative in the Bill in respect of working capital which, as the Minister rightly points out, has been an inhibition on economic development and growth. The decision to provide loan guarantees and interest subsidies and to expand that to working capital is an imaginative one, and will be welcomed generally by industry and industrialists. The Minister said it is frankly <Col N="372" /> experimental.  My response to that is: good.  It is a pity we have not been a little more experimental in the past, and that we have not identified some of the key inhibitions on the development of enterprise which the Minister quite obviously wishes to see fostered and encouraged.  The lack of facilities for working capital was a serious inhibition in the past, particularly when it was matched by a banking system which was inordinately conservative in respect of industrial development, not in commercial transactions or straightforward trading, but in respect of risk taking in the industrial field.</P>
    <P>One must ask why the financial institutions, and the banks in particular, did not do more in the past.  The Minister asks that question later in his speech on another aspect of industrial development.  It is a question which it is worth while asking in this regard. Why have they not been more forthcoming with Irish capital?  Why have they not been more willing to invest in Irish industry?  Why have they not been willing to partake in the risks which are necessary for growth and development? In that regard the Bank of Ireland are to be commended on their most recent innovation.  They decided to participate at equity level with certain industries provided they do not compete with home manufacture and provided they have a major employment content.</P>
    <P>I hope the initiative in this Bill will stimulate them to extend their scope in that direction and will also encourage the other banks, particularly the other Irish banks, into similar activity. As the Minister said, the essential part of industrial strategy is to strengthen and develop domestic industry.  That is the key point of this Bill and it is something to which I will return later.</P>

      <P>At the moment the situation is that children are being ferried out of that area.  Having regard to the erratic nature of the primary education which they are receiving, will the Minister say if when they get facilities in their own area it might be possible to have a look at the situation and see if there are any compensations that might be offered to them having regard to the unusual and, perhaps, unorthodox fashion of their education?</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister will accept that ordinarily children should be educated in their own parish and pursue the curriculum as happens in other schools.  Some of these children have completed the second year of their course in one school and they spend the third year in another school.  There has been this uncomfortable transport of students from one school to another. I thought that when things settled down the possibility that the children might have suffered in the process would be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>A certain degree of tension is, unfortunately, inseparable from any system of public examinations. My Department have constantly under review methods of improving the educational system with a view to minimising tension in this regard and the present Government have taken practical steps in the matter, for example, the abolition of compulsory Irish from the certificate examinations in May, 1973, and the award of a certificate to every candidate taking part in these examinations as from 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the incidence of tension among young people is higher than before?  I do not believe that the abolition of compulsory Irish from examinations has had any effect.  Would the Minister consider changing the system to fit the student rather than requiring the student to fit the system?  We must have a broader look at the examination system rather than make piecemeal changes.  At present there is a high incidence of tension and drastic steps should be taken in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree entirely with what the Deputy has said. The incidence of tension in our lives is much higher than it was in our parents' lives and this affects students in competition for university places. This year we might see all kinds of tension in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can see from the relaxed look on the faces of people on this side of the House that we have no problem in dealing with it.  I am not sure what the Deputy means by changing the system to fit the pupil rather than the reverse.  I am not aware that the pupils have been changed in any way to fit the system. Of course, there is more competition for university places than was the case 20 years ago and that produces an element of competition which means that students have to work much harder.  Of course, this includes a certain amount of tension.  There have been many suggestions about forms of examinations as a means of assessing <Col N="378" /> students but I am not sure that a better system than the examination system has been brought forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been suggested that continual assessment might be considered but there are tremendous practical difficulties.  As the Deputy knows, in the last few years there have been oral examinations with regard to languages and this may have helped. I should think there is as much tension attached to an oral examination as to a written examination but as speaking may come more naturally to us than writing, perhaps oral examinations are a little easier on students than written examinations.  There is tension attached to any examination or test and there is no point in pretending there is not. It does not matter if it is students, adults or people going for interviews for jobs, there is tension.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider that supervisors going out to examination halls should be asked to set the students at ease and only be concerned with situation where students might copy?  Apart from that they could inform the students on examination day that they do not have to be as disciplined as, unfortunately, the impression is given.  A certain amount of relaxation could be brought into the examination hall without being prejudicial to the spirit of the examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is victimisation?  If the person who applied for permission to get married and left the school had been retained the school could have this teacher up to 31st December, 1977.  Is the Minister aware that a serious situation exists in this area <Col N="381" /> because there is no secondary school and there is a problem in relation to pupils?  Is he aware that as this is a working class area it appears to me that the children in this area are being victimised and undue stress is being put on teachers and pupils?  In view of the fact that the regulation indicates that staff at the same level can be retained until 31st December if there is no replacement would the Minister not consider it reasonable to allow them to appoint an additional teacher for the backward pupils in this school up to 31st December?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of fees charged to their students is a matter for the universities concerned.  In the case of students to whom higher education grants are paid, the fee element in their grants is adjusted in accordance with increases in fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not see it as his duty to make an allocation of money available to the university colleges concerned so that they will not have to charge 16 per cent extra on their fees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The universities concerned already get very generous allocations of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important matter about which nearly all the Deputies in the House have had correspondence.  In view of the fact that the eligibility limit for third level grants has remained static over a period when there has been 100 per cent inflation&mdash;I am not exaggerating &mdash;would the Minister not agree that a large number of students, of relatively badly off parents, who attend the universities are now being charged 16 per cent extra?  Would he not agree that this calls for an extra allocation of money from the Department's funds for third level students?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the allocation of funds for the universities for the current year has already been decided and that the 1978 allocation has not yet been decided.  All those factors will be taken into account in arriving at the amount of money to be given to the universities.  I would point out that the fees in universities in Ireland are roughly, at their very highest, only 50 per cent of what they are in the North of Ireland and England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree on that but would the Minister not agree that eligibility limits do not exist in Britain and Northern Ireland and that there is a far more liberal grant system in those areas?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, would the Minister like to say when he will increase the level of the grants in view of the fact that he has told us that since September last a fundamental review of the whole grants and eligibility limits position has been under way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy pointed out to me in an earlier supplementary, the question deals with fees and not with grants.  However, I do not mind saying that the review to which he refers is almost completed and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement in the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that my question is totally relevant in that there is a mass of the student body who should be in receipt of grants but who are not receiving them and who, consequently, are suffering from the increase in fees? For example, would the Minister not agree that a messenger from the Department of Education having one eligible child, fully qualified academically, could not avail of a grant and would be paying a fee 16 per cent greater this year than last year?  In such circumstances is there not an obligation on the Minister to increase the allocation to the universities in order to alleviate the hardship on such people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The universities can obtain funds only from two sources&mdash; either from the Government or by way of fees.  Because the grants to universities are so high, the fees are kept at what, by comparison with other countries, is a fairly reasonable level.  If we were to increase the grants, we would be channelling more money to a certain section of the community but this might necessitate cutting down on the grants to universities.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Chair would allow me a final supplementary. Would the Minister not face up to the basic question of university fees falling heavily on people who cannot afford them and who, had the eligibility level been raised, would be enjoying grants?  I have no sympathy for those people who have lots of money but I am concerned with this other section and I am asking the Minister whether he would be prepared to consider some relief in this area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for your courtesy and patience but there is a final question I would like to put to the Minister.  Is he not convinced that people whose means are relatively slim are putting their children through university at great sacrifice because of the eligibility limit situation?  Is this not an area which requires subvention?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the Industrial Development Authority that detailed discussions were held with the company several months prior to the closure of the plant.  The company's difficulty arose primarily from a drop in demand for some of their products. Attempts to find other suitable products from within the parent group <Col N="391" /> which could be manufactured in Tallaght were not successful.</P>
    <P>The authority are now endeavouring to secure a replacement project for the factory.  Full details have been circulated to the authority's overseas offices and a number of possible promoters have been approached directly.  No positive proposals have resulted to date.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Department and the appropriate State agencies take all possible steps to prevent the closure of operations where this is practicable.  The bodies stand ready to give all possible assistance to companies in difficulties.  In this connection I would take the general point that firms which foresee problems should approach the appropriate State agency in good time.</P>

If a private firm sets up in a particular place with assistance obviously they must retain, if they are to be effective as private industrialists, some degree of freedom in relation to their activities.  However, as far as Ballinrobe is concerned, I <Col N="394" /> am aware of the need for industrial development in the area.  I can tell the Deputy that employment as at 1st January, 1977, was at 196 in Ballinrobe which compares very favourably with the figure for 1975, which was 165 persons. The figure indicates a significant percentage increase in times when employment is difficult to find.

However, as I indicated, measures are being taken in regard to the use of our natural gas in the production of nitrogenous fertiliser to remedy the situation.  When the Marino Point project comes into operation there will be a net increase in the total number of people employed in the fertiliser industry, even including the loss which resulted from the factory mentioned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that because of the availability to them of natural gas feedstock from the North Sea, some fertiliser manufacturers in Britain at present enjoy a manufacturing cost advantage over their competitors in this country.  Other fertiliser manufacturers in the UK and those in other member states of the EEC are understood to be at a disadvantage for the same reason.  I understand, however, that the favourable price being paid for natural gas for fertiliser manufacture in the United Kingdom is at present under review.</P>
      <P>Apart from any question of the legality within the EEC of restrictive measures of the kind implicit in the Deputy's question, a major consideration in this context is the future development plans of the industry in Ireland.  I would point out that the new NET factory at Marino Point which is due to commence production in 1978 using natural gas from the Kinsale Head well has been planned on the basis of serving not only the home market but export markets in the EEC and elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously one cannot predict exactly what the price would be in 1978 of the fertiliser to be produced at Marino Point, but by virtue of the fact that it is using natural gas and will be a very modern plant, I think we can anticipate that it will be very competitive and certainly competitive with similar products across the water.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the latest position regarding the search for oil and gas in this country's territorial waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 13 companies or groups of companies engaged in exploration activities in Irish waters under exclusive licence and 21 companies or groups of companies who have non-exclusive licences permitting them to carry out general prospecting activities.</P>
      <P>Twenty-eight wells have been completed to date.  The Kinsale Head gas field discovered as a result of drilling by Marathon is at present in course of development.  Drilling by ESSO on the Seven Heads structure produced significant shows of oil and gas and, although the existence of a commercial deposit of petroleum has not been confirmed by operation to date, an evaluation of the potential of the area by the company is continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two wells are at present being drilled, one in the Porcupine Trough off the west coast and the second in <Col N="398" /> the Fastnet Basin to the south west. The company at present drilling in the Porcupine propose to drill a second well there later this summer.  Four other companies intend to drill one well each during this year.  This would bring the total to 7 wells in the current season, four of which will be off the west coast, two in the Fastnet Basin and one in the Celtic Sea.  These are cases where firm plans to drill have been made.  The possibility that other wells might be drilled this year cannot be completely ruled out.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Motor Insurance.</Title>
    <P>35.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has under consideration any remedial measures to eliminate discrimination by insurance companies against applicants seeking cover for motor insurance; and if under EEC regulations it is possible for a more competitive form of motor insurance to cover the Irish market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned to ensure that motor insurers as a body continue to make motor cover available to the general public at competitive rates.  Individual companies must, however, be allowed exercise their commercial judgment in regard to what risks they cover and to charge loadings in accordance with the schemes of loadings submitted to and accepted by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can say that the level of competition on the market over the past 12 months has improved in that the number of complaints of refusal to cover alleged restrictive practices has dropped considerably.  Companies <Col N="399" /> are now being less restrictive in their underwriting than before.</P>
    <P>I have recently received a report of the Examiner of Restrictive Practices on the extent of competition on the motor insurance market and this report is being examined.  The Motor Premiums Advisory Committee is engaged on a long-term statistical exercise to establish a basic premium and appropriateness of loadings.  The declined cases agreement between motor insurers which provides that cover will be provided except in cases where it would not be in the public interest to do so is being reviewed and a more binding agreement is expected to be concluded shortly.</P>
    <P>I am not quite clear what the Deputy has in mind about the bearing of EEC regulations upon the competitiveness of motor insurance, but the opening of our non-life insurance market in accordance with EEC rules has already resulted in the licensing of six new companies to do motor insurance and I expect that in due course there will be further entrants to the market, thus improving the competitive situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that there is grave dissatisfaction in the area of motor insurance?  Is he further aware that insurance companies have been refusing to insure many people who have been convicted and that the appeals machinery is completely unsatisfactory? Would he ensure that once a person has been convicted and pays a penalty at least he will not be deprived of his livelihood by the insurance company? Will the Parliamentary Secretary ensure that such person will not be denied the right to re-insure even at an increased premium as some insurance companies have been refusing to insure in recent times?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the appeals machinery is concerned I have already indicated that I am seeking recommendation with regard to undesirable risks in the interests of all parties by particular persons seeking motor insurance. As far as grave dissatisfaction is concerned, there are still problems in the motor insurance market.  A good index of the extent of those problems <Col N="400" /> is the number of complaints received and indications are that the number has fallen very considerably and people are obtaining insurance much more readily now than was the case in the past.  This is the result of more active competition in motor insurance than existed hitherto.</P>
      <P>As far as the individual risks mentioned by the Deputy are concerned, particularly in the case of people who have been convicted, one must realise that if a person is such a bad risk that the company would find it impossible to consider covering him, that the risk that they would have to pay out would be so great that it would not be worth their while covering him, in these very extreme cases they must have ultimately the right to refuse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that people have been blackballed in this city by insurance companies and are now unable to obtain insurance cover?  Would he not agree that the loading system that sometimes appears to victimise people is unrealistic and needs to be modified and standardised realistically in relation to insurance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of anybody being blackballed in the sense used by the Deputy but if he will give me the names of the people I will have the matter looked into and I will look into any individual cases where he feels that the loadings are not related to the risk.  I have already been able to secure information for individuals.</P>

      <P>Arising from representations in March of this year, I learned that one firm had imported fertilisers packed in bags bearing the firm's name, without a complete indication of the country of origin.  The matter is still being investigated in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners.

      <P>I can give the Deputy some indication of the problem from my indication to him that it is not as simple as all that.  The problem is to an extent that goods were marked as made in Ireland when, in fact, they were made in Northern Ireland.  Most people would accept that goods made in Northern Ireland are made in Ireland but this is the matter which is being argued at the moment.  There may be other aspects of the problem.  I do not wish to go into it in great detail.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if his attention has been drawn to a newspaper report (details supplied) of a British proposal which would ensure the conveyancing of houses quickly and cheaply while still retaining all necessary safeguards; and if he will consider the adoption of a similar proposal in this country.</P>

      <P>The British proposal referred to in the report is not an official proposal but one that apparently has been submitted by an individual solicitor for the consideration of a recently established Royal Commission on Legal Services. No doubt the Commission's report in due course will be of interest to us though, of course, there are differences in the laws of the two countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country, the National Prices Commission in their Occasional Paper No. 22, &ldquo;Solicitors' Remuneration in Ireland&rdquo;, published last December, recommended to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the <Col N="407" /> monopoly held by the legal profession on conveyancing should be referred to the Examiner of Restrictive Practices and Restrictive Practices Commission.

      <P>To speak of unqualified clerks is not to set the position accurately.  They may be unqualified in the sense that they have not been admitted as solicitors but they would be qualified in knowledge to deal with conveyancing matters.  There would be no analogy between examining the title and applying for the documents referred to by the Deputy.  While the work of conveyancing may have been done by a clerk, it would be done under the supervision of a solicitor who would have experience of conveyancing work.</P>

If an ordinary person were to attempt to investigate a title the resultant loss might be considerably more than the fee which would be paid to the legal people involved. In relation to the monopoly of the legal profession in conveyancing matters, this is under investigation by the Minister for Industry and Commerce with a view to referring it to the Examiner of Restrictive Practices as suggested by the National Prices Commission <Col N="408" /> following a report into solicitors' remuneration, commissioned by the commission.</P>

    <Title>Industrial Development Bill, 1976: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>When concluding I quoted a sentence from the Minister's speech which I regarded as being at the heart of the Bill.  The Minister said that it is an essential part of our industrial strategy to strengthen and develop our existing domestic industry.  That is a very unnecessary statement.  In the past the IDA have been criticised for fostering foreign enterprise virtually to the exclusion of domestic enterprise and people like myself have criticised Irish private enterprise for being singularly lacking in enterprise.  The Minister should have said that the central part of our industrial strategy is to strengthen and develop our existing domestic industry.  The word &ldquo;essential&rdquo; as used by the Minister is an apology for past policy and is an admission that private enterprise has lamentably failed in the past and is not really regarded as providing the major portion of our job requirements in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also referred to sectoral restructuring.  Irish industry generally is open to the severest criticism in this regard.  The previous speaker, the former member of the Fianna Fáil Cabinet which led us into Europe and opened up the Irish economy, which had been fostered behind tariff walls, to international free trade said that they had been given all sorts of information about the effects of free trade in EEC conditions.  The CIO reports during the early and mid-sixties spelt out in graphic detail the sectoral restructuring which was necessary if certain Irish industries were to be protected from the full severity of free trade.  Free trade was first introduced under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement as a deliberate prelude to the EEC.  Free trade was fully <Col N="414" /> introduced on our entry into the EEC. Those reports went unheeded and were disparaged and Irish management paid the penalty for that by being made virtually extinct in many cases, and Irish workers pay for it through continuing redundancies.  Traditional industries, mainly the textile industry, the clothing and footwear industries have been affected.  The restructuring which was necessary, and which would have been undertaken by aggressive and far-sighted management, even without the aid of CIO reports and Government incentives did not take place, because management was to a great extent introspective.</P>
    <P>Many middle-aged people, with growing families, now on the dole queues can thank shortsighted management for their present position. Sectoral restructuring is essential if an economy is to adapt to changing conditions. Theoretically, it was supposed to happen under market forces, but that does not always occur.  Under market forces existing industries can disappear and a product will be supplied from outside the economy.  We are talking about the continuation of the supply of a product by Irish workers and the so-called impetus of the market does not automatically take place.  It requires the outside intervention of an agency such as the State to ensure that that happens.  This is being provided for under this Bill. There is now assistance for amalgamations and for acquisitions by way of loan guarantee and interest subsidy for the capital required.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that it is hoped that this Bill will encourage the financial institutions to be more forthcoming in financing industrial restructuring.  This is a quiet, but explicit criticism of Irish financial institutions which have been lacking in the provision of working capital for new enterprises, and in providing necessary finance for the restructuring of existing industry.  The financial institutions were as shortsighted as Irish industry in not foreseeing what would happen.  I hope the Minister's quiet admonition will be taken for what it is.  It should be a stern warning to Irish financial institutions that <Col N="415" /> they must be more involved, more aggressive and more far-sighted in relation to industrial restructuring.  They cannot be passive in a situation where the necessary changes do not take place rapidly enough, if we are to maintain our market position.  The financial institutions set themselves up as the guardians of the whole system and they are open to very severe criticism for having failed in the role which they so generously gave themselves.</P>
    <P>This Bill makes provision for specific investment in research and development and in product development. The Minister referred to the fact that since 1970, 350 projects have been approved.  The Minister also referred to the fact that <i>per capita</i> investment is low in research and development, by European standards.  The grant limit is being increased from £15,000 to £50,000.  That is not an inordinate amount of money when one thinks of the cost of highly qualified researchers and the equipment they very often use.</P>
    <P>It is indicative of the lack of innovation in Irish industry and its lack of enterprise that our investment in R and D should be so low.  You can judge the health of various economies and even individual companies by, in the case of an economy looking at the amount of GNP devoted to R and D and, in the case of a company, the amount of total sales allocated to R and D.  In the middle 1950s the number of scientists engaged in research and development here could literally be counted on one hand.  Even today the total scientific labour force engaged in research and development is lamentably low, and we have slow economic growth because of slow industrial growth.</P>
    <P>The Bill also makes provision for equity participation by the IDA in industrial projects with a new limit of up to £1 million.  It makes provision, too, for joint ventures.  Both of these provisions are to be supported and welcomed and not least by members of my party who might be expected to have some ideological objections to such activity by the IDA.  I have none whatsoever.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="416" /> A very welcome innovation in the Bill is the establishment of project identification for import substitution. The Minister made the point that, in the past 18 months, the IDA went to about 400 Irish firms with specific propositions for import substitution. That is a lamentable commentary on the lack of enterprise by Irish industry. The IDA, who are not a moneymaking operation and whose primary aim is the creation of employment for social purposes, had to go to Irish companies in the past 18 months with 400 specific propositions for import substitution.</P>
    <P>I often think if we spent as much time, energy and money on import substitution as we spent on export development we would be in a far healthier position.  It was economic stupidity on the one hand to seek to develop export markets while, on the other hand, permitting our own domestic markets to be captured and eroded by competing imports.  As it was opened up progressively, the domestic market became the captive of foreign companies and our own companies originally supplying the market were swept away without any policy of keeping them in business. This project identification unit inside the IDA is to be welcomed in the sense that at least it will provide Irish industry with an element of enterprise which that structure has been lacking in itself up to now.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the second point I want to make in a brief general context, that is, a national development corporation, a proposition which has been put forward by members of my party from time to time and to which the Taoiseach referred at the IMI conference last Saturday in Killarney.  It cannot be seen outside the context of planning.  I do not intend to go into planning in any great depth or detail now except to say the words of Professor Louden Ryan at the end of the IMI conference are worthy of note.  He said everybody at the IMI conference was talking about the necessity for planning but nobody had defined what he meant by planning. It reminded me of Edward, Prince of Wales, in 1890 saying: &ldquo;We <Col N="417" /> are all socialists now.&rdquo;  That is easy to say if one does not give a precise definition of what is meant by a socialist. We could use his phrase and say we are all planners now, provided nobody asks too accurately what is meant by planning.  The Opposition, the IMI, the IFA, the financial institutions and the trade union movement are all in favour of planning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can all reach agreement on the necessity for planning. When we would begin to fall out and begin to disagree is when we define what is meant by planning. What I meant by planning is not an up-to-date or glossier version of programming which went under the name of planning when Fianna Fáil were in power.  By planning I mean the conscious control and direction of investment by the State.  Planning without a political context is meaningless. Planning is not the creation of a business environment in which it is easier to make a profit, which is what the IMI mean by planning.  It is quite different.  It is the conscious direction of the economy towards the achievement of stated goals and objectives and, in our case, the stated goal and objective must be achievement of full employment within the shortest possible period of time.  That is what is meant by planning in the context in which the word is used by members of this party.  It is quite different from what is meant by others.</P>
      <P>I always listen with great suspicion when I hear panegyrics about planning coming from the Opposition because really what they mean is nothing more than the discredited and discarded attempts at programming which characterised their period in office and which ended in the disappearance of the Third Programme which went down the plughole in 1970.  It is ludicrous for members of the party opposite to demand planning now in conditions of economic recession and uncertainty when they threw out the window the Third Programme in conditions far less hazardous than those which currently face us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="418" /> Within the context of planning I have made the point that there is a great necessity, as a complement to this Bill, for the establishment of a national development corporation.  I do not see it as in any way supplanting the role of the IDA, but rather as complementing it.  Before Question Time I made the point that, even with the greatest possible expansion of industry as a result of this Bill, even with the most propitious external circumstances in the world economy, we cannot expect to meet more than half of the job requirements in the future.  On the other hand, we do not expect, nor could we possibly tolerate, that those who do not get work should emigrate.  Where are the missing jobs for the other half to come from?  I have suggested, as have others, that they must come from an enhanced and developed State sector, specifically through the agency of a national development corporation.</P>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that I do not see this in any way being hostile or inimical, as Deputy Brennan suggested, to private enterprise. I have stated my views quite clearly in other places, and I stated them recently to the IMI who will shortly be publishing my remarks at their chief executives' forum.  The national situation in relation to unemployment and the population generally is so serious that this is not a time for ideological confrontation.  It is a time when the only question we should ask of any enterprise, of any proposition, of any proposal, is: will it provide work?  Will it provide jobs?  If the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, let us do it.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach said he had no ideological prejudice one way or the other he was voicing a pragmatic attitude. I have the same pragmatic attitude towards private enterprise.  If it will provide employment, I have no ideological prejudice against it at the moment.  It will not provide all of those who are seeking work with work and, therefore, we have to have something else.</P>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear, too, that in the past the public sector has been confined to two roles, that of <Col N="419" /> providing public utilities where a private monopoly would be socially dangerous such as the ESB, and that of providing services or developing resources which private enterprise failed to promote on grounds of unprofitability, such as Bord na Móna. There has never been a coherent statement on the State's role in industrial development.  That has been a great lacuna in our industrial development process.  Neither am I proposing that the national development corporation should be a hold-all for lame ducks; in other words, that for every private enterprise that was about to go under there was a refuge where it could run, that somebody would keep it going no matter how unprofitable it might be.  I do not mean that either and I do not want the analogy to be made with certain actions of the British Labour Government in attempting to shore up some obviously unprofitable and unviable enterprises.  I do not propose a rubbish dump for lame ducks.  I am proposing the creation of a State holding company analogous to that of Sweden which controls a group of State companies accounting for about 5 per cent of manufacturing output.  It is in a diverse range of technology, from the more traditional to the most advanced, with emphasis on heavy industry.  In advocating a State development corporation to act as a co-ordinating holding company nobody is putting forward an unproven solution but a model which already exists in Europe's most advanced economy.</P>
    <P>The proposition is not new in this country.  Since 1969 at least it has been put forward by the Labour Party in their policy documents.  It would be in the best interests of the Irish economy to establish this corporation very rapidly, particularly in the context of the development of our natural resources, which is referred to in the closing stages of the Minister's speech. I do not believe it would be in the best interests of the Irish economy if separate companies were set up, for instance, to manage a State smelter as is envisaged or, ultimately, a State oil company because I would fear the power, often the negative power, of <Col N="420" /> self-contained industrial empires even where they are State companies.</P>
    <P>I believe that State companies in minerals, metals, metal manufacturing and fabrication, oil, gas and petrochemicals&mdash;all of which are possible &mdash;are potentially gigantic in terms of our past and present industrial experience. They could grow disproportionately large in relation to the rest of the economy.  They could be virtually uncontrollable and unaccountable to anybody, including the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>For that reason there would be problems of sub-optimisation.  In other words, these companies would put their own objectives above national objectives and, therefore, they would not operate as effectively as one would wish from a national point of view.  At the moment there is a serious lack of co-ordination and co-operation between semi-State companies, and this is lamentable in an unemployment situation.  It is also true that none of those companies has a fiat given to them by the Government to develop in such a way as to create the maximum amount of employment in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I am firmly of the conviction that we should have a State development corporation or a national development corporation to act as a holding company with wholly-owned State companies, fully accountable, and with equity capital in joint ventures covering the entire economy except for public utilities such as transport, power and telecommunications. I do not envisage that this proposition will be accepted without opposition. Clearly there is much opposition to this concept, but unless something radical is done in terms of innovation and industrial development we will continue to have persistently high levels of unemployment that will be socially unacceptable.  In certain circumstances they could produce such stress that they would place in question the institutions of the State.  I do not think that is too heightened a way to paint the prospect that could face us.</P>
    <P>For that reason I advocate as a <Col N="421" /> complement to this Bill a new departure in State industrial development policy by the freeing for the first time of the entire State sector from the shackles placed on it by private enterprise ideology.  This has prevented it from going out to the market-place and competing where it was possible to do so, very often against companies masquerading under an Irish name, and sometimes in the Irish language, which were nothing more than foreign subsidiaries acting at the behest of companies and boards elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I hope the very nature of our population problem will cause many people who have an ideological objection to the State to look in a new fashion at the State's role in industrial development. In this Bill we are accepting that major State involvement is necessary in private enterprise if we are to meet the social goal of full employment. Under this Bill every possible aid is being given to private enterprise, from capital subsidies, interest, training, project identification. Behind the Bill there is a panoply of State agencies who offer additional help and support.  In addition, we should say that the State itself should be involved directly in manufacturing or in services wherever there is an opportunity to do so and it should not be restricted on ideological grounds. The great necessity now is for employment-generating opportunities.  We are faced with the situation where even on the basis of the best years of this economy we only provided half of what we will require in terms of jobs each year for the next decade.  This will be the problem of whatever Government are in office.  It will be in times when the world economy will be far less buoyant than it was during the 1960s and at the beginning of the 1970s.  It is questionable whether the world economy will ever return to that level of performance.  Up to 1973 we went through 25 years of world buoyancy in international trade and I do not think that will be repeated.</P>
    <P>The total compass of this Bill is to be welcomed.  Taken together the individual components add up to a meaningful package and I should <Col N="422" /> think they will answer most of the requirements of Irish and foreign industry in terms of expansion of development. It is an intelligent and imaginative Bill and in some instances it is courageous.  To quote the Minister &ldquo;in one area it is frankly experimental&rdquo;. We need to experiment and we need the courage to stand over experiments that fail having regard to our need for employment.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, I hope an industrial development Bill will be introduced in this House establishing a national development corporation which will enfranchise the State's sector to engage in industrial development. In that case we may hold out the prospect that within a not too unreasonable period we will be able to achieve full employment for the first time.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the previous speaker one feels the oracle has spoken.  Nothing sickens me to my stomach more than listening to Deputy Halligan speaking on the economy.  He chastises the Fianna Fáil Party because of their economic plans which he said did not work. This shows how little he knows about the recent history of Fianna Fáil plans.</P>
      <P>This was the Government who were going to set up the Department of Economic Planning.  They have not produced an economic plan in over four years.  I am very worried about the IMI when I think of Deputy Halligan addressing them.  I wonder what kind of people they are because anybody who has any knowledge of business or economics knows very well that Deputy Halligan does not know one end from the other.  It makes me sick listening to those unctuous platitudes from Deputy Halligan.  The country is fed up listening to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy.  I hope he apologises to the nation as well, as he makes them pretty sick too.  The <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i> exceeded its targets and was a great success.  The second <Col N="423" /> programme reached all its targets.  The third programme was not a fiasco. Some of the targets, although not all, were reached.  At least it was a plan and was something by which we could measure.  The Government have not even brought out a census.  They are afraid to do this.  They talk about planning with State development boards.  The people are concerned about getting jobs.  The Government, through their taxation policy, have driven more people out of work than any other Government in the history of the State.</P>
      <P>I welcome certain sections of the Bill particularly the one which seeks to encourage first-time entrepreneurs.  I attended a meeting yesterday evening of the Catholic Youth Council, who cater for over 200,000 young people in the city of Dublin, County Dublin and part of Kildare and Wicklow.  They are very anxious to get small industrial schemes and craft industries in order to train young persons who are out of work. They have had meetings with the IDA but apparently because they have no capital to put into those schemes they cannot be considered for a grant.  I hope the Minister will get the IDA to give a small grant to this body to encourage them to get young people to work.</P>
      <P>The Catholic Youth Council would like to get a scheme going throughout the 200 clubs they have, which are very rarely in use in the daytime, to train young persons in certain skills. A grant should be available from the IDA for such work.  Those people would be trained for a certain period in certain skills and would then go on their own and develop the skills they had learned.  This matter should be taken up with the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I like the term &ldquo;first-time entrepreneurs&rdquo;. Entrepreneurs is a good word but it is a dirty word in the thinking of Deputy Halligan and other people like him.  If it were not for entrepreneurs there would be no employment for people.  We must encourage young people to be successful and to create employment for others.  I have great praise for people who have <Col N="424" /> made the big time.  There are people who have the urge to build an empire and to create something.  Recently on television we got an insight into the Smurfit Group and how they have grown over the years.  Here are entrepreneurs who have created many jobs for our people.  We want more people like that.  We want to see incentives given to people.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the IDA be very concerned about the management of any industry starting up.  It is important that the money that belongs to the taxpayer does not go down the drain.  They should, however, encourage bodies such as the Catholic Youth Council.  When they come along with a proposal to set up a workshop in a particular place and they have a number of people willing to teach skills to people, whether it is manufacturing souvenirs, clothing items or various other things, they should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>A great amount of work needs to be done.  There are 200 clubs in Dublin. If 150 of them were able to avail of a scheme from the IDA and train two or three young people this would be a tremendous boost.  The IDA should encourage this.  They should set up a special section dealing with small cottage industries and have consultations with some youth bodies to see what can be done.  They should, in co-operation with AnCO, get to work on schemes to enable people to help themselves.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the Bill I want to refer to.  I refer particularly to what the Minister said in relation to the enterprise development programme complimenting the small industries programme.  What small industries will this help?  Will the kind of scheme I have outlined be included in this?  Something good might be produced if the IDA would look at this.  I was puzzled when the Minister said that the authority's power of loan guarantee and interest subsidy would be extended to working capital borrowed for such ventures.  He then stated:</P>
    <P>This type of scheme is new in this country and is frankly experimental, <Col N="425" /> but the indications for its success are good and I have every confidence that it will become a useful generator of new industrial activity.</P>
    <P>He later stated:</P>
    <P>For some sectors re-equipment alone is not the answer, there is also a need for re-organisation and restructuring. The proposal in the Bill concerning sectoral restructuring is designed to meet this need which has been accentuated by the recession.</P>
    <P>We have yet to see evidence that the recession is now over according to the Minister for Finance.  This looks very like a blueprint of a policy statement which is coming out, possibly for an election, about what the Government intend to do.  It is full of promise but there is no action.  The people are sick listening to the promises the Government have been making while the economy has been deteriorating.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of his speech the Parliamentary Secretary referred to our performance in 1976 as being remarkably encouraging.  He told us that manufacturing output increased by more than 11 per cent while the volume of manufactured exports increased by about 20 per cent compared with 1975.  However, since 1975 showed the lowest performance for many years it will be seen that the comparison was with a year in which there was a gigantic drop in output.</P>
    <P>One of the major factors in the closing down of industry, in industrialists losing the will to operate, was the cost of fuel.  It is to be noted that while the increases imposed by the Arabs since 1973 on a gallon of petrol have amounted to 12p, the Minister for Finance during that time has applied increases amounting to 35p per gallon or approximately three times the increase applied by the Arab countries.  The Government are to blame for what is the worst recession in any country in Europe and this in a country which is supposed to have stable Government.</P>
    <P>I trust that the IDA will use the least amount possible of red tape and will give every encouragement, particularly <Col N="426" /> to small industries and voluntary organisations, to create employment for young people.  There is a big problem in regard to finding work for school leavers.  We must encourage voluntary bodies to help in solving this problem and the IDA, in close co-operation with AnCO should lend their expertise in solving the problem and creating an environment in which there is an incentive to expand industries.</P>

      <P>Every encouragement should be given by this House to any effort made towards providing job opportunities and relieving pressures on employers in regard to the retention of staff.  It is late in the day that the Government have begun to take stock of the high unemployment figures.  Industry, as a result of sabotage by the Government, has been allowed to run down considerably so that we now have what is perhaps the highest level of unemployment ever.  In addition to the 118,000 already on the live register account must be taken of the 40,000 school leavers who will be coming into the live register.  When a situation is allowed to deteriorate to this extent, it is very difficult to redress it.  In the past the IDA have done wonderful work in very difficult circumstances. Nobody wishes to detract from their success but it must be a severe blow to them to find that while they have been endeavouring to create employment, to attract foreign industrialists, the Government, by various other measures, have been stifling growth and creating a situation that destroys incentive.  The policies of the Minister for Finance and his efforts to scrape every pot in order to obtain more tax, have interfered with the development and progress of industry. The IDA have had to contend with a situation in which the Government were wrecking Irish industry.  However, this situation is in keeping with what occurred during the terms of office of previous Coalitions.</P>

      <P>It is all right to talk of incentives but the practical situation is another matter.  There is a question about whether the moneys we are talking about will ever be made available since Bills of this nature can be merely window dressing.  As Deputy Briscoe stated, we are being presented with this Bill on the eve of a general election and when, perhaps, there are as many as 160,000 people out of work.  Have the Government any excuse for not taking remedial measures during the past three years to deal with the situation?  Why was assistance not given to those people who wished to develop either small industries or industries of the type referred to in the Bill?  Had a proper industrial environment been maintained many of the people now out of work could be employed gainfully.  We hear of how such schemes as the free education scheme and the free health service operate but what is the reality?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am relating my remarks to the Bill.  I treat with suspicion everything we have been told time and time again by Ministers.  We <Col N="428" /> were told of the great health scheme and other schemes that were coming, but they never came.  They all got bogged down and the only result was an increase in the human misery all too obvious throughout the working-class constituency I represent, a constituency with the highest unemployment rate in the country, twice the national average.  It is our duty to speak out here loud and clear about the conditions that exist.  A survey carried out in this area showed that 25 per cent of those who left school in 1969 were still unemployed.  In the same survey 24 per cent of the parents were unemployed.  That is a serious situation, one requiring more extensive remedial measures than are proposed in this Bill.</P>
      <P>We do not want a whitewashing operation.  We want something that will take the people off the dole queues.  Recently the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare told us there are 33,000 in the dole queues in Dublin alone.  In reply to two questions I tabled to the Taoiseach he did not know the number of school leavers unemployed in a particular area and he did not know the number unemployed in Dublin as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Any debate on industrial development must relate to the existing situation.  This Bill is in relief of the existing situation and, in order to assess the situation, we must know exactly what the situation is. Bills of this nature are not enough. We want active service, not lip service. We must ensure that people are provided with the opportunities to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objectives of the Bill are to introduce two new incentives to encourage new enterprises and to facilitate sectoral restructuring as well as providing additional technical assistance to developing countries.  AnCO and other agencies have trained and retrained personnel.  Some are undergoing <Col N="429" /> refresher course after refresher course because there are no job opportunities available.  There are no opportunities because of the Government's callous neglect of the industrial situation. This Bill does not go far enough. It will not create the necessary jobs. This Government have trained the greatest number ever to stand in the dole queues.  What is needed is a comprehensive look at the situation and concrete action to redress the situation. We may take some people off the dole queues by sending them to third countries requiring technical assistance.</P>
    <P>New enterprises will only come about if the proper climate is created. That climate will not be there if there is a lack of confidence.  If that climate is not there industrialists will not invest. There are industrialists who would be willing to invest if they knew there was a climate of confidence in the country.  I believe a change of Government would bring that about and we would find industrialists only too willing to avail of the facilities we have.  I hope that time will not be long in coming.</P>
    <P>The restructuring of industries is important.  Far too many have been allowed to run down.  Those willing to build up industry must be assisted.  We know the problems and the pressure points.  Steps must be taken to save existing industries which are in danger of running down.  It is the aim of this Bill to provide an additional function to the IDA concerning technical assistance to developing countries.  We can supply such assistance because we have the trained personnel.  People must be given every opportunity to perfect their technical knowledge and ability so that they can examine the technological advancement and technical development problems and can bring back here, as many have done in the past, that expertise that will enable our industries to develop.</P>
    <P>While we have people with such expertise on the labour exchanges here let us give them an opportunity to use their knowledge at the earliest possible moment.  There is reference here to the native entrepreneurs who have not been coming forward in sufficient numbers. The Government know full well why <Col N="430" /> these people have not been coming forward.  They have no faith in the Government, who have practised deception and presented misleading policies over the years.  Members of my party know that, given the right conditions, many such people would be only too willing to assist in the development of industry.</P>
    <P>If such development is to take place it can only be done on the basis of full and factual information.  That type of information can only be accumulated by a scientific survey such as a census. The Government have not allowed a census to take place.  Therefore it is impossible for people to get a comprehensive picture on which to make plans for the future.  The Government must be condemned for their failure on this score.  Such failure deprives the IDA and other people involved in industry of an opportunity of assessing the situation fully and factually.  The position may be so bad that the Government do not want them to know, and neither do they want the Opposition to know.  It is obvious that from time to time the Government have concealed much information which people would require if they were to participate in building up this ailing economy of ours which has been run down as a result of callous neglect first, because of the financial outlook of the Government, then because of the Cabinet battles that have taken place between Ministers in relation to various problems. It would appear that employment and industrial development were a low priority in the minds of many of the Ministers.</P>

      <P>The whole base of Government policy involves collective responsibility.  Far too often a Minister introduces a Bill in this House and another Minister condemns it outside.

This is part and parcel of industrial development, part and parcel of the vital spark that is missing from Irish industry.  We want to assess the situation now to find out exactly what this Bill means, on what authority it has been presented to the House.  We have spent long hours debating measures that have come before this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair will not permit the Deputy to go further on that line.  We are not having a general debate.  The Chair has asked the Deputy on at least three occasions to keep to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that he would like to discuss the objectives of the Bill and then make some comments on industrial development generally.  If Ministers are permitted to make such comments generally, the same opportunity should be afforded to members of the Opposition. One must take into consideration all the factors that surround industrial development, the small and large industries, the cottage industries that Deputy Briscoe spoke about, and all the factors relating to the development and the downfall of industries.  It is only when we take all these factors into consideration that we can really assess the merits of this Bill.  The Minister says that many Irish people both <Col N="432" /> in this country and overseas have the qualifications and experience and the ideas to make successful industrialists. This is quite true.  They are there in their thousands and I am quite sure that from time to time these people will return, but only when there is a change of Government, and again that may not be too long in coming.  These Irish people have come and gone.  They have been unable to obtain the type of information that is required in order to make a long-term decision to commit their capital, their ideas or their expertise to a new venture.</P>
      <P>In entering into a new venture one must be absolutely satisfied, and I am sure the IDA are making every effort, despite the circumstances under which they operate, to provide information on the assessment of job opportunities, expertise and qualifications.  These are factors.  The labour pool is a factor. Can we have satisfactory statistics?  If we have will this survey assist this Bill or help these people to make up their minds?  If it does the labour survey will have done a good job, and so will the Bill.  People who have come here tell us that they are unable to obtain the type of information they require, whether it be from the Ordnance Survey, the Department of Labour or the Manpower Service. Statistics were presented in this House no later than yesterday, selected statistics which give an erroneous impression. I would not like to see statistics being presented that are not factual and do not give the full picture.  I would not like to see people who have the expertise and necessary finance being &ldquo;conned&rdquo; into coming here and then finding collapse after collapse of industry here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about new initiatives to help that part of the financial package for which the first-time entrepreneur cannot supply on his or her own.  Some type of financial assistance is absolutely necessary and the greater the problem the Government create the greater the incentives will have to be.  With a change of Government tomorrow we would not have to alter any structure and people would come here with expertise and qualifications. A greater effort could be made <Col N="433" /> to assist smaller industries.  Substantial efforts have been made in the past, many of them successful and the results are evident at the moment.  Great credit is due to people who started in a small way, and to the IDA for their efforts in stimulating and assisting them.  How many more industries might be created if we had the proper climate?  We would not have 150,000 people in the dole queues if we had the proper direction and proper ministerial confidence.</P>
    <P>For the last few months I have not seen the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I understand he is somewhere now talking about all the jobs that will be available in the near future.  We are approaching a general election and we will hear many statements of this type between now and the general election.  We heard them before the last one.  The Minister has a job to do at home because of the very serious situation which exists here in relation to industrial development. There are other agencies competent to do the job abroad without the assistance of the Minister.  His presence would hinder rather than assist the type of development we all hope to achieve. The personnel in the agencies we have are competent and have done their job in the past wisely and well and they have attracted to this country many large industries and in the future they will, without the assistance of the Minister, attract more industry.  When a Minister such as the present Minister goes abroad, people listening to him must be concerned as to whether he is speaking on his own behalf or on behalf of his Government.  Many people have been &ldquo;conned&rdquo; into believing that some policies were about to be perfected and put into operation, only to find that the Minister who introduced them had reneged on his promises, and so had the Government.  This is not the type of Government to which people will respond in any measure in the future.</P>
    <P>However creditable this Bill may be, however worthy it may look, it must be treated with suspicion when it is introduced in this way at this time when the Government have so ruthlessly sabotaged the industrial development of this State over the years.  Industrial <Col N="434" /> sabotage is nothing new.  It has taken place in the past and probably will in the future.  If we are merely going to replace one industry with another that is not good enough. We must increase the number of industries and of job opportunities and we must ensure a future for our children and their children and we must see that this is done effectively.</P>
    <P>This Bill will not achieve what is required.  It will not shorten dole queues.  It may assist some people but there is nothing in it revolutionary enough to meet the situation that has been allowed to creep up on us over the last few years.  This Government have constantly blamed one source or another.  When they do not blame Fianna Fáil for their mishaps they blame the Arabs.  The truth is that the people will have confidence in us.  The great industries that were built up here were built up under Fianna Fáil over the years and we look forward to the day when we can develop even greater industries.  We hope that Governments if they change in the future will not sabotage industry as was done in the past.  Industrial sabotage hits at the heart of the nation, at the purse of the housewife and at the pocket of the working man.  The working men know all too well the tragedy that has been inflicted upon us.</P>
    <P>This Bill is being read the Second Time.  As it reaches Committee Stage we will have more to say in relation to the aids necessary for an ailing industry. They are necessary to ensure attraction of new enterprise.  It is sad to think that so many industrialists have indicated their desire to come here and for one reason or another they have been pushed out into the wilderness.  Not so long ago a major chemical industry wished to locate here and because of lack of support from the Minister and the Government that industry was allowed to leave after much development work had taken place.  Members of the IDA when they have succeeded in capturing giant chemical industries which would create a large volume of employment, must become depressed when they see them drifting away from this country <Col N="435" /> after the necessary arrangements had been made for their establishment.</P>
    <P>What is required is some link-up between the trade unions, who must think in realistic terms, and the industrialists who are endeavouring to develop here.  Some industrialists may wish to develop in a way in which they have been trained and in which their techniques can be developed, different though they may be from ours.  There must be a period when they can attune themselves to our way of thinking and our structure within the trade unions. The Government have responsibility to ensure that trade union obstacles are not responsible for impeding industrial development.  Trade unions have in some cases been responsible for the closing down of industries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be an understanding between industrialists and trade unions so as to have industrial peace.  This lack of understanding between industrialists and trade unions has caused a lot of the trouble.  There must be a free flow of information between trade unions and prospective industrial developers so as to ensure that impediments will not arise at a later stage.  Industrial development will take place if people have confidence. We have trained personnel waiting to cope with any industrial development set up here if the money is available to set up industry.  Many Irish people who live abroad are available to set up investments here.  I hope that in the not-too-distant future they will be able to realise their ambitions and set up small or large industries here.  One of the vital factors in the development of industry is statistics so that long term plans can be made.  No long term plans can be made in this country because effective statistics are not available. The Government by not having a census have effectively sabotaged future job opportunities for many of the young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="436" /> In my area and elsewhere there are industrial estates where advance factories are left idle for two or three years.  This situation must be examined to find out why advance factories are left idle for so long.  There must be something wrong when the finance is available, when the people are available and the factories are available but are not put into action.  Every day we see goods being sold which could be manufactured here.  The Minister should do something to enable these factories to be put into production.  If the Minister has a number of industrialists abroad who would be willing to come here, new jobs could be created within a very short time.  The Minister has been making election speeches abroad.  He should come home and examine the plight of Irish workers who are crying out for jobs. The IDA and the other institutions which seek industrialists abroad can do that effectively, but the Minister's job is at home where many redundancies that could have been avoided, if suitable action had been taken, have taken place.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably only impede progress abroad.  I hope that the time will come when we will have suitable people in power who will develop a climate of confidence that will attract industries without new incentives to come here to develop industry and facilitate the production of job opportunities that are not here at present.  I hope that the situation in Dublin will be improved by a financial injection that will stimulate employment so as to employ some of the unemployed.  We also need job opportunities for the young people who will be leaving school during the next few months.</P>

      <P>One of the contribution conditions to be satisfied in order to qualify for maternity grant is that not less than 26 employment contributions have been paid or credited in either of the two contribution years preceding the date of the confinement which in this case were the years 1975 and 1976.  As this condition was not satisfied on the insurance of the claimant's husband a maternity grant is not payable on his insurance.  The claimant's husband was employed in the years in question but employment contributions were not paid and my Department are taking action to secure payment of the outstanding contributions from his employer. As, however, these contributions were not paid at the due dates and as the employee was partly responsible for this by neglecting to present an insurance card to his employer, they are not reckonable for the purpose of any claim arising before the date on which the contributions are paid.</P>
