      <P>The enactment of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1976, which became law following the passing of this Bill by the Seanad necessitates the amendment of the collective citation of the Fisheries Acts where it occurs in sections 1 and 3 of the Bill.

      <P>Amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 7 are consequential on amendment No. 3 and No. 50 is <Col N="716" /> related also.  Therefore I suggest that we take these amendments together with provision for separate decisions if required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 2, to delete lines 22 to 28, and substitute the following: &ldquo;&lsquo;local authority&rsquo; (except in section 25 (5) (b)), means&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in the case of the administrative county of Dublin, excluding the borough of Dún Laoghaire, the council of the county of Dublin,</P>
      <P>(b)  in the case of the borough of Dún Laoghaire, the corporation of the borough,</P>
      <P>(c)  in the case of a county borough, the corporation of the county borough, and</P>
      <P>(d)  in the case of any other administrative county, the council of the county,</P>
      <P>and, where the context permits, includes a water quality control authority established under section 25, and references to the functional area of a local authority shall be construed accordingly;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have put down amendments Nos. 3, 7 and 50 in order to give effect to the intention of Deputy Dockrell's amendments Nos. 4 and 5 which relate to the inclusion of Dún Laoghaire Corporation in the definition of local authority in section 1.  I would point out that the Deputy's amendments would not achieve this objective fully.  I am sure that in the circumstances Deputy Dockrell will be prepared to withdraw the amendments.</P>
      <P>I accept that there are many precedents for grouping the Borough of Dún Laoghaire for various purposes with the four county boroughs and I see no objection to making similar provision in this case.  Amendment No. 3 provides accordingly.  Amendments Nos. 7 and 50, which deal respectively with the definition of &ldquo;reserved function&rdquo; and expences are consequential amendments of a purely technical nature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not include Drogheda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is included in a peculiar way.  Dún Laoghaire Borough covers its own area while Drogheda is covered by Louth County Council so that there is no necessity for providing for Drogheda.  There is a difference in size as well as everything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate that there is no problem with Drogheda or with any of the other boroughs in this respect, I understood that Dún Laoghaire was known always to be a county borough and consequently would be included under the specific provision in that area which refers to county boroughs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Dún Laoghaire is in a very different position from other boroughs and urban districts.  Its population&mdash;53,171 in 1971&mdash;is 65 per cent greater than that of Waterford County Borough and is almost as large as Limerick.  Dún Laoghaire Corporation provide practically all the local government services in the borough and in some instances provide a service for a large area of the county&mdash;for example, the fire service.  Virtually no services are provided by Dublin County Council in the borough.  This is borne out by the fact that the amount of county at large charges contributed by Dún Laoghaire Corporation is very small.  It amounted to slightly more than 1 per cent of the total revenue expenditure in 1973-74 compared with an average <Col N="718" /> of more than 27 per cent for all other boroughs and urbans.  It will be seen, then, that there are special circumstances affecting Dún Laoghaire.  It is almost a separate entity and for that reason it was decided to make a separate case for it.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 37 is consequential on amendment No. 6.  I suggest that the two amendments be debated together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;monitoring&rsquo; includes inspection, measurement, sampling or analysis, whether periodically or continuously;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;monitoring&rdquo; which is used in sections 4 (5) (b), 16 (4) (b) and 22 (1) (a) of the Bill is open to a number of interpretations and it is considered necessary to define it.  The definition proposed by amendment No. 6 includes the various activities, such as inspection, measurement, sampling and analysis, coming within the meaning of the term as used in the Bill in relation to water pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Why since we are defining the word &ldquo;monitoring&rdquo; do we not define it <i>in toto</i>?  Is there any reason for this?  It states here that monitoring includes such activities as inspection, measurement, sampling and analysis, whether periodically or continuously.  The word &ldquo;includes&rdquo; indicates that there is something else involved.  I am wondering whether the Minister is depending on the definition of the word &ldquo;monitoring&rdquo; in some other Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;monitoring&rdquo; is taken as having the normal meaning but some people might argue that the words we are including in this amendment might not be included in the normal meaning.  In order to prevent any misunderstanding it was decided that those words should be included.  The draftsman, no more than ourselves, has not been able to think of any other wording which would be considered necessary to include here.  We are merely ensuring that there will be no loopholes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing unusual in this.  In a number of previous Acts interpretations have been added to words in order to ensure their inclusion.</P>

      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I note here that the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; is used in a number of instances, for example, in section 3, subsection (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with section 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the possibility of the need for a definition of &ldquo;person&rdquo;.  Section 3 says:</P>
      <P>Subject to subsection (5), a person shall not cause or permit any polluting matter to enter waters.</P>
      <P>(2) A person who contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies to section 4, section 5 and so on.  What does &ldquo;person&rdquo; mean here?  Does &ldquo;person&rdquo; mean more than an individual?  Could it mean a corporate body or a statutory <Col N="720" /> body?  Is there a need in section 1 for a definition of the word &ldquo;person&rdquo;?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer Deputy Faulkner to the legal interpretation in the Interpretation Act, 1937.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;person&rdquo; shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as importing a body corporate (whether a corporation aggregate or a corporation sole) and an unincorporated body of persons as well as an individual.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <P>Board of conservators is interpreted as meaning a board of conservators under the Fisheries Act, 1959 to 1974 and includes the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  In the event of a board of conservators being dissolved, which is the present position in some areas in this country, do we take it that those who are acting on behalf of the board of conservators are included here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If it was intended to do that, an Act would have to be passed in this House and provision would have to be made in the Act to provide for that.</P>

      <P>Yes, certainly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In the definition of &ldquo;polluting matter&rdquo; is &ldquo;recreational uses&rdquo; broad enough?  Would it include swimming?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Recreational uses would include swimming naturally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It includes all forms of recreation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  &ldquo;Polluting matter&rdquo; includes any poisonous or noxious matter and any matter which would render the water harmful or <Col N="721" /> detrimental to public health or to domestic, commercial, industrial, agricultural or recreational uses. Recreational uses would include swimming.  The main significance of the term as used in the Bill relates to the prohibition in section 3 on causing or permitting any polluting matter to enter waters.  This prohibition will have fairly limited application.  It will not apply to trade or sewage effluent. The term is also used in sections 12, 13 and 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I was mainly concerned that the word &ldquo;recreational&rdquo; should be absolutely clear.  I am glad to hear that it covers all forms of recreation including swimming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand how it would not cover swimming. The Deputy can be assured that it includes all forms of recreation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I note here that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;tidal waters&rdquo; includes the sea and any estuary up to high water mark medium tide and any enclosed dock adjoining tidal waters.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that the responsibility in relation to this whole question of water pollution is divided.  I know that is not the Minister's fault.  A Bill came before the Seanad recently in relation to pollution at sea.  It is a pity that we should have a situation where we are dealing with all inland waters plus the coastal waters, estuaries and so on but that another Minister is dealing with the question of pollution at sea.  When this Bill on sea water pollution was issued, there was no explanatory memorandum and everybody immediately assumed that it was a matter for me on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with Deputy Faulkner.  The Minister for Transport and Power will only deal with discharges from vessels at sea and the responsibility for discharges from pipes and anything on land will be the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government.  &ldquo;Tidal waters&rdquo; has been defined and the main significance of the definition is to define a <Col N="722" /> line below which discharges from vessels and marine structures will be excluded from the general prohibition in section 3.  It would be a pity if we did not define the responsibility of the two Ministers.  The Bill deals with the matter very adequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned with the definition.  I accept that it is all right.  I am concerned with the fact that the responsibility should be divided.  When the Bill in relation to pollution at sea was introduced in the Seanad, it was immediately assumed on this side of the House that it was also the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government.  We had felt that the problems in regard to the purity of water and pollution of water should be the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government. I have no real objection to the definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like Deputy Faulkner to get the impression or to give the impression that there was some sort of derogation of duty on the part of either Minister in this case.  The matter is very clearly defined and it is my responsibility as laid down in the Act.  The other Bill to which the Deputy has referred deals very clearly with an entirely different matter and while there is co-ordination between the two Departments this is not the only thing in which there has to be delineation between the local government authority and the transport and power authority on many matters dealing with the sea.  The arrangements made in this and in the other Bill are more than adequate to ensure that nobody will escape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I was basically concerned with the fact that I felt that this whole question of pollution of water should be the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government or of one Minister.  We can agree to differ on that.  Were EEC regulations in relation to monitoring taken into consideration when the definition was prepared?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>Amendment No. 9 is an alternative to amendment No. 8 and therefore, these two amendments may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(8) The Council shall in each year make a report to the Minister of its activities during the preceding year, and the Minister shall cause copies of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I put down this amendment to meet as far as I can amendment No. 9.  It proposes that the Water Pollution Advisory Council be required to make a report to the Minister each year of its activities in the preceding year and that the Minister shall cause copies of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  A procedure on these lines is the more usual one adopted in regard to reports by bodies of this nature.  I trust that the amendment is acceptable to Deputies J. O'Leary and Faulkner and will enable them to withdraw amendment No. 9.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has come more than half way to meet our amendment with his, but he should include in his amendment the word &ldquo;recommendation&rdquo;.  The amendment then would read: &ldquo;The Council shall in each year make a report to the Minister of its activities during the preceding year and its recommendations . . . &rdquo;.  In any annual report there should be more than statistics and figures and a summary of the workings of the committee of the council for the previous year.  It should also include any recommendations which that council or committee make during the previous year.  In <Col N="724" /> other words, if there is to be any informed discussion as a result of an annual report that report should include the recommendations made by the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We are, perhaps, playing a bit with words.  I understand what Deputy O'Leary is trying to do but a report must include recommendations. Apart from its departure from the usual formula in regard to the reports by such bodies, amendment No. 9 is unduly specific in regard to publication of recommendations of the council.  It might inhibit the council from making recommendations if they had to be published in full.  There is even the possibility that the Minister might find himself in a situation where he might have to consider not referring certain matters to the council; which would be unfortunate.</P>
      <P>If an advisory body is to be useful it is best that full and frank exchanges of views should be the rule.  Deputies will agree with this.  If a specific requirement regarding recommendations is omitted, there will still be every likelihood that the council will give information in their report as to the recommendations since that would form an important part of their activities.  I cannot see how they could make the report without including in it recommendations which they felt should be made.  I would expect that recommendations of general public interest would be adequately covered.  Some discretion should be left to the council, and in view of the composition of the council and the wide range of interests involved, I do not think that we need have any fear that their activities will not be adequately covered if they are required to produce an annual report.</P>
      <P>I ask the Deputies not to press the point because I feel that those concerned are all intelligent people; they know what they were set up for and if they are doing their job, and I believe they are doing it well, they will include any recommendations they consider necessary in the report and that will be available.  Therefore, I feel it is adequately covered.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy J. O'Leary that the Minister has come a considerable way to meet the point we made.  I take it that we can expect that the recommendations, or at least some information in relation to the recommendations, will be made available in any report to the Minister which will be laid before the House.</P>
      <P>It is well that the activities of the advisory council will be in the public eye.  The fact that they will be in the public eye will be a spur to the council's activities.  More important still, it would be very helpful to many of the bodies concerned about water pollution if they had access to the research and, to an extent, to the recommendations made by the council.  This would help the activities of such bodies very considerably, firstly, by assisting them to protect the environment through the expert knowledge which would be made available to them.  Also, and this is very important, the council's reports would give an opportunity to such bodies to assess in a factual rather than in an emotional way the dangers or otherwise to water supplies related to industrial development.  At a time when we have such considerable numbers of people unemployed, it is vital that we should not lose an industry to purely emotional considerations.  In those circumstances and in view of what the Minister has said about the likelihood of recommendations being available in the report which would be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, we will withdraw our amendment and accept the Minister's.</P>

      <P>I would regard the advisory council, as I am sure the Minister does, as a very important element in assisting in the control of water pollution.  They would be expected to bring what I might term a new dimension to the advice being offered to the Minister.  They will not be part of the civil service who normally <Col N="726" /> advise him, nor will they be part of the purely professional individuals or groups who might be involved. That does not mean that we would be satisfied with a body of well-meaning amateurs who would regard it as their function simply to note and accept the suggestions, proposals or actions of the Minister and add a few innocuous pieces of advice.  There is nothing wrong with the well-meaning.  In fact, it is of considerable advantage to have people involved in this council who are and who have been deeply concerned with the enormous problems presented by water pollution.</P>
      <P>Nor, indeed, is there anything wrong with them being amateurs at the outset. If this body are to do the very important work laid down for them and to give advice which will make a mark on water pollution problems, they must have every opportunity to develop their expertise and to have up-to-date knowledge and information on water pollution problems.  Therefore, I would urge that every facility should be made available to the council to acquire the requisite knowledge and expertise so that their advice will be well-informed and useful.</P>
      <P>I should like to know what the present temporary council are doing in this regard.  I should like to know what facilities are available to them. Have they got a headquarters?  How many times have they met?  What contacts have they got with similar bodies abroad?  Are they in contact with the Council of Europe, a body who have taken a particular interest in the whole question of water pollution, as well they might, because the problems facing many of our partners in the EEC in relation to water pollution are much greater than, fortunately, we have had to face to date?  There is a lot to be learned from the activities not only of our partners in the EEC but also the activities of the members of the Council of Europe in relation to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A considerable amount of worth-while documentation is available to anybody who is interested.  I have no doubt the advisory council will be in touch with them.  I should also like to <Col N="727" /> know whether or not any links have been forged between the advisory council and any similar type of body either in the EEC or in Britain.  Some time ago we learned that salmon were being caught again in the Thames which had been so polluted that there was no fish life in it for a considerable number of years.  Anything the British have learned in relation to this matter would be helpful to us in our endeavours to ensure that our waters are not polluted.</P>
    <P>As I said, we are very fortunate that as yet the problem is relatively small and I emphasise the word &ldquo;relatively&rdquo;. In this technological age with the development of industry and with the extended use of various fertilisers in the agricultural sphere we are becoming more and more in danger of pollution.  We are fortunate in having the opportunity now of being able to forestall the type of problems which almost destroyed some waters in Britain and in Europe.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know whether the council will have the right to call on expert knowledge at home, whether they are building a library to facilitate them in their work, and whether publications are available to them from abroad.  As I said, the council are exceptionally important.  I am pleased to note that their <i>raison d'etre</i> will be to devise means by which our waters can not only be cleaned but that cleanliness can be maintained.  In this technological age this is an extremely important matter in relation to the health of our people.</P>
    <P>Much will be expected from the advice tendered by this council to the Minister.  I wish them well.  They have a very important task ahead of them. I have no doubt they will carry out that task.  It will be impossible for them to do so unless they are given the full backing, financial and otherwise, they will need.  Both through publications and by going abroad themselves, they will have an opportunity of reviewing the methods which have proved successful in some instances.</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputy Faulkner is aware that the Water Pollution <Col N="728" /> Advisory Council, on an informal basis in advance of this legislation, were set up by me with the approval of the Government.  Their inaugural meeting was held on 7th February, 1975.  There is very wide representation on the council.  During the preparation of this Bill they were very useful and most helpful in their advice.  They have headquarters at the Custom House, Dublin.  The necessary staff are provided by the Department of Local Government.  Any publications they may require are made available to them.  Any research they have required so far&mdash;and I should imagine in the future&mdash;has been provided, in the main, by the bodies represented on the council.</P>
      <P>We have on the council the Confederation of Irish Industry, Bord Fáilte, the IFA, the National Youth Council, the Department of Local Government, the County and City Managers Association, the Trout Anglers Federation, the National Science Council, An Foras Forbartha, the Department of Health, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, the Institution of Engineers of Ireland, the Department of Agriculture, the General Council of County Councils, the Inland Fisheries Trust, the Electricity Supply Board, the Office of Public Works, An Foras Talúntais, the Department of Education, the Irish Federation of Sea Anglers, the Institute of Chemistry of Ireland, the Department of Fisheries, the Pharmaceutical Chemical and Allied Industries Association, An Taisce, the Institute of Biology of Ireland, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association and the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there could be wider representation than that.  They represent practically all that could be fitted into a reasonable council.  They have been doing a good job.  In the circumstances I cannot see where the fears Deputy Faulkner seems to have arise.  On the question of travelling abroad, I do not think that arises at present.  We will meet it if it does. Any information required can be obtained.  Any documentation or books or publications they require can be made available.  They co-operate <Col N="729" /> with the Northern Ireland Council and attend meetings, as the Northern Ireland people attend meetings of the council in the Republic.  That is the proper way to deal with this matter. They are doing a good job and they will continue to do a good job.</P>
    <P>On the question of the salmon caught in the Thames, while I believe there has been a vast improvement, that is one salmon which has been caught so many times that it must be a little bit stale now.</P>

They are improving and I am hoping that, within the next few years, we will be able to catch fish in any of our rivers and lakes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very far from being critical of them.  My purpose, and rightly so, is to ensure that whatever expertise is required by the council is made available to them and that the facilities which I have no doubt they will need are also made available to them.  One of the most serious problems facing humanity today is the whole question of water pollution.  It is such that we, who are in the fortunate situation that, relatively speaking, our problem is not as bad as it is in other more industrially developed countries, should ensure that nothing is spared to help a council such as this to provide the advice which is vitally essential to ensure that our water would not be polluted. It is not good enough to say that this council will have within themselves the means by which advice can be given; in other words, that they would have within themselves the expertise <Col N="730" /> and basic knowledge which would be essential in a matter like this.  There is no doubt that they will be able to provide quite a considerable amount of information that will be helpful to the Minister; nevertheless a certain expertise is essential which is available from areas where very serious water pollution obtained and where the problems in regard to it were overcome.  It is essential that all this be made available to the council wherever it is needed.  I am not being critical; I wish the council well but I want to ensure that whatever facilities are necessary and whatever financial provisions are needed will be made available to them so that the advice they will tender to the Minister will be of top quality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with the proposal to set up this Water Pollution Advisory Council and I am glad to hear the Minister say that the committee which already exists is working very well.  However, I think the section could be strengthened; there are many aspects of it with which I am not happy.  The Water Pollution Advisory Council will have a vital role to play in the years immediately ahead.  I presume the Minister has a good team of experts on this committee and that he will have a similar expert team on the water advisory council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Advisory councils are common nowadays; we have one under the Wildlife Bill.  Subsection (4) of this section says that the council will consist of such number of persons appointed for such period as the Minister thinks fit.  Would it not be better to spell out the number of persons to be appointed?  Does the Minister intend it to remain flexible so that he can add one or two who have a certain expertise in one field or another as he thinks fit?  Subsection (6) says that the Minister may remove any member of the council from office.  I think it is a bit severe to have this in the Bill.  There are many arguments for and against it but I am against such a subsection.  Can the Minister remove a member from office just because he does not like him?  The conditions under which the Minister may <Col N="731" /> remove a member from office should be stated in the section or else in regulations to be made under the Bill.</P>
    <P>How will the Water Pollution Advisory Council stand in relation to An Foras Forbartha and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards? Will these bodies act in an advisory capacity for the water advisory council? Will they be working for that council?  Must the council accept their recommendations, ratify them and submit them to the Minister?  Or can the Institute for Research and Standards and An Foras Forbartha submit their own independent reports directly to the Minister over the heads of the advisory council, so to speak?  I sincerely hope there will not be a conflict of opinion with different recommendations going from these organisations to the Department against the recommendations submitted by the advisory council.</P>
    <P>I presume the council will have available all EEC draft directives from the very first stages and that they will be in a position to make recommendations to the Minister as to any changes they think should be made in the draft directives if they think that the directives if implemented would not suit Irish conditions or could not be implemented at reasonable cost.  If the council are to have teeth their recommendations should be made public.  No Minister would have anything to fear from the publication of such recommendations. If he does not agree with the recommendations I am sure he will be able to justify his position and will not accept recommendations only for good and sufficient reasons which he can stand over publicly.  I think the section could be strengthened considerably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was passed through the Seanad and was very fully discussed there and it has passed through this House and has been fully discussed so far.  We are now on Committee Stage and a number of amendments have been put down by the Deputy, by Deputy Faulkner and by myself.  Deputy O'Leary now raises a matter which he says he thinks should <Col N="732" /> be included in the Bill but which has not been mentioned so far.  I do not think he can justify what he says.  If he had listened to what I said earlier, I went pretty fully into the matters he has raised.  First, as regards publication, the position is the recommendations will be placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas and if anybody here knows of a document placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas that did not appear in the newspapers, I should like him to tell me about it.  Of course everybody will know what the recommendations contain.</P>
      <P>As regards what An Foras Forbartha or the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards may do, they are represented on the council as I pointed out and their advice will be available to the council at first hand. All the necessary documentation is available to the council and any information or documentation which they may require from anywhere will be provided.  That being so, I cannot see where Deputy O'Leary's fears arise because we have done everything to ensure that the council will be well armed.  In regard to the removal or appointment of a member, one of the reasons why we have not mentioned a number is that we believe it is better to be flexible.  At some time some organisation may arise which could give some very useful information. Some very useful information could be obtained from some organisations.  As it stands at present it would be possible to add to the committee for the purpose of using that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of removal, the normal thing in all Acts is that the members are appointed &ldquo;with the right of the Minister to remove&rdquo;. It is suggested that he can go around with a little hatchet and cut off the people he does not like.  They would not be there if he did not like them or if he felt they would not be useful.  As far as I can see, we have set up this committee in advance of the legislation and picked the people best qualified to serve on it.  We have made provision in case some other organisations could be useful.  They can get all the information they require. Their report will be made available <Col N="733" /> to the Members of the Oireachtas and will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any sense in Deputy O'Leary's argument.  All his points were adequately covered before we came into the House this morning.  I thought I gave full information on all these points made by Deputy Faulkner and Deputy O'Leary.  If they require any further information I will be glad to provide it.  I do not think any of the fears expressed by Deputy O'Leary are likely to affect this Bill when it becomes law.</P>
    <P>This Bill was introduced in the Seanad because we were anxious to get it made law as quickly as possible.  The longer we delay it the longer we are preventing the necessary steps being taken.  There are a few important amendments which must be fully discussed, and I think we are wasting time on matters which have already been fully discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They would have to make that information available.  As far as changing the planning board is concerned, you cannot do this because a certain organisation considers it is wrong.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the fact that the council will take into account the views of everybody concerned with <Col N="734" /> water pollution, any recommendations they make should be binding on both county councils and the new planning board, especially in relation to water pollution.  I agree the planning board will have a difficult task but I still feel that if a council such as the one being set up make recommendations to the Minister they should be acted upon both by the county councils and the new planning board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>This is an advisory council, not a statutory council to make laws.  They will make recommendations. This is a different thing altogether.

In my opinion it would be wrong if they were.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who is suspicious of boards I admit that this is one of the most important ever set up particularly, as Deputy Faulkner said earlier, since pollution is rare here.  We must industrialise the country.  I read an article the other day which said that when you industrialise a country it cannot be as pollution-free as before You must make a choice&mdash;to create employment which is bound to lead to more pollution or to have a pollution-free countryside and unemployment.  I know what my choice would be.  The greater the population the more pollution we will have.  If we had deserted villages we would be pollution-free. The reason we have very little pollution is that we were under foreign rule for a very long time and this was a holiday ground for an industrialised country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must control pollution and keep it to the minimum.  This is a wide-ranging committee which should be able to do good work.  The members must be experts.  They must visit other countries.  The Minister said he did not see any reason for this but in my view there is.  I have great admiration for State companies but they are not doing enough to avoid pollution.  I refer now to Bord na Móna, a company for which I have great respect.  They are very good employers and are an asset to the nation and the ESB.  This company  <Col N="735" /> should have had settling lakes along the Shannon when they started to develop bogs.  I do not know if they did enough research at that time.</P>
    <P>This is why I want to point out the importance of having experts to do research, to find out the best way to prevent pollution and to keep it to the minimum.  State companies should set an example by insisting that pollution be kept to the minimum by industrial development.  I assume that the new committee can only advise and the planning board will make final decisions. They will accept or reject the advice of the committee.</P>
    <P>We must have expert knowledge on how to control pollution, not stop it. We must be very careful that we do not weigh too much in favour of certain people who might for personal reasons want to prevent industries being established in different areas.  This reminds me of the itinerant problem. Some people say &ldquo;Settle them, but not at my back door&rdquo;.  This is happening all over the country.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that not too many dirty industries are established here, but we must strike a balance.  Anybody who thinks we can industrialise this country quickly and at the same time keep it as free from pollution as it was before is making a fool of himself. Of course we must keep pollution to the minimum and we must insist that we have the best experts available. Anything the committee can do to ensure that should have the support of this House.</P>
    <P>This committee should spare nothing, money or anything else.  They should go abroad to find out the latest and most modern way to prevent pollution. State companies must ensure that they do not cause pollution unnecessarily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As usual Deputy Callanan made a number of very good points.  The members of the commitee, as members of the organisations they represent, are frequently abroad investigating the facts the Deputy mentioned. When they come back they report on the steps being taken in other countries and there is no necessity <Col N="736" /> for them to go abroad again simply because they are members of the board.  Their advice is available.  That is why the net was spread so widely. We have got everybody on the board we thought could give advice and at the same time we have tried to keep the committee to manageable proportions.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Callanan said, if we industrialise the country we are bound to have a certain amount of increased pollution.  It is up to us to ensure it is kept to a minimum.  There are people who constantly condemn pollution.  If they meant what they said they would never travel in a motor car and would try to prevent everybody else travelling by car too because cars are polluting the air.  They would not smoke cigarettes or tobacco under any guise because they are causing a certain amount of pollution also.  We can go overboard on this kind of thing.</P>
      <P>The planning board must have authority to deal with the Planning Act.  They have a statutory requirement to deal with it when matters come before them.  I am quite sure that advice given from everybody, such as the advice that is being given at the present time from various bodies, will be taken into consideration. With regard to the question of cost the bodies which have been set up have already been able to provide a lot of expertise.  We are already providing them with services.  We will provide them with any documentation and any information they may require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing I would like to mention which might be overlooked in this debate, or an outsider looking at the debate might miss it.  This is one of the least water polluted countries in the world.  At the present time, wherever there is any population, pollution occurs, but we should remember that this is one of the least polluted countries.  Secondly, we do not have to go abroad to find out a lot of things.  There are certain things here which are not in many other countries.  Deputy Callanan referred to one of them.  Where would we go to find out a way in which we could prevent peat from polluting water?  We are almost the only country in the <Col N="737" /> world that is commercially using peat so there would not be any point in sending somebody to a foreign country to find out what they would do about it because they never heard about peat.  We have people working on it who are doing a very good job.  I give credit to Bord na Móna because, even though again and again they cause a certain amount of water pollution, they are doing their best to try to prevent it happening.  I hope this will be the case in relation to all the commercial industries in the country.</P>
    <P>I believe we are labouring this.  The committee which has been set up are doing a good job and will do a much better job when they come under this Bill because they will then see that we have provided the necessary muscle to allow them to work.  They are advising at the moment and they know, as the law is and has been for a considerable time, there is nothing that can be done about it.  In this Bill we are providing the teeth Deputy O'Leary referred to to enable them to do their job.  I believe the position will be improved considerably.  I want to say again that I believe we might be labouring this matter a little too much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer back to the Minister's reply to Deputy O'Leary in which he again referred to the fact that this matter had already been discussed in the Seanad.  The Minister has done this on a number of occasions.  I can only assume that he feels that, having had it discussed in the Seanad, there is no need to have it discussed to anything like the same extent in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be misinterpreted. I said that the matter had been discussed in the Seanad and it had reached Committee Stage in the Dáil and everybody had an opportunity of putting down amendments including the Deputies opposite.  I do not believe it is relevant to suggest new ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the Dáil is the place, as well as the Seanad, to have the Bill fully discussed so that everybody will be clear in their minds about what is contained in the Bill <Col N="738" /> when we are finished with the discussion. Deputy O'Leary said that the Minister would decide on the number of people, that he would appoint them and he could summarily remove them. I feel that that is a bit arbitrary.  However, the Minister pointed out that in relation to the appointment it might be necessary to appoint somebody from some new body which could contribute towards the work of the council.  I accept that but I do not see why the Minister should not allow the council, once they are appointed, to elect their own chairman.  As the Minister said, he would not have nominated them if he did not believe they would do a worth-while job.</P>
      <P>There is another point I should like to question.  Section 2 (2) states:</P>
      <P>The Council may, either of its own volition or at the request of the Minister, make recommendations to the Minister in relation to any matter relevant to his functions or responsibilities . . </P>
      <P>Why is the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; used instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo;?  I did not put down an amendment because I expect there is a specific reason why it should be that way.  It appears to be rather strange that it is worded that way.  It could be interpretated as meaning that should the Minister request information from the council that they would decide they would not give it to him.  I accept that is a bit far fetched but the subsection says that &ldquo;the Council may&rdquo; make recommendations either of their own volition or at the request of the Minister. I imagine that this particular aspect of the work of the council is the reason for their existence, that is, that they shall make recommendations to the Minister either of their own volition or at the request of the Minister.  I should like the Minister to explain why the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reason &ldquo;may&rdquo; is in the subsection is that if they feel there is no necessity to give advice on certain matters they do not have to.  If they want to give advice they may do so.  It would be rather ridiculous to say that they shall give advice on something when in fact that is what is being <Col N="739" /> done and they are not in a position to give advice on it.  Subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>The Council may, either of its own volition or at the request of the Minister, make recommendations to the Minister in relation to any matter relevant to his functions or responsibilities concerning control of water pollution and shall advise him on any matter referred to it by the Minister in discharge of his functions and responsibilities under this Act.</P>
      <P>If they feel there is something they want to give advice on they may give it and if they do not feel they want to give advice they do not have to.  If they are asked for advice they cannot say &ldquo;No, we do not have to&rdquo;.  They shall give advice on it.  I believe the matter is very clear and I do not see any ambiguity about it.  I do not see any reason why the wording should be changed.</P>
      <P>With regard to the election of a chairman it has been practice for many years, when a board such as this is being set up that the Minister of the day appoints a chairman.  The chairman appointed in this case is an excellent man and I believe he is doing a very good job.  Possibly if the people on the board were appointing him they would appoint the same man.  As Deputy Faulkner knows as well as I do, very often when a group of people come together as in this case the first thing they must do is elect a chairman. They may not know each other and, individually, they may not be able to assess who anybody is or what each person's capabilities are.  In that case it is good, sound practice that the Minister, having a fair knowledge of the people on the committee, may appoint the chairman</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 11, to delete &ldquo;any polluting matter to enter waters&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;polluting matter exceeding the standards established under section 26, to enter waters&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I believe that this amendment is much simpler than the Minister's amendments but it implies that a standard has been set.  As the section stands it is rather vague.  It is very important that no polluting matter exceeding the standards should enter any waters. This is an important amendment because there could be very minor polluting matter entering waters which could be covered by the use of the word &ldquo;any&rdquo;, something which could be polluting matter but shortly after entering the water would no longer be a pollutant; its polluting effect would be completely eroded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, we feel that the standard which will be established under section 26 will be sufficiently wide to guard any problems envisaged by the Minister.  As Deputy O'Leary has said, any sort of matter which would not necessarily be polluting but which might interfere with or be detrimental to the recreational uses of the water and which would come from natural causes could be regarded as an offence.  We do not want to involve people in the commission of an offence in relation to some relatively minor matter.  If the Minister would accept this amendment it would safeguard what he intends to safeguard but at the same time would not be an irritant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid there must be a complete misunderstanding here. The fundamental point which the Deputies appear to be missing is that section 3 deals with discharges which would not be permitted at all and it is impossible to provide standards for something which is completely banned. We cannot tell a manufacturer or a farmer that he will be prosecuted if he puts matter into waters unless that matter comes up to a certain standard. I am afraid that section 3 has been read and section 4 has not.  Section 3 deals with discharges which should not be permitted at all&mdash;waste oil, rubbish, slurry and so on&mdash;and it would make no sense to provide standards for such discharges.  All discharges of a type which can be discharged to waters in a proper manner are covered by the licensing provisions of section 4.  As I see it, this amendment to section 3 would make a provision whereby materials would be licensed or permitted when in fact this material had been completely banned.  Regarding matter which would affect swimming, either it is banned and would not be allowed at all or we are talking about something entirely different which does not come under this Bill.  We are talking about pollutants and there are two types, that which is completely banned under section 3 and that dealt with in section 4, which provides for the licencing of certain types.  We must get this clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are taking amendments Nos. 12, 43, 44 and 45 with amendment No. 10. The intention of amendments Nos. 10, 43, 44 and 45 appears to be that section 26 should be amended so that quality standards may be prescribed for any pollutants and to amend section 3 so as to restrict the prohibition to polluting matter exceeding such standards.  The first point is that amendment No. 43 would not, in fact, enable quality standards to be prescribed for other pollutants because the addition of this phrase in section 26 (1) would only provide for standards in relation to methods of treatment.  It would accordingly be argued that since section 26 enables quality standards to be prescribed only for trade and sewage effluents, a prohibition as proposed in <Col N="742" /> amendment No. 10 could not apply to other pollutants.  The prohibition will not apply to trade or sewage effluents because these will be controlled by licence.  Therefore the effect of these amendments would be to make section 3 ineffective.  The issue here is not simply a question of drafting.  In case there is a misconception perhaps I should explain that trade and sewage effluents will be controlled by licence under section 4.  The purpose of section 3 is to prohibit the entry to waters of any other form of polluting matter. Indiscriminate dumping in waters is something which we do not want at all.  We could not fix a quality standard in that case and it would also be inappropriate to fix a quality standard for waste oil; it is completely prohibited. The same thing applies to pig slurry; it should not be discharged into the nearest watercourse.  Silage effluent and industrial waste are other forms of polluting matter which would come within the prohibition.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Deputies O'Leary and Faulkner had in mind that since there will be some exemptions under section 4 (10), there should not be an absolute prohibition in section 3.  What we have in mind in section 4 (10) is that there may be classes of trade or sewage effluent where in the generality of cases there would not be a danger of pollution. Septic tanks which are properly designed and maintained and which deal with domestic sewage from individual houses are unlikely to cause pollution problems.  There may also be other cases where the quality of polluting water or the normal effluent quality would not warrant the inconvenience and administrative cost of licensing. We are therefore providing in section 4 (10) for the possibility of exemption from licensing requirements and provision should be made that any effluent so exempted should be brought within the scope of the prohibition in section 3.  Perhaps it was the intention of Deputies O'Leary and Faulkner, and I agree, that it would be clearer if section 3 were amended so as not to apply the prohibition in that section to any effluents exempted under section 4 (10) where they comply with any relevant standards under section 26.  In other words, if an effluent is exempted from <Col N="743" /> the licensing requirements of section 4 it would not come within the scope of the prohibition in section 3 if it complied with any relevant standard prescribed under section 26.  Amendment No. 12 provides accordingly and I hope it will enable Deputies O'Leary and Faulkner to withdraw amendments Nos. 10, 43, 44 and 45, which, as I have already explained, are unacceptable. Section 3 provides for total prohibition and section 4 provides for the licensing of certain types.  We must look at these two sections separately and the amendment which I have suggested does the job that Deputies Faulkner and O'Leary are interested in.  That is all that is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I can clearly see the point made by the Minister &ldquo;Polluting matter&rdquo; includes any poisonous or noxious matter or any substance which enters the water and is liable to render such waters harmful or dangerous to public health or to domestic, commercial, industrial, agricultural or recreational users.  Section 3 (1) provides that a person shall not cause or permit any polluting matter to enter waters.  Take as an example when a farmer allows 20 head of cattle to stand in a river for the most part of the day during the summertime.  Naturally, the waters become polluted.  A few hundred yards downstream there is an area used for swimming or recreational purposes and this area could be deemed to be polluted.  Farmer No. 2 could then bring a case against farmer No. 1, as the section stands.  It is with the intention of preventing such situations arising that Deputy Faulkner and I put down this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be amazed if any effort were made to prevent farmers allowing their cattle to use a stream during a period when those cattle are running because of flies. Such a stream is one of the greatest assets a farmer can have.  To suggest, as Deputy O'Leary does, that because there is swimming lower down the river or stream special provision should be made so that farmers would not be allowed to let their cattle use the stream I do not think would work at all.  Subsection (3) says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="744" /> It shall be a good defence to a prosecution under this section to prove to the satisfaction of the court that the person charged took all reasonable care to prevent the entry prohibited under subsection (1).</P>
    <P>I do not know if that means that a farmer should wait around with a little tin for his cattle to pollute a stream and try to collect in the little tin and deposit that pollution elsewhere. I am very anxious to ensure things are properly dealt with and while I have some sympathy with the people who want swimming facilities, I still do not see why farmers should be prevented from using an asset they have been using from time immemorial, namely, the streams running through their lands as drinking water and a refuge for cattle during hot weather.  I doubt if any of Deputy O'Leary's party, especially rural Deputies, would give very much support to the suggestion that farmers should be prohibited from using such streams and that is the only interpretation I can take out of what the Deputy has said.</P>

      <P>No.  We want to ensure that standards are laid down and we do not want to leave it open for anybody to pollute waters in which recreation takes place, and that includes swimming, but there is a good defence here.  The Department of Agriculture are satisfied it is a good defence.  What Deputy O'Leary is saying is that we either take out swimming completely as a recreation or say all recreation except swimming so that the farmer with the swimming pool will not have his portion of the river polluted by his neighbour's cattle or else we prevent the cattle from going into the river or arrange they do not pollute it when they go in.  That would be an impossibility, as Deputy O'Leary knows.  We are talking about something which is just not possible. We have gone as far as we can.  I suggest the Deputy leave the matter as it is.</P>

      <P>I recognise that the change had to be made because a new Department of Fisheries was established and the decision to change from the Minister for Agriculture to the Minister for Fisheries is welcomed. However the setting up of the new Department is fortuitous in these circumstances. I am not concerned with the personalities presently occupying the positions of Ministers but with the difference of outlook of the Departments themselves.  I felt somewhat perturbed at the many references to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in the original Bill because the reference to him concerned, in the main, exemptions.  As the agricultural sector of his portfolio was the largest in that it related to a wider field and was concerned with more people and their activities on the farm, <Col N="747" /> the main emphasis and thrust of a Minister for Agriculture would relate to exemptions.</P>
      <P>It is possible that pressure groups might feel these exemptions were necessary in the circumstances but they could result in grave damage being done to the environment and, particularly, to the purity of our water.  This pressure could appear to be justified on economic grounds.  I must admit that when I studied the Bill in relation to the part to be played in it by the Minister for Agriculture, and particularly when I noted the emphasis on exemptions, I felt that the fisheries aspect of his portfolio tended to fade out.</P>
      <P>I believe that now we are in a different situation when the emphasis is on the Minister for Fisheries.  The pressures on the Minister for Fisheries would in my view be quite the reverse of those on the Minister for Agriculture. The pressures will be to exhort the Minister to do everything in his power to safeguard fish life and this in turn will ensure that the water is preserved and kept as free as possible from pollution in this technological age.  This emphasis which will now be placed on the matter of water pollution, particularly when one notes from today's news that fish died because of water pollution in a river, is welcomed. For these reasons I am glad of the change even though I know that the change has taken place for technical reasons.  I feel the emphasis now will be much more on ensuring that our waters will be kept pure rather than on exemptions.</P>
      <P>We learned the profound lesson last summer when during the long hot spell we saw for the first time how badly polluted some of our rivers were and the effect this had on our fish life.  We had a bad experience in relation to water for human consumption in Clogherhead in my constituency.  I believe the change will alter the emphasis and this is good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the change in ministries is concerned it is true that the new Minister will have fisheries as his main concern but at the same time <Col N="748" /> it would be unfair if I allowed the comment to pass that if a change had not taken place the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, and his Parliamentary Secretary, would not have been as interested in protecting that particular aspect.  While somebody whose sole interest will be fishing will be referred to in future, and that will be a help, the position would not be as black as Deputy Faulkner believed it would be.  Deputy Faulkner told us of fish dying and I should like to tell him that I read in a newspaper, dated 1880, of the death of salmon and trout in a river in the south of Ireland.  It was not attributed to &ldquo;water pollution&rdquo;.  The story stated that the fish appeared to have been poisoned and cattle running into the river were blamed for it.  I do not think any prosecution was taken against the owners of the cattle by those interested in fish.</P>
      <P>It was tragic that the position was so bad in Clogherhead but the Deputy cannot blame the Minister for Agriculture or anybody else for that.  This is a case which proves that for years no Government spent enough money on the question of sanitary services. Had that been done Clogherhead and places like it would not find themselves in the position they found themselves in last summer.  Deputy Faulkner's comment about realising how polluted our rivers were was not a fair one because, no matter what we do, if the supply of water runs low pollution will appear and it has been appearing for a long time, long before this State got its freedom.  That is something even this Bill will not remedy.  If we get another long hot summer we will have a lot of rivers running dry and pollution will appear. There is nothing we can do to prevent that.  The Bill will prevent pollution in rivers throughout the year and we have a lot of that.  We are still a lot better than Britain or continental countries.</P>

      <P>It shall be a good defence to a prosecution under this section to prove to the satisfaction of the court that the person charged took all reasonable care to prevent the entry prohibited under subsection (1).</P>
      <P>This subsection will probably be regarded as a dream provision by junior and senior counsel.  I can see it being argued for and against <i>ad nauseam</i> in the courts.  As soon as any person or body is prosecuted for an offence his first reaction will be to claim the benefit of this subsection and I can see legal advisers taking the initiative and relying on it as a defence.  I have been advised that district justices and Circuit Court judges will have to take such a defence into consideration when ruling on cases brought before them.  I suggest the subsection is unnecessary because most people served with notice of prosecution will be inclined to rely on it.  For that reason I suggest the subsection should be deleted.</P>

I would be anxious to hear those reasons.  As I have said, undoubtedly there is considerable disquiet about the provision among those concerned with the environment, and with water pollution in particular.  The Minister was good enough to furnish me with a copy of the recommendations sent to him by the advisory council and they, too, expressed disquiet in this regard.  As <Col N="751" /> Deputy O'Leary said, it would be a pity if this provision provided an escape for somebody from an offence in relation to water pollution.  The difficulty is in relation to the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.  The Minister will probably say that the courts will have to decide, but I should be happier if the phrase were reworded.  I agree it would not be fair to tie people absolutely in the sense that they would not be given any opportunity to defend themselves and that is another reason we did not table an amendment in this respect.</P>

We all know different judges will have different views on what is reasonable.  Take a farmer who lays down a silage pit adjacent to a stream; he can argue that he took all reasonable care to avoid polluting the stream.  However those of us who are farmers realise the havoc that can be caused as a result of the location of silage pits.  It has been proved that streams which were not near to silage pits have been polluted. If a person is brought before the court can he not argue that he took all reasonable care to avoid polluting although he located a pit at such a point that it actually caused pollution?</P>

      <P>I associate myself with the three previous speakers on this point.  As Deputy O'Leary said, this subsection gives a sort of blank cheque to the legal profession.  It is an escape device for people being brought before the courts.  It reminds me of a provision in the old Planning Act in regard to prosecutions for unauthorised buildings&mdash;it was practically impossible to catch offenders under that provision because of the various mechanisms they could rely on.  The delaying process was there in the old Planning Acts and it is very similar to the out that is being left here for people polluting waters. There is such an out under subsection (3) and I should like to hear the Minister's comments on it.</P>

      <P>I think this House has gone a little screwy.  The last two Deputies who spoke did not seem to be <i>au fait</i> with Deputy O'Leary's argument.  Earlier he established the fact that swimming was a recreation and I agreed with him.  He then mentioned the case of a person who might use part of a river for swimming and where a farmer might allow his cattle to use another portion of the river, thereby causing concern to the first person that the river might be polluted. That is the point at issue here. We are an agricultural country and I would not be prepared to see a Bill going through this House which would say that a farmer should not be allowed to let his cattle into a river during the summer.  What is being suggested by the Opposition is quite ridiculous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know what Deputies O'Leary, Hussey and Burke want.  Deputy Faulkner tried to point out that Deputy O'Leary had said he was not trying to prevent the cattle from going into the river but he did not want the person with the swimming facilities to prosecute the farmer.  Can anybody say that that line is being followed now?  Deputy Burke suggested it would be wrong to have an out in this case.  Is it not the case that the Opposition have been arguing that it would be wrong if there were an out for people who pollute rivers?  The word &ldquo;loophole&rdquo; was used.  Who is the loophole for?  It is not for the person who does the swimming.  The loophole is for the farmer whose cattle might pollute the stream.  That is a very dangerous argument to follow and it would be very foolish if an agricultural country came down on the side of a person who might want to have a swim. Cattle do not stay all day in a river. The whole argument being advanced by the Opposition is ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My advice is that it will give a better balance to leave in the subsection.  The prosecution must prove that the pollution in the water was done wilfully or <Col N="753" /> negligently.  The alternative is to take out the subsection.  That means we should not leave what the Opposition call a &ldquo;loophole&rdquo;; in other words, that we should ensure that the person who wants to swim in the river can take a prosecution against the farmer whose cattle have been using the river. The Opposition should take a long look at this matter because it is not as simple as it looks.</P>
    <P>There are other problems we are attempting to deal with; for instance, there is the large-scale pollution of water supplies and we are making provision for this.  This section is an almost exact replica of what is in the Northern Ireland legislation which has been in operation for four years.  It has not caused any of the problems suggested by Deputies opposite and there have not been prosecutions as a result of it. I want to make it clear that while I am anxious to ensure that this Bill will be effective at the same time I am not going to agree that as an agricultural country we should take out this subsection and thereby leave the farmer open to prosecution without any defence if his cattle have been using a river or stream.  Another point arises and I am not quite clear on it.  It is the question of wild animals, into which category cattle fit, and domestic animals.  Under law their control is quite different.  The subsection is not perfect but it is the best that can be put into the Bill and I should prefer to leave it there.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister admitted he understood what I was talking about when I spoke in relation to section 3 (1).  Had our amendment been accepted on that point it would have covered this situation.  I do not accept the Minister's point that subsection (3) is necessary as a consequence of section 3 (1).  It appears to me that subsection (3) gives the initiative with regard to defence to a person who is prosecuted.  His first reaction will be to fall back on subsection (3). In the case we discussed with regard to farmers, a justice would take into account the fact that reasonable care was exercised by the defendant.  This is the normal practice in courts.  The <Col N="754" /> escape clause in subsection (3) should be deleted from the Bill because it is unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to be changing feet.  He started the discussion and at first he stuck to his line of argument.  Earlier he asked me to say if swimming was included and I said it was.  His second point related to a person who had a river passing by his property and where he or his family wanted to swim.  He mentioned the situation where a farmer next door to that person had an open field leading to the river and who allowed his cattle to use the river.  The Deputy's point was that this section would allow the person who wished to swim in the river to prosecute the farmer.  He is now talking about an entirely different matter.</P>
      <P>Let me give another example.  If a farmer spreads pig slurry on his land at the appropriate time and a sudden storm washes that slurry into a river or lake and he is prosecuted, section 3 (1) provides a way out for him.  He is entitled to that because he did not intend to pollute the river or lake. Deputy O'Leary is saying that every case should be prosecuted.  If the section is deleted, they will have no defence. We tend to forget that we are an agricultural country.  Deputy O'Leary's discussion related specifically to the man with the swimming pool and the man with the cattle that are using the river above it.  My advice is that it would be a good defence to say that he was not responsible for polluting the river to the detriment of the swimmer.  If the section is not left as it stands, there will be many questions to be answered in the coming summer.</P>

      <P>There is little point in giving examples.  The Minister will agree that we might be in some difficulty had Deputy O'Leary not put the cattle in the river in an earlier section because it seems to be his main defence in relation to this subsection. We have discussed the matter at some length.  The main purpose was to bring the attention of the Minister to the disquiet in relation to it.  Deputy O'Leary has a point when he says that if a case came before the court, irrespective  <Col N="755" /> of the subsection, the judge would have to accept a reasonable defence.  The fact that the subsection is in the Bill does not give any more protection than if it were not in the Bill.  It leaves loopholes for other individuals in regard to polluting waters. The main purpose of the discussions was to bring to the attention of the Minister that there is disquiet; even the advisory council are perturbed about it.  In that sense the debate was worth while.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 15 and 30 are related and may be taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( )  A local authority shall issue a decision within a period of two months, on an application for a licence received under this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We believe that this is a reasonable amendment and that it is in line with the provisions in the Planning Act.  If the amendment is not accepted, a local authority could delay the issue of a licence as long as it wished.  This could cause serious inconvenience to the applicant and, more important, it could mean that waters would continue to be polluted.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) (a) reads:</P>
      <P>Subject to subsection (2), a person shall not, after such date as may be fixed for the purpose of this subsection by order made by the Minister, discharge or cause or permit the discharge of any trade effluent or sewage effluent to any waters except under and in accordance with a licence under this section.</P>
      <P>Section 5 (1) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person shall be deemed not to have contravened section 4 (1) in relation to an existing discharge of <Col N="756" /> trade effluent or sewage effluent made before he is granted or refused a licence under section 4 if, before the relevant date, he applies for such a licence and complies with the requirements of any regulations under section 6 regarding the furnishing of information to a local authority.</P>
    <P>This means that where there is an existing discharge a person cannot be prosecuted once he has applied for a licence until such time as the local authority either decide to grant the licence or refuse the licence.  If that time were to be lengthy, the pollution would continue.  If we can specify a time limit we would be ensuring that the matter would be dealt with quickly by the local authority.  This is a reasonable amendment and it should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be unrealistic to impose a time limit because some applications may require considerable investigation by the local authority, for example, water quality investigations extending over a period of time. It should be possible for local authorities to give decisions in the vast majority of cases within a relatively short period, in many cases less than two months.  Therefore, it would be undesirable to fix a longer period generally for consideration of applications. When giving instructions to local authorities, I will tell them that they should make every effort to speed the decision.  There are many cases on which a speedy decision should be possible.  At present there are a number of pollutants which will require to be dealt with.  Some of them will have to be investigated at great length and for that reason to fix a time limit of two months would mean that many of them would probably get a refusal. There would not be adequate time to allow them to prove that they are entitled to a licence.  The fixing of an unrealistic time limit would have the undesirable effect that licences would be refused or that stringent conditions would be attached to them. This could lead to appeals and further delays.  On the other hand, applicants could delay in furnishing relevant information which would seriously <Col N="757" /> inhibit the proper appraisal of applications within the suggested time limit.</P>
      <P>The amendment would also remove the flexibility of approach to the licensing of existing discharges, which is provided for in sections 5 and 18 under which an existing discharge can continue to be made until such time as the local authority decide either to grant or refuse a licence.  This could take quite a long time.  If they do not apply or if a time limit is there, the natural thing would be so say: &ldquo;All right, we think that is a pollutant.  We will stop immediately&rdquo; and it could cause a great deal of trouble; in fact, it might close down industries.  My advice is that as the Bill stands an applicant for a licence can seek an order of <i>mandamus</i> where a local authority or sanitary authority fail in their duty to deal with an application. However, I think we can rely on local and sanitary authorities to operate the system in a reasonable and expeditious way.  It would be better not to prescribe any period within which decisions must be given and for the various reasons I have outlined I would not be prepared to accept the amendments.  However, I will try to ensure that a speedy decision is given and I will try to have any complaints that are made dealt with as quickly as possible.  We are all on the one side in attempting to stop pollution of the waters but we do not want to tie it up unnecessarily.  I believe that to make this order now would be a mistake. I shall keep the whole matter under review because I believe only experience will show whether or not a time limit is necessary.  Existing cases are dealt with.  New ones could possibly be dealt with in a fairly short time except that water tests have to be carried out.  I would ask that the amendments be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept that the Minister is just as anxious to control this situation as I am.  There might be something in what he said in relation to requesting the local authorities to speed up matters, but when there is not a statutory control in a matter such as this local authorities can, if they so wish, continue to be rather slow in their operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="758" /> The Minister, I think, appreciates what I am trying to get at, that where there is a discharge which is causing grave pollution, as the Bill stands at the moment this discharge can continue until such time as the licence is either issued or refused.  I can accept what the Minister says in relation to an industrial project, that there could be serious consequences if a local authority were to refuse a licence.  A local authority which has such an industry in their area would be very slow to refuse such a licence in any case, because I doubt very much if they would be anxious to take responsibility for disemploying quite a number of people.</P>
    <P>I agree that in some instances it would be necessary to carry out possibly fairly lengthy investigations, but in relation to the problems which we have at present and to which the Minister referred, I would have thought that the local authorities would already have had a considerable amount of information long before this Bill was even introduced in regard to the difficulties and problems which arise from the discharge from these industries.  In fact, they have at present a responsibility in relation to them.  It would not take all that long for them to issue a licence, and there would be nothing to prevent them adding to that licence, as is allowed for in the Bill, the particular conditions under which this licence is issued.  In issuing to the industry or whatever it might be the licence with the conditions attached, the local authority would have the right to go ahead in relation to the efforts to prevent the continuation of this discharge.</P>
    <P>I was wondering while the Minister was speaking whether it might not be possible to amend slightly the amendment we have already submitted: &ldquo;A local authority shall issue a decision within a period of two months or, with the consent of the Minister, a longer period, on an application for a licence received under this section&rdquo;.  I am a little worried about the fact that while this Bill has very worthy objectives and, in my view, will, as I said in my Second Reading speech, do a great deal of good in regard to the question <Col N="759" /> of water pollution, the fact that there is no time limit imposed will allow an out which will, to some extent anyway, frustrate the worthwhile objectives of the Bill.  Is there not some way in which we could ensure that the local authority would issue a licence within a reasonable period?</P>
    <P>The local authority themselves know a good deal about the problems and difficulties within their own area in regard to industry and many other aspects of life also which are the cause of water pollution.  I do not feel it would take all that length of time to investigate those ones.  The investigations into the new ones might take longer.  While I understand the problems the Minister is facing, at the same time, if we leave it wide open as it is now, there could be instances where a particularly awkward case came before the local authority and the local authority would just put it to one side and not deal with it for a lengthy period. They might feel incapable of making a decision because they knew the decision would create other problems possibly for themselves.  In those instances, the very fact that there would be a time limit would force that situation. I appreciate that in certain industries a hasty or a wrong decision could be very harmful, but as the local authority are entitled not only to issue the licence but also to lay down the conditions, that aspect if it could be overcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner will appreciate that, having got rid of one set of appeals, I am not very anxious to have appeals under another heading coming in.  Therefore, I would not like to put into this Bill a provision that they would give the right to appeal after two months.  There is the right to an order of <i>mandamus.</i> What I would be prepared to do when the regulations are being sent out to the local authorities is to tell them that unless they were in a position to give a decision within a period&mdash;we can think about two or three months&mdash;we would require them to let us have a report as to why this has not been done, and we could then take the necessary administrative action in <Col N="760" /> order to speed it up.  Or if anybody felt he was being held up and reported the matter to the Department, we would take the matter up with the local authority.</P>
      <P>I do not want to tie the matter up any further because there can be exceptions. However, I can assure Deputy Faulkner that I am more than anxious that there would not be any unnecessary delay, and I would ask him to accept that assurance.</P>

      <P>While I accept the Minister's assurance, I am sure he is aware that planning authorities are not finding it too difficult to issue decisions within two months even in the most difficult of cases.  I hope there will be a sense of urgency in dealing with applications on the part of local authorities under this Bill.</P>
      <P>I would not like to see any of the provisions of this Bill becoming too flexible.  Flexibility is all right in respect of some legislation, but where the improvement and protection of the environment is concerned we must be very cautious about such flexibility.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister realises the importance of local authorities being adequately staffed to deal with applications under the Bill; otherwise it would be impossible for them to deal with applications within a reasonable period.  I am prepared to accept the Minister's assurances, particularly his assurance that the arrangements for the control of pollution will be reviewed after a reasonable period of experience of the operation of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In anticipation of this Bill, a discussion document was issued some time ago to all local authorities and was laid also before the House. This relates to practical aspects of implementation, including staffing, which are problems that will have to be dealt with.  There will be discussion in the very near future with the managers regarding staffing requirements.  I would assume that in respect of new industries decisions in relation to licences would be issued with the planning decision.  This will eliminate delays and will enable existing industries, for <Col N="761" /> instance, to continue, provided they had applied for exemption, until the decision was made.  It will be necessary to ensure that planning authorities, by reason of lack of action, do not allow existing pollutant industries to continue simply because they have applied.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputies opposite for the way in which they have dealt with this matter.  We are all anxious that the situation be tidied up in the best way possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, this is a situation in which we could have tabled an amendment.  However, I wish to discuss the matter.  Section 4, subsection (2) (b) says that subsection (1) does not apply to discharges from a sewer.  It may be said that to have a local authority licensing themselves is not a very sensible procedure.  The section gives to local authorities the right either to grant or to refuse licences.  Although the local authorities concerned would be the licensing bodies, they should have to go through all the procedures laid down for any other groups or individuals.  This is important.  It is said often, but I do not know with what degree of accuracy, that local authorities are the worst offenders at times in relation to water pollution.  In these circumstances I would consider it desirable that the local authority, as the licensing body, would fulfil all the requirements in regard to planning permission as must be fulfilled by industry, for example.</P>
      <P>The Minister should direct the carrying out of a survey by the local authorities in relation to ensuring that modern disposal systems were in use. In many areas there are systems which are not up to standard, some of them being in very poor condition.  A local authority which might not have sufficient financial provision could be in a situation where they would be insisting on certain conditions being fulfilled by industry while not taking any steps to provide modern disposal systems for themselves or one could visualise situations in which the Minister, who has power to prescribe standards in relation to effluent, might not press for changes because of financial considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The doubts we have in relation to the local authority being the responsible body in so far as a major part of the Bill is concerned are increased by the fact that local authorities themselves are not included.  I decided <Col N="763" /> neither to table an amendment nor to ask to have the subsection deleted but I consider it worth while having the matter discussed here in order to hear the Minister's views in this regard.</P>
    <P>The local authorities should be required to fulfil the same stringent conditions as apply to other groups or individuals and the one way in which we can provide for this is by exempting subsection (2) (b) from the conditions laid down in subsection (1) (a).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am well aware that many local authorities are polluters, they are the people who allow sewage into waters.  I have been criticising this for many years.  Every Government since the start of this State fell down in relation to money for our sanitary services.  When I took over less than four years ago there was only slightly over £8.3 million spent on sanitary services for the whole country.  Last year it cost £25 million and this year it will cost £25 million plus.  It is not meeting the requirements but there is a scarcity of money. We are doing the best we can.  The local authorities are the appropriate authorities to operate this Bill.  It would be ridiculous to say that the local authority should report and prosecute themselves.  That does not mean that we do not realise that a lot of things have to be done in regard to ensuring that where pollution is being caused by the local authorities steps should be taken to alleviate it.  The local authority could say that they will prepare the schemes which can be operated provided they get the money. In a period of two or three years we would not be able to produce enough money to solve all the problems. Deputy Faulkner must be aware that these problems exist in many towns. We can only meet the requirements in a planned way as we are doing now. The larger amounts of money are certainly improving the situation.  There are people who, having got primary and secondary treatment works in at a large cost are now insisting on tertiary treatment before others come into line with what they have already <Col N="764" /> got.  We must make sure that when we are notifying local authorities, we will try to ensure that they are aware of the fact that we expect them to do the best they possibly can.</P>
      <P>It is up to us and the Government to ensure that money will be available as soon as possible to provide for the type of sanitary services required.  The position under the Bill as regards the discharge from public sewers is that while they will not be licenseable under section 4, the Minister will have power to make regulations under section 26 prescribing standards for such discharge or for waters into which such discharges are made generally or in particular cases.  Where such regulations are made, there would be a statutory duty on the sanitary authority concerned to take steps as soon as practicable to ensure that the effluent does not contravene the regulations.  I know Deputy Faulkner did not put down an amendment but decided to have it discussed in this way.  I have no objection to that; it may serve a very useful purpose if it brings to the notice of the general public that every sanitary authority have not got the necessary up-to-date equipment, and that it must be provided as quickly as possible.  It would not be a good idea to ask the local authority to report and prosecute themselves if they are not meeting requirements.  For that reason the best we can do is leave it as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>My main object was to try to ensure that the local authority would have to accept the same stringent conditions that would be placed on an industry.  It would not be a good defence on the part of an industry which was creating a serious pollution problem to say that they could not afford a better system.  In section 4 subsection (9) we find that:</P>
      <P>A prosecution for an offence under this section may be taken by a local authority, a board of conservators, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries or any other person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In circumstances where effluent from a sewer was obviously creating a serious pollution problem there is <Col N="765" /> nothing to prevent another person from prosecuting the local authority. Admittedly, that would cost money and no doubt very many people would not do it.  Nevertheless, the fact is that it is possible and it would not simply be necessary for the local authority to take a case against itself.  I am uneasy about the situation.  It should be incumbent on the licensing authority, which will decide where they will grant refuse licences to any other group in relation to this matter, where possible to have the same standards. It would be ridiculous to have a situation where a licensing body would insist that certain conditions be fulfilled by an applicant when they on the other hand would have lower standards.  I agree that there are financial difficulties.  I will accept this if the Minister keeps an eye on local authorities and will take action on receipt of a complaint in relation to the activities of the authority.  It is vital that the local authority should give the example.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of local authorities have not got the equipment to improve sanitary services.  Incentives should be provided for people to build houses in isolated parts of the country where they can put in a septic tank and effluent can be disposed of without having to be treated.  That would relieve the situation in villages and towns.  Local authorities should be asked to build more rural houses.  The increasing amount of sewerage is a problem that has to be dealt with and I agree that it cannot be dealt with overnight but my suggestion would be a help.  Local authorities are being accused of being the greatest polluters because of the fact that the treatment of sewerage is such a big job.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is well aware of my approach to that problem.  Four years ago when I took over dealing with planning appeals, the regulations said that houses should only be allowed in settlements, in other words, towns and villages.  I think I have reversed that trend over the last four years.  Of course there will be building in towns and cities.  This is natural, but I have encouraged everybody who <Col N="766" /> wants to build in a country district where there is the incentive of a much cheaper site&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have encouraged all local authorities who have suitable applicants for local authority houses to build isolated cottages where sites are available for them.  I will do everything I can to encourage them to do this. Again and again local authorities have instructions to do this.  Some county managers are opposed to this kind of thing; I do not know why.  Public representatives should ensure that they do it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of who should be responsible for operating the Act, the local authority are the people who must do it.  When we talk about local authorities polluting I wish people would understand, including people who complain, that when we talk about the local authorities we talk about ourselves. The local authorities are our representatives.  We appoint people to them, we elect people to them, and those are the people who run the areas under this House.  There is no reason why anybody should try to create mystery about what is happening.  We have not the necessary money to do all the jobs.  We are doing everything we can, but it will be ridiculous if we create the situation where not alone are a local authority asked to report and to prosecute themselves, but where an individual should be entitled to prosecute a local authority over the sanitary services or lack of them in the area polluting rivers, streams and lakes and we, the public, would pay whatever fine was imposed and would also pay the court costs.  There would be a net loss to everybody and nobody would gain as a result of such a court case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we want to ensure that a very tight monitoring system is carried out on discharges into lakes and rivers by local authorities, we must have a reasonable approach and accept where responsibility lies.  As far as I am concerned I am as anxious as anyone to see this matter dealt with as quickly as possible but I do not believe the suggestion made would be the best <Col N="767" /> way to deal with it.  We can deal with it properly under the Bill as it is going through.  I give my word that I will do everything I can to ensure that there will be no breaches by local authorities where this matter is being dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We should face this problem in a frank, sincere and serious manner.  There is great disquiet among the general public, particularly among the environmentalists, those interested in fishing, tourism and in the protection of our amenities, about the fact that this exemption is provided for in this Bill.  There is great public concern about the fact that local authorities can keep on polluting rivers, streams and lakes.</P>
      <P>This is a financial problem.  It is very important that a planned system of priorities should be prepared as soon as possible and a programme drawn up over a period of five years or so which would eliminate pollution completely in the areas of major contention and disquiet.  The Minister referred to a number of local authorities having sewerage plants installed adjacent to rivers and lakes at large cost to the ratepayers and taxpayers and they are now looking for a third stage or tertiary treatment unit.  I understand that there is another system under consideration at present whereby chemicals would be applied to the existing treatment works.  This system is known as chemical precipitation. If it is successful it could mean that the third stage treatment could be carried out at far lesser cost than was possible a few years back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another source of pollution which is very serious, as expert advice shows, is the discharge from sheep dipping tanks.  The position is so serious that it may be necessary to restrict discharge from sheep dipping tanks into the sea, into tidal waters, despite the fact that it may have to be piped a considerable distance or there may be a soakaway adjacent to tidal waters or to the sea.  If this is so, how serious is the position in relation to septic tanks adjacent to sheep dipping tanks which are near rivers and streams?  This <Col N="768" /> must surely kill off any form of fish life in these rivers and streams.</P>
    <P>The areas of high amenity and tourism value as well as areas which are renowned for fishing should get priority in any such schemes.  The Minister should exercise some form of control over the discharge from local authority sewers.  Perhaps he could set himself or his Department up as the licensing authority in this regard.  I see no reason why he should not insist on local authorities applying for licences to him or to the environmental section of his Department.</P>
    <P>The public are very concerned that local authorities can carry on polluting by discharge from a sewer, which by the interpretation of this section includes sewerage treatment or disposal works of a sanitary authority.  The Bill is weakened considerably by virtue of the fact that the local authorities can discharge untreated sewage in some cases into lakes, rivers and streams.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the Minister has power to prescribe effluent standards which would be binding on local authorities but that is not the answer to the problem.  There should be some commitment involving improved and effective management of existing systems, commencing with an early review of the systems.  The need for the control of discharges from public sewers should be included in the review of the Bill referred to by the Minister when it becomes law.</P>
    <P>We must face the fact that the main problem is a financial one.  Some scheme should be established whereby local authorities would fix their priorities within a reasonable period, have the cost of eliminating pollution estimated and submit the overall cost to the Minister.  Some years ago an effort was made to have this costed.  That would be out of all proportion in relation to present day costs.  I urge the Minister to set such a scheme in motion as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I do not know what Deputy O'Leary has against the poor farmers.  Having had a go at the man with the cattle, he now has something to say about the man who is dipping sheep and what happens to the effluent <Col N="769" /> when he is finished dipping them.  This is covered completely in the Bill.  All these matters are adequately covered and there is no way in which somebody who uses toxic material&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We propose to prevent uncontrolled discharges from sheep dipping tanks.  That is not the most serious problem.  There is a far more serious problem from industrial effluent which is doing a lot more damage. When Deputy O'Leary did not mention those and did mention sheep I wondered if he had a particular reason.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all right to say there must be special controls and there must be a special study of municipal sewage, and so on.  One thing we need is more money.  We are getting as much money as we can.  In my short time here we have expended about £30 million on sanitary services, £30 million on the sewage end of sanitary services.  If water schemes had not to be dealt with, we could spend a lot more money on the other side of it, but water schemes have to be dealt with and have to get more than their fair share of the money.  We are putting as much money as we can into it.  We are putting in a tremendous amount as against one-sixth in the previous four years.  It would not be right to say we are not paying the necessary attention to it.  The plain facts are that the Bill remedies a great many problems.  It will not remedy the problems of sewage from towns and cities.  We can only do that if we get effective ways of doing it.  That requires money and the money will be provided as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of the tertiary treatment, there are not only <Col N="770" /> two as Deputy O'Leary said but 100 different ways in which people think the problem can be solved.  In his own area at present an experiment is being carried on in Killarney to find out how one type of treatment would work.  We have a report coming to the Westmeath County Council on a proposal for another type of treatment.  I met a person recently who told me that they had cleared the lakes between Canada and America of sewage very effectively by tying bags of bluestone to motor boats and driving them up and down the lakes.  Everybody has his own idea about how these things should be done.</P>
    <P>The tertiary treatment has been suggested by certain interested bodies. There are lobbies in this as well as everything else.  They usually consist of people who, no matter how well meaning they may be, have very effective water sewerage schemes in their own areas and therefore do not worry very much about those who have not.  They forget that not only does the installation of the tertiary system cost a sizeable amount of money but there is also an annual payment which has to be made available. Until we are satisfied about one which will work, it would be wrong to expend some of the scarce finances on those schemes, not because we do not want to do it but for that reason.</P>
    <P>I think we have established the fact that we are aware of what should be done.  A continuing and increasing amount of money will have to be made available for sewerage schemes. For years local authorities have been preparing these schemes and presenting them to the Department.  I believe one of my predecessors got a proposal about all the water and sewerage schemes then required in the country, and the figure of £36 million nearly made him faint even though he was a strong man.  That was some years ago.  Now £36 million will finance little more than one year's output. Local authorities can bring their proposals up to date.  Some of them are a little doubtful as to which comes first and the representatives on the local authorities tend to differ as to which should come first.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="771" /> I want to make it clear that when the documentation is finalised and cleared in my Department if a scheme is third, fourth or fifth on the list submitted by the county, we cannot be blamed if the allocation of money goes to one higher up on the list.  This is a lesson which might be learned by many people when they are sending in their schemes because they tend to clear and finalise one which is much further down than the one they want to deal with principally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the £36 million, which nearly made somebody faint, and the small effect it would have today.  This underlines the fact that it is useless to compare the amount of money being spent now with the amount of money spent previously unless inflation is taken into account.  In replying to what I said on this matter, the Minister said that if the local authorities were brought to court we would all have to pay.  That is true but to quite a considerable extent we all have to pay when an industry is brought to court. Usually they will recoup their money in some other way, perhaps by increasing prices if the fines were all that big. While that may be so, it is incumbent on us to ensure that the local authorities who are the licensing people have as rigid and as stringent conditions imposed on themselves as they would impose on other people.</P>
      <P>We have discussed this matter for a long time and I do not think it is necessary to discuss it any further. There are one or two questions I should like to ask the Minister.  One relates to the matter I raised earlier with regard to discharges from road tankers and mobile containers.</P>

People recognise that unless they are eternally vigilant such damage could be done to our natural surroundings as would have very serious consequences for all of us.  I think it is accepted that if a person were to get a licence in these circumstances, on the basis of false or misleading information, it could have very serious consequences.

It is in many other Acts, the Planning Act particularly, and it appears to be operating satisfactorily.  It means that if somebody makes a statement and he claims afterwards that he did not understand at the time or did not know something it might be a defence, but if he knew it and cannot prove that he did not know it, then it is false and misleading and to his knowledge.</P>

There is nothing extraordinary or unusual about it.  It is a section that has been found to be very useful in the 1963 Planning Act and it is also in the new Planning Bill. When you find something works well, you put it in and use it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>To revert to the first question put by Deputy O'Leary on subsection (2), I have a note on the side of the Bill asking as the Minister asked, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; The Minister will make regulations in regard to the licences. Investigation may be necessary.  For example, an industry is causing pollution and an investigation may be necessary to determine what is the extent of the pollution, and to consider what conditions will be necessary to attach <Col N="777" /> to the licence which will be imposed on the industry and so on.  This is all in the cause of improving the situation and the purity of the water.</P>
      <P>I wonder why an industry which might have been causing this pollution for many years should now be charged a certain amount of the cost of this investigation.  I would have thought the licensing authority would carry out an investigation, pay for it and then issue the licence with conditions attached.  It would be a different matter if the industry were told that they were committing an offence and because they continued to commit the offence, an investigation was necessary.  Then I agree they would have to pay the expenses.  In this case where the whole function is of importance and of benefit to the public generally, I cannot understand why we should have a subsection which would require the applicant to defray or contribute towards the cost of the investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner is missing the point.  These are regulations I may make which may require an applicant to pay whole or part of the cost.  We are talking about somebody who is causing what may be major pollution.  In such a case it may be necessary to spend a very sizeable sum to find out if he is.  I am suggesting in this Bill that I may make regulations which will allow the local authority to recover all or part of this money from the firm concerned.</P>
      <P>At present certain firms have paid substantial sums for this purpose.  I was not allowed do it in the Planning Bill but I would have considered it reasonable&mdash;and I said so in an amendment which I had to take out of the Bill&mdash;to make people who cause extensive investigations to be carried out pay a share of the expenses. Deputy Faulkner spoke about somebody doing this for the good of humanity and said that everybody would be helped by it.  The whole cause of the investigation is that somebody was harming the amenities of other people by causing pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EEC have been discussing, approved and I hope will make a regulation which they call polluter <Col N="778" /> pays.  I would be in favour of that.  I do not believe the general public should be asked to put their hands in their pockets to pay for something someone else is doing.  We have too much of this going on at the moment. I can see nothing wrong in asking these firms to make a contribution.  I am sure it will be dealt with in a reasonable way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner appears to have in mind that a firm might be put out of business because they would be asked to pay more than they could afford.  That is not likely to happen. If a firm are causing pollution and insist that they are not but try to prevent the operation of the Act to such an extent that expensive, or maybe not so expensive, investigations have to be carried out, there is nothing wrong in insisting that they be asked to pay some of the costs.  It is not a question of trying to punish people who are in the right but people in the wrong should be prepared to contribute towards the public purse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Minister says about polluter pays which is generally accepted by the EEC.  As I understand it, the polluter who is deliberately causing pollution must pay.  That is acceptable in these circumstances if the polluter believes he is not causing pollution and somebody else says he is.  This is a new Bill under which an investigation will take place.  The investigation will decide whether that person is creating a pollution problem.  At that point the local authority are entitled to issue him with a licence with conditions attached to it. If he does not act in a way to reduce or end pollution, then I can understand his having to pay.  That is how I interpret the polluter pays.</P>
      <P>The Minister possibly misunderstood me because he said that I had said the person in those circumstances was doing a benefit to humanity.  What I actually said was that this investigation carried out by the licensing authority would ultimately result in a benefit to humanity in general because it would prove whether pollution was present. If it was present, the authority could insist on action being taken to ensure that the pollution was abated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="779" /> I believe that when you talk about the polluter paying you are really saying that where a person in full knowledge, and having been forewarned deliberately continues to pollute the water.  I fully accept he should be brought to court, have to pay fines and pay for any investigations that are necessary.  But this is a different matter. The licensing authority will carry out this investigation to decide whether what he says or what they say is correct. If they decide ultimately that what they say is correct, then they can issue a licence with conditions and if he does not fulfil them, he is liable to prosecution, to be fined and he should have to pay for any further investigations necessary.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, the investigation referred to in this section is in the public interest generally and, therefore, should be paid for out of public funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a question of dealing with regulations.  Industry generally do not take the same view as Deputy Faulkner.  We are putting in the provision that an applicant is required to contribute towards the cost in cases where a special or unusual investigation is carried out by a local authority, to enable that to be done. The licensing authority would not do this in every case and this can be put in the regulations.  We will also put in the regulations that where there are exceptional circumstances or excessive costs, all or portion of the costs should be borne by the firm.  We will have large multi-national industries coming to this country.  If we did not include this provision, we would not get one red cent from them.  At present most of these firms would be prepared to pay a reasonable amount towards the costs.  In my view we are protecting ourselves by giving authority in this case to make regulations which will allow this to be done.</P>

      <P>If the person who made the application insisted and said they were not causing pollution and we insisted on having certain tests carried out and eventually after spending a lot of the people's money it was proved that it was a pollutant, I see no reason why the firm should not be asked to pay some or all of that cost.  Industry should be prepared to accept that.  If there was a fairly expensive investigation carried out, where a firm was concerned, I see no reason why they should not be asked to contribute and I do not think industry see any reason why they should not.  I am not talking about ordinary simple ones which might cost a small amount of money.  There are special circumstances and if we do not put it in this Bill, then we will not be able to make the regulations.  If we cannot make them we cannot get any money from those people.  This is reasonable.</P>

Unfortunately, it is possible to get people to prove one thing or the <Col N="781" /> other.  If you keep travelling around enough you will be able to get somebody to believe the point of view held by everybody else.  Deputy Faulkner is as well aware of this as I am.  I do not think we are talking about that at all.  We are talking about where people will be involved in industry and where there is a question of cost.  I do not believe that the public should have to bear all the cost of cases where they are not responsible for the extra cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This subsection deals only with the register of abstractions by local authorities from waters in their functional areas.  The Bill does not provide for control of water abstractions.  Such control would be more appropriate to some future measure dealing with the regulation of water resources.  Water abstraction has, however, a considerable bearing on pollution control since major abstractions can reduce the assimilative capacity of a river or lake.  That is what Deputy Faulkner was talking about earlier when he spoke about all the pollution last summer.  The water was down so low that it looked a lot worse than it was.  It is necessary, therefore, that local authorities should keep a register, at least, of significant abstractions.  The requirement in this subsection that a register be kept of water abstractions will also facilitate the compilation of comprehensive data on water resources.</P>

If some industry were to take a few thousand gallons of water out of it, it would have to be recorded. Casual abstractions of small amounts will not have to be recorded.  There is no danger in this at all.  It is quite a simple matter.  It gives some facilities to local authorities.</P>

      <P>In many rivers valuable fisheries exist where no right of ownership is exercised.  Thousands of pounds worth of damage can be done and because ownership is not exercised no claim can be made under existing law for damages.  A very considerable stretch of river could be involved.  In the west this could apply to a complete tributory or catchment. The purpose of this amendment is to give power to the board or to the local authority to sue for damages where damage is done to fisheries and where no claim is being lodged by the private owners or by the person who may have the right to do so but who, for one reason or another, is not exercising that right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that what is meant is that if a contravention of section 3 (1) or section 4 (1) takes place the owner of the fisheries concerned would be the person to take action in defence of his property.

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) A local authority may recover the cost of steps taken under subsection (1) from another local authority or from a sanitary authority, where its acts or omissions necessitated such steps&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, there is a feeling, whether it be true or false, among the public that local authorities are themselves very often offenders where pollution is concerned and they feel it is like setting a thief to catch a thief to appoint local authorities in charge. I am inclined to agree with the Minister that there is not much option though the Minister said that at a later date it might be possible to introduce some better system.  Now we should be seen to be ensuring that local authorities will act within the law in the same way as the industrialist, the agriculturalist or the individual.  One way of ensuring that local authorities comply with the law is by making them liable for damages, costs and so on. That would make them more careful. If a local authority can recover from a neighbouring local authority, the latter will be very careful to ensure it does not offend.  This amendment would ensure that local authorities would be particularly careful in the matter of containing water pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised this amendment is unnecessary because the power <Col N="791" /> it proposes to confer on a local authority is already contained in section 13. Section 13 (2) enables a local authority to recover the cost of any steps it has taken under subsection 1 from such person as it satisfies the court is the person whose act or omission necessitated such steps.  The Interpretation Act, 1937, provides that the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as importing a body corporate, whether a corporation aggregate or a corporation sole, and an unincorporated body of persons as well as an individual. Local authorities and sanitary authorities, therefore, come within the definition of &ldquo;person&rdquo; and recovery of costs from another local authority or sanitary authority is, therefore, covered in the section.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the amendment be withdrawn.  It is rather interesting because, when Deputy Faulkner was speaking, I was thinking that one of the cases which might occur when this Bill becomes law would involve Drogheda Corporation.  Again and again, Drogheda Corporation have been accused of polluting the beaches at Mornington, Bettystown and Laytown and Deputy Faulkner and I might very well find ourselves on the opposite side of the fence if such a court case cropped up.  It would be interesting finding out what evidence might be produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree the local authority have the power to prosecute and recover damages and costs, nevertheless I believe it would be salutary for us to direct the attention of local authorities specifically by the insertion of this amendment because it would clearly identify the local authority aspect of the matter.  While local authorities will not be slow to take action in dealing with individual cases, I have grave doubts as to whether they will make quite the same effort to recover from other local authorities. Local authorities will be responsible for the implementation of the Bill.  They will be the licensing authority and so on.  The more emphasis we place on the fact that they must come within the scope of the Bill the same as any other <Col N="792" /> individual, the better.  It is because of this line of thought that we tabled this amendment.  We recognised that a local authority already had the power to deal with &ldquo;any person&rdquo; and, as the Minister has said, &ldquo;any person&rdquo; could mean another local authority.  It is incumbent on us to impress on the local authorities in every way possible how important it is for them, the authority responsible under this Bill for dealing with pollution, to recognise that they are not there to ensure that others preserve the environment but that they also have a grave responsibility in this matter. If the amendment was accepted, that emphasis, as far as the general public are concerned, would be placed on local authorities.  I agree that &ldquo;person&rdquo; in the circumstances will include local authorities but nobody else outside the legal profession or those deeply interested in this matter realise this.  They are of the opinion that nobody is involved here except private individuals, industries or other groups.</P>

      <P>I cannot see the point in having this section when local authorities are allowed to discharge from sewers into lakes, rivers and streams.  The section permits a local authority, which could be a major polluter but which would not come within the ambit of the Bill, to take proceedings against another local authority in respect of what could be a minor matter.  Until such time as local authorities are obliged to licence their own sewers this section should not be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I find this extraordinary. Deputy O'Leary has put his name to an amendment to the effect that a local authority may recover the cost of steps taken under subsection (1) from another local authority or from a sanitary authority, where its acts or omissions necessitated such steps. Even though this was debated fully and an amendment withdrawn by Deputy Faulkner, Deputy O'Leary wants the same thing, which is included in section 13, withdrawn completely. We will never get legislation through the House if Members change their mind every five minutes.  I can see no reason why we should not <Col N="794" /> include in this section the provision to ensure that if a local authority deliberately continue to pollute waters flowing into the area of another local authority&mdash;we have enough of this on the continent between Germany, Belgium and Holland&mdash;the authority suffering the pollution should be entitled to take the necessary steps. That is included in the Bill, but Deputy O'Leary now says this should not be done.  I do not think action will be taken very often because it will not arise very often.  But the fact that it may arise only once in 25 years does not mean that it should not be the law of the land.</P>
      <P>The omissions referred to by Deputy O'Leary are included.  I believe the section is as perfect as such sections can be.  We should leave it as it is. Deputy O'Leary talked about a local authority that is a major pollutant of its own waters.  There is no way of stopping that authority; one cannot tell them to stop the sewage going into the river or lake until the necessary money is spent to prevent it.</P>

The rates of subsidy range from 40 per cent to 60 per cent of loan charges, depending on the location of the scheme, and are regarded as adequate. An additional 25 per cent is payable in respect of schemes in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
      <P>I would point out that the main reason for overloaded or inadequate sewerage systems is underinvestment in the past.  The capital allocation for sanitary services has, however, been substantially increased in recent years and the ongoing sanitary services programmes include a significant number of schemes designed to provide and improve arrangements for the final disposal of sewage so as to ensure that such disposal will not seriously affect the environment.  It is my intention that this policy will be continued until all locations at which serious pollution problems may be occurring, or where there is a danger that they might occur, are dealt with.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Deputy has been making representations, as have other Cork Deputies and councillors. Cork is a very big county and we have given them a big amount of money.

I have given the Deputy the fact that there are no schemes before the Department and that this will not come for a preliminary debate by the county council until 14th March next.  In view of the fact that it will be coming before the county council, who are apparently now taking an interest in it, the councillors are the people who should put the necessary pressure on to have it moved in the direction of the Custom House.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that either there is a priority list or there is not.  It is No. 10 on the list in Donegal.  The Donegal County Council would be the first to complain if we jumped that scheme over those that are higher on the list and they would be perfectly entitled to do so.  I agree with the Deputy that this appears to be a scheme which merits quite high priority but I cannot change the regulations which are made at local level in this case.

      <P>Local authorities are finding it difficult enough to get dumps where they can put the refuse for which they are responsible.  For that reason I should hate to enter into any kind of agreement that they should also be responsible for private firms. I am sure it would be possible to make an arrangement between private firms and people who have dumps for the disposal of waste.  I think it would be very foolish of local authorities to become involved in something like that but if they do become involved I think they are entitled to charge what they consider to be a reasonable rate.  I would not have a function in fixing such a charge.</P>

      <P>I have a note here which says that a further effort to obtain possession was made in November, 1975, but Messrs. A.D. Comyn, solicitors, Loughrea, stated the registered owner of the lands had died in 1974 and they had been unable to get any instructions from his widow who lived in Dublin.  Following a report on the use being made of the land, the case was referred to the Land Commission solicitor of 18th June, 1976, to proceed for an order for possession. The solicitor is awaiting a reply to his recent letter to Messrs. M.T.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>From figures available to AnCO and from the results of a number of surveys carried out by AnCO, it is estimated that there are between 400 and 500 apprentices out of work at present.  The trades most affected are construction, motor and electrical associated with construction. Unemployment among apprentices rose rapidly around September/ October, 1974, but it has been relatively stable since then.  In all about 1,600 apprentices have been notified to the training authority as redundant since that time but their surveys have established that the great majority of them have found alternative employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All apprentices notified to AnCO as being out of work are advised by letter to register with the National Manpower Service and to contact the nearest AnCO training centre.  Where <Col N="810" /> out of work apprentices contact AnCO training centres arrangements are made to provide training.  Three hundred and forty-three out-of-work apprentices were given training by the training authority in 1975 and approximately 400 in 1976.</P>
    <P>AnCO is somewhat disappointed with the response by apprentices to the invitation to present themselves for these courses and could accommodate more apprentices if they would come forward.</P>
    <P>To improve the future supply of skilled workers, AnCO have provided training for substantial numbers of first year apprentices over and above those taken on by employers.  About 500 such apprentices were taken on in 1975 by AnCO and over 800 in 1976.  AnCO are prepared to take on a similar number in the present year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that apprentices who do not complete their training, even though they obtain alternative employment, are probably lost to that craft or trade in which they trained?  While the Minister stated that there are not sufficient apprentices now, is it not as a result of loss of confidence because of termination of apprenticeships?  Would he not agree that there should be some subvention made to employers to enable them to keep those apprentices in employment until they have completed their training?</P>

      <P>As I have already explained, the training authority are making provision to continue the training of apprentices who have lost their employment in training, and we are making similar plans in the present year.  However, the figures suggest the situation is improving and that the problem is decreasing in its extent compared with last year and the year before. I would also state that the surveys conducted by the training authority suggest that the figures of unemployed apprentices must be treated with some caution, because although figures notified officially to the training authority indicated that a certain number of apprentices have been unemployed, later surveys have shown that the figures were not quite accurate.  However, <Col N="811" /> AnCO continue to make such surveys and to make arrangements for apprentices who find themselves out of work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to an earlier question regarding Dr. Lamont's position on 10th November last, it is not possible for the Government to make representations to the illegal Rhodesian regime, as, in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions we do not recognise or have diplomatic relations with it.</P>
      <P>At that time I expressed the hope that Dr. Lamont would remain free to continue with the good work which he has long carried out for the people of his diocese.  I wish to make it clear that we deplore any action taken by the illegal regime which will prevent him from doing so.  Such action, if carried out in the face of the protests it has aroused, will serve only to emphasise the necessity for the regime to agree without delay to a settlement acceptable to the international community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will note that I did not ask whether the Government would make representations to an illegal regime but whether they would protest at the decision to deport Dr. Lamont from Rhodesia.  I take it from the reply that the Government have not made any protest, through any channel, in regard to this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  The Government's position is that a protest would represent a formal contact and this is precluded by reason of the UN resolution.  As I told the Deputy in November last, before the decision to deport Dr. Lamont was taken, we made representations to other governments with which we are in friendly contact asking them to bring to bear on Rhodesia any pressure possible in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears, therefore, that we are prevented from making any protest against regimes with which we do not have diplomatic relations even in cases where the rights of our citizens are concerned.  Is that not a hopeless position as instanced by the Lamont case which concerns a man who represents the rights and freedoms of many people in Africa?  Is <Col N="814" /> there no way, through the UN or otherwise, that we could protest formally against the deportation order or are we to appear to acquiesce in the situation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be surprised to hear that I agree that it is a difficult matter when one is limited by what is in effect a boycott resolution. A country that is party to such a resolution must take the consequences as we have witnessed in this case.  We are limited in regard to the protest we can make to the regime concerned but in a way we are to blame for that situation.</P>
      <P>In regard to whether we are acquiescing the Deputy will appreciate that a protest is merely an expression of feeling.  The Rhodesian government, by reason of this exchange of views, if nothing else, will know our position in relation to Dr. Lamont.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the IDA that they declined <Col N="816" /> to give a training grant to the company in question because of the absence of a long term development programme and because of the poor trading results at the time.  The function of AnCO in this case was to advise the IDA whether training carried out was of such a nature as to qualify for a grant.</P>
      <P>The IDA met a representative of the company on 20th January, 1977 and informed him that they would consider a training grant for the company if a long term development programme could be put forward and if the trading trends, which had improved, continued to show this improvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the &ldquo;Guaranteed Irish&rdquo; mark is to identify those products which are substantially of Irish manufacture and in relation to the products to guarantee compliance by the manufacturer with certain criteria designed for the protection of the consumer.  To qualify for the use of the mark the value added in Ireland in the case of a product must represent not less than 40 per cent of the ex-factory price.  This criterion is realistic having regard to the country's heavy reliance on imported materials and components.  The objective of identifying goods which are substantially of Irish manufacture and stimulating consumer support for them is being achieved and the Minister does not propose at this stage to recommend to the Irish Goods Council that the conditions for the use of the mark should be altered.</P>

That may cause the Deputy surprise but the &ldquo;Guaranteed Irish&rdquo; badge is not given to a company or to an overall spread of products, but product by product and each product must conform to the criteria I have mentioned, namely that 40 per cent of the ex-factory price of value is added in Ireland.  Even in the case of the products that the Deputy has in mind I take it that 40 per cent of their value has been put on here by labour, assembly and so on.</P>

      <P>There has been a curtailment in services which were provided for children attending this school.  When we made complaints the situation was eased somewhat. Arrangements were made for the children to be brought back in ambulances, but some of them were carried all over the country.  Would it be possible for the Minister to have a look at it and to arrange to have pick-up points?  Parents of these children have agreed to travel to selected areas to meet the minibus or whatever mode of transport it used and pick up the children if they could be guaranteed that the minibus would be there at a particular time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I made inquiries of the North Western Health Board, and I am informed that there has been no curtailment in the service.  The position is that up to mid-1976 these children were brought from Cregg House, Sligo to Donegal and to points south of Donegal as well.  The arrangement was that parents beyond Donegal town would collect the <Col N="818" /> children in Donegal town on Friday afternoon and return them to Donegal town where they would be picked up by minibus or ambulance and transported to Cregg House.</P>

      <P>What the Minister says is not quite correct.  That was the position.  The question refers to whether the Minister is aware that that type of service ceased and was replaced by a rather uncertain situation of being transported by ambulance when it is available.  This situation in the case of handicapped children causes grave hardship because the ambulance is not always available at the same time, and even when it is expected it has been as late as two hours arriving at Donegal, either dropping children or picking them up as the case may be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few questions I would like to ask the Minister.  We have been discussing the responsibilities of local authorities and of sanitary authorities.  Section 14 (1) puts an onus on the person responsible for an accidental spillage, discharge or deposit of any polluting matter which enters or is likely to enter waters or a sewer to make this information available to the local authority as quickly as possible.  What is the position in relation to the local authority themselves or to the sanitary authority in their respective areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean the local authoriy should notify themselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the local authority might notify the sanitary authority where the sanitary authority are the authority, or <i>vice versa.</i> Is there any onus on one to notify the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that the local authority and the sanitary authority, even though they have divided responsibilities&mdash;some under the health board and some under the local authorities&mdash;work together and there is no necessity to have this matter dealth with in the way the Deputy suggests.  I believe there is adequate provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate from the discussions this morning on the other sections that what I am mainly concerned with here is that the local or the sanitary authority, as being the authority responsible for the control of this work under the Bill, should have the same conditions applying to them as they would apply to others.  In other words, they can issue a licence to an industrialist, for example, and attach stringent conditions to that licence but they themselves will not necessarily comply with the same standards. <Col N="826" /> In this section the local authority can prosecute a person who does not notify the local authority or the sanitary authority in relation to an accidental discharge.  Again I emphasise the point I have been making all the time, that the local authorities should, in so far as is possible, be bound by the same conditions as the people who will be responsible to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid Deputy Faulkner has not quite grasped it. The sanitary authority referred to here would be, for instance, an urban district council.  They would not be a local authority for the purpose of this Bill.  The county council would be the local authority and the sanitary authority would be the urban district council.  If a spillage occurred and the sanitary authority were responsible, naturally they would have to notify the local authority.  That is laid down in the Bill.  I think Deputy Faulkner was thinking, as I was earlier, that we were talking about the officials of the health boards or something like that.  There would be the same manager anyway and in many cases the same engineer under either authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I think the Minister would agree that it might be better to say that he did not clearly understand it either.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 11, subsection (1), line 38, to delete &ldquo;may and, if so directed by the Minister,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the amendment is agreed section 15 (1) will read: &ldquo;A local authority shall make a water quality management <Col N="827" /> plan for any waters situated in its functional area or which adjoin that area&rdquo;.  This amendment is very important.  What we propose is basic to the good or proper operation of the Act when it comes into being.  If local authorities are left to their own devices and especially if sufficient money is not immediately available, then the water quality management plan can and will be put on the long finger and the whole purpose of the Bill could be defeated to quite an extent.</P>
    <P>Section 15 (2) states:</P>
    <P>A plan under this section shall contain such objectives for the prevention and abatement of pollution of the waters the subject of the plan and such other provisions as appear to the local authority to be necessary.</P>
    <P>There should be no deferment of the preparation of this plan because surely it will not be possible to tackle a problem of this magnitude unless we know what our objectives are.  There may not be all that great difficulty in seeing what measures are necessary to control the pollution problems which face any local authority at a given moment, but that is quite a different matter from having a plan laid out which will enable the authority not only to overcome the water pollution problems which face them but also to plan ahead so as to remove the immediate problems and to ensure that the work being done by the local authorities in this field will have a lasting effect.  In any aspect of life it is of vital importance that we should have a very clear indication as to where we are going in a matter such as this if we are to succeed in overcoming the problems which are there.</P>
    <P>The local authorities will know the specific water pollution problems in their own areas which must be tackled as quickly as possible.  To some extent that could be done on a piecemeal basis.  The basic objective of the Bill is not only to overcome the problems which face us at the moment, but also to ensure that we will be able to get into a controlling situation, as it were, of this very grave problem and be able to keep it under control.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" /> For those reasons there should be no delay in drawing up a plan of this kind.  It is vitally important that the local authority should know the problems which exist within their boundaries and that a plan should be drawn up to deal with them and the priorities decided on.  I strongly urge the Minister to accept this amendment.  Quite frankly, I cannot understand why we should have the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; first and then the words &ldquo;if so directed by the Minister&rdquo;.  Once this Bill is passed, surely it becomes incumbent on local authorities to prepare a plan for the control and abatement of the pollution problems in their areas.  I strongly recommend that this proposal put down by Deputy O'Leary and myself should be adopted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly Deputy Faulkner may have missed the intention of the section, because the quotation he gave was not complete. He left out an important word. Section 15 (1) provides: &ldquo;A local authority may and, if so directed by the Minister, shall . . . &rdquo; Deputy Faulkner left out the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. I think he will admit there is a big difference between what he said and what is in the section.  We propose in the Bill that a local authority may do so.  It is expected that initially plans will be made only for the more important river catchments.  If an important one is left out, the Minister may direct that a plan be made and the local authority shall do so if so directed.  That is an entirely different matter from what Deputy Faulkner has been saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention behind section 15 is to enable local authorities to make water quality management plans commencing with the more important river catchments.  I should explain that the making of a water quality management plan will involve rather complex and detailed investigations, including qualitative and quantitative assessments of water resources, the surveying of all discharges to and abstractions from waters in the catchment and defining all existing and potential water uses.  There will also be need for detailed consultation with a wide variety of interests in relation <Col N="829" /> to the setting of objectives in the plan for prevention and abatement of pollution in the waters concerned.</P>
    <P>It can be seen therefore that this amendment, which proposes to place a statutory duty on all local authorities to prepare plans for all catchments immediately the section comes into operation, would impose an intolerable burden on some local authorities and there would be a distinct danger that it would tend to frustrate the purpose of the section.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the reserve power in the section whereby the Minister may require local authorities to make plans for particular waters is quite adequate to deal with a situation where a local authority may be slow to exercise their power under this section in respect of an important catchment. Therefore I would ask that the amendment be withdrawn.  It is not possible to do what is suggested and it would not help to have it there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though I may not have read all the section, there is no question about whether I understood it.  We suggest that &ldquo;may and, if so directed by the Minister&rdquo; should be deleted to ensure that it would be incumbent on the local authorities to provide a water quality management plan.  The Minister says&mdash;and I have no doubt this is a fact&mdash;that a complex and detailed examination is necessary before such a plan can be provided. I cannot understand why there should be any delay because, while I would accept that a complex and detailed examination is necessary, nevertheless to me that would be all the more reason why we should insist that the local authorities begin at once to make this plan available.</P>

    <P>Is it not obvious that if the local authorities are left to their own devices in relation to this matter and if this examination and investigation and all the other matters referred to by the Minister in his reply, are necessary, and that this will be costly to some extent, they will put it further on the long finger?  Ultimately when it is discovered that they have been negligent &mdash;possibly some local authority may be negligent in the performance of their duties&mdash;and when the Minister, in <Col N="830" /> accordance with the section as it is at the moment directs them to do it, they will then only be beginning on the work they should be beginning on immediately.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that we should not ensure that the local authorities would commence this work as soon as this Bill passes through the Houses.  It refers not only to their own functional area but to adjoining areas.  This means that, if the local authority decide to go ahead and carry out all the necessary discussions and investigations on the plan for their own functional area, and the next local authority do not, the whole situation is complicated in the sense that they will not be able to carry out the function laid down for them in this subsection which relates to the performance of their duties.</P>
    <P>If we are to be really effective in putting the provisions of this Bill into operation, it is essential that the local authorities should get moving at once on their plans and co-operate with one another, as suggested in the subsection, so that they will not only know what their objectives are in relation to their own functional area but they will also know the objectives of the local authority in the next area and can correlate those objectives and come to a decision as to what should be done in respect of the adjoining areas.  I do not see any reason why this should be delayed.</P>
    <P>The Minister said what was likely to happen was that where a local authority did not carry out their function in relation to their own area, and if that persisted for some time, he could intervene and see to it that the authority did their duty in that respect. Because what is done in one local authority area has such an effect on the matters under discussion here in another local authority area, it would not be wise to allow any of them not to carry out their functions immediately.</P>
    <P>Let us take, for example, the case where a river flows through one county and then through another county.  If the local authority on the lower reaches define their objectives, prepare their plan, and so on, and the local authority on the upper reaches do not, whatever pollution is caused in the latter <Col N="831" /> area is carried into the other and damages the work done by the authority who decided it was necessary to go ahead with their plans at once.  I agree with what the Minister said about the amount of thought, planning, discussion, investigation, and so on, which is necessary.  But I can see no reason why it should be put off.</P>
    <P>What is basically important here is that the objectives must be known because people cannot work towards objectives unless they know what these are.  If objectives are decided on in one local authority area&mdash;where a local authority has a responsibility in this Bill for areas along its borders&mdash;then it is very difficult for the other local authorities to define what their objectives are and certainly very difficult for them to carry out the function they are intended to carry out.  I am not convinced by the Minister's arguments. First, we have a very important plan to be laid down which will contain the objectives of the local authority and why we should say they &ldquo;may&rdquo; do it or, if directed by the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; do it, I cannot see.  We should tell them in this Bill that they should do it, that it must be done, that we must have a programme for the country that is correlated and linked so that we can make a worth-while effort at controlling and containing this problem.</P>

      <P>I fully support the amendment, which I think is very important.  The making of a water quality management plan is fundamental to the Bill.  There is a great danger that some, perhaps a few local authorities or the odd one, may be very slow in taking the initiative in preparing management plans.  They may have problems regarding technical staff and other things.  It should be made clear at the outset to local authorities that they must immediately on the passing of the Bill get down to the fundamental task of preparing a water quality management plan.  This will take some time to prepare. The sooner local authorities take the initiative to commence plans the better.  It is a reserved function of the local authority to make a plan under <Col N="832" /> section 15 and this in itself could mean that it will take some time from when the initial steps are taken until the plan is finally ratified by the elected members.  It may have to be sent back for revision a number of times by the elected members.  There should be no doubt in the minds of members and officials of local authorities but that they must get down to the preparation of this plan immediately on the passing of this Bill.  The best way to ensure that is to accept this amendement and make it mandatory on local authorities to make the water quality management plan immediately.  That is fundamental to the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I cannot agree.  Although objectives will be laid down at national level, the plans will be made at local level, and I think nobody would suggest it is possible to start off every local authority making plans for each catchment in its area simultaneously.  Deputies opposite must know this as well as I do.  Much of the necessary work will be done&mdash; indeed, the ground work is in progress at present&mdash;but there are not so many people who can give technical advice available for the technical work.  To suggest that all local bodies at one time could continue to prepare their plans and use the limited number of technical people available is just not reasonable.</P>
      <P>The section is phrased in such a way that the local authorities will make plans for their larger catchment areas and put the important ones first.  If I find that they are leaving out some areas that should be included I shall instruct them to bring these in.  Eventually I hope they will get around to all of them.  In regard to altering or amending, local authorities can change plans from time to time but basically the situation is that each local authority will be expected to bring in a plan for the larger or more important areas first.  This is the only way it can be done.  There is no other way in which it can be done at present and I ask that the amendment be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is impossible that <Col N="833" /> each local authority would provide for the most important aspects of the pollution problem in their own areas in regard to making a plan of this kind?  What is done in one area in this respect&mdash;and possibly in relation to water more than anything else&mdash; has an effect on other areas.  I do not believe that local authorities could suddenly start a flurry to get all the expertise necessary together immediately but surely there must be some sort of association between the various local authorities if we are to have a proper plan to deal with the problem as a whole.  It is impossible to deal with the pollution problem in a truncated manner.  I have already explained that what happens in one county will affect another, especially if there is a river flowing through both of them, which is fairly common.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be an overall plan. There must be a setting up of objectives before any work is done.  In subsection (2) it is pointed out that the plan under this section shall contain such objectives for the prevention and abatement of pollution of the waters the subject of the plan and such other provisions as appear to the local authority to be necessary. To me this means that, unless we have a plan, even the objectives are not clear.  I believe it is not even possible for an individual local authority to decide absolutely on its own objectives; it must do this also in co-operation with neighbouring local authorities and, to a small extent possibly in an overall pattern.  I cannot understand why the Minister will not accept this amendment because all we are saying is that the local authority &ldquo;shall&rdquo; do this.  To say that they &ldquo;may&rdquo; do it means that they may if they so wish.  It does not specify here that they must even deal with the larger and more important aspects of the work, as the Minister has said.  It does not specify that.  It simply says that they &ldquo;may&rdquo; or, if they are instructed by the Minister, they &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  It will take quite considerable time before they are likely to be instructed by the Minister.  They may be tardy&mdash;and this may happen in certain circumstances where a local authority is in financial difficulties&mdash;and <Col N="834" /> they may decide that this will not be one of their priorities, that they can push it aside and say that they have more important matters to deal with.  In that way they, as a local authoriy, can frustrate the efforts being made by their neighbours. This is a very important amendment to a very important section of the Bill, a section which I believe will ultimately decide whether or not we shall have any sort of reasonably quick progress in regard to this problem.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances I feel strongly that we should in some way get around this point so that we will ensure that at least a reasonable effort will be made by all local authorities.  I am not suggesting that local authorities are irresponsible.  What I am saying is that there are circumstances which may decide for a local authority that they do not propose to go ahead with it at that time.  Therefore the effect will be felt by their neighbour and to some extent by the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is particularly anxious that this Bill should work well, and so am I.  I believe this is a good Bill which will effect considerable progress in relation to the controlling of this very great pollution problem.  Unless we ensure there will be some type of co-operation between the various local authorities in this matter and that there will be no way in which a local authority, who for one reason or another decide not to bother their heads, will be able to opt out, the progress we make in containing and controlling water pollution will be much slower.  Therefore I recommend that the Minister accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We are going along, not a step but a half a step at a time.  Obviously the Deputies opposite have not got as far as subsection (7).  Subsection (6) says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As soon as practicable after a plan under this section is made, revised or replaced, a copy of the plan as so made, revised or replaced shall be furnished by the local authority concerned to the Minister, to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries,  <Col N="835" /> to local authorities whose functional areas adjoin . . .</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) says:</P>
    <P>The Minister may&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  require plans under this section by two or more local authorities to be co-ordinated in relation to matters and in a manner specified by him.</P>
    <P>(b)  require a local authority to revise a plan under this section in relation to matters and in a manner specified by him and at such intervals as he may direct, or to replace such a plan,</P>
    <P>(c)  direct two or more local authorities jointly to make, revise or replace a plan under this section,</P>
    <P>and local authorities shall comply with any such requisition or direction.</P>
    <P>Here we have the safeguards which the Deputies are talking about and they are in the section under discussion. The suggestion made that immediately the Bill is passed it should be mandatory on all local authorities to make provision for all the areas under their control is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner is aware, and Deputy O'Leary is far more aware, of the different catchment areas which may occur within a local authority area.  Some of them are more important than others from a pollution point of view.  This amendment suggests that all should get equal standing and all must by law have plans made immediately. We are saying that the local authorities should take the most important one first and then proceed to do the remainder.  If they leave out an important one it is my job to see that it is included.  They must of necessity consult where necessary the adjoining local authority or urban authority and prepare a revised plan. In those circumstances I cannot see why there is so much talk about including this amendment.  It would not help and in my opinion it would actually hinder progress.  There is no point discussing it further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the Minister.  In his opening remarks <Col N="836" /> he suggested that we probably had not seen subsection (7).  Of course we have.  In fact that subsection is another reason why I would be inclined to press my amendment.  Subsection (7) says:</P>
      <P>The Minister may&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  require plans under this section by two or more local authorities to be co-ordinated in relation to matters and in a manner specified by him,</P>
      <P>That is quite good.  But the problem I see in it is the one I have been discussing for some time here, that is, by the time the Minister decides it is necessary to intervene very valuable time will be lost.  The point I was making from the beginning was that one local authority could start preparing their plan, presenting their objectives, deciding on their future in relation to the control and containment of water pollution while their neighbour might decide not to bother. It would be some time before this would be brought to the attention of the Minister.  Not only that but if one local authority decided they were going to try to put the spirit of this Bill into operation, they would find that they could only deal with it in relation to their own functional area and that they could not deal with it in the adjoining areas as is laid down in section 15 (1).</P>
      <P>If it were mandatory that they should begin the work on the plan&mdash; I cannot visualise them rushing around trying to get a plan ready within a very short time&mdash;each local authority would know that the adjoining local authority were doing their share and there could be the type of co-operation and co-ordination referred to in subsection (7) without any need for interference by the Minister.  If we are to obtain what we hope from this Bill it is essential that this work should proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the management plan is basic to the operation of the Bill.  In those circumstances, and taking note of subsection (7), I still believe it is very important that local authorities should not have discretion about when they begin to concern themselves with <Col N="837" /> this work.  They have the right to decide what type of operation they will mount.  The Minister has already stated on a number of occasions&mdash;and I agree with him&mdash;that they would have to begin with the most important and larger elements which are creating the greatest pollution problems.  That is understandable and in that area co-operation between local authorities is most important.  In relation to the relatively minor problem relating to smaller rivers and lakes, they can very often be dealt with within the local authority's own area.  The larger areas cannot be dealt with piecemeal.  They must be dealt with in a way which will have an overall effect and will produce the best possible results.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another aspect of this to which I should like to refer, that is, the feeling some local authorities may have that, if they get in quickly, prepare a plan and submit it, they may get a share of additional capital allocation for sanitary services that may become available.  Those local authorities would then fare far better than those who would not take the initiative soon after the passage of this Bill.  There would therefore not be an even spread of money throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister may require two or more local authorities to co-ordinate their plans.  It is quite obvious that what is likely to happen is that each local authority will prepare their plans, discuss them and after they have been approved in principle consultations will take place with the neighbouring authorities. It should be compulsory for each local authority to commence work immediately on the passage of this Bill, on the water quality management plan for their particular area.  The Minister would then be in a far stronger position to direct them to co-ordinate their plans.  I am sure he will agree that local authorities do not like to be directed by the Minister to do certain things in relation to the provision of plans.  The Minister should therefore accept our amendment.</P>

It is of course most objectionable from the amenity point of view.

We have a situation here where the sanitary authority has the power to make decisions and to issue instructions which must be obeyed but at the same time the sanitary authority itself is not bound by the same conditions.  The Minister did say in relation to a previous amendment, which was similar to this one but which related to the local authority rather than the sanitary board, that <Col N="842" /> he would endeavour to ensure that all speed would be used in furthering the work or business here.

      <P>This was the point I wanted to make earlier.  Section 16 (1) states:</P>
      <P>A person other than a sanitary authority shall not, after such day as may be fixed for the purpose of this section by order made by the Minister, discharge or cause or permit the discharge of any trade effluent or other matter (other than domestic sewage or storm water) to a sewer, except under and in accordance with a licence under this section granted by the sanitary authority in which the sewer is vested or by which it is controlled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear to me that, while the <Col N="843" /> sanitary authority can refuse to permit any person except under licence to discharge trade effluent and so on into the sewer, the sanitary authority themselves are exempt.  Could I assume that the sanitary authority are entitled to discharge or cause or permit the discharge of any trade effluent or other matter to the sewer?</P>

      <P>In page 16, subsection (1), line 20, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this amendment is accepted the subsection will then read: &ldquo;The Minister shall by order provide that all appeals under sections 8 and 20 (or such classes of such appeals as he specifies in the order) shall, in lieu of being brought to the Minister, be brought to An Bord Pleanála.&rdquo;  I do not know whether we should have had that amendment on the previous section but the fact is we spent a considerable time here debating the Planning and Development Bill and one of the most important provisions in that Bill was the provision to take planning appeals out of the hands of the Minister, except in certain rare cases, and place them under the control of Bord Pleanála.  There <Col N="846" /> appears to be no good reason why appeals under this Bill should not also go before An Bord Pleanála.  In those circumstances we decided to table an amendment asking that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; be changed to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  It would appear to me to be a retrograde step to go back in this particular Bill and have appeals going to the Minister rather than to An Bord Pleanála. The board will probably have their hands full for a short period and they will face a pretty heavy workload, but I believe the extra burden thrown on them by this particular Bill would not be all that onerous.  It would be more appropriate to have appeals under this Bill heard by An Bord Pleanála and I suggest the Minister should accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope these amendments have been put down to elicit information rather than to press for their adoption.  Making it mandatory on the Minister to make an order would not necessarily have any great effect without further changes in subsection (1). I am quite willing however to state what our intentions are and to explain why section 21 is drafted in its present form.</P>
      <P>It has always been the intention that these appeals should be transferred to An Bord Pleanála as soon as practicable. Provision could not be made for this until the 1976 Planning Bill had been enacted.  As soon as that happened I introduced the amendment on Committee Stage in the Seanad which incorporated the present section 21 into the Bill.  I hope that this will suffice to indicate that we see advantages in having the board handle these appeals and that we intend to avail of the power to transfer them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some difficulties.  First appeals under section section 8 and 20 are likely to raise very technical issues which could have implications for the board, particularly in regard to staffing. Second, the Bill itself has implications, particularly in regard to staffing and facilities which will have to be worked out before decisions can be made regarding dates on which particular provisions can be brought into operation. Third, it is desirable that there should <Col N="847" /> be discussions with the board as to the timing of transfers.</P>
    <P>We have yet to see how An Bord Pleanála will operate.  I think it only reasonable that they be allowed some time to settle into their task of dealing with planning appeals and their other responsibilities under the Planning Acts before we begin to impose additional work on them.  That is why section 21 is drafted in a manner which will allow some flexibility.</P>
    <P>I could envisage a situation where the board might take over appeals under section 8 but appeals under section 20 might have to remain with the Minister for the time being.  The latter would be appeals relating to discharges to sewers and there might be some logic in these remaining with the Minister. It might be helpful to test that by experience.  As of now, however, the intention is that appeals under both sections will be transferred to the board when they are in a position to take on this work.</P>
    <P>Once appeals have been transferred to the board I find it very difficult to envisage any circumstances in which subsection (4) would be used to transfer them back to the Minister.  The power to revoke or amend an order may however be very necessary in relation to the incidental or consequential provisions.  We are setting up a new system which has yet to be tested by experience, and control of water pollution is too important to take any chances about loopholes which might arise through oversight or omission.  In the light of this explanation I hope that the amendments will be withdrawn. For Deputy Faulkner's information I should like to add that the board will start working on planning appeals on 15th March, for which I am truly thankful.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(3)  A sample taken by a local authority or a sanitary authority shall be analysed by a central authority designated by the Minister.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We feel that the analysing standards should be uniform and of a high level. If the responsibility for analysis is left to each local authority that would result in considerable duplication because each of them might set up their own infrastructure to deal with them. It would mean that we might not have the same standard of purity of water throughout the country.  If the work was centralised in a highly efficient unit it would be possible for us to finance it so that it could do the necessary work for the various local authorities and sanitary authorities quickly and efficiently.  If centres were set up all over the country not only would there be duplication but it would be a costly matter.  In the interests of the objectives of the Bill the central authority designated by the Minister would be the best body to analyse water samples.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A provision on these lines is unnecessary.  Section 28 (5) of the Bill enables the Minister to make regulations governing the taking of samples by authorised persons for the purpose of performance of functions under the Bill, including functions under section 22 relating to monitoring. Such regulations may provide for analysis of samples and may also prescribe the classes of persons to be responsible for the taking of samples and the carrying out of analysis, the certificate or other evidence to be given of the result of any analysis and the persons by and to whom such certificate or evidence is to be given. This power should be adequate if it becomes necessary to prescribe arrangements for analysis of samples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore I should point out that many aspects of implementation of the Bill's provisions, including the question of arrangements for analysis of samples, need to be considered in detail before decisions are taken on <Col N="850" /> final arrangements.  A discussion document dealing with the main activities which will be generated by the Bill, including the need for laboratory facilities, has been issued to local authorities by my Department as a basis for discussion with them and other bodies concerned.  Copies of this document have been made available in the Oireachtas Library.  This document suggests that consideration be given to the provision of local and area laboratories in addition to a central co-ordinating centre and it would be unwise at this stage to write a provision into the Bill requiring that all samples taken by local and sanitary authorities be analysed by a central authority, as proposed in this amendment.  I think there will be regional arrangements to deal with analysing samples and I believe that will be satisfactory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

There is no provision in the Bill requiring monitoring authorities to consult and co-ordinate their work.</P>

The types of vessels which it is envisaged will be covered by the regulations are small vessels, such as pleasure craft, which may cause pollution problems by discharging sewage to waters in confined areas such as marinas.

    <Title>Local Government (Water Pollution) Bill, 1976 [Seanad]: Fifth Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to place on record my appreciation of the constructive approach of Deputies who contributed to the debate on this Bill and, in particular, Deputies O'Leary and Faulkner for the consideration which they gave to the improvement of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As you know, the Bill was handled in the Seanad and during the earlier Stages in this House by the present Minister for Defence, who was then Parliamentary Secretary in my Department. However, I kept in close touch with its progress through all Stages and was very pleased that the Bill was so well received both here and in <Col N="856" /> the Seanad.  This reflects, I think, the strong desire on the part of the general public for effective action to be taken to deal with the pollution problem.</P>
    <P>I should mention that when the Bill is enacted it may be necessary to bring it into operation in stages. Regulations and orders, some of which may be of a fairly detailed nature, will have to be made to give effect to certain provisions of the Bill and their preparation will take some time.  Apart from this, implementation of some of the new controls will require the making of practical arrangements by local technical facilities. Staffing implications will also require consideration.  It is, however, my firm intention to bring the various provisions of the Bill into operation as soon as these matters can reasonably be disposed of and I hope to be in a position to bring some of the provisions into effect without much delay.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will, of course, have a major role to play in the implementation of this legislation and I am confident that they will perform their functions effectively and responsibly. Fishery interests, the Water Pollution Advisory Council and other bodies will also have important roles and I am sure that they too will play their full part in securing a co-operative and effective approach to the protection of our waters.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by expressing the hope that this Bill will enable all of them to make a significant contribution towards keeping our waters free from pollution and be seen by developers and the general public as an earnest of the intention&mdash;not only of the Government but of all parties in this House&mdash;to see that that objective is achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a most important Bill.  It is important for the future of the environment, particularly in relation to water supplies.  I appreciate the fact that the Minister accepted some of our amendments and in the discussion we had today, even in relation to the amendments he did not accept, I think he understood our viewpoint.  I believe this Bill will be to the country's advantage.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was not paid unemployment benefit from 6th November, 1976, because she had exhausted her maximum entitlement to 390 days benefit prior to that date and she did not requalify for a further entitlement as less than 13 employment contributions had been paid in respect of her for the purposes of requalification.</P>
      <P>As explained in the reply to the Deputy's previous question regarding this case on 27th January, 1977, unemployment assistance was not paid to this person as she was not the holder of a qualification certificate which is a necessary requirement for entitlement to such assistance.  Following a report by a social welfare officer, a deciding officer refused her application for a qualification certificate on the ground that her means, derived from the benefit or privilege of free or partly free board and lodging in her parent's home, exceeded the statutory limit which in her case was £798.20 per annum.  She was notified of this decision and of her right to appeal against it if she was dissatisfied.</P>
