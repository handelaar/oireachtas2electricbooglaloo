      <P>I will be in touch with the Opposition Parties in regard to business which will be initiated in the Dáil before the Christmas recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is that this is normally done by way of verbal communication between the Whips. We know at this stage that the Appropriations Bill has to be introduced. There was a Bill circulated this morning, the Gaeltacht Bill.  There is the possibility of one or two other Bills being moved, by long or short title, before the Christmas recess but those are not yet clear.  Normally the Government side are not in a position to make long forecasts in relation to measures of this nature.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not asking for long-term forecasts; just a short-term weather forecast.  What I want to know <Col N="662" /> is, given the short time between now and the end of this session, what legislation is to be brought in in the period between now and the Dáil going into recess in about ten days' time?  That is a reasonable request at this stage.  The Parliamentary Secretary should be in a position to answer it.  He can hardly be in the position that he does not know what he is bringing in next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that at mid-August 1977 VAT, excise duty and other tax elements constituted approximately 16.1 per cent of the average cost of the goods and services covered by the consumer price index.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to be clear about this.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could help me.  Is that an average or can I take it as being the total because obviously some items are more heavily weighted than others?  In other words, an average would not <Col N="664" /> necessarily give me the answer I want. Is that the total tax element in the overall CPI figure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be difficult, Sir.  I am only trying to straighten this out.  Perhaps I could do it privately afterwards.  Obviously some of these items are more expensive and are more heavily weighted than others.  An average would not there-fore necessarily give me the simple answer to the question of how much of the consumer price index is represented by tax.  Perhaps I could take it up privately with the Parliamentary Secretary after Question Time.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach (a) if he will furnish estimates, from the best available sources, of the percentage of the total work force, including those never yet employed, at present unemployed, with the figure for the corresponding date in 1976; and (b) if he will give, from the best available sources, the corresponding figures for the other EEC member states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The only source which provides information on employment and unemployment on a comparable basis for the EEC member states is the series of Community labour force surveys.  The first such inquiry was carried out in this country in May 1975.  The EEC report on that survey contains information on the percentages of the total work force&mdash;including those seeking regular work for the first time&mdash;who were recorded as unemployed in the different member states and, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving these ratios.</P>
      <P>A further labour force survey was taken in the spring of this year and it is anticipated that the first results for Ireland will be available, at national level, during the first half of 1978.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin South-Central</i>): Technical planning for the second television service has throughout been on the basis of providing the new network as economically as possible and of minimising expense and inconvenience to viewers. In some areas the introduction of the <Col N="671" /> new transmitter network could, if corrective measures were not taken, interfere with existing multi-channel reception. RTE have devoted a considerable amount of effort to identifying the extent of the interference and have taken special steps to minimise it. There will be extended test transmissions from the new transmitters during which any interference experienced will be monitored.  RTE will then determine what further steps, if any, need to be taken to deal with any residual problem.  The Deputy may be assured that everything possible will be done to avoid the situation to which he refers.</P>
      <P>Viewers relying on &ldquo;off-air&rdquo; reception, that is those not connected to cable television systems, will in general need to get new aerials or adjust existing aerials and/or television receivers in order to get satisfactory reception of RTE 2.  RTE advise that in the great majority of cases the cost to viewers should not be more than £10 to £15.  There will be cases, however, where the cost involved may be higher and viewers in some areas will need to change to receivers capable of receiving UHF transmissions or 625 line VHF transmissions.  Costs involved will have to be borne by the viewers.  I am assured that RTE, in close association with the appropriate trade associations, will provide comprehensive information and advice to viewers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Our intervention prices are substantially higher than in the UK.  In accordance with Community regulations, the buying-in prices for beef sold into intervention are derived from the intervention price. This price is adjusted by a coefficient reflecting the relationship between the average market price of each of the categories of animals eligible for intervention and the Community average market price for adult cattle.  The Irish coefficients will come up for review in the normal way at the beginning of the next marketing year.  The high level of intake into intervention here, which is now running at about 3,000 tons per week, would indicate that our buying-in prices are not unremunerative <i>vis-àvis</i> market returns.</P>

In that regard I have had a number of conversations with the French Minister for Agriculture and members of his Ministry, and I expect to meet people from the French Ministry in Dublin next week in order to try to settle the problew which has bedevilled the sheep industry since our entry into the Community.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 32 and 33 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Representations have been made to me by the poultry processing industry to the effect that the industry is operating at a competitive disadvantage <i>visà-vis</i> Northern Ireland processors by reason of lower production costs in Northern Ireland.  This is a fact; but taking all factors into account, including the MCA charge on exports to here, the margin of advantage to Northern <Col N="691" /> Ireland processors marketing poultry meat in the Republic is not substantial. As my predecessor discovered, there is no action open to the Irish authorities under EEC conditions to establish full equality of broiler production costs North and South.  I may add that only limited quantities of poultry meat are being supplied to the market here from Northern Ireland and these have not shown any increase in recent months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Is the Minister aware that there is an adverse difference of approximately £25 per ton between the price here and that charged for feed in Northern Ireland?  Has the Minister been informed, and does he agree, that the price at which produce from Northern Ireland is being sold here virtually amounts to dumping?  Is he aware that poultry producers here are in danger of having to go out of business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there is an imbalance between the price of poultry feed in Northern Ireland as against here.  I am also aware that the amount of poultry from Northern Ireland being sold here is rather limited and there has not been any increase in modern times.  On the other hand, the circumstance with regard to the MCA obtaining in the North and down here, while it has an adverse effect in this area, is to our great benefit in such a large area otherwise. It is to the advantage of producers here as a whole that this situation should continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Is the Minister aware that the MCAs are not effective and do not relieve the situation?  Is the Minister also aware that, apart from official imports, huge quantities are brought across unapproved?  That virtually amounts to dumping.  Presumably the Minister is aware that the value of the poultry industry was about £45 million for 1977 out of the farmer's gate and more than £70 million retail.  Is he aware that about 6,000 people are employed in this industry and that they are in danger of <Col N="692" /> being put out of business by virtue of this unfair competition?  These people simply want to be put on equal terms with their competitors a few miles away.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>One way would be to equalise the level of devaluation of the green £ in the North and down here.  I am sure that would be very detrimental to the interests of producers generally down here and the Deputy must be aware of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I do not care how the Minister does it.  Is the Minister aware that these producers are working under a serious disadvantage as a result of the feed being £25 per ton dearer here than in Northern Ireland?  Is it the intention of the Minister to stand by while this valuable industry is put out of production?  There is a precedent for helping them, as the Minister must be aware.</P>

    <Title>Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Bill, 1977: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to increase the limit imposed by the Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Acts, 1963 to 1975, on the amount that NET may borrow under Ministerial guarantee.  It is further proposed to widen the scope of the ministerial guarantee powers to permit the guaranteeing of the due payment of commission and incidental expenses arising in connection with loan guarantees.  In addition, the opportunity is being taken in the Bill to introduce legislative controls over the remuneration of the chief officer of the company and over the superannuation schemes operating in the company.</P>
      <P>The principal provision in the Bill is that which proposes that the limit on the guaranteeing by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy of borrowings by the company be raised from the present limit of £30 million to a new one of £100 million.  The increase is required to enable the company to complete the financing of its ammonia-urea project at Marino Point, Cork Harbour.  So that Deputies can fully appreciate the necessity for an increase of this size in the statutory guarantee powers, I propose to outline briefly the developments over the last two years which have led to this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="729" /> As Deputies are aware the Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta Act, 1975, was enacted specifically for the purpose of assisting the company to finance their Marino Point project.  The Act increased the authorised share capital of NET from £7.5 million to a new limit of £27.5 million.  It provided that the Minister for Finance could take shares in the company up to a limit of £22.5 million, and that he could take up additional shares in excess of that amount up to the new authorised share capital limit of £27.5 million with prior Government approval and it increased the limit on the guaranteeing by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy of borrowings by the company from £2 million to the present statutory limit of £30 million.</P>
    <P>In mid-1975, these provisions were considered more than adequate to complete the funding of the project which was then estimated to cost £63.5 million and which it was envisaged would be financed by way of £15 million Government equity, £5 million IDA grant and the balance of £43.5 million in borrowings.  However, there have been two significant developments since then, one being substantial increases in the project cost and the other being demands by the different lending institutions for 100 per cent guarantees for all borrowings.  These developments have seriously upset the company's best calculations and have led to the present situation where further legislation is essential to enable the company to complete the financing of the project.</P>
    <P>Firstly, I will deal with the question of the project cost.  The latest estimate from NET suggests that total expenditure could be in the region of £90 million.  This represents an increase of about £27 million on the mid-1975 estimate.  The company have attributed almost 45 per cent of this increase to material and labour costs, over 30 per cent to sterling devaluation and additional interest charges, and almost 25 per cent to additional project requirements which had not been budgeted for in the mid-1975 estimate.</P>
    <P>It is, I consider, a matter of regret and of grave concern&mdash;and I have made my views on this clear to representatives <Col N="730" /> of the company&mdash;that costs have spiralled in this manner during the construction of the project.  It must be conceded, however, that expenditure on the project has been incurred during a period when inflation reached heights never experienced before in these islands.  It was, in fact, precisely because of these massive inflationary trends that NET were unable, despite their best efforts, to arrange a fixed price contract and were obliged to operate on a basis of reimbursable costs for the major proportion of the contract for the project.</P>
    <P>The second reason for the increased guarantee limit now sought is the demand by all lenders that total borrowings by NET in respect of the Marino Point project be fully secured. This is a development the company did not foresee prior to the enactment of the 1975 amending legislation.  It had then been anticipated that the institutional lenders, such as the European Investment Bank, who were participating in the funding of the project, would require partial ministerial guarantees for borrowings but that the other source of loan finance, a consortium of banks, would not require any such guarantees.</P>
    <P>However, it has since become clear, following protracted negotiations between NET and the lenders, that the institutional lenders must have full guarantees and that the bank consortium wishing to be treated on a par with all other lenders would require similar guarantees.  In addition, due to the financing of earlier capital projects at NET's Arklow factory by way of short term borrowings over a number of years, an unfavourable imbalance between current assets and current liabilities had developed in the company's account.  Because of this, it was considered prudent to re-arrange these borrowings as medium term borrowings through the bank consortium.</P>
    <P>The re-scheduled borrowings which amount to almost £10 million will also require guarantees.  Overall, therefore, total borrowings by the company in the region of £80 million, representing about £70 million required to complete the Marino Point financing and the <Col N="731" /> £10 million adjustment of Arklow borrowings, will have to be guaranteed by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  In proposing a new statutory loan guarantee limit of £100 million, I considered it prudent that a realistic limit be provided to cover adequately the company's immediate requirements and possible requirements in the future.</P>
    <P>I want to stress at this point that the attitude of the lenders in no way reflects any lack of confidence on their part in NET or in the Marino Point project. It simply illustrates the desire on the part of the different lenders involved in the overall financing package to be treated equally by NET and, since the institutional lenders must have full guarantees, it is not at all unreasonable for the bank consortium to seek the same facility.  There is, however, no doubt that the company retain the full confidence of their bankers with regard to their ability to repay all borrowings.  Under the loan agreements entered into by the company, all borrowings have to be repaid before the end of 1984.  In fact, on the basis of their latest financial projections the company would have no difficulty in repaying these borrowings at an earlier date.</P>
    <P>In addition to proposing a new statutory loan guarantee limit, I am taking the opportunity at this stage of extending slightly the scope of the powers of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy with regard to guarantees. In section 3 of the Bill it is proposed that the Minister be empowered to guarantee the due payment by NET of commission and incidental expenses arising in connection with moneys borrowed by the company.  In practice the amounts of commission or other expenses that might be payable by the company would represent a very minute fraction of the actual amount being borrowed.  Nevertheless, the absence of this power did create difficulties for NET when completing a recent guarantee agreement and the amendment proposed in section 3 will get over this problem and bring the NET legislation into line in this respect with that of some other State companies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="732" /> The types of controls proposed in sections 4 and 5 of the Bill in relation to the remuneration of the chief officer of the company and to superannuation schemes covering employees of the company are now being inserted in relevant statutes governing the different State companies as the opportunity arises.  The power to control the chief officer's salary and to regulate superannuation schemes is already contained in the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the company; so in fact these new provisions will not affect the controls operating at present but will merely give them a statutory backing.</P>
    <P>Now that I have dealt with the reasons which have made it necessary to introduce this Bill, I would like to refer to the Marino Point project itself. This vast petrochemical complex, which will be using as feedstock some of the Kinsale Head natural gas, will in broad terms have an output sufficient to meet the nitrogenous fertiliser requirements of Irish agriculture until at least the mid 1980s.  This level of output will undoubtedly play a significant role in the continuing expansion of the agricultural industry and will, for the first time, ensure the availability of nitrogen supplies to our farmers.  In the early years of production and until the home market demand for nitrogen expands sufficiently to absorb the total output surplus production will be disposed of on foreign markets through marketing arrangements already completed.</P>
    <P>The actual construction of the Marino Point plants is now at an advanced stage.  There have been some disruptions in the construction programme due to intermittent industrial disputes at the site but generally the rate of progress has been satisfactory. At this stage and due to the size and complexity of this undertaking it is difficult to say precisely when the plants will be ready to come on stream. It seems reasonable, however, to expect that the ammonia plant could be ready to commerce production by about mid-summer 1978, followed by the urea plant within perhaps a further two months.  This time scale should tie in with the landing of the first <Col N="733" /> natural gas supplies which it is expected will arrive at about that time.</P>
    <P>NET's new plant will undoubtedly have a revitalising effect on the Irish fertiliser industry as a whole and this is to be welcomed.  There is little doubt that the industry has had more than its share of problems over the last couple of years and some of these are still with us.  Last year, in particular, was an exceptionally difficult one for Irish firms in the business.  Yet despite this situation companies have been able to maintain the same level of employment during the past year.  The latest expectations are that the overall market situation will improve in 1978. The NET project will obviously help in this regard as the availability of home-produced nitrogen based on an indigenous raw material will from the middle of next year onwards be of benefit not alone to NET but also to the different companies involved in the production of NPK compound fertilisers in this country.  Therefore, the NET project quite apart from generating an additional 500 jobs in the industry and in ancillary servicing industries will also help to secure the future of existing employment in the Irish fertiliser industry generally.</P>
    <P>I confidently recommend the Bill for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This party accepts and supports this Bill and I merely want to say something about its setting.  We particularly welcome the growth of the domestic fertiliser industry and we welcome the demand for the growth which has seen quite a large increase in the use of fertiliser by Irish farmers compared with what was once the case.  Even now we are very far behind in the table showing use of fertiliser or consumption of fertiliser for agricultural purposes.  It is only a fraction, one-seventh I think, per acre or per hectare of what is used in the Netherlands. They are at the top of the table and absorb as much fertiliser as the whole of Latin America does in a year.  We do not aim, and perhaps do not need to aim for that level of land utilisation but obviously we have a long way to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very large part of Irish land is unreclaimed and before fertiliser can <Col N="734" /> be applied to it a great deal needs to be done to drain and clear it.  That is only the beginning of the job.  There is this enormous national task ahead in which Nítrigin Éireann is gearing itself to assist.  Anything this Party can do in helping the company, particularly in helping it to overcome times of difficulty, will be willingly done.</P>
    <P>It is a particularly happy accident&mdash; I think it is an accident&mdash;that the NET plant at Marino Point was decided on before any natural gas was found in the area, certainly before there was a commercial strike.  It is perfectly appropriate and the right type of development that natural gas should be used as far as possible to supply the hydrogen element for the manufacture of synthetic fertiliser. There is, however, the other problem regarding natural gas which does not arise on this Bill but I should like to draw it to the Minister's attention&mdash;I think he mentioned it himself in former debates on this subject&mdash;and that is what will be the final destiny of the balance of the natural gas apart from what is used for the production of nitrogenous fertiliser.  This naturally is an important point and a difficult one for the Minister and his Department because they must weigh up many factors, some of which are, perhaps, very difficult or impossible to calculate at present.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the amount of this limited resource&mdash;gas will not be available forever&mdash;which is to be devoted to the manufacture of fertiliser means so much less gas left for production of energy.  Even on the energy side there are very serious decisions to be made as to the form of energy into which the gas not absorbed in the fertiliser industry will be converted.</P>
    <P>The most economic way, were it not for the expense of laying a pipe-line and the capital installation of a distribution grid would be to sell the gas as gas.  As the Minister himself pointed out on a former occasion, the conversion of the gas into electricity, although it means that use can be made of a ready-made grid in the shape of the ESB network, is very highly wasteful and while that wastefulness might have been tolerated for the sake of simplicity or benefit to the <Col N="735" /> balance of payments in the past, in the world into which we are moving where these resources will be limited, hazardous and subject to all kinds of political instability over which we have no control, the economic use of our energy resources, however small they may seem, will be a very difficult matter.</P>
    <P>These things all belong together. The policy of the State even in regard to the production of fertiliser from our own natural gas will not be capable of being confidently stated until we have a State policy on energy generally.  I fear we are as far from having that now as we were about a year go when the then Opposition moved a motion condemning the then Government for not having an overall policy.  I am well aware of the difficulties and snags and, as has often been said, of the very serious decisions that have to be made and perhaps wrongly made in the best of faith. There is not an unlimited time for making these decisions which will bear very strongly on the future of the fertiliser industry also.  As time goes on, I shall be pursuing the Minister to make sure that we have no undue delay in formulating an energy policy that will leave us as far as possible&mdash; it cannot be done completely&mdash;selfsufficient and independent of foreign sources not only in the remainder of this century but in the coming century.</P>
    <P>The Minister explained clearly enough the reasons why he is seeking this enormous increase in the limit of guarantees.  The first of the NET Bills which envisaged only the Arklow operation and did not envisage anything based on natural gas production or the Marino Point complex, envisaged the limit of guarantees at only £1 million.  That was as recently as 1963.  This limit has now increased in the space of 14 years by 100 times but we accept that we just cannot work on the basis of being surprised by simple mathematical calculations like that since quite new factors are now at work.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of matters I want to mention to the Minister.  They might more appropriately be raised on <Col N="736" /> Committee Stage but if I mention them now he may get a chance to polish them off before Committee Stage.  Although the Minister says that the proportion borne by commission and incidental expenses through borrowings is minute I wish him to give some indication of what kind of commission this is, on what kind of sums the commission is calculated, at what percentage and who gets it.  I am not making any allegations but I want to know if it is possible to economise in this regard or if it is possible to direct the work represented by such commission to an Irish recipient, if it is not already in the hands of an Irish receipient, which may well be the case?</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department contacted me yesterday to say that the Minister on Committee Stage&mdash;I think the object was to accelerate this Bill&mdash; would be moving an amendment which would have the effect of replacing the existing section 5 in the Bill with a completely new section, a much shorter one, the object of which was simply to leave the existing superannuation scheme provided for in the Articles of Association of this company as it stands and to provide that any alterations in the terms of the operation of the scheme would require the approval of the Minister given with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.  I agree that on the face of it that is a simpler and a shorter way of doing things.  If it is just an oversight let it be so and I will not make a fuss about it.  I would like to know, if that is so, why it was thought necessary in the first instance to put down the section, the replacement of which the Minister now proposes?  It seems to me, on the face of it, that the provision in the existing section 5 (6) is one which perhaps may be more restrictive than whatever provision is at present in force in the company's superannuation scheme.  I observe also that the more or less standard sub-section (7) in regard to laying orders before the House will not operate if we adopt the new section 5 which the Minister has circulated.  Apart from referring to those matters which the Minister may be able to deal with on this Stage I have nothing more to add, except to join with him in welcoming <Col N="737" /> the Bill and wishing it every possible success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill because it makes provision for a significant expansion of the activities of this important State-sponsored body.  I am sure the House will be unanimous in agreeing to the adoption of the Bill.  I share the concern of the Minister regarding the cost of the Marino Point project and I also share the concern not only of the Minister but I am sure of the other Members of the House who will contribute that a project which two years ago was estimated at approximately £63 million should have worked out in the region of £90 million.</P>
      <P>I know that Government equity was involved in the first instance and IDA grants were also involved at that stage. It strikes me as rather strange&mdash;the Minister's predecessor may have more to answer for it than he&mdash;that when the State put £15 million equity into a project and the IDA gave a further £5 million grant aid into it that fairly rigid supervision should not have been maintained and matters brought to the notice of the House before now rather than that we should have over-expenditure of some £27 million on the late 1975 Estimate.  It strikes me as excessive that there should be a 25 per cent cost attributable to additional project requirements in relation to the project.  This was only budgeted twoand-a-half years ago and was in the melting pot for the best part of seven or eight years.  It does not speak well for design and accurate projections that one has to have a 25 per cent additional project requirement in terms of finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible, no matter how rigorously attacked by inflationary increases to estimate even for two years ahead.  One should be able to estimate on a fairly reasonable basis a projection for material and labour costs. This is done nearly all the time in the city and is done in the case of all the State-sponsored bodies on a very rigorous basis.  The ESB, for example, might well have done this more effectively in many ways.  It is possible to estimate two years ahead within reasonable limits.  When one sees here that <Col N="738" /> 45 per cent of the increase of £27 million is attributable directly to materials and labour costs one wonders how exactly the work was done on the budget in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I do not in any way hold the company responsible for the 30 per cent sterling devaluation as that was outside the scope of the company but I am concerned that in this country once the State is picking up the tab there is a tendency at all levels of professional and construction work in projects of this nature, when contracts tend to be based on reimbursable costs, for people gaily to add on whatever they feel like. Professions in the construction industry are fairly liberal in their interpretation at that end and once construction firms have an open-ended contract of a reimbursable nature they simply add on to it knowing that the State will pick up the tab.</P>
    <P>That bodes ill for the necessary expansion, which I totally support, of the role of State-sponsored bodies.  I hate to imagine what we would be faced with if in building the nuclear energy project in Carnsore Point at a cost of a few hundred million pounds we had budgetary projections of such a shoddy nature.  I would not be too critical if this was a new State-sponsored body but they have had a lot of experience in the Arklow end, in particular, in this regard.  We were entitled to something better from this State-sponsored body.  I hope the cost will not exceed much more than the £90 million, although I would not be surprised if it touched £100 million by the time it is completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite this criticism on my part in relation to the project I am pleased to note that it is geared to the nitrogenous fertiliser requirements of Irish agriculture at least into the mid-eighties. I recently read an interesting contribution by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture in relation to the use of fertilisers in Irish agriculture.  I was interested to hear some of the critical comments on radio programmes in this regard&mdash;for <Col N="739" /> example, the comment of the County Westmeath CAO, in which it was pointed out that Irish farmers by and large have been on a plateau in terms of the use of nitrogenous fertilisers in the sphere of general productivity development.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly there is room for continued significant expansion in output and, to this end, in the use of nitrogenous fertilisers.  The Minister did not refer in his speech to any prospect of a reduction in the price of fertilisers.  Perhaps that aspect does not come formally within the context of the Bill.  However, it was the expectation of some people that the Marino Point project would result in a general reduction in the over-all cost.  But if this result is not achieved the fact remains that we are using essential indigenous raw material. There is massive scope for the further use of nitrogenous fertilisers in Irish agriculture during the next ten or 15 years.  Since price increases at the level of agriculture are not likely to rocket very much in the years ahead, the increased use of fertiliser will be very necessary in terms of increasing over-all production.</P>
      <P>This Bill will add a new dimension to the commercial role of State-sponsored bodies and to their general contribution to this nation.  I have always supported the NET project. Even at times when certain Irish commercial interests were trying to screw that body out of existence, I continued to support them as I supported strongly their setting up.  They are making a distinctive contribution to the Irish infrastructure for agriculture, to our overall industrial expansion and to the provision of employment at their Arklow and Cork plants.  My criticisms of the financial operation will have to be seen in that context.  I believe in efficient State-sponsored enterprise with a high productivity level and a high employment content.  It is only when State-sponsored bodies are operating in this way that they are contributing to the national interest. The Labour Party find it easy to give full support to this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. L. Lawlor Mr. L. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, this Bill <Col N="740" /> is necessary to enable the completion of the NET project.  The industry in which this body are involved is of a high-escalation type in terms of costs. Consequently, the figures mentioned by the Minister are colossal.  It is our hope that the plants at Arklow and at Marino Point will meet the targets of pay-back in 1982 as outlined.</P>
      <P>The gas finds off our coast and the constraints that these finds have placed on our technical consultants represent a whole new development for us. Recently there have been expressed some words of caution regarding certain standards.  As this new industry will be of a highly technical nature I trust that the people concerned will ensure the enforcement of the necessary safety regulations and standards. To a large extent non-Irish consultants were engaged on the Marino Point project and these people have brought with them a large amount of technology from abroad.  Perhaps this has been the cause of much of the escalation. However, much has been learned by Irish professional organisations and contractors as a result of the Marino Point project.  Perhaps this will lead to much greater control in regard to the spin-off industries that are likely to result from these gas finds.</P>
      <P>Hopefully, too, the gas that is found off our coasts will be put to maximum use by such bodies as NET and the ESB.  I urge the Minister to give urgent consideration to the question of the possibility of using this gas to supply the city of Dublin.  As the Marino Point project is at an advanced stage, it will be necessary shortly to begin transporting the chemical to Arklow.  This will put on our rail system demands of a kind not experienced up to now.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and wish it a speedy passage through the House.</P>

I am advised that the commission is of the order of a ½ per cent and is payable on the amount raised. So far as I know this is payable to the leading bank who arrange the finance. It covers such items as commitment fees and legal fees.  I am advised that the necessity for this section was brought to the attention of the Department by the Attorney General.  I am advised, too, that Irish banks and that worthy body of men, Irish lawyers, will be the main beneficiaries of this commission.  I understand that in some instances the commission payable would be a ¼ per cent.</P>

      <P>That is so.  The commission would be the main item of expenditure.  Perhaps it would be better to deal with the amendment that it is proposed to introduce on Committee Stage in respect of subsection (1) of section 5 at that time rather than to deal with it now and then have to repeat later what I would say now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opening speech I expressed regret and concern in relation to the question of costs and in particular to the escalation in this regard.  I went on to give the reasons for this situation, but in fairness to NET it should be said that for the most part the reasons were very much outside their control.  That is true particularly of the last two years.  The problem was created more than two years ago when the arrangements for the building of the plant was made.  On the Bill that led to the 1975 Act I spoke at some length about my reservations and doubts as to what NET were doing in entering into the arrangement with Kellogs.  I expressed concern then with the nature of the arrangement.  It got fairly hot and heavy between myself and my predecessor so far as certain aspects of that arrangement were concerned. He showed the House that all was well and that the possible escalation of costs which I foretold as being likely was in his view unlikely and the whole situation would be controlled. There is a temptation to simply say &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; and leave it at <Col N="742" /> that.  It is unfortunate that it has worked out the way it has.</P>
    <P>NET were in the difficulty that they could not, because of the nature of the operation, enter into a different type of contract.  Due to the inflationary situation which existed at the time, they could not enter into a fixed price contract.  There were a great many imponderables in the situation. In any event, that is history.  They entered into an arrangement and one of the results is that there has been very substantial escalation in costs.</P>
    <P>I thought Deputy Kelly might have dwelt more on this difficulty.  I was surprised, but nonetheless glad, to find that Deputy Desmond drew the attention of the House to it.  He drew attention to an attitude of mind that because the State is picking up the tab, the contract, or the job, is fair game. That is a widespread belief and is frequently put into practice.  In my view Deputy Desmond was right when he said that it was a very dangerous practice.  This mentality exists today as much as it did five, ten or 20 years ago.  This is a reality which should be borne in mind by some people who are proposing certain types of solutions to another major problem that faces this country in the industrial field today and about which we will talk later. As I said, it is a reality that this mentality exists.  Some people often make full use of the opportunity to take the State for a ride because the taxpayer is picking up the tab.  This is something we have to be extremely careful about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kelly raised the question of the gas usage.  As he properly said, this is one great difficulty. It is recognised that the use of this very limited amount of natural gas for electricity generation is not by any means the optimum use.  We are faced with a difficulty of considering whether any gas should be used for this <Col N="743" /> purpose or if a smaller amount than is at present projected should be used.</P>
      <P>When I came into office I found that there were not, as I hoped there might be, exact costings of the alternative uses to which this gas might be put.  In particular, there were not exact costings of the possible grid to bring the gas to Dublin.  I asked that these costings be prepared by independent people.  I expect that the result of that study will be available within the matter of a few weeks and after that a decision may be made.  One's freedom of decision is to a fair extent inhibited by the fact that a decision was made three-and-a-half years ago and a lot of things have happened since then as a result of that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in regard to the allocation.  Considerable expenditure has been incurred by another body on the basis of that decision.  I am hopeful it is not an expenditure down the drain if a change is made, because it might be possible at a comparatively small additional cost to change the nature of the power station in question which has been under construction for the last 12 months.  These are matters that will have to be gone into in more detail on another occasion and on which major decisions will have to be made over the next couple of months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider getting the advice of the new board which we now have for such matters&mdash;the Board on Science and Technology?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in the process of getting advice from two economists &mdash;one in my Department and one in the Department of Economic Planning and Development or Finance, I am not sure which Department he is in at the moment.  So much advice is being given by so many people already that I have to draw the line somewhere. The Deputy will be aware that one of our difficulties in this respect is that one firm of consultants gave different advice to two different clients in this field about this matter.  If I am sceptical about the kind of advice one <Col N="744" /> gets from some quarters, it is understandable. Therefore I have asked two accomplished public servants to give me the most dispassionate advice they can on the costings of these matters. These economists are working in close co-operation with the IIRS who are competent to assess these matters dispassionately and in the public interest.</P>
      <P>So far as the use of the remainder of the natural gas from Kinsale is concerned, over and above what will be used by NET at Marino Point, my own feelings and enthusiasm would be that the bulk of the remainder, if at all possible, would be used in a further chemical plant by a State company preferably in that area.  From the national point of view this would be the most beneficial and economic use of the gas.  I would like to see sufficient gas brought to Dublin to provide reasonably priced fuel for the domestic market.  That depends entirely on whether the economics are right and I hope to have advice on that which will enable me to take a definite decision one way or the other within a short time.</P>
      <P>These were the main points raised in today's short debate.  I am grateful to Deputies who have taken part for their welcome of the Bill and for their understanding of the need for these higher limits.  I hope that the considerable difficulties which were incurred by NET in the course of construction are at an end and that the ammonia and urea project at Marino Plant, will have a long and successful period of production with considerable profit to the Irish people generally and specifically to the agricultural sector.  All the indications are that notwithstanding the escalation in costs this will be the case.  I wish them well in their endeavours. Notwithstanding the delays and cost escalations it is only right that congratulations should also be given to the NET executives and engineers for the way in which they have overcome enormous difficulties in the building of what is far and away the largest and most complex industrial plant ever erected here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This seems to have the seed of confusion in it.  Why would it not be possible to declare in this Bill or some other way what this chief executive is to be called?  Suppose there is a managing director, and suppose somebody else is appointed chief executive, which of them is the chief officer?  This seems a slightly sloppy way of doing business, unless there are respectable precedents for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The articles of association of the company provide for ministerial control of the remuneration of what is described as the managing director in the articles.  This would not cover the position where the chief executive might be a manager or a general manager.  In order to provide for the eventuality it is considered best to include a section which would apply to the chief officer of the company irrespective of his title and whether or not he was a board member.  This is also in line with recent legislation of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am trying to discover is this: supposing for the <Col N="746" /> sake of argument the company which now has a managing director were to find it convenient for some purpose to appoint someone called a chief executive, how would we decide which of those was the chief officer for the purpose of this section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>They could not do that under the articles of association apparently.  The articles call the chief executive the managing director, and the section is there to provide, for example, that if they amend the articles and call him a manager or a general manager, whoever is <i>de facto</i> the chief executive would be the one covered by this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there anything in the articles which contains the expression &ldquo;chief officer&rdquo; and equates it with the managing director they now have? If not I accept that the <i>de facto</i> chief officer is now called managing director.  Suppose they were to appoint somebody else, side by side with the managing director, called a chief executive, so far as this section is concerned we would be in a position where we could not tell who was the chief officer.  I do not wish to make a fuss about it if the Minister would look at this and try to do something with it in the Seanad.  Will the Minister consider that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that the problem referred to by the Deputy could ever arise in practice.  There is in every company some person who is clearly designated and seen to be the principal executive officer of that company whatever name they call him by. It varies from company to company. Some call him chief officer, some chief executive, and in manufacturing and trading companies such as this the usual practice is, I understand, to call him managing director.  The reason for that is that if he goes abroad on company business, as he may frequently have to do, his position within the company is liable to be misunderstood by people in other countries unless he is described as managing director.  The name that he is called by is irrelevant; as long as he is the principal executive officer of the company this section <Col N="747" /> applies to him.  It is put in this way because it is possible, for example, that they could change the articles of association so that instead of calling him managing director they could call him something else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I see that.  The point I am trying to make is that this seems to be a fairly cumbersome piece of drafting, because here is a company which the Minister tells me has a <i>de facto</i> chief officer, although he is not called that in the articles.  He is called the managing director.  That is fair enough, but here is a section which refers to this expression &ldquo;chief officer&rdquo; and then gratuitously throws in a parenthesis referring to a chief executive who apparently does not exist in this company at the moment.  It almost invites one to suppose that he may exist there in the future.  What then are we going to say about the managing director?  The section would be better if that parenthesis were left out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the Deputy is right.  I do not know why this was put in in parentheses; it only confuses the situation.  Apparently the Department of the Public Service, who are a law onto themselves, like the phrase &ldquo;chief executive&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 5, to insert the following section :</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> 5.  &mdash;Any alteration in the terms, in operation at the passing of this <Col N="748" /> Act, governing the grant of pensions, gratuities, allowances or other payments on resignation, retirement or death, to or in respect of a member of the parmanent staff of the Company, including its chief officer, or any other arrangement to provide for benefits additional to the terms referred to above, shall not take effect unless the alteration or arrangement has the approval of the Minister, given with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service. </P>
    <P>I am proposing this amendment which would entail the deletion of the existing section and its replacement by a much simpler one.  Because the company already has a pension scheme, in the preparation of which my Department and the Department of Finance were involved in accordance with its memorandum of association, which provides for ministerial control of superannuation schemes of a company, it is now felt that for purposes of overall supervision and co-ordination of superannuation of public sector employment, ministerial control over any future change of the superannuation terms of the staff of NET would be adequate.  Ministerial control of the superannuation terms of staff is provided by statute in the case of most public concerns.  A similar section to this section is apparently being provided in the Agricultural Credit Bill, 1977, which is before the House at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the possibility of surplus gas from the Kinsale Head project not being used here.  I concur with the Minister's view that if it were economically viable and if one could find the right technology one should go for a chemical plant to handle surplus gas in the area.  In the original construction of this plant and of other analogous plants we should have used the expertise of the ESB.  There were interrelationships between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Transport and Power and between NET and the ESB, in the past. It is a pity that we have not availed of the very considerable technology which the ESB had whereby they built massive power stations throughout the country even, to take Tarbert alone, in the constituency adjoining the Minister's. The ESB could help considerably in the construction of a chemical plant.</P>
      <P>As regards the sending of surplus gas to the greater Dublin area, I would have strong reservations.  Admittedly the previous Government subsidised town gas and this was extended to other areas by the present Government; but I have an objection to siphoning off gas to what in effect is a private company in the greater Dublin area.  This needs considerable careful analysis by the Minister.  There is already a commitment in relation to Cork where, probably because of proximity and because of a decision already taken, it can be implemented. But even when sending gas to Limerick, for example, I would prefer to see this kept within the State-sponsored setting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see great merit in the Bill as it has developed and I am glad that we are enacting all Stages today.  If the ESB can go abroad to places like Saudi Arabia and build massive construction projects of a very sophisticated nature for other countries, there is no reason why they should not expand here in this matter.  It has been said that perhaps the Sugar Company could do this, but I do not think they are big enough to become involved in the chemical extraction plant side.  I do not think they have the construction <Col N="750" /> techniques or expertise in that area and I do not think there is any other State-sponsored body capable of doing it.  Expansion in that direction should be a diversification of the role of the ESB.</P>

      <P> Section 3: In page 2, subsection (1), line 34, &ldquo;other than a private company&rdquo; inserted after &ldquo;company&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>The effect of these amendments is to exclude private companies from using the official seal.  The main aim of sections 3 and 5 in regard to the use of the official seal is to help to speed up the procedure for transfer of company shares and other securities.  Section 3 and 5 as they stand would enable companies generally, that is to say whether they were public or private companies, to use the official seal for sealing securities. However, it was the principal intention that in the case of large companies whose securities are freely transferable the official seal would be entrusted to the company registrars who would be in a position to prepare, seal and issue certificates without having to send them back to company headquarters for signing and sealing with a common seal as at present.</P>
      <P>The use of the official seal by private companies gave rise to misgivings when the Bill was considered in Committee in the Seanad.  It was stated that there already existed in practice an undue amount of carelessness in preserving the characteristics of the private company which imposes restrictions on the number of members and transfers of shares.  It was felt that the use of the official seal by private companies could contribute further to this carelessness because it provided a less formal procedure for the sealing and issuing of share certificates.</P>

    <Title>Agricultural Credit Bill, 1977: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to consolidate the Agricultural Credit Acts, 1927 to 1975, and to make a number of substantive amendments in the existing legislation.  Those Acts deal with the objects, constitution, functions and financing of the Agricultural Credit Corporation (ACC) and with the various charges which may be taken on land and other property as security for loans.</P>
      <P>Before discussing the Bill I would like to review briefly the work of the ACC.  The corporation were established in 1927 to cater for the special credit needs of agriculture, in particular to provide long-term credit which was not readily available from the commercial banks.  For many years the level of ACC's business was modest because of the traditional reluctance of farmers to borrow, a reluctance which was due in part to the poor profits in agriculture and the uncertain market opportunities available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The big change in investment came in the mid-sixties, reflecting the rapid improvement in the agricultural economy and the expectations generated by the prospect of entry into the European Economic Community.  ACC themselves gave a considerable impetus to the demand for credit.  During the past decade they conducted publicity campaigns in favour of greater investment in farming, they launched a highly successful deposits scheme to help finance their lending and they <Col N="757" /> expanded their organisation to cope with a big increase in business.  They established 35 district offices, staffed mainly with agricultural graduates, in order to bring their facilities within easy reach of customers and to maintain close contact with the diverse problems of farmers in the field.</P>
    <P>ACC's lendings, which were only £5 million in 1965, increased to £25 million in 1972.  They reached £35 million in 1973 and £85 million in 1976. Their lendings for 1977 are likely to rise to £105 million bringing total loans outstanding to £210 million.</P>
    <P>The corporation give loans, including hire-purchase facilities, for any purpose which is considered of benefit to agriculture or horticulture, the main demands being for loans for purchase of livestock, land purchase and improvement, buildings and machinery, seeds, grain and fertiliser, working capital, debt funding and family settlements. As well as loans to farmers, accommodation is provided for firms in the agricultural processing industries such as creameries, meat factories and grain mills.  Of the £105 million estimated lending in 1977, £90 million will go to farmers and £15 million to the processing industries.  Repayment periods vary from one to two years for seasonal loans to 15 years or more for land purchase.  Current rates of interest range from 8¾ per cent for seasonal loans payable within one year to 11½ per cent for term loans of ten years and over.</P>
    <P>The authorised share capital of the ACC is £10 million all of which has been taken up by the Minister for Finance.  They also have outstanding Exchequer loans amounting to £12.5 million and foreign loans totalling £32 million.  During the past few years they have financed the bulk of their business through their deposits scheme and repayments on existing loans.  The estimated intake of deposits in 1977 is £55 million which will bring the total amount on deposit with the ACC at the end of December to £175 million.</P>
    <P>I now proceed to the Bill before the House.  As I mentioned at the outset, it is largely a consolidating measure.  As legislation is urgently required to increase that statutory limit <Col N="758" /> to which the ACC may borrow, the Government decided to avail of the opportunity to bring up to date the existing legislation on agricultural credit which spans a period of almost 50 years and is dispersed over nine statutes.  Most of those statutes now contain several amendments and many provisions are obsolete.  In addition it has been decided to include some substantive amendments which I will explain shortly.</P>
    <P>The Bill is divided into five parts. Part I&mdash;Preliminary and General&mdash; contains definitions and conventional provisions about charges on the Central Fund and the payment into the Exchequer of money paid to the Minister pursuant to the Bill.  Part II is devoted to the corporation, their objects, powers, constitution and financing and the appointment and superannuation of staff.  Part III deals with chattel mortgages taken by the ACC and recognised banks&mdash;in practice the bulk of licensed banks.  It covers the registration of mortgages, the effect of mortgages in relation to the retention and disposal of stock, the seizure of stock under execution orders and the penalties for breaches of mortgage agreements. Part IV relates to charging provisions on land in respect of loans obtained from the corporation.  These include special charging procedures in cases where, for example, land is subject to equitable claims or a prospective borrower is only a tenant for life, the circumstances in which ACC charges can get priority over equitable interests or other land charges, and the extent to which tenants for life and others with limited tenancies may charge their holdings for ACC loans. Part IV also contains provisions whereby the ACC can themselves make orders charging loans on land with the consent of the borrower. Part V contains provisions to facilitate and protect lending by the ACC to agricultural co-operative societies.</P>
    <P>I will now refer to the main amendments to existing legislation which are included in the Bill.  Sections 8 and 9, which deal with the objects of the corporation, provide for an extension of powers to enable the ACC to give <Col N="759" /> credit facilities for the fisheries industry. It is not envisaged that ACC should compete with An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and other credit agencies in offering such facilities but rather to make provision for the future.  The demand for credit for our developing fishery industry may increase to such an extent that it may become necessary to supplement the services of the existing credit agencies.  In those circumstances, it would be desirable for the ACC to have the power to provide for the industry.</P>
    <P>Section 11 increases the authorised share capital of the corporation to £20 million from the existing limit of £10 million.  At present, however, it is not envisaged that the State would increase its investment in the corporation.  They are not in need of any further State equity at the moment but it is desirable that the State should have the power to increase its investment if a situation arose in which the corporation unexpectedly found themselves unable to meet their commitments from their normal sources of finance.  Section 12 and 14 provide for an increase in the maximum amount which may be borrowed by the corporation and guaranteed by the Minister for Finance. The new maximum of £350 million as against £220 million at present should meet ACC's requirements over the next three years.</P>
    <P>Section 15 continues the existing provision under which the corporation may obtain a ministerial guarantee against losses in certain circumstances. Two changes are, however, being made.  The ceiling on such guarantees &mdash;now £5 million&mdash;is increased to £10 million.  Secondly, in order to simplify procedures, guarantees will in future be given by the Minister for Finance, instead of the Minister for Agriculture with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Section 23, which deals with the giving of chattel mortgages as security for loans, extends the existing arrangements so as to obviate the need for separate mortgages and separate registration where more than one loan is envisaged for the same borrower over a period.  The definitions of both floating and specific chattel mortgages <Col N="760" /> are being extended to permit a single charge to cover both a current advance and future advances.</P>
    <P>Section 26 extends the period for registration of chattel mortgages in Circuit Court offices to one month from the existing period of 14 days which has been found to be inadequate. Section 37 contains a wider definition of permanent improvement purposes.  There are at present a number of provisions in the Agricultural Credit Acts whereby persons with limited tenancies can charge as security for loans from ACC provided that such loans are obtained for permanent improvements purposes.  As defined up to now such purposes are confined to improvements to land and buildings only, whereas other improvements, such as investment in extra livestock or machinery, may also be of permanent value to the land being charged.  It has been decided therefore to extend the definition of permanent improvement purposes to include any purpose which will be or is intended to be of permanent or long-term benefit to the farm business conducted on the land. Section 39 and 42 enable the ACC to acquire priority rights over various equitable claims on the land.  At present the corporation may avail of this facility only for loans up to a maximum of £10,000.  To allow for changes in money values since that limit was fixed the ceiling is being raised to £25,000.</P>
    <P>Section 47, which deals with the extent to which tenants for life may charge land for loans from the ACC, contains a new provision to facilitate lending to minor full owners where no trustees have been provided for in the original settlement.  Up to now where the ACC were prepared to give a loan to such a person they were precluded from advancing the money to anybody except trustees appointed for the purpose by the courts.  It is proposed that in such cases the ACC may, with the consent of the President of the High Court, nominate two suitable persons to receive the loan, such persons becoming trustees solely for the purpose of handling the loan in question.  Section 48 contains the existing arrangements under which a personal representative <Col N="761" /> of a deceased person may charge the land of deceased to secure an ACC loan.  Under existing legislation the amount involved may not exceed £10,000.  The ceiling is now being increased to £25,000 to take account of changes in money values.</P>
    <P>Section 54 relates to charging orders whereby the ACC may, with the consent of the borrower, make orders charging the land of the borrower with money advanced by them, or liable to be paid by them on foot of a guarantee.  There may be occasions where the ACC would be prepared to give loans which would be unsecured at the date of issue if they knew that, in the event of default in payment, they could proceed to make a charging order in arrear.  It is desirable, therefore, to empower the ACC to make such orders in arrear in addition to their present power to make charging orders when the loan is being given. The section provides accordingly.  The charging order would, of course, be made only with the consent of the borrower and would take effect only from the date on which it is made, not the date on which the loan was originally advanced.  Any priority rights acquired by other lenders in the meantime would not, therefore, be upset.</P>
    <P>The Schedule of enactments repealed lists the nine Agricultural Credit Acts which are being subsumed into this comprehensive Bill together with two provisions of the Agricultural Co-operative Societies (Debentures) Act, 1934.  The effect of repealing these two provisions is to dispense with the existing requirement that agricultural co-operatives must have the prior consent of the Minister for Agriculture to the issue of debentures.  It is considered that this requirement is no longer necessary and tends to duplicate investigations which the lending agencies undertake in any event to determine the credit-worthiness of the customer.</P>
    <P>The various amendments to which I have briefly referred are necessarily of a technical nature and I will be glad to elaborate on them when we come to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the financial provisions in this Bill recognise the prominent and successful role played by the <Col N="762" /> ACC in agricultural development and are designed to enable them to cope with the likely demands on them for credit over the next few years.  The changes proposed in the charging provisions are intended solely to simplify administration, leading to a more flexible charging system and more expeditious issue of loans.  There is also the advantage that all the legislation on agricultural credit will now be available in a single statue.</P>
    <P>Before I finish I would like to pay tribute to the directors and staff of the corporation for their dedication and enterprise in developing their organisation to its present impressive level.  The aim must now be to consolidate their position following a period of very rapid expansion while continuing to provide a first-class service to Irish agriculture.  I wish them every success. I commend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It goes almost without saying that my party will welcome, as my party has always done, any extension of the facilities available to the agricultural community.  This is not a new attitude on our part.  It has been part of our character and make-up for over 50 years.  On any measures coming before the House designed to assist the agricultural industry we have always had quite a number of knowledgeable, expert and extremely dedicated Deputies willing to contribute to the debate.  That will be the position on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that history and that level of interest on the part of all Deputies in matters agricultural, it seems to me extraordinary that the Minister should come in here with a Bill consisting of 35 pages and 40 sections, possibly more, outside of the Schedule, having issued it a week beforehand without any explanatory memorandum. I do not want to use the word &ldquo;discourtesy&rdquo; because I do not think any discourtesy was intended but, of all the parliaments in the world, An Dáil has a higher number of Deputies with an agricultural background than has any other legislative assembly.  We are predominantly an agricultural country. <Col N="763" /> It is our major industry.  A little thought in coming before the House with a Bill of this size, to facilitate those Deputies who are not actually rural by background but who recognise the importance of and the contribution made by agriculture to the economy, particularly the contribution made by the Agricultural Credit Corporation, would certainly have resulted in the issue of an explanatory memorandum. Such a memorandum would be extremely helpful.  I agree the Minister's opening statement was of benefit to the House, but we should all have liked an explanatory memorandum which we would have been able to study before we came into the House.</P>
    <P>We all appreciate the importance of agriculture to the economy.  We all know the contribution it has made and we willingly agree that it should be subsidised.  When we entered the EEC we could foresee the benefits to agriculture that our membership would bring.  We foresaw that the quality of our exports could be improved after many years in the doldrums, by necessary injections of capital, expertise, knowledge, dedication and general support.</P>
    <P>In the first four years of our EEC membership we had all these qualities devoted to the Department in an almost unknown way by the then Minister, Deputy Clinton.  The faith of the farming community and the trust which they willingly placed in Deputy Clinton were realised because he had shoulders broad enough to take that responsibility to the conference tables of Europe where he fought hard for the rights of Irish farmers and for their advancement, which meant the advancement of the whole nation.  At that time there was an element of doubt in the minds of farmers but after a short experience of Deputy Clinton's administration our farmers ceased to worry.</P>
    <P>The great difference between farming in the 1970s and into the 1980s and in the previous 40 years can be best defined by the difference between television advertisements by the commercial banks in the past and those we have seen more recently, in the <Col N="764" /> past two or three years.  Earlier, such advertisements showed well-dressed customers stepping out of big cars in the streets of Dublin.  That has changed and the people the banks' advertisements are now directed at are stepping from tractors in Ireland's fields.  That is a clear recognition of agriculture as our most important industry and it shows that none of us is far removed from agriculture in some form, that we all have some dung on our boots.  Of course in the future we will have our hills and shallow valleys but we will not be subjected to the massive depressions of countries with a less rural background.</P>
    <P>The ACC are well positioned to help in the expansion of agriculture, and although it is clear to all why, it is significant that it is the Minister for Finance who is introducing this technical Bill.  Deputies D'Arcy, Bruton and Donegan will have a lot to say later about the problems with which this technical Bill will confront the farmers.  For my part, I should like to issue a warning <i>vis-à-vis</i> other lending institutions in the State.  Some Deputies would suggest that they do not approve of commercial lending institutions and that they should be nationalised, and others would suggest that they can do no wrong.  The commercial banks have rights as well as responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The Bill indicates a clear understanding of the ACC.  It extends the area in which they can lend and it raises lending limitations.  It introduces new categories, for instance, fisheries, which I approve of because in a few years fisheries will be seen as a viable and valuable investment area.  I do not disapprove of the proposal to allow the ACC to expand their lending functions in new and different types of projects and of increasing the amount they can lend, but I would issue a warning about the possibility of State and semi-State institutions of a banking nature entering areas which the private sector had considered to be their field.  There may not necessarily be a conflict, and perhaps it is good that there should be an expansion of interests where the risk is high, but if we were to amalgamate all the <Col N="765" /> State lending agencies into one institution they would form a formidable business for any individual to deal with.  I am not disapproving of the IDA, Fóir Teoranta, the ICC and the ACC, but if we are to encourage them to enter the private sector to a larger degree, some form of discussion should be initiated between the banks and the Government in regard to the intentions of these institutions in the future.</P>
    <P>The ACC were very necessary when they were established.  They were lending money to farmers, large and small, who because of the lack of profitability in farming over almost half a century found it extremely difficult to borrow money from normal commercial sources.  That has changed now.  Farmers are now sought after as customers by the commercial banks but repayment by farmers in the future will not be so sure.  A business approach has been adopted to farming and there is a very much greater risk and very much bigger investment in the hope of a much larger profit.  The risk is greater and will become greater still in the future because of the prices at which land is changing hands.  In some cases it is sold at over £2,000 an acre. I am not an agricultural economist but having done sums on the basis of yields in the dairy industry it is difficult to see how a profit can be made in some of the areas where land is fetching prices of this order.</P>
    <P>The Minister has raised from £10 million to £20 million the issued capital of ACC.  There is a section in the Bill which dictates that the number of directors on the board who shall be Minister's appointees will be in accordance with the amount of money held by the Minister.  Up to now that has been 100 per cent and therefore the Minister nominated all the directors.  I do not know if the Bill will change this but as a matter of curiosity perhaps the Minister will tell us if there will be any change in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party I welcome this Bill.  I will always support anything that gives a better opportunity to provide credit for the agricultural community.  They are certainly entitled to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> I want to put on record here the part played by the ACC in the expansion of the agricultural industry over the past ten or 12 years.  It is interesting to note that the amount lent by the ACC has increased from £5 million in 1965 to a projected £105 million in 1977.  That is a remarkable increase.  They have played a major part in the huge step forward in agriculture during that period.  We must increase agricultural output if we are to survive and in order to advance and progress we must provide the where-withal. Credit must be available to the people engaged in our major industry. The amounts of money involved in agriculture are huge and improvements must be made if we are to benefit from our membership of the EEC and reach our potential in providing jobs.</P>
    <P>I often think that Bills of this kind do not go far enough.  In general, my experience of the ACC has been good but the small farmer very often finds it impossible to get credit from the ACC, though he has proved himself an excellent farmer.  Because he has not got sufficient land to give a guarantee he finds a reluctance on the part of the ACC to give him a loan.  He lacks the collateral to borrow the money he needs to make his enterprise viable.  I would ask the ACC to consider that kind of person and to take into account his past record.  Money should be available to enable people to improve their holdings and for the replacement and improvement of stock.  It is my personal experience that even people with a sizeable amount of land sometimes find it hard to get recognition from the ACC.</P>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion of the fishing industry because it will need huge financing in the years to come.  I also welcome the fact that the ACC can lend money to co-operatives and meat factories and food processing establishments of all kinds.  It cannot be emphasised enough that we must develop the potential for employment in this sector if we are to make any impact on our unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statement in the Fianna Fáil manifesto that our produce should be processed at home.  I <Col N="767" /> take it to mean that it is lunacy for us to export live cattle and that money should be available to expand the meat industry and to establish new industries related to agriculture.  They may be small industries but they will survive because they are the backbone of agriculture which is traditional in our rural society.  I do not believe that private enterprise is capable of this type of operation but if it is prepared to undertake the job its efforts would be welcomed by me.  I agree with Deputy Barry than an explanatory memorandum would have been helpful with a Bill of this size.  At the same time I believe the Bill had to be introduced now.</P>
    <P>The Minister should ensure that money is made available for the development of agriculture.  There is no doubt that small farmers are capable of increasing their production if they are given credit.  In the past, the ACC have been slow to give credit to small farmers.  The ACC should consider all types of farming in relation to credit facilities.  If farmers were given credit they would increase their herds and their land and thus create more employment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and assure the Minister that my party will support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because it will go a long way towards consolidating the previous Bills.  As the Minister rightly pointed out, the ACC came to life in the mid-sixties. Before that, they extended little credit and their approach to examining the creditworthiness of farmers was pathetic.  They used to send confidential reports to the local Garda barracks and this stopped many farmers from applying for credit.  The attitude of farmers at that time was that the ACC were the last straw. In the mid-sixties it was realised that a system of long-term payments was needed by farmers.  At that time the banks changed their policies to suit the money market and farmers' overdrafts were called in for no apparent reason.  In 1960, the then Minister for Agriculture saw that there was potential in farming and that the <Col N="768" /> industry needed a system of finance that was in keeping with it.  At that time there were also management changes in the ACC.  They realised the needs of the farmer and opened branch offices throughout the country.  They now have 35 branches and most of them are staffed by agricultural advisers.  This was a wise decision because most farmers seeking loans considered the agricultural adviser to be their friend.  An expansion in agriculture followed a £5 million loan in 1965.  When I first came into this House the figure was only £1½ million.  In 1965, the upgrading of ACC had begun.  This year it is expected that their loans will total £200 million.</P>
      <P>The one-year loan scheme for fertilisers and grain has been a great boon to farmers.  Many grain merchants charge double interest for six months' credit but the one-year loan scheme has helped farmers to buy their supplies at the keenest prices. There is a great difference between the list price and what one can bargain for because a merchant must get in a certain amount of cash in spring time due to the amount of credit he has to obtain from financial institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the family settlements have been reintroduced in the agreements with the ACC.  They were introduced in the sixties but were withdrawn some years later and nothing was given for family settlements.  That was a mistake.  Very often members of a family, a mother, father or sister must be settled when a farm is taken over by a young man.  It is only right that they should receive a reasonable weekly income.  In Denmark, Sweden and other countries, when a father or mother hand over a holding to a son it is done on a financial basis.  The Minister has told us that of the £105 million estimated lending of the ACC in 1977, £90 million will go to farmers and £15 million to the processing industries.  That looks good on paper but many of the meat processing industries are in a position to get money from the ordinary banking institutions.  It is my view that the £15 million is allocated to very few industries.  I am aware that it has gone <Col N="769" /> to companies that have been involved in processing for many years and have had good facilities with banks.  The ACC should examine the question of loans to the processing industry particularly if there is a danger that farmers will be left short.  The situation is different in relation to the co-ops. Because they are run by farmers it is only natural that they should approach the ACC for money.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that the Bill deals with chattel mortgages taken by the ACC and recognised banks.  If we are to expand long-term leasing of land that is necessary.  The person without land or a farmer's son will now be given an opportunity of going into farming with a chance of having land for a reasonable number of years. Unless he has the money to purchase the land he will not have great security and for that reason such chattel mortgages are necessary.  They are based on a farmer's ability and credit-worthiness. In view of the high cost of land the chances of such young men getting involved in agriculture are poor unless through the system of leasing for a number of years.  This provision will be of great assistance to the people in the west because it takes some time to get title in order there.  More than 60 per cent of the land in that province is owned by people of 55 years of age and upwards and this provision will be of great benefit to those who succeed such people.</P>
    <P>The ACC have done more than the Land Commission in getting farmers up to economic status.  In many cases the banks did not give assistance to the farmers at the same rate the ACC did.  The ACC gave an opportunity to small farmers to buy land and improve their holding without having to wait for the Land Commission to divide a farm.  The fact that the ACC make money available to farmers to improve their holdings means that the process of division is speeded up.  Farmers welcome the fact that when they obtain a long-term loan from the ACC they are not compelled to make the first repayment for a long period.  That gives them an opportunity of getting some profit on the money they have invested in the farm.  We all know that <Col N="770" /> it takes some time to get any return from an investment in agriculture and the ACC recognise that also.  They know the needs of the agricultural community.  This Bill covers the likely demands for agricultural credit over the next few years.</P>
    <P>The ACC have been setting a pattern for lending procedures to agriculture. They have staffed their offices with agricultural advisers mainly.  The main banks have been following suit. They have taken on quite a number of agricultural graduates to advise them and to advise farmers getting loans from the banks.  The ACC have been the pace-setters in the field of credit to agriculture.  They have come a long way since the early 1960s.  This Bill provides the money for the ACC who will set a headline for agriculture over the next few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. We have come a long way since the time when the present Taoiseach as Minister for Finance refused to guarantee that he would provide a sum of £1.6 million if it was not forthcoming from other sources.  He change his tune between Question Time and a question on the adjournment and gave that guarantee.  At that time, we were talking about figures like £1 million and £1.6 million.  Now much larger sums of money are involved.</P>
      <P>Every praise should be given to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  They have many notable firsts to their credit. They were the first semi-State company to go out into the market and ask for investment.  They have been extremely successful in this field, far more successful than their counterparts in the Industrial Credit Company.  They were the first to decentralise and open offices for lending and borrowing and normal banking business in all the major towns.  This has been a real success story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They were the first to offer loan facilities to farmers on a spring to autumn basis for the purchase of seeds and fertilisers for cash.  Therefore the farmer was the boss and he could go into the merchant and say: &ldquo;I am here with cash.  What is your lowest <Col N="771" /> price?&rdquo;  That was a great move forward, and one on which we should congratulate the ACC.  They were the first to offer long-term banking facilities with consequent lower repayments. They were the first to extend banking facilities to farmers without deposit of deeds for security.  Deputy Crinion mentioned the 18 months moratorium. Under that scheme a farmer who got a loan from the ACC did not have to pay both principal and interest for the first 18 months.  That enabled the farmer to get on his feet.  He knew that for 18 months all he had to pay was the interest charge.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the then Taoiseach and the then Minister for Finance said that loans must not be made unless the documents were deposited within three months.  Happily that never came to pass.  At that time, those gentlemen were described in private as a pair of welching bookmakers if they made the people do that.  The House knows how long documents can lie in solicitors' offices before the business is finally signed, sealed and delivered. That is now water under the bridge and the customer who deals with the ACC knows that, on average, he will get a better deal with the ACC than with the commercial banks.</P>
    <P>It is also worthy of note that the ACC were the first to lend money on chattel mortgage loans, thereby leaving the deeds of borrowers available for deposit elsewhere, and thereby increasing spectacularly the borrowing capacity of the company or the individual concerned.  This was a very big step forward.  I remember going in to a man&mdash;no names no pack drill &mdash;who was then the secretary of the ACC.  He said to me: &ldquo;Mr. Donegan, you know what will happen if you do not repay your chattel mortgage.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;I do.  I go to jail.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;Yes, and so do I.&rdquo;  It is of great benefit that we have the chattel mortgage situation as it is today.</P>
    <P>There is still a reluctance on the part of some farmers and co-operatives to borrow money from the ACC even from spring to harvest.  That is wrong. Perhaps it relates to the dreadful experiences <Col N="772" /> during the Economic War. Those experiences should be set aside and our land should be farmed to its maximum capacity.  The banks did not like the ACC going into their field and made their views known very clearly.  In that climate the ACC had to expand.</P>
    <P>There were occasions when the Minister for Finance of the time put the brake on and, after 18 months or so, realised he was wrong, took off the brake and pressed the accelerator.  We do not want that stop-go policy in Irish agriculture.  We must have a continuing process of increased production, and farmers must be allowed to increase their production in a very obvious profit situation.  Continuity in lending is highly important.  Putting the load where it should be, on the backs of the farmers, is highly important also.</P>
    <P>There is only one man living today who went through the whole course. He was there when the ACC opened their first office and happily he is still with us.  It is proper that I should recall that at this time.  He served the ACC with honour and brilliance for 50 years.  He is a striking example of the high quality of the staff of the ACC over that whole 50-year period.  We wish him well, and many happy years.</P>
    <P>This will not be the last time the Minister for Finance will have to come back to the House to amend this legislation. I look forward to the ACC expanding and expanding again and taking their place as one of the major finance houses of this State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief. I could not let this occasion pass without welcoming this Bill.  Any farmer who would not welcome the Bill, which will co-ordinate the work of the ACC, and who would let it go without saying a few words in praise of what the ACC have done for Irish farming, is not worthy of the name farmer.  Comments have been made here today about lending and borrowing.  Some of us who started the co-operative movement in the western regions, where there was not much confidence, know we had to depend on the ACC to get going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember going to the ACC looking for money for a co-operative and I was told we were not as credit-worthy <Col N="773" /> as a private company.  I had a little bother in trying to convince them we were.  They said members of co-operatives were unpaid, while members of companies were paid; a man would take an interest in his company if his salary was at stake but, while committee members of co-operatives were bursting with enthusiasm in the initial stages, when management was appointed, and so on, quite naturally they lost interest because they were unpaid.  Eventually we convinced them that was not so.</P>
    <P>We got them interest in the co-operative movement.  At that time co-operatives had a lean time in the west.  Some of the commercial banks said they were great while the going was good.  As Deputy Donegan said, there was a stop-go policy and the squeeze was put on very quickly.  I am associated with co-operatives which would not be open today were it not for the ACC.  Banks closed their accounts.  You had these ups and downs and this is where the ACC have been a great addition to the farmer. I am glad that the Minister also stated that it may be necessary for the State to come in and that they can come in if necessary under this Bill to assist the ACC in providing a service which is very important to farmers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham rightly mentioned the question of finance for small farmers which is very relevant in my area.  I have always held that it is not the amount of security in land or money that a man has which should determine his eligibility for a loan.  That is why I say it is very important that the ACC and all lending agencies should have&mdash;as they now have&mdash;qualified agricultural advisers to judge the ability of the man, not on the acreage he owns but on himself. In fairness to the ACC, from my experience, it did not matter if a man had not great security in land, if they thought he was a good man and doing a good job they would give him the money.  This must be emphasised because you can get a man with a very small acreage who is a go-ahead type and will succeed whereas you can get a very wealthy man to whom you can give all the money in the country and <Col N="774" /> he will let it go down the drain. Recently, all lenders are judging the man more on himself than on his security at the time he seeks the loan.  I have had very close association with the ACC and I must give them credit for the fact that when you bring them somebody you think is a good man they are very sympathetic as regards loans.</P>
    <P>The annual loan for fertilisers and seed is an excellent idea.  An ambitious man can get the loan, pay it back and borrow again as mentioned by Deputy Crinion.  This is a very big Bill and although the Minister did not issue a lengthy memorandum, he condensed it in his speech which covered all the main points.  We can go into it section by section on Committee Stage.  The Minister dealt with the principal items about which we wanted information.  We are delighted that this Bill is brought in to consolidate the ACC.  We know that the ACC will be there in the future to finance farmers and that they need not fear to borrow.  All farmers fear borrowing for the simple reason that they had sad experience in the past.  I am a little older than some Deputies here and I must say that the commercial banks came in when the going was good. When we were setting up marts these banks were vying with each other in putting money into them.  But suddenly a bank squeeze came and people who had been prepared to get money and put it into bricks and mortar were in difficulty.  We set up a committee to advise them to be careful where they spent their money.  I was a member of that umbrella committee.  When the banks put on the squeeze the ACC helped many people.  That is why I say that without the ACC there would not be the same confidence among farmers. The banks are providing an ideal service but they might squeeze at a time when it would not suit the farmer. That is why every Deputy who has spoken so far has praised the ACC.</P>
    <P>My association with the ACC was always in regard to borrowing money, not paying it back and I must give them due credit.  We are on our feet now in the co-operative movement in the west but we were in the red for a long time and did now know when we <Col N="775" /> would be closed down.  We always had to go back to the ACC and every time we did so if we put up a pretty good case, even though it meant heavy borrowing, we got the money.  It would be unfair if I did not make known the way the ACC treated the co-operative movement and the small farmers.  I want them to continue in that way for the benefit of small farmers who want money to buy machinery.  I have no doubt these people will continue to get money from the ACC as they are doing.</P>
    <P>I refrain from repeating much of what Deputy Crinion said.  I am very pleased at what the farmers are doing with the money they get from the ACC but I am not happy with the processing side of the business.  I am not satisfied the processors of agricultural produce are efficient; if they were, they should be able to pay a better price to the producer and nothing would be exported on the hoof.  I have very strong views on this.  It is the Government's aim to process every bit of farm produce but farmers must be paid a competitive price for it.  At present people can buy it on the hoof and process it abroad and this is what I am not happy about. As regards the use farmers are making of the money from ACC, this can be seen throughout the country.  I welcome this Bill in a big way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill.  In doing so may I say that it would have been a great help if we had an explanatory document before us.  However, we shall have another opportunity to discuss the various sections.  The ACC have given farmers confidence and hope.  Changes must be made to cater for future needs in order to streamline operations, to modernise them and make them attractive to prospective borrowers. The ACC have a very well qualified staff as far as agriculture is concerned, particularly at ground level.  One of the farmer's greatest difficulties for many years was the lack of experienced and qualified staff to deal effectively with loans for different farm enterprises. This vacuum has now been filled by ACC.  Their system of inspection <Col N="776" /> on the farms gives them firsthand information when assessing the credibility of farmers.  I compliment the staff both in the country and in the head office.  In the country, because of their experience they can give valuable advice on how money should be borrowed.  Their visits bring ACC right on to the farm and this is essential to-day. They adopt a very humane approach.  The old conservative image of head office and the old civil service attitude have gone.  It was not easy to borrow money at one time from the ACC.  Now, even an ordinary farmer can telephone the head office and this is necessary.  If he finds the going difficult, he can approach head office and that is as it should be.</P>
      <P>One of the great steps forward in recent years has been cheque issuing at local level.  This was necessary because the farmer borrowing money for any purpose could not afford a long delay before he received his cheque.  Up to this all applications were made at local level, they were then transported to Dublin and processed there.  Small problems then went into the melting pot and there were long delays before people finally received the go-ahead or their cheques for whatever they needed them for.  This was red tape procedure.  I am glad to see this has now ceased and that we have cheques issued from local offices where any farmer can get the necessary funds, no matter how big. The regional manager has authority to issue £40,000, the county officer £20,000 and an area officer £10,000. This indicates the amount of authority that was handed down from the top to those actually working in the field with the farmers.  They can now process the applications and issue cheques up to those amounts if they consider the particular farmers are creditworthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather disappointed at some of the provision in the Bill.  We should have passbooks in the ACC for depositors.  I always believed this was necessary during my time as director of ACC.  I am prepared to accept that the larger depositors are well catered for.  Small depositors, whether they be <Col N="777" /> farmers or other people in our towns throughout the country, who are prepared to avail of the Government guarantee and the attractive interest rates, should be issued with passbooks by the ACC.  This would attract more savings which would substantially increase the funds of the ACC.</P>
    <P>The ACC should be allowed operate current account facilities.  This is a very big step which I believe will have to be taken by the ACC during the next few years.  The Minister will receive great opposition to this measure from the commercial banks. There is lots of room for the ACC with current account facilities and also for commercial banks with current account facilities.  I believe that great benefits can be obtained from current account facilities in many cases where large sums of money in current accounts are not being used and no interest is being paid on them.  I believe this is the more lucrative area as far as the commercial banks are concerned.  The ACC should be given the same benefits because they are now in competition with the commercial banks.  The Government are the biggest shareholders but they do not help with interest rates or they do not help with money.  The ACC have to go on the open market when they require money.  They must buy their funds on the money market or in deposits.  I believe they should be given the same benefits as the commercial banks in relation to current account facilities.</P>
    <P>We always live in the shadow of a bank strike.  I believe the bitter experience of 1970 and, to a lesser degree the experience of 1976, has not yet diminished.  Severe scars were left in many areas.  A lot of innocent people had to suffer.  It is essential, from a national point of view, that an alternative banking system be made available for farmers and for other sections of the community in the event of a bank strike.  The ACC are now in the process of providing a network of offices throughout the country which will enable them to offer an alternative banking system to all sectors of the community.</P>
    <P>During the 1976 bank strike the ACC were widely used by firms for <Col N="778" /> their deposits or for obtaining money to pay staff in their factories or firms backed up by guaranteed cheques and for a variety of other purposes.  Everybody realises the risk of holding large sums of money on business premises or in private houses.  People are inclined to lodge money outside the country in the absence of an alternative system.  This happened during both bank strikes when money was lodged in England and Northern Ireland. Large sums of this money did not return to the country.  That is another reason why an alternative should be available when a bank strike occurs so that other sections of the community, apart from farmers, who deposit large sums of money, would have an alternative banking system.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential when the ACC are engaged in building premises all over the country that they provide facilities in them for safes, the same as commercial banks, and that they have facilities to carry out current transactions.  I will welcome the day when the Minister comes back with such proposals to the Dáil.  Current account facilities would give greater profitability which would in turn find its way back to the production lines on farms and put the ACC on a competitive basis with other money lending institutions.  Cheaper funds would then be available for the future development of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I believe the development of our small farms needs immediate attention. The greatest impact can be made here by the proper investment of money on the production side.  Deputy Bermingham said he was slightly disappointed with the operations of ACC with regard to small farmers.  My experience has been directly the opposite. If it were not for the ACC over the past ten to 12 years our small farmers would have been in a very difficult position because they had not the capacity to borrow.  Any bank manager will look at the capacity of that man to borrow money.  Things might be difficult in the case of small farmer, with 40 to 50 acres and family commitments, walking into a bank manager and asking for a loan of £10,000 or £15,000.  Such a man had <Col N="779" /> no hope of obtaining that loan.  Things might be different today.</P>
    <P>The ACC have set the headlines as far as the small farmer section of the community are concerned.  They have given those people the necessary credit during the past ten years.  There is need for investment in that area.  The time has come when assessment of the potential development of small farmers working on very low incomes under the farm modernisation scheme must be looked at.  When these plans are ready there must be no delay in providing the money for their implementation. These are plans that are backed up by grants from the EEC.  I trust that the farm retirement scheme, too, gets off the ground at the next review. It is then that the ACC will be needed to provide money, first, for capital investment and, secondly, for the purchase of land in order to make these small holdings viable.</P>
    <P>Production enterprises on small farms would result in much benefit to the whole economy.  Sooner or later the interest rates applicable to small farmers in respect of borrowings will have to be subsidised in some way.  At the moment interest rates are favourable but in so far as the ACC and the commercial banks are concerned we need only think back one year when interest rates were at levels of 14, 15, 16 and in some cases 17½ per cent. It would seem that interest rates are on the climb again in England so it is reasonable to assume that whatever happens there in this respect will happen here also within a short time. Small farmers cannot afford high rates of interest.  It has always been my opinion that small farmers requiring large amounts of capital, whether that capital be for the purchase of land or for capital investment in housing, the latter being non-productive, should be able to borrow on a long-term basis and also at rates that are static.</P>
    <P>It is only right that the ACC should be in the position of being able to vary their interest rates.  I recall, from my experience on the board, a sum of £30 million being on loan at rates of 6 or 7 per cent.  The people who had that money were aware that if they re-applied to the ACC their interest <Col N="780" /> rates might be changed.  Consequently, if they needed more money they would borrow from the commercial banks. However, that interest rate had to be carried by the borrowers who came afterwards.  I am glad that the ACC have taken the necessary step in this regard.  At any rate, the small farmer cannot afford the sort of interest rates that applied in, say the second half of 1976.</P>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to sections 27 and 28 which deal with the question of a chattel mortgage. I am not satisfied with the terms in this regard but I understand that there will be an opportunity later for tabling amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the meantime I would ask the Minister to bear in mind the iniquitous situation which provides for the buying of cattle on a chattel mortgage.  Rather, permission to borrow should be based, first, on the confidence of the prospective borrower, secondly, on the trust that the corporation place in him and, thirdly on his farming record.  In addition there is the point which embraces all of these, that is, the man's credit-worthiness. Consequently, I am suggesting that the provision in this regard be watered down.  It is not good enough that a person who wishes to sell, say, six or seven cattle out of a number that have been purchased by way of a chattel mortgage, must give seven days notice of his intention to the ACC.  In general I cannot find much wrong with the Bill but this specific provision is objectionable.  Borrowers must be capable of being trusted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An area officer can have up to 600 files relating to farmers in his area. This gives some idea of the amount of work involved both for the officer and for his staff.  Of the people on his books up to 250 might have loans on a chattel mortgage basis.  It is not difficult to conceive of a situation in which the officer on the occasion of a sale in his area would have up to 50 applications for sanction to sell.  A huge amount of time would be involved, <Col N="781" /> first, in examining the applications and, secondly, in giving the necessary authority.  One can think of a situation in which a person would buy 80 cattle.  That would involve big money as the animals would cost about £400 each.  If the occasion arose that he wished to sell 20 of those cattle, he should be able to go ahead and, perhaps, replace them with 20 more. Some cattle fatten quicker than others. In any case, a person in such a situation should not have to go to his local ACC office each time he wished to sell off some of the cattle.  This situation complicates matters not only for the farmer but for the local officer and for the ACC.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the changing provisions are intended solely to simplify administration, thereby leading to a more flexible charging system and to a more expeditious issuing of loans.  How can the Minister reconcile that sentence with the provision in respect of a chattel mortgage?  Instead of the section simplifying matters it is complicating them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree. Section 27 (3) reads that:</P>

      <P>In other words, he must go through the ACC before effecting any change in his stock.  Is that clear to the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it is not the making of loans that is dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so but it concerns the operation involved in the granting of loans.  It has been stated here that farmers are going to the ACC in large numbers to borrow the full cost of manures, seeds and so on, on a one-year basis.  The bulk of this <Col N="782" /> money is unsecured.  I accept that there is a risk of security in this but that is not the only area in which there is risk.  If a man borrows to buy, say, manure, he will apply the manure to the ground.  Subsequently, a crop is sown and in due course the grain is sent to the merchant.  There is no guarantee of the repaying of the money borrowed.  There should be the same flexibility in respect of the buying of cattle by way of chattel mortgage.</P>
      <P>I welcome the section relating to the charges on deeds.  It is difficult to follow the text of the Bill and apply it accordingly.  This was a bottleneck in ACC over a number of years.  At one time they were very conscious about securities.  That has been relaxed and this section will relax it even more. People applied for loans.  Although the loans were granted, they had to get a bridging loan.  There was a snag there.  The bridging loan was given at 1 per cent or 2 per cent higher than the loan rate.  This meant that the farmer had to use the bridging loan and pay a higher rate of interest until such time as the full charge was put on his deeds.</P>
      <P>As we all know, these deeds get seriously bogged down in solicitors' offices.  If there is any snag, no matter how small, it can be a very slow process to have the charge put on the deeds.  I have known cases where it took as long as a year to put the charge on the deeds.  That unfortunate farmer had to pay the extra 2 per cent on the bridging loan instead of starting to make his repayments on the loan proper.  Therefore, I welcome this section, which I hope will relieve this bottleneck.</P>
      <P>I accept that if deeds are not in order the ACC have to be careful about handing out loans.  In the majority of cases these will be reasonably in order.  It should take only about a three month period to put a loan through the registration office and get the charge put on the deeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to praise the ACC for the development loan scheme which has a one year moratorium.  This was a good and sound move so far as lending money to farmers was concerned.  If a farmer borrowed from other people, he would suddenly realise that the six <Col N="783" /> month period had passed and he would have to repay the money borrowed. This new scheme which can be attached to the farm modernisation scheme is one of the best ever introduced. This scheme has been &ldquo;flying&rdquo; over the last year.</P>
    <P>The corporation are asking for an increase of the amount of money they can borrow at one time from £220,000 to £350,000.  This is very significant and indicates the growth expected over the next few years.  The corporation are becoming one of the most powerful institutions in the State.  From time to time people complain about the way semi-State bodies are run.  From my experience in ACC I can assure the House that there is no laxity as far as the staff there are concerned and there is a very good working atmosphere. In my view this must benefit agriculture.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister and the Department will continue with the expansion and development of the ACC across the country, with particular reference to the local offices in most major towns.  This policy is vital to the needs of agriculture.  The ACC have 45 offices&mdash;I am subject to correction on that figure&mdash;across the country.  The Minister should give every encouragement for the development of this corporation. I look forward to the day when he comes back to the Dáil for current account facilities for the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  He will then put them in a very sound position, thereby benefiting the farming community and the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>As the Minister stated in his opening remarks, this Bill is designed to consolidate the Agricultural Credit Acts, 1927 to 1975, and rightly so.  We live in an era of quick and decisive change.  Our greatest single national industry must be geared to meet the challenge of the future. The ACC will have to play their full role in advancing the needs of the agricultural community if they are to make the real impact on Europe that many people expect.  Therefore, I welcome the opportunity to make a few comments on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> I was disappointed that greater emphasis had not been laid on the role of the small farmer in Irish society and his ability to play his part in the furtherance of our greatest export industry. I was also disappointed that some effort had not been made to ensure that the small farmer received preferential treatment by way of loans to enable him to consolidate his holding and provide a more viable holding for himself and his family.  In my view there is need for something of that nature to be done.  There is need to make secure as many farming families as possible because of the contribution they can make to society and to our export industry.  It must be remembered that agriculture is our greatest export industry because of the availability of raw materials from our soil.  Other industries have made a great impact on our economy in recent years, but agriculture has presented us with our greatest opportunity for many years.  This is because of our entry into Europe and because of our access to a market of millions of people, something which was denied to the farming community in the past.  I would like to see decisions being taken now that would ensure that the small farmer is given every opportunity to play a greater role in agricultural production.</P>
    <P>It is often said that agriculture is only a secondary industry.  When one remembers the amount earned from agricultural exports in recent years, one realises that this industry must be geared and modernised in every way possible to meet the challenges of the future.  We all know that the farming community have come a long way in recent years and that new market outlets have been responsible for that. Everybody knows agriculture is an industry which must face the challenge of the future and be prepared to overcome many obstacles.</P>
    <P>We should remember the situation which existed here in 1974 when there was a crisis in agriculture.  I was disappointed on that occasion to see that the Agricultural Credit Corporation made special efforts to collect the instalments which were due by borrowers.  They did not take into consideration <Col N="785" /> the crisis situation then and many small farmers went by the board in 1974 when they were unable to meet their commitments.  Their inability in 1974 has prevented many of them from getting further loans in order to make progress.  A second chance must be given to ambitious farmers who want to carry out a programme defined by themselves in conjunction with the local agricultural officer.  It is gratifying to know that so many people are involved in assisting the farmer to achieve the maximum return for the money borrowed.  In the old days he had to depend on his ability.  That situation has changed now, he can consult with his local agricultural adviser and they can work out a programme geared to obtain for the farmer a maximum return for the money borrowed that will enable him to meet his repayments as they become available.  Unfortunately disease and crop failure and so on can prevent a farmer from meeting his commitments.  Greater emphasis must be laid on giving a farmer who defaults another opportunity.  From my experience in dealing with the ACC I know that sons of farmers who defaulted are still regarded as a risk. There is need for change.  No son should be blamed because of his father's inability to meet his commitments. These areas are worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>Another area worthy of consideration is the marketing arrangements we have in this free sale area. Unfortunately, when a small farmer discovers that a patch of land is becoming available and feels that it is within his grasp to purchase the land he is outbid by a bigger farmer who has access to greater financial resources so the small farmer must go back to his original situation.  He must remain an inviable unit of production because of his inability to compete with the bigger farmers.  The time has come when price control will have to be introduced.  As we all know, land prices in Ireland are the highest in Europe.  Prices must be related to the production which can be secured from agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Credit Corporation have been of service.  They have <Col N="786" /> played their role in the agricultural industry and the greatest step that they took was their decision to devolve. The method of devolution on the part of the ACC was timely.  This devolution came at a time when greater focus was being beamed on agriculture and the local office has been a wonderful asset to the agricultural community. It has personalised the method of borrowing. The official in the local office personally can get to know borrowers, their ability and their potential.  The introduction of the local office was a useful exercise.  After 50 years I hope that the ACC will continue to serve the community and I hope that at some future date efforts will be made to give preferential treatment to small farmers.</P>

      <P>I too welcome this Bill. I particularly welcome the measure which increases the share capital from £10 million to £20 million.  This is a valuable step.  I also welcome the increase in borrowing powers which are guaranteed by the Minister from £220 million to £350 million.  This is in keeping with the greater intensification in agriculture in all its many facets The other aspect which I identify in this Bill is the simplification of security.  Traditionally one was only allowed to borrow up to the value of two-thirds of the value of the land held.  This has been loosened to some extent in recent years, but certainly in this Bill I see a conscious effort to simplify the kinds of security required. I see increased emphasis on the project, on the man, on the management and on the enterprise.  These are very welcome and timely measures in the development of the work of the ACC.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions which allow for an expanded involvement in the whole area of agricultural business. In this day and age we have major quasi-industrial projects in processing and marketing and in co-operative development which offer the greatest job potential and I am very glad to see the Minister taking this measure in relation to the position of the ACC.  They will in effect be able to cater for this kind of development adequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barry sounded a word of <Col N="787" /> caution about the ACC in relation to the banks.  Traditionally the ACC have fulfilled the role for which they were originally established.  If we consider why we have the ACC, we will identify that the ACC deal generally with the higher risk areas in agriculture.  They have always been a stand-by for the farmer and grower in periods of depression, when the banks may be influenced by other factors outside the country or outside the Government policy of the day.  I see the ACC as an instrument assisting the Government in achieving their policies.  I also see the work of the ACC as a major factor in providing stability and in overcoming the stop-go policies which bedevilled agriculture for so many years.  The ACC have on many occasions stimulated the banks to participate with the farming community and have in that sense had a very beneficial effect on the total availability of borrowing for the industry.</P>
    <P>The ACC have played a major role in national policy.  I join with the Minister for Finance in commending the ACC and the work which has been done over the years and on their development in relation to the needs of the farming community.  The ACC have played a very major part in the structural development of agriculture. The ACC's policy in recent years has been to develop farms to the level of 100 acres.  It is interesting to note that in a 1976 survey of 2,000 farms in which  borrowing was done through the ACC, the average acreage of borrowers had risen to 66 acres, and the average of new loans indicated further expansion on average of 33 acres, bringing the sort of thing which is happening within the ACC in relation to farm size very close to the objectives.</P>
    <P>From that survey it is self-evident that the ACC have had a major influence on the structural development of Irish farming.  They have pioneered several measures, such as the special encouragement to family farm settlements for periods up to 25 years.  Deputy D'Arcy has mentioned the one-year moratorium on development loan repayments.  I join with him <Col N="788" /> in commending this measure which emphasises the development-oriented approach of the ACC in recent years and the encouragement they have given in a phased way to commercial development and also to transitional farmers.  I also commend the work done by the many agricultural graduates employed in the ACC and those who worked in conjunction with the ACC in achieving their targets.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham has said that he hopes Fianna Fáil are serious about their promises to support the maximum home processing of farm products.  In this connection the measures here are very valuable. Firstly in relation to the development work of the ACC I want to see a new emphasis on intensification in agriculture, and this Bill will provide the basis for that.  There is a need for greater output from existing farms and horticultural holdings, so intensification in agriculture must be matched by similar developments within the ACC.  These are provided for in the Bill.  The second major development I would like to see is that of agri-business. I welcome the provision in Part V to facilitate and protect lending by the ACC to agriculture and horticultural co-operatives.  This would be a major development, and as an instrument in policy I would welcome greater involvement by these co-operatives in the development of intensive agriculture.  This will involve both greater responsibility on the part of the people in the co-operatives and backing from the Government such as is being provided in this Bill through the provision and making available of the necessary capital to the people in the co-operatives.  I also welcome the provision in sections 8 and 9 which extends the power to enable the ACC to give credit facilities to the fishery industry.  This is a very viable measure and an area which we hope will help considerably in job creation, which all parties here support.</P>
    <P>I want to see rapid development in the agri-business sector of the ACC to develop the processing, marketing and other intensive areas in agriculture. I want to see a comprehensive agri-business division, with broad <Col N="789" /> staffing, in the ACC.  I am aware that such a division has existed for the past few years.  I would like to see its operation broadened and deepened to include broader staffing with specialists in dairy science, agriculture and other related disciplines.  Finally, I would like to see a development parallel to the measure given in this Bill to provide for agri-business as the IDA provide for Irish industry.  How that should be provided is a matter for further discussion.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on this Bill and I welcome it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in welcoming this legislation. Particularly I welcome the fact that it is a consolidating Bill.  The officials of the Department of Finance, the Minister and his predecessor are to be complimented on bringing forward legislation in this form.  All who will be concerned with reading statutes will realise that amending legislation which does not consolidate makes life very difficult and probably costs a great deal of time, which is valuable, in offices throughout the country in going back on previous legislation.  That is all costing money.  The fact that the Government have brought forward a consolidating Bill on this occasion is something which should not be allowed to pass without a few complimentary words.</P>
      <P>When one is bringing in new legislation, as I know from my experience in office, the temptation is to go for amending legislation because usually you can get that through the parliamentary draftsman's office more quickly than you can if you go for consolidating legislation.  This is one of the problems we are always encountering, because the Government are under pressure at all times to provide legislation fast and if they go for consolidation they are not able to do that. One of the reasons the Government have been able to produce consolidating legislation on this occasion is that the number of new measures being implemented in this Bill is not so very great.  The major part of the Bill is really just re-enacting existing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="790" /> The Agricultural Credit Corporation's story since the passing of the Agricultural Credit Act in 1961 has been one of the success stories of Irish agriculture.  Their regional office and the development of a generally expansionist attitude to farming and farm credit has had an immense effect on agriculture.  The traditional attitude on the land of owing no man anything was one which did not allow agricultural progress to take place and did not allow the same business-like approach to be applied to agriculture as should be applied in other areas of the economy.  That is no longer the case.  Farmers now realise that if they are to expand and get the maximum return from their land they must be prepared to borrow, and borrow significant amounts of money.  It is fair to say that in the owner-occupancy type of agriculture we have here, where the farmer who is working the land owns it and has security for his loan. the availability of credit is rarely a problem, because any lending institution is aware that they have the ultimate sanction in order to get their money back.  Therefore if the farmer comes up with a reasonable proposal he should not have too much difficulty in obtaining credit.  However, it is very important that the credit be in a form that takes proper account of the nature of farming business.  The problems of the farming business are not the same as those of other businesses.  The commercial banks, who are the competitors of the ACC, in the policies that they are adopting in relation to the application of term loans through agriculture are not taking account of the peculiar problems that face farmers. To tell a farmer that he must extinguish entirely all his indebtedness on a particular day, as is the case with a term loan, and then start afresh with a completely new loan after that day, does not take account of the nature of an agricultural business.  It is not like a business where there is a period when one is selling everything and, having sold it, can afford to pay off all debts entirely and get into the black.  Agriculture is a continuing process and at no time can it be said that the farmer is in a position to extinguish all his debts.  I do not believe that the ACC <Col N="791" /> would in any sense act in an unsympathetic manner, but it is important that the commercial banks should have a look at their policy in this regard.</P>
    <P>Another very welcome aspect of the development of the ACC has been the fact that a very substantial proportion of their total finance is coming from deposits from the members of the Irish community, including a substantial number of farmers.  Therefore the need for Exchequer loans and foreign borrowing, neither of which is the most desirable way of financing agricultural expansion, is significantly reduced by the fact that the ACC seek to attract money on deposit from the community, from members of the community who realise that not only are they guaranteed a good return on their money by the Agricultural Credit Corporation but they are also, as the ACC themselves tell us, contributing significantly to the development of our major industry.  That is something in which we, as a people, should take considerable pride, that the members of our public have that degree of confidence in agriculture.</P>
    <P>There are a few small points I should like to pass on to in relation to the text of the Bill.  Section 14 refers to guarantees and the various requirements imposed on the Minister in respect of laying the particulars of each guarantee before this House.  This is a matter I have had occasion to raise in respect of guarantees given by the Minister to another State body.  I shall not go into that on this occasion. However, it is important we should ensure that full particulars of the guarantee, setting out all the details, are laid before the House and that the provisions of this section are complied with in full.  We must realise that in the event of these guarantees having to be used a very significant, contingent liability would fall on the Exchequer and on the taxpayers whom we, as Members of this House, represent.  I should like to ask the Minister for Finance for some indication of his general view about guarantees and the amount of money for which he is presently contingently liable.  Is he satisfied that the overall liability of the <Col N="792" /> Government in respect of guarantees &mdash;taking into account all the various State bodies, not just the ACC&mdash;incorporates adequate monitoring of this money and that we are able to take account of the currency in which this money is to be repaid?  Obviously it would be undesirable if there was to be an imbalance in favour of currencies which were rising in value by comparison with ours.  Therefore it is important not merely to consider the total amount of money being guaranteed but also the currency in which the contingent liability would fall to be met.</P>
    <P>Section 19 states that the chief officer's salary cannot be increased without the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.  This seems to be a fairly standard provision in respect of all Bills coming into the House in respect of any body.  Obviously the Minister for the Public Service, whoever he may be, is anxious to make sure that these public servants are not able to jump the queue in respect of salary increases in comparison with their counterparts elsewhere.  I would just ask the Minister&mdash;and here I am not speaking with any great knowledge of the matter&mdash;is there a danger of discrimination if the salary of the chief officer is specifically controlled but that those of perhaps his assistants or other people in the same organisation are not so controlled?</P>
    <P>For example, could a situation arise in which a person who was second in command could be earning more than the man who is at the top, the most responsible public servant in a particular organisation?  I have no evidence to suggest that this has happened in respect of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, but I did hear some time ago that it had happened in respect of another State body.  Perhaps the Minister would confirm or allay my fears in this matter and indicate what is his general policy.  I am sure he would agree that it would be undesirable if, by virtue of stringent statutory control on the chief officer's salary, his was allowed fall behind those of his subordinates.  This would be more likely to occur in a body which, while technically a State body, was a commercial one, which had a greater degree <Col N="793" /> of reliance on attracting specialist personnel from the outside business area, bringing them into the organisation and passing them out again later on when their expertise was no longer necessary.  To get that type of person obviously one would need to offer the going market salary rate regardless of any requirements laid down by the Minister for the Public Service.  In that sort of organisation it could happen that in order to attract a particular man one would have to offer him more than his chief officer in the organisation. That would not be desirable.  Certainly we should be aware of its implications and I would ask the Minister for a statement in relation to that issue.</P>
    <P>I said earlier I did not think that the provision for security for loans to agriculture constituted a big problem because most farmers who would be borrowing would own their land.  But there are some farmers for whom this might be a problem, young farmers setting up who perhaps did not own very much land, who might be operating a particular unit&mdash;say, a pig unit on their father's farm.  They might not be able to offer the bank or the Agricultural Credit Corporation the sort of security necessary.  I would draw the Minister's attention&mdash;and perhaps this is a matter he might wish to discuss with the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;to a provision which exists in Holland where there is an agricultural loans guarantee fund; and I understand a similar provision obtains in Sweden, where the Government will underwrite or guarantee the loan taken out by the farmer.  I understand that 10 per cent of the loans given to farmers by agricultural banks in Holland are underwritten by such a guarantee.  Obviously not all loans are guaranteed by the Government but there is no question of opening the sluice gates to uncontrolled demand by credit institutions for guarantees from the Government. But a selective policy has been adopted in Holland to guarantee farmers who might otherwise be unable to get a loan and who are facilitated in that manner.  I would ask the Minister to have a look at that provision. It may not be necessary here; perhaps there would have been more agitation <Col N="794" /> than there has been about it if it was a real problem.  However, it is one to which the Minister's attention should be drawn.</P>
    <P>There is another provision the Minister might examine also which is referred to in the report of the task force on agricultural credit which reported in Canada some years ago. They suggested there should be two forms of credit institutions, one catering for the commercial farmer, who can be treated in the same manner as any borrower&mdash;this is basically what the Agricultural Credit Corporation are doing&mdash;and another specialist institution catering for the small farmer, a small farmers' bank, which would be able to take account of the needs of the small farmer, to take account also of the social dimension of credit policy in respect of the small farmer.  We must realise that if we are to maintain a proper population balance here and a sufficient number of people in rural areas, strictly commercial considerations cannot be applied to credit for small farmers.  Account must be taken of the overriding, national objectives, which are not strictly economic, in encouraging development on small farms.  Possibly there is a case for some form of specialist credit institution to deal with small farmers' needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P> That Dáil Éireann deplores the negligence on the part of the Government in the developments that led to the closure of the Ferenka factory, with its disastrous consequences for the workforce and for general industrial development. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The story of the Ferenka factory at Annacotty can be told on several levels.  It can be approached&mdash;and I have no doubt that the Deputy who has put down an amendment this evening will do so&mdash;on the level of the history of an industrial investment that went wrong.  It is possible to explore the correctness&mdash;I see a lot of people doing that now&mdash;of certain forms of <Col N="795" /> industrial investment from abroad. That is a chapter with which I shall not deal this evening.  It is possible also to approach this on the level of industrial relations and to tell the story as being one of a disastrous failure in industrial relations.  That also is an aspect which, although it plays a prominent part in the story, I shall not deal with this evening.  However, the House will hear about it from one of my colleagues later.</P>
    <P>The aspect on which I want to concentrate the attention of the House is the story of the Ferenka closure, written as a comment on the quality of Government response to a very serious industrial crisis.  To judge by the Government's own statements, from which we do not dissent, this crisis may affect not just the immediate neighbourhood of the factory which was closed, but the entire future of our industrial development which, up to now, has been built on the expectation that we were going to be able to supply a large number of jobs, perhaps even our major industrial job requirements, by attracting industrialists from abroad. It is to the quality of the Government's response to what was very obviously from the beginning a major industrial crisis, a major threat to our industrial prosperity and, therefore, to the prosperity of our economy and of our nation generally, that I want to direct the attention of the House.</P>
    <P>This story almost writes itself.  If you watch it as it developed, and if you go back after it has ended and look at the public record of it, it writes itself.  It is a story that falls into a few quite distinct phases.  The first phase is one which consists simply in a record of certain external facts.  The trouble at the factory is the first phase: the pickets on Monday, 3rd October; the stopping of production; shortly afterwards, a couple of days later, the statement by Ferenka on, I think, 5th October, that they are losing in consequence of this stoppage up to £20,000 a day.  They said on 7th October they were suffering a &ldquo;very heavy financial drain&rdquo;.  A week later they said for the first time they <Col N="796" /> apprehended the possibility of a shutdown. That is the first phase.</P>
    <P>Now during that first phase, it is true to say that the Ferenka closure never hit the front page of any daily paper in the State.  It was confined to page 7, page 9 page 11, or further back still.  That first phase was succeeded by another phase in which the role of any Government was bound to come to the top.  As the closure continued, and as the factory and its parent company continued to make it plain that this was not only something in the nature of a last straw from their point of view but that they were in really serious trouble in consequence of it, we began to look to the Government to see what response was forthcoming from them in regard to this industrial dispute and the closure which had followed it.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday, 18th October, after the Government meeting, the press reported that a &ldquo;spokesman&rdquo; said the plant was in danger but that the Government &ldquo;could not intervene because what was in issue here was a dispute between two unions&rdquo;.  We know the mechanisms of contact between Government and the press and the people. When my party and our colleagues in the Labour Party were in Government we were often enough accused of being all too expert at these mechanisms, but both sides of the House will know what is meant when it is reported that a &ldquo;spokesman&rdquo; has said this after a Government meeting, and the House may take it, I think, that that was the Government point of view on that date, 18th October.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask, and a colleague of mine will pursue this matter in more detail later, what law prevents the Department of Labour and the Minister who presides over it from intervening or trying to help in an industrial dispute where more than one union is involved? If there is such a law, I would like to know where it is.  I would like to know where it is for the purpose of proposing its abolition because, on the evidence of the Minister himself in the frequent speeches to which he has treated the people since then, inter-union disputes are a most potent source of industrial disruption and this <Col N="797" /> is the very thing he and his Government, not once but twice in this story, as I will show you in a moment, say they are not able to deal with.  It is a dispute between two unions and so intervention by them is &ldquo;ruled out&rdquo;. That was their attitude on 18th October.</P>
    <P>On 19th October, Deputy Mitchell, our spokesman on Labour, and Deputy O'Donnell, the Fine Gael Deputy for East Limerick, sought to raise this matter here and the way they tried to raise it was they sought an explanation from you, Sir, Deputy Mitchell in particular, as to why his attempt to have this matter raised&mdash;because if no one else saw the importance on that side he saw the importance on this side of what was going on, and he sought an explanation from you, Sir&mdash; as to why a Special Notice Question, or what he sought to put into the form of a Special Notice Question, had been disallowed by you.</P>
    <P>Now I intend&mdash;I hope you will believe me&mdash;no reflection on you when I say Deputy Mitchell got a very strange reply from the Chair.  He got a reply which I would describe as an excess of courtesy on the part of the Chair, because the Chair told him that, since an inter-union dispute was involved, it was &ldquo;not the responsibility of the Minister for Labour&rdquo;.  I would have thought it would have been up to the Minister himself to give that explanation, were it true, but it is not; and I will show in a moment that the Minister himself did not believe it. But that is the explanation Deputy Mitchell and Deputy O'Donnell got. Because it was an &ldquo;inter-union dispute&rdquo; the Minister for Labour had no departmental responsibility and could not be called to question over the matter.</P>
    <P>But the Chair went further and suggested to Deputy Mitchell that, since a period of protective notice was still running, the Deputy would have plenty of time before the expiry of the notice to put down a question in the ordinary way to the Minister for Labour, if he saw fit, and have it answered.  Again, I intend no reflection on the Chair.  We are all new in the House in the sense that we are all <Col N="798" /> doing new jobs, including the Chair, but that advice to Deputy Mitchell was wildly wrong and misleading&mdash;I am sure innocently so&mdash;because the state of the Order Paper was such that it could have been foreseen, and was immediately foreseen by deputy Mitchell, that his question could not possibly be reached because the Minister for Labour was so far down the list.  The question was not in fact reached until 9th November; and by 9th November it was too late.  That was the response Deputy Mitchell got from the Chair; a courteous response, I agree, but a curiously, excessively courteous, bizarrely courteous response from the Chair on 19th October.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise&mdash;I do not want to spend too long on this aspect &mdash;that from beginning to end of the industrial relations side of it, when the industrial dispute was foremost, this party in the person of Deputy Mitchell and in the person of Deputy O'Donnell, and in the persons of the rest of us, behaved with absolute responsibility, with absolute quietude and with a sense of reasonable conduct throughout.  I want now to draw the attention of the House to the contrast which will jump up in the mind of anyone who can remember the days, and they are not very long ago, when Deputy Fitzgerald, now Minister for Labour, was over here.  There was no more strident Deputy in the House, no more strident, noisy Deputy, and bullying Deputy when the Chair would not allow him to say what he wanted to say and go on as long as he liked.  I watched from over there when Deputy Fitzgerald bullied the former Ceann Comhairle day after day, shouted and roared him down, wanting to know why the Government were not stopping this factory from closing and why they could not settle the other industrial dispute.  While deputy O'Malley, now Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, was not quite as disorderly, there was never an industrial dispute within his own sphere of operations in which the blame was not laid squarely and loudly at the door of the then Government.</P>
    <P>I want to draw a contrast between that behaviour, which we had to confront, <Col N="799" /> and the behaviour this House and the country have got from Deputy Mitchell and Deputy O'Donnell during the industrial relations phase of this disastrous story.  That was the situation around the 20th October.  The official Government line was: &ldquo;Yes, this is a dangerous, difficult situation, but it is essentially an inter-union dispute, and we cannot intervene&rdquo;.  It was non-intervention as complete as if it were the Spanish Civil War.  But everything changed about 21st October.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy then said, as the &ldquo;spokesman&rdquo; had previously said, that there was an &ldquo;imminent danger of closure&rdquo;; and that very day the President of the Chamber of Commerce in his own city made a statement, a very modest statement, plaintively inquiring what had become of the Minister for Labour and why was he taking no interest in this dispute and why was the Department of Labour nowhere to be seen on the front.  It was around that time, too, as a matter of journalistic interest, that the Ferenka dispute finally reached the front pages in the third week of October.  Now, whether it was pressure from Deputy O'Malley, Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, who was getting an uncomfortable time in Limerick, or for whatever reason, it suddenly turned out in the fourth week in October that the principle of non-intervention was not so binding after all.  Far from being a principle so clear that it could be pronounced from the Chair of this House, so clear that it did not need the political force of a minister to hammer it down somebody else's throat, but could be proclaimed from the Chair here, it turned out to be a good deal weaker than anyone had thought.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour&mdash;everybody wished him well; we did nothing to wreck his initiative; we did nothing to sneer at it&mdash;for the first time, about 23rd or 24th October, put up a set of proposals which were not acceptable to one of the parties involved.  He held further consultations and put up another set.  I have no doubt that those proposals, late and inadequate though they were as a <Col N="800" /> response, were made in good faith. His two sets of proposals did not work.  Many a Minister had had that experience before.</P>
    <P>From the moment when the Minister's second set of proposals finally were seen to be failures, it is fair to say the Minister for Labour left the scene for four weeks.  He left the scene as completely as if he had followed the Minister for Defence, Deputy Molloy, to Malta to a conference or on a jaunt somewhere.  There was not a peep from him or his Department for four weeks on the Ferenka matter. Perhaps it is too much to say there was not a peep out of him, because there was a substantial and significant squeak out of him in a different way.</P>
    <P>Two nights running, shortly after his proposals had been rejected, on the nights of 29th and 30th October&mdash; this is the kind of ministerial weekend that is tough&mdash;he attended meetings in Killarney on the former night and Youghal on the latter, and at each of these meetings he made powerful attacks on the defects in our system of industrial relations.  In one speech he commented on how we would have to reform and review our whole industrial relations structure.  In the other, he spoke about a topic that had been under notice before, the proliferation of unions.</P>
    <P>I regard that as a fair representation of the role of the Minister for Labour during this affair.  He did not do anything until, although I have no evidence for it, he was pushed into it by his colleague now beside him, or by the Government, in the later days of October. He then made an effort, stretching over three or four days; the efforts failed and he then made petulant and rough speeches about industrial relations. The rest was silence&mdash;he then departed the scene completely as if he had resigned.  Indeed, I thought at the time that he had resigned, but had forgotten to tell anybody.  There was not another word from him on this subject, except an inadequate reply to a parliamentary question at the end of November, when it was far too late. On 28th October, when his initiatives were finally rejected, the Marine, Port <Col N="801" /> and General Workers' Union asked the Minister for Labour for a Labour Court hearing on the main issue, the position of one of their shop stewards, but they got no response and they did not hear anything more, good or bad. Such is my information.</P>
    <P>On the 28th October, <i>The Irish Times</i> reported that &ldquo;it had been learned that the board of ENKA had been in touch with the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy on the previous day and that it was understood the possible closure of the plant might have been discussed.&rdquo;  I will give the House my opinion as to what was discussed and happened on that day.  ENKA told the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy that they had come to the end of the road, that they had decided to close down or phase out their operations in Annacotty, and that from then on we were on our own as far as Ferenka were concerned.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government knew that weekend, the weekend of the October bank holiday, that the game was up at Annacotty.  I am not blaming the Government for that.  The blame lies heavily elsewhere.  However, at the end of October the Government knew that the game was up.  I have reason to know the IDA knew or had reason to know that the game was up.  At that stage rumours were percolating that the game was up, and they reached me at the time from three different sources.</P>
    <P>That was the turning point.  Up to then, all one could accuse the Government of was being slow off the mark in trying to get to grips with an industrial situation which threatened the future of this factory and, indirectly, our whole industrial development.  A third phase then began and I regret to say that I consider this phase to have been a scuttling operation.  It was a phase during which the Government deliberately concealed the fact that they knew ENKA would not go on at Annacotty. They knew they would not go on, but they asked themselves what they could get out of the situation if they let it run on, if they let the unions and the workers sink further and further into public dis-esteem&mdash;what they could get out of it if they did not <Col N="802" /> disclose the fact that ENKA strike or no strike, were about to pull out.</P>
    <P>On 1st November, 1,000 men were laid off and on 2nd November ENKA asked for a meeting with the Government. On the following day Ferenka's local boss was reported as being &ldquo;reluctant to comment on a possible closure&rdquo;.  Is that the language a manager of an active factory would have used, even in the middle of a strike? He said he hoped that the ENKA meeting with the Minister would &ldquo;shed new light on the matter&rdquo;.  I am jolly sure that is what he thought, because he knew what was about to come up from ENKA was a proposal for a take-over. He ended up his interview, according to Press reports, with a plaintive animadversion about our &ldquo;lack of legislation&rdquo; in industrial relations.</P>
    <P>On 4th November ENKA met the Minister and the Minister allowed some details of that meeting to emerge.  In a Government leak, we were told the Minister had been &ldquo;tough and blunt&rdquo;. In an interview with RTE's Mr. McAleese the Vice-President of ENKA, Mr. Hutter, said the Minister had &ldquo;absolutely excluded&rdquo; the possibility of a State involvement amounting to a take-over.  Then we had the usual &ldquo;reliable sources&rdquo; telling us that &ldquo;the possibility of closure loomed large&rdquo;&mdash;a very substantial understatement.</P>
    <P>The offer to allow the Government to take over Ferenka in some shape or from was an unambiguous signal &mdash;a child would see it for what it was &mdash;that ENKA were about to pull out. Therefore, I cannot understand&mdash;this is what most concerns me about this history&mdash;why the Government allowed the best part of a month to elapse without letting the public know the true situation.  From the end of October or, at the latest, from the 4th November, the Government allowed a charade to go on.</P>
    <P>This is how it happened.  On 7th November we had the good old &ldquo;reliable sources&rdquo; trotted out again. What they &ldquo;indicated&rdquo; this time was that the Government were &ldquo;unlikely to take action&rdquo;.  We were told the Government &ldquo;believed the dispute was an inter-union one and that any settlement should be the subject of <Col N="803" /> negotiations between the workers and the company&rdquo;.  We had gone back to the situation of 18th October, although the only attempt that had been made in the meantime by the Minister for Labour was to throw aside this principle of non-intervention which was so indisputable as to be capable of enunciation by the chair of this House.  We were then back to non-intervention.</P>
    <P>I want a clear answer to this question: if it is true that an inter-union dispute rules out ministerial intervention, why did he intervene in October? On the other hand, if it is not true, if everything I have been saying is a false construction, if the thing was still completely open at the beginning of November, if the factory then could have been saved, why was the Minister for Labour not in there plugging throughout the whole month, instead of being as good as resigned, because no one heard of him or from him?</P>
    <P>The scene then shifts a little.  Everyone then started to look for the conciliation help which had not been spontaneously forthcoming.  On 8th November the Limerick Trades Council wrote to the Minister for Labour asking for a rights commissioner, and they got no reply.  On 8th November also the newspaper said that &ldquo;a Labour Court intiative was expected&rdquo;, and that little story was repeated for a few days after that; it died away plaintively.  No Labour Court intiative emerged on 8th, 9th or 10th of November, or thereafter.</P>
    <P>On 8th November in the Dáil, my colleagues Deputy Mitchell and Deputy O'Donnell asked the Taoiseach about the Ferenka dispute, and the Taoiseach said that a question and answer session on the subject of Ferenka &ldquo;might not be helpful&rdquo;. Helpful to what?  What was going on that it could prejudice or endanger? What were the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and the Minister for Labour up to, that might have been knocked off its course by a simple question and answer here in the Dáil, leave alone the kind of shouting and roaring and irresponsible <Col N="804" /> accusations that we got when we were on that side of the House and the Ministers on that bench were on this side? That was the Taoiseach's response; a characteristic one.</P>
    <P>On the following day, the 9th, the Minister for Labour said in the Dáil that the situation &ldquo;was delicate&rdquo;.  I would have thought that the Minister for Labour would not recognise a delicate situation if it were served up on a plate.  Not only was the situation &ldquo;delicate&rdquo; but he was keeping in touch with it hourly&rdquo;.  He was failing to keep in touch with one of the two unions that had caused this dispute; they heard nothing from him for four weeks.  How was that keeping in touch with the situation on an hourly basis?</P>
    <P>For the next ten days there were many meetings in Limerick involving many people; but the one party not in evidence of any kind whatever was the Minister for Labour and his Department. On 24th November the final phase began.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy issued what he called a final warning, but of course he knew that a final warning was then too late.  On 24th November I asked by a Special Notice Question if the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy would request the Taoiseach's intervention.  People in the House and in the Press gallery will recall that the Minister gave me a one-sentence reply; and you, Sir, refused to permit me to ask supplementary questions, in defiance of all precedent, if I may say so with respect. The reply was to the effect that he would not ask the Taoiseach to intervene, although our industrial future allegedly was still at stake.  Allegedly, the thing could still have been saved, because he himself appealed to the workers two days later to take the last moment's chance.  What was he doing? The Minister for Labour had &ldquo;asked the Labour Court to make available an industrial relations officer&rdquo;. That was on 24th November. Big deal, when the country had been shouting at the Government for six weeks, and this party had been playing a responsible and patient role in the matter.  Big deal, that he was &ldquo;asking an industrial relations officer&rdquo; to intervene.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" /> It was clear that weekend that the game was up.  The Limerick Trades Council, the weekend before the closedown, tried to get in touch with the Ferenka management at Annacotty and reported that they had &ldquo;gone to ground&rdquo;.  The day after that Mr. Harold O'Sullivan, vice-president of the ICTU, could not locate the Ferenka management.  On the same day the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy was making bogus appeals.  He knew the factory was gone, and the whole operation from the last weekend in October or the beginning of November was designed, not to save the factory, but was designed to do something far more sinister.  It was designed to prevent blame for the ultimate closure lying anywhere except on one party, namely, the unions.</P>
    <P>When the closure came, the Leader of my party asked the Taoiseach at the earliest opportunity, on the Tuesday, if he would consider the possibility of the factory being run by a workers' co-operative.  The Taoiseach treated this suggestion with the utmost courtesy, and promised to consider it and think about it, and said that it had never been put to him before and took him by surprise.  We know that up to 5.30 p.m. Netherlands time, that proposal had not been thrashed out with the IDA and still less with the Dutch parent company.  In other words, the show of interest and courtesy which we saw here was another charade.</P>
    <P>On the following day the Leader of the Opposition travelled to the Continent, and I can reveal to the House in broad outline that he made a constructive effort to see if he could be helpful in regard to getting the factory reopened and getting back the jobs of the 1,400 men who had been laid off. He was not successful, but he did elicit a telex message from Mr. Wansink, public relations officer of ENKA who has been on Irish television. I hope this will be understood as something that was a response to an initiative on his part to rescue the situation.  The telex states:</P>
    <P>dear sir,</P>
    <P>mr. hutter asked me to send you the following reply: we appreciate <Col N="806" /> your taking this initiative.  our decision is final and is based in part on the minister's position over this issue.</P>
    <P>So far as we are concerned the facts underlying the decision for liquidation have not changed.</P>
    <P>Mr. Hutter is the vice-president.</P>
    <P>We do not allege that the Government closed down Ferenka.  Such an allegation would be absurd and we do not allege&mdash;at least, I do not allege&mdash; that they are to blame for the situation which produced this closure; but I do most positively accuse them in the last month of that factory's life of keeping up a charade that it could still be saved.  I accuse them of ignoring and neglecting steps which might have been taken, the steps which, as ENKA put it, the Minister had &ldquo;absolutely excluded,&rdquo; of ignoring the proposals for a take-over&mdash;not that I or this party would give that an unqualified recommendation&mdash;without giving them a second thought, and of making no counter proposals.  I accuse them on the Labour side of doing absolutely nothing to resolve the problem.  There was, of course, a show; and the Minister at the end said: &ldquo;Look, if you do not go back by the weekend the factory will close.&rdquo; He knew it was closed by then, and that nothing that happened over the weekend would make any difference.  I accuse them of carrying on this charade, of neglecting to explore the possibilities at Government and IDA level for trying to keep the company there, and of trying to keep the factory there in some shape or form.  I accuse them of grossly neglecting the possibilities which our labour legislation offers to try to get this matter settled at a time when it could have made a difference.</P>
    <P>That is the worst part of it.  I accuse them of that for a sinister reason.  I believe that they had a political calculation in mind for doing that. They wanted to leave this situation behind them in such a way that, whoever is blamed, the people who will come out worst will be the unions. Undoubtedly they do deserve a lot of blame; but the Government want to make sure that, wherever else others stand on the scale, the unions <Col N="807" /> will be on the floor.  They wanted to make sure of that.  That political calculation was in their minds.  It has surfaced in speech after speech.  It has surfaced at the Fianna Fáil Party meeting.  It surfaced the following day in an immense editorial in <i>The Irish Press</i> side by side with a reprint of a speech made by Mr. MacEntee 36 years ago.  In speech after speech it has surfaced and there is a political intention here.  It may or may not be a sound or praiseworthy political intention; but it is no way of doing business.  Only a Government of sleeveens would do business that way and try to achieve a political objective, to condition public opinion, by conducting a charade for a whole month with men's jobs at stake.  That is no way for a free republic to be governed; and I hope that this will give the people perhaps the first taste of the quality of this Government and their response to their first real crisis, their first real task, and their first real failure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:</P>
      <P> To delete &ldquo;Government&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;present Government and its predecessor in Office&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>We have listened to one side, one analysis of the situation from the speaker for the Coalition.  I should like to differ with him on a number of points.  A fundamental point upon which I would like to differ with him is that my diagnosis of this regrettable happening, the closure of the Ferenka factory in Limerick, is not the product of an acute illness but of a chronic process which could only end the way it did.  I find it difficult to believe that, were Deputy Kelly in the Minister's position, we should now be facing a proposition for either the establishment of a workers' co-operative, with which I do not agree but which has certain merits, or that it should be taken into public ownership.  Perhaps the speakers on the Coalition side can tell us whether they would have faced this problem by taking the factory into public ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the saddest comments implicit in Deputy Kelly's speech was his <Col N="808" /> recitation of the litany of controllers of power in our society.  He mentioned the Labour Court, the ICTU, two Ministers, the Leader of the Opposition and the Taoiseach.  They all went to the people in control of AKZO and ENKA and begged them to keep the company open because nobody wanted the company to close down, as Deputy Kelly said, but they were all totally impotent in this situation.</P>
    <P>We should consider this debate as an opportunity to learn from our mistakes, particularly the Minister and his colleagues.  They should try to see what they can save from the wreckage of the Ferenka dispute and they should try to ensure that the situation will not recur in any of the other multinational companies.  The important point that has been established by the Ferenka débâcle is the naivety of all of them, the trade unions, the Labour Court, the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Opposition, in trotting around so tamely to the heads of the multi-nationals on the assumption that they might listen to their humanitarian plea to save the jobs of the workers, to save them the suffering that they are now going through with their families.  The naivety of this kind of approach is positively frightening. The multi-national is not the slightest bit interested in the national welfare of any society.</P>
    <P>The AKZO company employ about 80,000 people in as many countries as you can think of naming and they have never put humanitarian interests before profits.  In 1973 AKZO tried to close down in Europe four factories employing 6,000 people.  They were only prevented from doing so by the action of the International Federation of Chemical Engineers' and General Workers' Union.  They are a brutally ruthless organistion, designed to use everything they can, particularly labour, skills, technology, to make profits. They do not allow concerns for the national welfare of people to stand in their way.</P>
    <P>Besides the multi-nationals, about which I have no illusions, I should like the House to include in their consideration of the implications of <Col N="809" /> this issue, the role of the IDA.  In a recent debate on the IDA, in which we decided to increase their authority and wealth, I was the only Deputy that did not praise the activities of the IDA. I was the only one that questioned their preoccupation with capital-intensive industry, their preoccupation with bringing in multi-national companies, their disinterest in the use of indigenous raw materials or national resources, the question of the five-year tax relief, and so on.  There is no point in discussing issues of this kind from time to time unless Deputies learn from their own experience.  The experience has been, particularly in relation to this issue, that the IDA have been grievously at fault.  The IDA have the authority of the House.  Unlike the civil servant who is directly responsible to us, the IDA have been given a certain amount of autonomy.  Therefore, we have the right to criticise them.  They did advise the then Government to invest £7.9 million in Ferenka.  Through the years we gave them £1.7 million in training grants and then we took an equity share of £700,000, approximately £10 million altogether.</P>
    <P>As a result of the IDA's decision, which was obviously wrong, we are going to lose at least £2.5 million, probably £10 million.  They tell us now that they are indebted to the tune of £15 million.  How can anybody go on accepting the advice of these people? I am astonished to listen to these people on the television telling us what their new schemes are for the use of taxpayers' money after what they have done.  I have given another case for their real failures but there is no need to emphasise the enormity of their failure in relation to Ferenka. The importance of Ferenka is that it represents 71 per cent of all the IDA money spent in the Limerick county and city area.  It was a dangerously narrow base upon which they spent this money and we are now seeing the human consequences of their decision.  One has to ask why Ferenka was chosen for this particular area? We are now being told that the labour force was predominantly unskilled in the kind of skills needed for this complicated process.  Why did the IDA make this decision?  Have not we the <Col N="810" /> right to criticise them for making that decision?  What role has the Minister played in taking this decision?  Was he not wrong to take the decision? How can his judgment be trusted in respect of any new decision taken in relation to Ferenka? Ferenka never made money; they were always a bad bet.  In 1975 they pleaded inability to pay, a strange incident.  The company pleaded inability to pay through 1975 and then into 1976.  When the Labour Court appointed assessors to make a decision on this they came round to paying the national wage agreement award.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister, if he can tell me, or the movers of the motion because this occurred in 1975 when they were involved, what happened at that time? What information did they get from the firm and from the IDA on this incident of a decision of inability to pay and then a decision that they could pay after the Labour Court had moved to bring in assessors?  Were they deliberately misleading the Government and the IDA?  Putting it simply, were they telling lies to the Minister and to the IDA?  Where did they get the money to pay in the end? Why did they conceal the fact that they had that money?  At this time also the IDA continued to pay money.  In 1975 the IDA paid the company £600,000 at a time when the company pleaded inability to pay.  Why did they pay the £600,000?  In 1976 the IDA paid another £492,000.  That amounts to about £1 million at a time when the firm were pleading that they were in financial difficulties and dangerously unstable.  What did the movers of the motion, or the Ministers associated with the National Coalition Government do to find out whether this was a good going concern to which they should allow the IDA to pay £1 million at that time?</P>
    <P>What is the true role of the IDA in this?  Were the IDA party to the conspiracy by Ferenka to mislead the Government?  Did they know that this firm were verging on bankruptcy and did they give them this money in order to get over the inability to pay clause?  The then Minister for Industry, and Commerce has a lot to answer for.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="811" /> Deputy Garret FitzGerald must know what happened at that time.  Did they tell the Minister and did the Minister approve? This firm never achieved more than 60 per cent of their planned output and never showed a profit but yet they have accumulated losses of £15 million and we are still turning to the IDA experts who advised us to set up this disastrous enterprise in Limerick to get their advice as to what we should do next.  Is it true that recently the IDA were negotiating to give an additional £10 million loan&mdash; I read about this in the <i>Hibernia</i> newspaper&mdash;to bring up to £25 million&mdash;it is difficult to know how much&mdash;the losses in this derelict, bankrupt non-profit making enterprise?</P>
    <P>There is the odd feature of Oberbruch, the factory near Aachen in Germany which while paying much higher wages are in a buoyant trading position.  Presumably, one cannot blame the trade union activities for that.  Why can the factory in Germany have this kind of buoyant trading at this time when we cannot, with lower wages being paid in Limerick? Is it because the machinery is obsolete? Was it always obsolete?  Is it the position, as some people have said, that we paid for the machinery going into Oberbruch and that they sent us obsolete machinery over here? It sounds outlandish but one can begin to believe anything about this scandalous operation in Ferenka.  The training grants amount to £1.7 million and they were largely due to the fact that there was a 25 per cent turnover in employment. In the last seven years people have not left their jobs readily.  The poor things would take them back now if they could have them because they are so desperate for work, but a 25 per cent turnover led to this enormous training grant of £1.7 million. Obviously, bad management and bad personnel relationships existed because during this time there were 25 unofficial strikes.</P>
    <P>This brings us to the question of the sweetheart's arrangement between unions and companies which seems to me to have very grave dangers because there is the possibility that trade <Col N="812" /> union leaders will lean towards trying to guarantee peace at any price.  The result is a succession of unofficial strikes and unions tend to lose their membership to another.  Relatively recently a new consignment of machinery arrived at Ferenka.  How could that happen if they had decided to close down the factory? On what grounds did the IDA give them money to buy this new machinery which is now lying there blacked by the Marine, Port and General Workers' Union at Ferenka? What is the position about the machinery?  Who owns it?  Did the IDA pay for it? Does AKZO own it? What is the position in relation to the receiver? Can he put his hands on it? Can we take it back from them as part payment of the great debt they owe to us? Under what circumstances was the machinery purchased if the industry was in such dire straits? What steps can we take to see that AKZO cannot ship this machinery out of the country and back to Holland and do the same with the rest?</P>
    <P>There is the strange question about the equity shares.  We have equity holdings in only nine companies which I believe is wrong, a point I made in the recent debate.  We should take equity shares and we should have a controlling situation on the board of directors.</P>
    <P>Reading Mr. Russell's article in the newspaper recently it is obvious that he had little or no power or authority. This was shown eloquently in Deputy Kelly's contribution.  What authority could one director have when the Taoiseach, two Ministers, the Leader of the Opposition, ICTU and the Labour Court had no say?  None of them could influence the decision taken by those people.  They just told us, in the same way as they used to tell us from White-hall: &ldquo;We are going to shut this down We are going to open up that.  We are going to extend here.  We are going to build roads there.&rdquo;  Where is our sovereignty now?  In the North they are in the same position with Roy Mason. We are puppets.  We simply do what we are told.</P>
    <P>About 20 per cent of all IDA equity holdings are in Ferenka.  There is 7.5 <Col N="813" /> per cent, or something like that, amounting to about £700,000.  Why did we invest in this derelict, bankrupt, down-at-heel, non-profit making, total loss of an enterprise?  Why did the IDA put our money in there&mdash;surely they should answer that&mdash;as well as all the other millions they allocated on our behalf?  At the same time, they did have this shareholding.  Why did we not know what was going on from the board of directors?  Had we no right to know? Did they conceal from the director, the Government nominee, what was going on?  Did he know and not tell us? If he did know and not tell us, why did he not tell us?  Would it not be worth knowing all that?  He was a nominee of the Coalition Government. What was he there for if he did not know what was going on?  Why did we take an equity share if we did not intend to make sure we knew what was going on?</P>
    <P>The whole matter of equity holdings appears to be a very costly and meaningless charade.  This is too serious a matter to play politics with it.  All we can do is examine it carefully and, above all, objectively to try to find out what we can do in the future to avoid such an incident happening again. It is no good for the Coalition side of the House to suggest they do not, or did not approve, of these kind of policies on the part of the IDA all through the years, and particularly in the years they were in office.  As I said, in a debate a couple of weeks ago, we listened to them all endorsing IDA policies in relation to unemployment, even though we now have the highest unemployment rate we probably ever had in our history.  That is another question.</P>
    <P>On 4th April, 1973, Senator Keating was quoted in <i>The Economist</i> as saying:</P>
    <P> I think it is fair to characterise the centre of the efforts at development in the past as being to attract multinationals with high technology as part of a policy.  That is entirely acceptable and to be encouraged. </P>
    <P>Quite certainly and obviously it is six of one and half-a-dozen of the other who got the unfortunate people in <Col N="814" /> Ferenka into the disastrous situation they are in.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any use in wasting any more public money by trying to bribe AKZO to reopen the factory, or to bribe another multi-national to take over the factory.  Nor do I agree with Deputy Kelly's suggestion about a workers' co-operative. This is rather different from a furniture factory, or a boot and shoe factory, or a textile factory.  The expertise and know-how would rule that out. Oddly enough, the only solution is the solution suggested by Dr. Hutter at the meeting with the Minister, that is, that the factory should be taken into public ownership without compensation because the debts to the State far out-value the remaining assets of the company.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to look at the other subsidiaries of AKZO and the associated companies in Ireland. Will the same fate befall them? Should they not be taken over by the State also to compensate for State losses in Ferenka?  I believe there should be a public inquiry into all aspects of the Ferenka disaster&mdash;a word used by other people; it seems extravagant but, for the individuals involved, I do not think it is&mdash;including the part played by the IDA and by successive Ministers for Industry and Commerce.  The books, accounts and records of the company must be open to public inspection.</P>

      <P>When this unfortunate decision was made by ENKA to close the Ferenka factory in Limerick on 28th November, there was general sorrow and a feeling that a very serious blow had been struck at all of us. I am afraid, even though virtually no one disagrees with its seriousness, that did not stop some people from trying to achieve some benefit from this misfortune for the Irish people.  I am afraid the motion before us this evening is an example of the efforts the Fine Gael Party, and perhaps the Labour Party when they speak, may make to try to make some capital out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="815" /> I listened very carefully to Deputy Kelly who spoke for exactly half-an-hour without an interruption of any kind.  Not alone did he not mention the future; he did not even mention the present.  He confined his entire speech to a laborious chronology of events and alleged events interspersed with comments and assumptions of his own which frequently bore no relation to reality.  Unfortunately, that was the sole extent of his contribution.</P>
    <P>Of course, he made sarcastic personal remarks about the Minister for Labour in particular and myself to a lesser extent.  Unhappily that is his style.  There was no attempt whatever to assess what the present situation is, or what the future holds for the 1,400 people employed in the factory and the several hundred others outside it whose jobs are dependent on that factory.  Nor was there any consideration for the thousands of people who are dependent on those workers.  None whatever. We had a lawyer's dissertation on day 1, day 2, day 3, and day 4, and what was done and not done to Deputy Kelly's liking during that time. It is disappointing, but that is it.  That is what we are faced with.</P>
    <P>In any event, the gist of this long sarcastic speech by Deputy Kelly was to the effect&mdash;we got it towards the end&mdash;that I knew or the Government knew about a month before the closure was announced on 28th November that it was coming anyway, that the place was doomed, that is was going to close, and that the Government concealed this fact from the trade unions in particular and the public in general. Since that was the burden of his case, and since this is the way in which it is alleged the Government were negligent, I want to say straight away that is untrue.</P>
    <P>In a written question today which I said I would deal with tonight because I thought he would be dealing with most of these matters&mdash;he did not deal with the other points in his question&mdash;the Deputy asked for information and I am giving it now.  The answer to the question Deputy Kelly posed today about when the Government <Col N="816" /> were first informed about this closure is, at 3.30 p.m. on Monday, 28th November, 1977 when I received a telephone call.  The Government are accused, and the Minister for Labour and myself, I think, of not telling people how serious the situation was, how great the dangers were, of not telling people about the likelihood of closure.  Listening to Deputy Kelly, I wondered if he were talking about the same thing as I had been talking about for the past couple of months.</P>
    <P>On 21st October, 1977 I issued a statement from which I shall read two short extracts with the permission of the Chair, in which I said:</P>
    <P>The dispute there&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is at Ferenka</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;raises the imminent prospect of the direct loss of more than 1,400 industrial jobs.  Neither Limerick nor Ireland can afford this tragedy.  It is staring us in the face and it will assuredly happen if the dispute concerned is not speedily resolved.</P>
    <P>Further on I said:</P>
    <P>As the Minister responsible for industry I am satisfied that there is a grave and imminent danger of the group closing Ferenka permanently.</P>
    <P>What clearer warning could any Minister give than that statement?  If I were Divinely inspired, which I am not, I could not have put the matter more clearly.  What clearer warning could be given than those sentences and the whole of that statement if it is read as a whole?  It would waste too much time to read it all now but it is interesting reading in the light of what happened.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, after I had attended another meeting with Dr. Hutter&mdash;that statement was issued before my first meeting with him&mdash;on the night of 23rd November, I issued a statement on the radio on the morning of Thursday, 24th November, in which I said it seemed that we were no longer talking in terms of weeks or even a week, that it seemed we were talking in terms of days and that unless this dispute between the two unions was settled, as I put it, by the weekend, then I thought the future was very <Col N="817" /> bleak indeed and that closure seemed to be on the cards.</P>
    <P>That statement happily had an effect; it caused a response among many of the workers and, in particular&mdash;and I would like to acknowledge his assistance in this respect&mdash;it caused Mr. Harold O'Sullivan, Vice-President of the ICTU, to try to get the two unions involved to agree on a formula that would enable all the workers to go back.</P>
    <P>On that Saturday the workers concerned, because, I think, of the warning I had given on the Thursday, realised that there was imminent danger and the Marine Port workers agreed by an overwhelming majority at a meeting in Limerick to go back to work.  The Transport Union workers had already agreed to go back.  It is interesting to observe at this point, in view of the allegations of inactivity made against the Minister for Labour that the proposals on which each of those two unions recommended their members to go back and which the members accepted&mdash;in the case of the Marine Port workers on that Saturday and in the case of the Transport Union workers about one week earlier&mdash;were in substance the very same as the proposals put before both of them by the Minister for Labour five weeks earlier, on 21st and 22nd October.  They are not word for word the same but they were identical in substance.  If these proposals could be so readily accepted five weeks later at the very end why, we are entitled to ask, could they not have been accepted originally and the tragedy that has now happened avoided?  Why did this dispute have to be dragged on to the conclusion it unhappily came to?</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly has alleged that I knew that the company&mdash;I presume ENKA or AKZO or perhaps, Ferenka, but in any case the group&mdash;had already made a firm and irrevocable decision at the end of October to close this plant.  All I can say is that if that is so, why should senior directors of the company come twice to talk to me? Why should so much negotiation ensue and why should so many efforts be made over the following months?  Of course it is totally untrue to say I <Col N="818" /> knew they had made that decision.  I believe it is probably untrue to say they had made the decision.  One reason why I think this is that on the very day before the decision was made &mdash;on Sunday 22nd November&mdash;Dr. Hutter with whom I had discussion in regard to this matter was interviewed in Arnhem in Holland by Mr. John McAleese of RTE some time in the evening of the sunday for broadcasting at lunchtime on Monday, 28th, and it was broadcast.</P>
    <P>When Mr. McAleese asked Dr. Hutter, now that the two unions involved have agreed to return to work, if the factory would reopen&mdash;I quote from what Dr. Hutter said:&mdash;&ldquo;It is the local management and its opening of the plant depends very much on the practical conditions on the spot.  They&rdquo;&mdash;that is the local management&mdash;&ldquo;will have to decide and judge if conditions are sufficient to take up the work again&rdquo;.  Mr. McAleese asked: &ldquo;So it is up to the management there on the spot in Limerick?&rdquo;  The reply was: &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  This was broadcast on the Monday at 1.30 p.m. or shortly afterwards.  This was Dr. Hutter, the man who seemed to be in charge of the various discussions, telling, in public on the radio, an RTE correspondent that the question of the decision on the opening or closing of the factory was one for the local management in Limerick.  How can it be alleged that I knew, that the Government or that anybody knew a month beforehand that this would be done if this man said this at that time?</P>
    <P>Less than two hours after that broadcast I was on the telephone to Dr. Hutter, at 3.30 p.m.  He told me his board had met that day and they had made the decision to close.  I expressed horror and shock.  I pointed out that the men were now back at work, that the dispute between the two unions had ended so far as Ferenka were concerned, that I was totally amazed that they should do this now after the very favourable development on Saturday.  He said he was sorry and so on but that this was the decision I argued with him&mdash;and it is no exaggeration to say that it was an argument &mdash;and I put the case as strongly as I could that it was an outrageous thing <Col N="819" /> to do at this time.  For example, I pointed out that I had heard him on the radio only two hours previously say that it was a matter for the local management board in Limerick to make this decision.  He told me he did not say this.  I told him I had heard him say it, that several officials of my Department had heard him.  I said I had the transcript in which it appeared that he said this.  Then he said: &ldquo;I did not mean to say it, there must be some misunderstanding.&rdquo;  This, unhappily, is only one instance of the difficulties of talking to this particular firm.</P>
    <P>I have a long list of statements and contraditions of those statements made by various spokesmen of the firm in question.  I will not delay my time and the House's time because I have very little time, unfortunately, for this very complicated matter, by going through them all.  The sequence is that one statement is made, I issue comments on that statement, then the original statement is denied by another spokesman for AKZO and then some days after that again the statement denying the original statement is denied by yet another spokesman of AKZO.</P>
    <P>In the course of my discussion with Dr. Hutter, when I pointed this out to him and I said I found it very confusing to know exactly what their position was in relation to anything, gave this example to him of all these contradictions and counter statements and gave him the dates and all the rest of it he said: &ldquo;Some of those statements were not authorised&rdquo;.  I said: &ldquo;Well how do I know which are authorised and which are not?&rdquo; He said he did not know.  I said: &ldquo;How do the newspapers know which ones are authorised and which ones are not?&rdquo;  He said again he did not know.</P>
    <P>I was asked today when the question of the State taking over this factory from Ferenka first arose.  This first arose at the meeting between Dr. Hutter and myself on the 4th November, 1977.  It was suggested by him then as a possibility.  I asked for details of it and I was told there were no details available, that what he wanted me to do was to agree to the State taking over all the liabilities of the <Col N="820" /> company and then that we would work out the details afterwards.  He wanted me to take over the entire shareholding which was held by ENKA.  I said no, that I did not think that was on.  He then asked me to take a substantial majority in order, as he put it, in the two phrases that were used at the time, (1) that he could withdraw participation and (2) to reduce ENKA's exposure in the matter.</P>
    <P>At that stage there was no question of my being told there and then that if I did not do it the place was closing down.  I told him I wanted details of this and I had to consult the Government. I consulted the Government and conveyed some days later that the Government, first of all, needed details but secondly, they were not prepared, naturally, to make any decision on this matter about increasing their equity or anything else of that kind while there was an industrial dispute going on in the plant and while it was closed down, and that when that dispute was over and the plant was back in production the Government would obtain the advice of the IDA and the other relevant agencies to enable the position to be considered.</P>
    <P>No further details were forthcoming until my meeting on the evening of the 23rd November with Dr. Hutter. He, first of all, discussed with me certain points and he then handed me a document which I was not able to study fully at the time but which I had advice on later.  I could only say in relation to the offer that was made at that stage that no Government in any circumstances could agree to it because, quite frankly, from a commercial point of view or indeed any other point of view, what was offered was quite outrageous.  It would have entailed the Government taking over the entire liabilities from the time of the beginning of this particular strike onwards, all liability for investment, which was extremely heavy, all liability for future losses and for future investment.  At the same time it would leave the entire marketing control in the hands of ENKA, it would leave the entire pricing policy in the hands of ENKA.  ENKA have a factory making this very product.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> I could not accept that.  All the advice I got on the matter was that it was ludicrous to expect that it could be accepted by any Government.  There would have been the gravest negligence on my part or on the Government's part if any hearing was given to such a proposal in which the taxpayer was on an absolute loser to nothing, a loser all the way, and in which there was no guarantee whatever of any sort of survival for the company.  I had the document examined in detail by various advisers in the IDA and attached to the Department.  When they analysed it in detail the advice they gave me about it was that it was far more unsatisfactory and onerous from our point of view than I had thought at first sight.  They pointed our various things to me like that ENKA would retain the right to decide on the quality of the production and therefore the price that would be paid for it.  It was perfectly unthinkable that any such offer, if you could call it that&mdash;you could only call it that in the broadest terms&mdash;could ever be accepted by this or any Government acting responsibly.</P>
    <P>I offered that, as soon as the strike was over and the production was resumed, the Government were prepared to stand over the package which was already negotiated and agreed in September and, if necessary, increase further the equity holding which had been agreed at 24.9 per cent, but not to take over the entire factory and not to take a majority holding in it in a situation where nominally we would hold the majority of the shares and where we would take all the risks on behalf of the taxpayer but where the effective control lay all the time in the hands of ENKA.  If I had done otherwise than that I am quite satisfied I would indeed have been negligent.</P>
    <P>I was told that a meeting would be held on the following Monday by ENKA.  At that stage, as I stated the following morning, I issued a final appeal, as I saw it, in good faith, asking people, as the last chance, to think again before what was staring us all in the face happened.  I believed that if the workers concerned had <Col N="822" /> gone back to work then not even ENKA or AKZO would have taken the steps they did.  The workers went back to work.  I was shocked and amazed that after that very favourable development, the first in such a long time, eight-and-a-half weeks at that stage, within a few hours the ENKA board took the decision they did.</P>
    <P>I have used up nearly all my time. It is very unsatisfactory in this kind of debate on a complicated matter, to be confined to such a short time.  I have thought a lot about this.  I have analysed in my mind many of the reasons why a lot of these things happened and why this matter ended up in the very unhappy way in which it has. I have also thought a lot about the future and what should be done now and what can be done now.  I am afraid I have very little time to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>I want to make a couple of brief comments even though I cannot, unfortunately, finish them.  Virtually every major foreign firm which came into the country over the last 20 years have got on well with their workers. The Irish people have no resentment of foreign industrialists in the country. The Irish people regarded them favourably and welcomed them here as friends who have helped us in major ways during the past two decades. One of the very few companies who had a bad labour relations record since being established were Ferenka at Limerick.  As far back as 1972, after the plant had opened I had men coming to see me and saying that although they were working at Ferenka they were wondering whether there was any chance that I might find them jobs elsewhere.  Very often we as TD's find people coming to us because they have no jobs but for the past five-and-a-half years I have had people from Ferenka seeking a change of job.  Unfortunately, the situation at that plant was bad from the start.  The management must take a fair share of the blame for that unhappy situation. Since their establishment, Ferenka have had five managing directors, four chief engineers and five personnel managers.  It is not surprising, therefore, that the atmosphere was bad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="823" /> There was one union there so far as general workers were concerned. There was a closed shop agreement with the ITGWU.  Apparently, some of the unhappiness at the plant rubbed off on the union and many people thought that the union were not acting as effectively as they should and were not as tough with management as they might have been.  An attempt was made to organise another union at the plant.  This was the MPGWU.  So far as one can judge a considerable majority of the production workers joined that union.  Immediately the two unions were locked in mortal combat.  We have been given to believe from our reading of the newspapers in the past few days that all the union workers at Ferenka have got together almost as one happy family, have buried all the differences that existed during the past nine weeks and are prepared to work together as a united force with joint representation in the future should the factory re-open.</P>
    <P>I want to question the value of this move at this stage.  On Thursday week last when I was making a final effort to prevent the closure and appealing to the men to go back to work I said during the course of a radio interview: &ldquo;If this closes next week there will be lots of people who will want to sit down together and talk and be reasonable but that is no good.  It is this week that you must sit down together and talk and be reasonable.&rdquo; Unfortunately, once again I was right. Once the closure took place the many people here and elsewhere, who were silent for nine long weeks burst forth suddenly into full voice with the result that today we have no shortage of wise men.  It is a tragedy for this country that the efforts and the expressions we are getting now were not forthcoming at some time during the previous nine weeks when this tragedy could have been averted.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I have a great deal to say regarding the future but I cannot go into all that now because of the time limit.  Let me say, though in regard to individual members of the ITGWU in Limerick sitting down with members of the MPGWU and <Col N="824" /> saying that they are friends now, that they will work together and will not allow inter-union disputes to interfere with them in future, might I ask whether the two unions concerned at national level with their general secretaries and their presidents have sat down together and agreed to resolve their differences?  Have they solved the problems relating to Asahi in Dublin docks?  Let us not forget that the Asahi problem was there before the Ferenka problem began.  Asahi is still there.  Is there any lesson learned from what happened at Ferenka?  We are in the same position in Dublin docks today in relation to Asahi as we were in before Ferenka happened. Even at this stage, in order to preserve the rest of Irish industry I appeal to those two unions to sit down and talk meaningfully to one another, not to talk through intermediaries in different rooms at different times.  I issued a solemn and prophetic warning of what would happen in Ferenka.  That was five weeks before the closure.  Now I am issuing an equally solemn and prophetic warning that there will be many Ferenkas unless Irishmen sit down together, talk to one another and, for God's sake and above all else, have sense.</P>

      <P>I have listened carefully to the Minister and to Deputy Kelly and Deputy Browne.  With respect it is only in patches that they have touched the core of the real issues involved.  If, during this debate we are not prepared to face the unpleasant facts relating to this closure, we do a grave disservice to the workers concerned and to their families and we learn nothing for the future of industrial relations and of the Government's role in industrial relations.  Furthermore, we confuse the prospect of the plant being re-opened in some way. There are a number of viable ways in which the plant can be re-opened and the workers re-employed gainfully. In many ways all of us are responsible for what has happened.  Unless we face the facts we will do nothing to encourage future native and international investment here.</P>
      <P>It is not enough to say that the closure was a tragedy.  It was a scandal and even more, it was a national disgrace. There are clear areas of responsibility including, as we have underlined in this motion, the direct responsibility of the Government.  We are aware that in part and to a degree that we have yet to assess the company's labour relations policy was responsible. We are aware too, that some individual workers at the plant were responsible in part for what happened and also that the inter-union relations&mdash;in particular in respect of one union concerned&mdash;were responsible. But the Government in substantial part were responsible because of their indecision as exemplified tonight in a litany from Deputy O'Malley and by the regrettable inexperience of a fellow Corkman, the Minister for Labour. By their ineptitude and inaction the Government made a monumental contribution to the closure.  I propose to deal with these issues tomorrow evening. In relation to the Dáil we are dealing with the role of the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the best way to begin would be by quoting from <Col N="826" /> the EEC Council regulation, No. 1080 of 17th May, 1977 which states that from the start of the 1977-78 milk year the Community shall contribute for a period of at least five years to financing member states programmes for supplying milk and certain milk products at reduced prices to school children.  The implication of that is that this money has been available to this and other Government since 1st May, 1977.  The details of the way the money could be made available were set out in considerable depth in the Council regulation from which I am quoting of 17th May and in a subsequent regulation of 15th July.</P>
      <P>These make it clear first, that it is a five-year programme and that the money will be there in the future.  This means a decision will have to be taken by the Government at some stage. Secondly, they make it clear that it is a flexible scheme and it is open to the Government to give aid towards the cost of procuring the necessary equipment, if that is a problem, to provide the milk or milk products in the various schools.  They make it clear that the aid from the EEC will be equal to 50 per cent of the target price of milk.  The regulation goes on to say that that would be approximately twice the contribution which would be expected from a member Government. For every £2 provided by the EEC, the Irish Government would apparently have to provide only £1.  If ever there was an attractive scheme offered by the EEC that was one because most of them require the Irish Government to provide £1 for every 25p the Community provide.  This scheme is the opposite, yet to date we have failed to avail of this.</P>
      <P>The scheme is available not just in respect of whole milk, which may not be immediately attractive to all school children, but also in respect of chocolate flavoured whole milk products, yoghurts and a number of other products.  It is clear that there can be something in this scheme for every child and for every taste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also clear from the dating on which the money was available and from the dating of the regulation that if the Government had acted in time <Col N="827" /> we could have had this scheme available in our schools from the beginning of the school year which commenced last September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The money could have been available for this school year. My first question is: why did the Government fail to ensure that this money would be available for milk and milk products from the beginning of the academic year?  If I may be so bold, I will answer that question.  The reason is that this Government could not make up their minds which Minister was responsible, or should be responsible, for introducing this scheme. I put down parliamentary questions to all the Ministers who could be conceivably involved and every Minister in reply to my written questions disclaimed direct responsibility for it.</P>
      <P>It is not a sufficient excuse to say that the scheme, of its nature, is a complex one and that a number of Government Departments would or should be involved.  Practically every Government decision or scheme involves more than one Department.  It is the very essence of Cabinet Government that the Cabinet make the decision as to which Department shall have the lead role and enable the scheme to go ahead.  It is very hard to find any excuse for the Government failing to make a decision in relation to this scheme.</P>
      <P>First, it is a non-contentious issue. Nobody could be against the provision of school milk in principle. Second, there could be no political differences about the issue.  Third, Ireland could only gain from the introduction of the scheme.  If the Government cannot make up their minds which Department should be responsible, if they cannot make up their minds about an issue which is so simple and from which we can only gain, about what sort of issue can this Government make up their minds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To underline the catalogue of indecision and paralysis in Government, <Col N="828" /> we had the most unusual, if not unprecedented, spectacle of the Minister who is now in the House to answer this matter claiming last Thursday&mdash; after full notice having been given, a letter having been delivered personally by me to the Taoiseach the previous night, after a series of parliamentary questions, and after representations from various bodies concerned, dating back for months&mdash;that he was not responsible for the scheme but saying that the Minister for Agriculture was. I do not know why a difference of opinion on a matter like school milk should arise between the Minister for Health and Social Welfare and the Minister for Agriculture but, if they cannot agree about that, it must be very difficult to expect them to agree about other and more serious issues.</P>
    <P>My second question is this: why did the Minister for Health and Social Welfare not accept responsibility for this matter last Thursday?  Why did he not answer the debate then?  I hope when he rises he will be announcing that he is introducing this scheme.  The House should ask itself this question: were it not for the persistent parliamentary questions I put down, or for the fact that I raised this matter twice on the Adjournment, would we have had a decision this year, or any year, about the introduction of a school milk scheme?</P>
    <P>What are the consequences of the failure of the Government to make up their minds on this issue?  There are a number of technical issues which have to be overcome before such a scheme, which would obviously be beneficial to this country, can be introduced. First, there would have to be talks with the milk processors to ensure that the right sort of product is available for supplies in the schools.  You would need a specialist type of product with a specialist form of dispensing of the product.  Second, there would have to be talks with the school management board and teachers about the various arrangements for interposing the supply of milk in the normal school day.  Have such talks taken place?  I doubt it.  If they have not, why not? If the Government had decided this matter long ago, or even if they had at least decided which Minister was <Col N="829" /> responsible, these talks could now have been brought to a conclusion and we would be ready to go ahead straightaway.</P>
    <P>The second consequence of this delay and indecision on the part of the Government is that the money, which could be coming to this country and which will go to other countries in respect of the current milk marketing year, is not and will not come to this country.  France, Denmark and Britain are in a position to implement this scheme straightaway. I understand the regulations in Belgium for the implementation of this scheme have been published and a decision in principle has been taken in Holland to implement it.</P>
    <P>The result is that all those countries will almost certainly obtain money in the 1977-78 milk marketing year for the provision of milk and milk products in their schools and it looks as if we will not get any money.  If we do not, the Government's responsibility in the matter is clear.  Money which would otherwise have come here will have been irrevocably lost as a result of the Government's indecision.</P>
    <P>My last question is perhaps my most important one.  Why should we have a school milk scheme?  Why is it a good thing?  This country, unlike many other countries, does not have a school meals service.  We have such a service in some Dublin schools under the Departments of Health and Social Welfare, but we do not have a comprehensive school meal service.  I believe there is a case for providing school meals, and certainly for providing school milk. Many children from deprived backgrounds, where perhaps the homes are broken up because of alcoholism or some other factor which diminishes the competence of the children, may go to school without a proper breakfast, or if they have a breakfast it consists of food not properly balanced from a dietary point of view.  They will go into school where they will not get a school meal, or any sustenance during the day unless they have been provided with a packed lunch.  If their parents were unable to provide them with an adequate breakfast, it is unlikely <Col N="830" /> they will be provided with a packed lunch.  The result is that many of these children will not be able to concentrate on their education and derive benefit from that education to the same extent as their peers who are adequately fed.  This fact was recognised by the Department of Education when they introduced a school meal service in Rutland Street, a deprived part of this city.  They recognised that the provision of food, or a food equivalent, during the day was an important factor in improving education.</P>
    <P>The provision of a school milk service, as well as ensuring that the children from deprived backgrounds avail of adequate education, will also be of assistance to parents in defraying the amount of money that they would otherwise have to pay for other products in substitution for the milk that they would get under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The second reason in favour of the introduction of the scheme is agriculture. We are a leading dairy producing country in the EEC.  The dairy industry is a larger factor in our economy than it is in the economics of any other EEC countries.  Therefore it is in our interests to be in the lead in any measure which will expand the consumption of milk in the Community. If this scheme were introduced it would add approximately three million gallons to the total amount of milk products being consumed here every year.  We are already high <i>per capita</i> consumers of milk products and it is in our interests to try to persuade by example other EEC countries to raise their consumption of milk products. We cannot do this with conviction if we have to tell them that while money was made available to us to introduce a school milk scheme we failed to avail of the money.  We cannot encourage other countries to consume more of our milk products unless we show the basis confidence in our own products when money is made available.  This scheme is necessary. Will the Minister introduce it and, if so, when?  If not, why not?  Why has there been such a long delay in coming to a decision, which Minister is responsible, and will he say whether or not the scheme should be introduced?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>When we had a similar situation previously in regard to a milk product, which was cheap butter for the social welfare classes, we had no difficulty in deciding how the scheme should be administered or which Minister would be responsible. The Minister for Agriculture is responsible for making the case for the scheme for Ireland, and the Department with the machinery for administering the scheme is the Department of Social Welfare.  That should not have caused a problem.  During my time we had the opportunity to discuss this in the EEC, and I made a very strong case for it for a number of reasons, most of which have been outlined by Deputy Bruton.  One of the products I tried to get included was cheese, because cheese in a sandwich can be almost a full midday meal for children and it is something which would be very beneficial.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister is very anxious about the health of young people and is anxious to prevent disease before it starts.  I hear people talking about &ldquo;Charlie's health plan&rdquo; and what it will do for the country.  This is to the Minister's credit.  This is a way in which the Minister could influence young people to use milk products in the quantity that they should be used. This is an excellent opportunity for which we are probably three-quarters paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect that convinced me that this was something we should look for and should accept as soon as it became available was this.  We are well on the road to being qualified by the amount of money we already contribute for milk and school meals and it would take a comparatively small additional amount to be fully qualified to get a substantial extra sum of money for this country.  It seems an extra-ordinary thing that for some reason we are hesitating about this.  I hope that a final decision has not yet been made.  I hope that the fact that we did not start this at the start of the school year is no reason that it cannot start after Christmas.  I know that the Government have been extremely busy since they came to office and they may not have had time to look at the <Col N="832" /> seriousness of this situation.  As a result of this discussion and as a result of the feelings of the people generally I hope that after Christmas the Government and the Ministers concerned will decide that this is something we should have.</P>

This scheme for the supply of milk and certain milk products at reduced prices to school children is only one of a number of schemes being considered by the EEC Commission to deal with surplus milk production in the Community.

      <P>I am making a statement and, if Deputy Bruton chooses to misunderstand what I am saying and to contradict something that I am not saying, that is not good parliamentary behaviour.  The manner in which the total fund arising from the co-responsibility levy is to be administered is still under consideration and it is quite possible that we will get back from the co-responsibility levy more moneys than we contributed, or at least as much, so that is not an argument relevant to the matter we are now discussing.  This scheme which Deputy Bruton and Deputy Clinton are interested in would provide that the EEC would make a contribution for at least five years to financing a member state's programme for supplying milk and certain milk products at reduced prices to all school children.  The amount of milk per pupil is limited and, except in certain specified circumstances, it will be confined to a quarter of a litre or .44 of a pint.  The EEC contribution will be 50 per cent of the target price of milk, the national contribution would have to be at least 50 per cent of the EEC contribution and the balance would be chargeable to the school children. The EEC subsidy would come from the Feoga fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to Deputy Bruton and Deputy Clinton that they misunderstand <Col N="834" /> the situation.  This is not a very attractive scheme from our point of view.  The retail price of milk here after the State subsidy of 3½p per pint is deducted is 8p and the EEC subsidy proposed under this scheme would be 3.8p per pint.  The Commission then envisage that the balance of 4.2p per pint would be paid by the school children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Deputies be clear about that.  I have no hesitation in saying that any scheme which would envisage school children paying 4.2p per pint of milk would not work.  The money could not be collected and we could not ask the children to pay it.  It would be a ridiculous scheme.  If the children do not pay the only people left to pay it are the State.  Therefore we will find the State in addition to the subsidy it is already giving, also paying 4.2p per pint of milk under this scheme.  That would cost £6 million per year.  I hope Deputy Bruton understands that.  He is trying to give the impression that this is free milk coming from the EEC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nothing of the sort.  The introduction of this scheme would involve us in paying out of the Exchequer £6 million per annum.  I do not mind paying £6 million per annum out of the Exchequer if that is what we want and if that is the best way of spending that £6 million.  As Minister for Social Welfare I am not prepared to say that if I can get an extra £6 million more from my colleague, the Minister for Finance, this is the way I would spend it.  I do not think it would be very good value, and I believe my colleague, the Minister for Education, would say the same.  If our colleague, the Minister for Finance, is prepared to make an extra £6 million available to us for any of our purposes, education, social welfare or health, I do not think that this is the way we would use it.  The Deputies are very much mistaken when they try to persuade the House and the general public that this is very much an open and shut case <Col N="835" /> and that all that is required is for us to say the word and we will get all the milk we want free from the EEC for the schools.

      <P>At the moment under existing legislation any urban authority who want it have the power to provide a scheme for the supply of school meals&mdash;not merely milk&mdash;to any children attending a national school in their administrative area and there is a similar provision for Gaeltacht areas.  Any urban authority in the country who want to do that may do it and we cannot turn them down. Any local authority has the statutory right to introduce such a scheme and it must be financed to the extent of 50 per cent by the Minister for Social Welfare and 50 per cent by the local authority.  As matters stand approximately only half the urban authorities in the country are availing of that.  If Deputy Bruton is very interested in this the first thing he should do would be to go out and find out why the rest of the local authorities are not introducing free school meals a scheme for which is already there and available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to condemn the proposal entirely.  The one advantage which may emerge out of it is that it is quite possible that, in so far as we are already supplying subsidised milk to schools under the free meals scheme, we will be able to recoup that expenditure from Brussels.  That would <Col N="836" /> be a positive advantage to the country and should certainly encourage other local authorities in urban areas who are not availing of this free meals scheme to go ahead and introduce it. As far as we have studied this proposal, at the moment it is not very attractive from our point of view. The situation is on-going, to use a cliché.</P>
    <P>We will certainly keep in touch with the situation and if any more attractive proposals emerge from Brussels we will be glad to avail of them.  At the moment I am not satisfied that I would be justified in spending £6 million on this sort of scheme.  As Deputy Clinton knows better than anybody else, the existing level of consumption of milk in this country is abnormally high. We consume 44 gallons per head per annum as compared with, say, 12 gallons in Germany.  We have not much hope of increasing that any more.  I do not think there is any demand, in rural areas certainly, for a free milk for schools scheme.  There might be a possibility of extending it slightly in the urban areas, but I have never come across any pressure in rural Ireland for a scheme for free milk only.  I am satisfied that unless this Brussels proposal is very considerably changed it is not the best thing for us at present and it would not be the best way for us to spend another £6 million if I or the Minister for Education were to be offered that by the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>The only grant payments to State-sponsored bodies which have been affected by EEC Regulations are the annual grants to CIE.  The relevant regulations are general transport regulations and are numbered 1191/69, 1192/69 and 1107/70, copies of which have been laid before the House.  Brief particulars of these regulations and of the manner in which they have been applied to CIE are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  EEC Regulation No. 1191/69 enables payment of compensation by the State to transport undertakings in respect of losses incurred on services operated under public service obligations which are deemed essential to ensure the provision of adequate transport services. Payment is being made to CIE under this regulation in respect of losses remaining on rail passenger services after fares increases and any possible economies in operation.</P>
      <P>(b)  EEC Regulation No. 1192/69 provides for compensation by the State in respect of specified financial burdens borne by railway undertakings. Payments were made to CIE in 1976 under this regulation to cover the following costs in respect of rail passenger and freight operations:</P>
      <P>&mdash;superannuation and pension costs less savings arising from the Board's exemption from payment of certain social welfare insurance contributions in respect of clerical and supervisory staff.</P>
      <P>&mdash;50 per cent of the costs of maintenance and control of level crossings. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  EEC Regulation No. 1107/70 specifies certain additional circumstances <Col N="695" /> in which State aids may be paid to transport undertakings. Under this regulation payments are being made to CIE in respect of:</P>
    <P>&mdash;50 per cent of infrastructure costs in respect of rail freight (Article 3.1.(b))</P>
    <P>&mdash;losses on the Board's road passenger services which cannot be recouped by fares increases or eliminated by economies in operation (Article 3.2).</P>
    <P>&mdash;residual deficits on railway operations and losses on maintenance of canals (Article 4).</P>
    <P>In order to comply with the provisions of these regulations a new subvention structure for CIE was introduced with effect from 1st January, 1975, and this structure in respect of the year 1977 is set out at page 154 of the Estimates Volume for that year. As the regulations govern only aid for transport by rail, road and inland waterway the grant to cover losses on the operation of the Galway-Aran ferry service is not affected by the regulations.</P>
    <P>As regards the statutory authority for the issue of grants to CIE the position is that section 6 of the Transport Act, 1964, which provided for an annual grant to CIE of two million pounds, with provision for periodic variation was repealed by the Transport (No. 2) Act, 1974.  Section 3 of the 1974 Act envisaged instead payments of unspecified amounts to the board out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. These payments are accordingly voted annually by the Dáil and included in the Vote for Tourism and Transport. The amounts are calculated annually in accordance with the EEC Regulations.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputies in regard to grants towards the cost of archaeological excavations is available in my answer to Question No. 287 of 18th October, 1977, and the answer by the Minister for Education to Question No. 314 of the same date.</P>
      <P>There is no obligation on the excavators to lodge in the National Museum the objects discovered.  The Commissioners of Public Works are in touch with the excavators concerned to ensure that any archaeological objects found are reported.</P>
      <P>The policy in relation to the granting of moneys for archaeological excavation is under continuous review, including the question of whether persons who have not fully complied with all the conditions of their licence should get further grants.</P>

      <P>The terms of reference of the Archaeological Survey are:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the survey to be a complete record of all the visible remains of field monuments of every age and type,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;a standard procedure to be adopted in regard to the technique <Col N="698" /> of recording monuments both in drawing and verbal description; the records to contain all essential scientific data.</P>
    <P>&mdash;a systematic territorial coverage to be followed.</P>
    <P>The provision for the survey in the current year is approximately £45,000.</P>
    <P>Five archaeologists and three surveyors are currently engaged full-time on the survey.</P>
    <P>To date the survey is at various stages of completion in Counties Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Cavan, Westmeath, Longford, Kildare, Dublin and Offaly.</P>
    <P>The preparation of the survey report is commencing this month and it is intended to publish it in parts as completed.</P>
    <P>In the course of the survey there was evidence that a number of monuments had been destroyed.  The rate of destruction varied from one area to another but on average was somewhat over 15 per cent of those for which records were available.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of retirement pension, which is a contributory pension, at the maximum rate since June, 1975.  The rates of retirement pension and of old age (contributory) pension are identical and a person cannot receive both pensions at the same time.  The substitution of old age pension for retirement pension when the person reached pension age in June, 1977, would, therefore, have been of no advantage to him, and he has been so informed. If, however, he wishes to receive old age contributory pension in lieu of retirement pension and notifies the Department to that effect, arrangements will be made to change the pension. In the meantime, as he had a period of insurance in the United Kingdom the question of his possible entitlement to a British pension under EEC Regulations has been referred to the British authorities and he will be advised of the decision as soon as it becomes available.</P>

      <P>The claim for unemployment benefit made by the person concerned was disallowed by an appeals officer of my Department in respect of the period from 2nd to 14th July, 1977, on the ground that the claimant was not unemployed as this was a period in respect of which payment was made to the claimant by CIE in respect of annual leave.  This was in accordance with the usual practice whereby benefit is not payable in respect of periods for which annual leave is also paid in cases where the claimant is due to recommence work with the same employer or can reasonably be expected to do so within a short period.</P>

      <P>The programmes of the Industrial Development Authority have as their objectives the maintenance as far as possible of existing levels of employment and the creation of new employment in industry in urban areas and in other areas alike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some time past the authority has been giving special attention to the industrial development and related job creation needs of the Dublin area including the inner city area.  To this end the Small Industries Programme is being actively promoted in the inner city.  Construction of a &ldquo;cluster&rdquo; of factories for small scale industry at Newmarket in the Liberties area is due to commence in March, 1978. This development will house eight <Col N="714" /> small factory units and is expected to be ready for occupation by the end of 1978.  In addition, the authority is working closely with the local authorities to explore ways and means of promoting industrial development both in centre city locations and on the perimeter.</P>
    <P>On the basis of consultations to date with the local authorities and with private developers, it is estimated by the authority that there are at present available in Dublin city and environs about 30 locations, totalling some 700 acres, in private and public ownership which would be suitable for industrial projects.  A major constraint on the establishment in the inner city area of projects with a high male employment content is the scarcity of suitable land for such projects.</P>
    <P>As to the final part of the question, no special funds additional to the existing provisions for industrial development have been allocated since June, 1977.</P>

      <P>The IDA are actively seeking new industrial projects for the vacant factories in counties Laois and Offlay. Since the beginning of this year 15 industrial promoters have been taken to visit the factory in Clara and 12 to visit the factory in Edenderry. Negotiations are continuing with one overseas firm regarding a possible project for Edenderry.  A number of firms have expressed interest in locating in Clara.</P>
      <P>Two units in the 15,000 sq.ft. cluster factory at Tullamore have been allocated to projects which have been approved for grants under the IDA's small industries programme.  I understand that a number of inquiries have been received regarding the remaining three units and it is expected that they will be allocated before the end of the year.</P>

I do not envisage any significant change in the survey's role in these matters.

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is mainly interested in &ldquo;private&rdquo; cars. On 30th September, 1976, the latest date for which figures are available, the total number of all types of motor vehicles under current licence in the country was 724,816 of which 551,117 were in the &ldquo;private&rdquo; car category. A total of 540,000 approximately of the latter figure were 16 horse-power or less.</P>

      <P>The question of an inspection of the houses by an inspector from my Department does not arise in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 31st December, 1974, Tullamore Urban District Council informed the person concerned that the transfer order had been made in her case. Under section 106 of the Housing Act, 1966, a purchaser has a right of appeal to the Minister within twenty-one days beginning on the date on which he is notified of the making of the transfer order if he is not satisfied that the house is in good structural condition.  The tenant concerned was notified by the urban council of her right of appeal and the time limit which applies.  However, her appeal was not received in the Department until 11th March, 1976.  The appeal <Col N="722" /> could not, therefore, be entertained. The position is that the person concerned, as the owner of the house, is now responsible for its repair and maintenance.  The local authority is not empowered to carry out any further work in this case at this stage.</P>
    <P>The solicitors acting for the person were informed accordingly on 15th June, 1976.</P>

      <P>The table which follows gives for the years 1973/74 to 1977 the information sought by the Deputy on the Department's total financial allocation and the parts of it devoted to housing and roads.  Funds for community and recreational facilities are not specifically distinguished in the Department's Vote and the public capital programme and consequently it is not possible to include figures for this heading in the table.  The cost of land acquired for local authority housing constitutes part of the housing allocation; it is not possible to segregate land acquisition costs from the other costs of local authority housing construction.</P>
      <P>The financial allocations for the various services of the Department are not settled in accordance with predetermined ratios but have traditionally taken account of such factors as the level of commitments, the needs of the various programmes, the over-all budgetary position and so on. These criteria are likely to continue to be the main influences in the settlement of the financial provisions to be made annually for the various services.</P>
