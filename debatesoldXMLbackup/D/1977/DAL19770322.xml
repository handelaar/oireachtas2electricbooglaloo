    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he received any representations from the Donegal branch of the medical union to have the proposed orthopaedic unit for the north-western region sited at Letterkenny General Hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received representations from the Donegal branch of the medical union to have the proposed orthopaedic unit for the North Western Health Board area sited at Letterkenny General Hospital.</P>
      <P>The question of the provision of an orthopaedic unit for the North Western Health Board area has been considered and discussed by Comhairle na nOspidéal, the North Western Health Board and my Department. Various options as to how the unit might be provided were put forward including the possibility of having it sited at Letterkenny General Hospital.</P>
      <P>On 21st February, 1977, the health board further considered the matter and came to the conclusion that the orthopaedic unit should be located at Sligo General Hospital and pending the provision of this unit that a temporary unit should be provided at Our Lady's Hospital, Manorhamilton.</P>
      <P>Following further discussions with the health board, I have now approved of this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister take into account, before sanctioning this proposal to build the unit in Sligo, the huge number on the orthopaedic waiting list from Donegal who have to travel far and have no facilities?  We are awaiting a very much needed extension to Letterkenny Hospital which could easily have included this unit.  Is the Minister aware that the medical profession in Donegal were unanimous in their desire to have it in Letterkenny?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the medical union view was but as far as I can gather they wanted it in Sligo.  I appreciate that people will have to travel quite long journeys but if it was sited in Letterkenny they would also have to travel long journeys down to the border of the North Western and Western Health Boards.  This was a decision, after long deliberations by the health board, and I think, in all the circumstances, it was the most sensible one to be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied to leave Donegal without <Col N="5" /> orthopaedic facilities and to have the Shiel Hospital at Ballyshannon unused? A large amount of money was spent on this hospital in the past in providing proper theatre facilities and the most up to date facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will acknowledge that the site in Sligo will be nearer the people in Donegal than Galway where they will have to travel up to the end of 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to pursue this too far but it is quite a serious matter.  Is the Minister aware that the people to whom he referred, in the Sligo and Leitrim area have orthopaedic facilities and Donegal will have none?  The Minister is providing facilities in both Manorhamilton and Sligo.  There is a huge waiting list.</P>

    <P>5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is prepared to establish a maternity unit in the James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown, Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the provision of a maternity unit at James Connolly Memorial Hospital has to be considered in conjunction with the overall needs for maternity beds in the Dublin area and more specifically with the projected number of births in the catchment area of the hospital.  It is difficult, however, to estimate accurately such needs in view of the changing position in relation to the number of births in Dublin in recent years.  The matter is being kept under review but until a definite trend emerges it will not be possible to decide on future maternity bed requirements and where these should be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the development which has occurred in that area and in areas approximate to it, would the Minister accept that he <Col N="7" /> would not need a research agency to tell him that there will be a need for a maternity unit in that hospital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as development in that area is concerned housing did not go at the pace that was anticipated. Whilst there is an agreement in principle that a maternity unit will be provided, the number of births in Dublin fell by 800 in 1975 compared with 1974, and by 400 in 1976 compared with 1975, so there is a reduction of about 1,200 births over that period.  The masters of the maternity hospitals met and discussed the whole situation and they said that not alone had they adequate maternity accommodation but they could take on more cases.  At present it would appear superfluous to have another maternity unit in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the accessibility of Blanchardstown hospital to the likely mothers would the Minister accept that they should be considered?  The same would apply to the Finglas area.  It would be much easier for ladies to get to Blanchardstown than to the Rotunda hospital. The Minister will accept that often there can be delays for as long as an hour in getting through the traffic to the Rotunda hospital.  Would the Minister also accept that in respect of births the mothers are in Blanchardstown, Clonsilla and Finglas rather than in the centre of the city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it is a longer distance in from the James Connolly hospital; it it about five miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot of traffic congestion on the way in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that according to the masters who discussed this in detail they have sufficient beds within the three hospitals now provided for maternity in Dublin, and they say that they could deal with more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the position of the mothers is one which must get priority over the <Col N="8" /> position of the masters, even if it is inconvenient for the masters to move out?  Surely we are concerned with providing the service where it is most beneficial to the people who are in need of it.  A case can be made that Blanchardstown rather than the centre of the city should be the location for a maternity unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to consider it as a unit.  Whilst I can understand the concern of mothers and families, the masters who discussed this are of the opinion that they would have very many more vacant beds in the Dublin hospitals if the James Connolly hospital were to have a maternity unit.  There was an agreement in principle that a maternity unit would be built, but this has been postponed due to the trend in births.  This problem was also discussed with the hospital authorities, although I do not know what their view was.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I am considering the implementation of part of the interim report.  Three of the recommendations have already been implemented, that is the council for the education and training of social services personnel and, as recommended in the report, two new special residential units for children under five years who have been deserted or are awaiting adoption or who have been taken into care by the Eastern Health Board, were provided in Madonna House, Blackrock, in 1976.  Two or three additional units for 20 to 25 similar children will be provided in 1977.  New residential facilities for 16 homeless travelling children aged between eight and 16 years were provided in Newtownmountkennedy in 1976.  Additional accommodation may be provided there in 1977.  As far as other parts of the report are concerned I believe I will be able to make a decision and a pronouncement on them in a matter of a week or two.</P>

      <P>I have not received any reports on the possibility <Col N="10" /> of a connection between blindness in children and canine pets.  I have, however, seen recent Press reports on the subject.  I am advised that there can be such a connection.  There is a disease called toxicara canis which derives its name from a worm which infects the intestine of dogs.  Ova from the worm are excreted.  If these ova get into the mouths of children and are eaten, the larva hatch in the gut and migrate into body tissues especially the brain and eye.  This may cause blindness or epilepsy.</P>
      <P>I am told that the risk of serious infection is slight.  Nevertheless I would strongly advise people to have their pet dogs wormed regularly and to make sure that children do not let their pets lick them on the face.  It is also very important that children should develop the habit of washing their hands before eating, particularly after playing with their pets.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In May, 1972, the Clarenbridge Oyster Co-operative Society, Ltd, applied for an oyster fishery order under section 256 in respect of part of Galway Bay.  This Department considered that the granting <Col N="13" /> to the society of the oyster fishery order sought had merit, because the assignment by order to a named co-operative society of fishermen, and the direct control and management of this important public oyster fishery would be likely to result in more effective conservation of the fishery by tighter control of illegal fishing, particularly the removal of under-sized oysters.</P>
      <P>The necessary statutory public inquiry into the society's application was held in Clarenbridge on the 20th December, 1972, and no objections were raised to the granting of an order.  Following full consideration the Parliamentary Secretary, my predecessor, directed that an oyster fishery order be made in favour of the Clarenbridge Oyster Co-operative Society, Ltd, subject to the rules of membership of the society being amended to provide that membership of the society shall be open to all residents of the State, to all companies registered within the State under the Companies Act and to all societies registered in the State under the Act, and that membership of the society shall not be refused any such resident company or society which complies with the society's rules.  The society was notified of this requirement on the 21st April, 1975, and on the 3rd November, 1975, they confirmed that they had so amended their rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fisheries Division then put in hand immediately the finalising of the order.  However, the order differs fundamentally from previous oyster fishing orders in that it effectively transfers to a private group, that is, the society, the control of an important, <Col N="14" /> widely-worked public oyster fishery.  In order to protect this public right as far as possible, the Fisheries Division obtained legal advice on various aspects of the matter and included them in the draft order as necessary. I would take it that all that is the cause of the delay.</P>

Having been in Finance, Deputy Colley will agree with me that it is no function of the State to provide all the money for those who want to build houses no matter how rich they may be.  I do not think we will find much disagreement on this point. Those who can borrow money other than from local authorities should be encouraged to do so and I think are doing it in a big way.</P>

Four thousand, seven hundred and thirty-seven dwellings were at tender stage at 31st December, 1975, as compared to 4,392 at 31st December, 1976, a percentage change of 7.3 because starts in the last quarter of 1976 were 2,553 as compared to 1,248 in the last quarter of 1975.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the seminar was to provide the senior officials concerned with an opportunity of extending and updating knowledge and information about aspects of the technical management of the fire service.  While seminars of the kind on different subjects are a fairly regular feature for local authority technical officers, there is no basis for the implication that no other measures for improvement of the fire service are envisaged.  The general question of short-term arrangements for the central training of fire service personnel is at present being considered by a sub-group of the Local Government Manpower Committee, and an interim report relating to breathing apparatus training has already been acted upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the wider front, I have asked all local authorities to conduct a thorough assessment of the strength and efficiency of the fire service in their area, extending both to fire fighting <Col N="21" /> and fire prevention programmes, and have provided guidance on how this should be done.  This work is at present in progress and is of fundamental importance in the opportunity which it affords local authorities to identify any weaknesses there may be and to identify any necessary improvements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government why the amount requested by his Department from Kildare VEC for audit fees has increased to such an extent in 1977; and if he will indicate the amounts charged in each of the years since 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in audit fees for Kildare VEC is part of a general increase in audit fees due to the overall rise in the cost of the Local Government audit service.  In fixing the revised rates for individual authorities, regard was had to the current levels of revenue expenditure of the various authorities, the length of audit time and the difficulty of particular audits.</P>
      <P>The fees were last revised in 1973. The current fees, which have been approved by the Prices Commission, will apply to the audit of accounts for the year ended 31st December, 1975.</P>
      <P>The fees chargeable in respect of the audit of the accounts of Kildare VEC since 1970 are: 1970-71, £40; 1971-72, £40; 1972-73, £40; 1973-74, £200; 1974 (9 months), £150; 1975, £450.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that even the Minister would agree that &ldquo;galloping&rdquo; would not be a word that would amply describe the inflationary figures he mentioned in this case.  Seeing that members of the VEC are happy with the personnel and that the figures are reliable&mdash;it is members of Local Government who want to audit them&mdash; does he not now feel, in view of the very high cost involved, that Local Government could foot the Bill and pay for the audit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the members would even be aware of whether or not the figures were correct. They are presented to them by the officials and I am sure they are correct, but they must be audited.  It is ridiculous to suggest that because a number of figures supplied by local authorities are accepted by the members that should be sufficient.  I do not think Deputy Power would agree that that was so.  I might point out that whereas a fee of £200 was fixed in 1973 and the then expenditure of Kildare VEC was less than £200,000 the comparable figure for the year ended 31st December, 1975, is £677,000, an increase of 238 per cent. The revised fee represents an increase of 125 per cent.  Generally the idea is that the VEC pay for two-thirds of the cost of the audit and the extra one-third is carried by central funds.  That is not an unreasonable way of doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister inferred that we might not be aware of the figures.  I am telling him we are aware of the figures.  I am saying members are satisfied that the figures presented to them and to the personnel in the Vocational Education Committee are very reliable.  We know them more intimately than do those carrying out the audit.  The Department of Local Government want the audit.  The figures are now ten times what they were when Fianna Fáil were in power. Could the Minister impress on his Department that they should carry the fees?</P>

      <P>The Deputies may have intended to refer to the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Acts which provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for payment of allowances, to leaders of parties in Dáil Éireann, which are designed to provide research and secretarial assistance for the general conduct of the Opposition in Dáil Éireann.  It is not intended to introduce amending legislation to provide for similar payments to Independent Deputies.</P>

      <P>A glib reply such as that does not meet the question.  Is the Minister for the Public Service not fully aware that Independent Deputies who are not aligned to the three major <Col N="25" /> parties have been more than patient in this matter for the past few years since the figures were moved up to the point at which they now are?  Is it not a fact that somewhere in the region of £500 or £600 per head is paid to the three major parties in this House and that the people who come off worse are the three non-aligned Members of the House who asked this question? Will the Parliamentary Secretary, the Minister and the Government look at this matter in the proper light rather than try to find a way out of it?

I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to go fully into this matter and to do something positive about it rather than say that perhaps they will change it after the next election.

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central)</i> asked the Minister for Agriculture the steps the Government intends to take to ensure continuing employment for the workers of the <Col N="27" /> Clover Group, Donnellys, Cork Street, Dublin 8; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>As announced on Friday, 11th March, the Government have decided to provide State assistance for the Clover Meats Group in the form of a guaranteed loan through the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  This, together with further facilities which are being made available by commercial banking interests will provide for the group's immediate needs.  I have been informed by Clover Meats Ltd. that it is not their intention to close the Donnelly factory but that it is available for sale as a going concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> In the financial deal which was worked out, did the Minister get any undertaking from Clover Meats that the Donnelly factory will remain in operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy any more information than that contained in the reply.  The Donnelly factory will not be closed down but is available for sale as a going concern.  It will not be for sale for any other purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Is the Minister giving an undertaking that the present employment content at Donnellys, which is 300, will be maintained even when it is sold?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that no Minister could give that sort of undertaking.  That depends entirely on the supply of pigs.  They will not keep people unless they have work for them. If the supply continues at its present level I assume the same number of people will be employed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Surely in the financial deal worked out by the Minister, the ACC and the IDA, the future prospects of that firm were considered.  Will it be a viable proposition?  Will it continue manufacturing within the present company? <Col N="28" /> Is it the intention of the company to sell?  If it is the intention of the company to sell off Donnellys of Cork Street was an undertaking given that the present employment content would continue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main concerns of the Government in providing State assistance was to ensure that the maximum number of people would be kept in employment within the group, however that was to be done.  A group of experts are being put in to see that everything possible is done to keep the organisation working at the highest possible level and to keep the maximum number of people in employment.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to <Col N="30" /> take Questions Nos. 23, 24 and 25 together.  The total area of lettable lands on the hands of the Land Commission for division in County Galway is 8,348 acres.  Particulars are set out in a table which, with your permission, Sir, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.  It is expected that the cases marked with an asterisk will be allotted during the current year.  The programme for 1976 envisaged the division of 90 properties.  Of this number 69 were in fact divided; schemes for 13 others were prepared but were not finalised in time to permit operation and in eight other cases it was not possible to prepare the resale schemes. Other properties were included in the division programme resulting in a total allotment of 5,000 acres which is considered satisfactory.</P>
      <P>Following is the table:</P>
      <P Just="Center">County Galway</P>
      <P Just="Center">Particulars of lettable lands (apart from turbary and insignificant residues of partly allotted properties) in possession of the Land Commission for division.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave figures for 1976 &mdash; they were also given by his colleague to another Deputy&mdash; which were misleading.  The amount of land actually divided in County Galway did not correspond with those figures. It is embarrassing for Land Commission officials to have to give figures and the names of estates to be divided when they are not subsequently divided. Is it true that the money for the Land Commission for 1977 according to the Estimates, has been cut?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware of the recent sale of the Sebag Montefiori estate at Bruree, County Limerick of over 400 acres to speculative purchasers who are non-farmers and who since the purchase have already tried to sell the estate in smaller lots to other land speculators at a large profit; if he is aware of the congestion among the smallholders in the adjoining areas who would benefit considerably from the extra land if the Land Commission were to acquire this estate for subdivision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the number of applications on hands at present from holders in Counties Limerick and Kerry for the exchange of holdings under the Land Commission; and if the Land Commission will consider the Sebag Montefiori estate and the Coll estate in Bruree, County Limerick for <Col N="41" /> acquisition so as to meet the needs of these applicants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 27 together. I understand that an application on behalf of a non-qualified person for consent, under section 45 of the Land Act, 1965, to the purchase of the Sebag Montefiori estate has been lodged in the Land Commission and is at present under consideration. All the relevant circumstances will be taken into account by the Land Commission and until a decision is made on the application it would not be appropriate for me to make a statement in the matter.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission have compulsory proceedings for the acquisition of the Coll estate comprising some 137 acres but pending the hearing of an objection which has been lodged it is not possible to say what the outcome of the proceedings will be.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the number of applications for migration which the Land Commission have on hands from smallholders in Counties Limerick and Kerry are 20 and four respectively. These are, of course, general applications for migration and are not necessarily related to any particular estate. The Deputy will appreciate that where the Land Commission acquire lands for division the needs of local deserving smallholders must first be taken into account before there is any question of utilising part of the lands to provide exchange holdings.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Could he tell the House what is meant by a &ldquo;non-qualified person&rdquo;, in this case, the person who bought the Sebag Montefiori estate?  When will the hearing to make the decision on the question of the acquisition of the Coll estate of 137 acres take place?  The Minister gave figures for migratory farmers, were they 20 for Limerick and four for Kerry or <i>vice versa</i>?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, 20 for Limerick and four for Kerry.  I cannot tell the Deputy when the actual hearing will take place nor can I tell him the <Col N="42" /> various ways by which a person can be disqualified from buying land here. The position has altered considerably since we joined the EEC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister used the phrase &ldquo;non-qualified person&rdquo; I should have thought he would know the meaning of that phrase.  Are his Department aware that the non qualified person seeking permission from his Department for the purchase of this land has already sold parts of it, subject to permission, to other land speculators?  Has this important factor been taken into consideration by his Department in dealing with the application of this so-called non-qualified person?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>My party are opposing this section as it stands because it repeals the legislation setting up An Foras Talúntais.  Since their establishment, An Foras Talúntais <Col N="54" /> have built up an enviable record of agricultural research and of service to the farming community and the community in general.  They have built up a reputation for high scholarship and are a cadre of devoted people.  It is proposed in this legislation to wipe them out.</P>
      <P>I am afraid the purpose behind this, or one of the purposes, at any rate, is to requite a long-felt envy of people in the Department of Agriculture.  It is basely motivated.  The reason behind the proposal in this section to destroy An Foras Talúntais derives its origin from unworthy motivation.  As far as I know, the proposal to destroy An Foras did not receive the blessing of any recognisable organisation in the country, agricultural or otherwise.  To look for the motivation that produced this extraordinary decision you do not have to search far afield but near home. One must examine the motivation behind the effort to destroy something as useful and as good as this organisation. The theory behind the Bill is that research can be carried out, as if it were a commodity like cornflakes, within the general ambit of a remarkably awkwardly titled Bill like this.</P>
      <P>Anybody who has had even a nodding acquaintance with An Foras or what lies behind research knows that agricultural research as we have known it and as we have benefited by it here will be destroyed by this proposal.  In the future research will become the creature of a Minister, and worse still, of the Minister for Finance.  The whole continuity of research will be destroyed by this spiteful, contemptible measure.</P>
      <P>One wonders if there are not more venal reasons behind this as well.  One wonders whether in destroying An Foras Talúntais one is not making a super-duper job for one or two of the boys that they could not have had before. One wonders if a particular one of the boys whom some of us can identify will not now be able to put his fingers into the pie of what he considers to be research, as well as everything else, as well as all the other pies in which this gentleman has his fingers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard this proposal as corrupt.  It is shameful.  It is a disgrace.  It could <Col N="55" /> only come from a source completely insulated and remote from any contact with the farming community here.  This was generated in the well-known smoke filled backrooms.  No farmer had anything to do with this and no farming organisation could feel anything but shock at this proposal to destroy An Foras Talúntais.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has a couple of very important sections.  They have been highlighted by Deputy Gibbons in the amendments he has put down.  There is distinct evidence of empire building by entrenched powers, powers which have shown little respect for what is right or necessary for the agricultural community.  They have their narrow-minded approach which has apparently been approved and ratified by this Government.  We have the politics of envy within the Department of Agriculture.  It has been evident in other Departments on other Bills.  This approach has nothing to do with the best interests of the agricultural community.</P>
      <P>An Foras Talúntais is an organisation that, since brought into operation, has shown tremendous ability and is capable of looking after the best interests of the agricultural industry.  It is highly desirable that the functions of An Foras Talúntais should be separated in all aspects but financial accountability from the civil service. The civil service should be merely an administrative backup.  The Minister's function should be the laying down of general policy.  They should not have virtual control over all aspects of the agricultural services as is envisaged in section 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of An Foras Talúntais and of the advisory service generally is being attacked not because of deficiencies but because of success.  The mentality of envy of success apparently is a hallmark of the present regime.  I am sorry that at this time, when we have so many opportunities in our agricultural life, we should have before us a Bill of this nature.  An Foras Talúntais since their inception have had outstanding success for which they have gained an international <Col N="56" /> reputation.  This is due to so many original ideas and successes at research level for which they have been responsible.  They have the confidence of the farmers and I do not think that on either side of the House there is any doubt about this.  They have this confidence because the farmer knows that when he goes to An Foras Talúntais to discuss a matter with them they will give him a sympathetic and knowledgeable hearing, a hearing which is independent because of the autonomy of An Foras Talúntais.</P>
    <P>What will the situation be if this Bill goes through?  A farmer going to An Foras Talúntais will have a hearing merely from one arm of an executive agency.  No farmer fears that what he tells to an officer of An Foras Talúntais will be used in the future for taxation or any purpose other than the best interest of the farmer himself.  The secret of the success of An Foras Talúntais has been their autonomy, their independence and the confidence they have built up.  It is not a confidence built up by the mere passing of an Act.  It has been built up by the experience of the farmers in their dealings with An Foras Talúntais and by the men who have given many hours of their own time, seeking no reward other than the satisfaction of a job well done.  They got this sense of achievement because they were working as an independent unit, not independent of the farmers but independent on behalf of the farmers.  They had this sense of achievement and satisfaction because they were doing something constructive for the Irish nation.  I am not saying that they are ultra-patriots, because that would be to overstate the case.  They are men who have worked hard because of their commitment to research, because of their education and background.</P>
    <P>All of this goodwill within An Foras Talúntais will be destroyed by this executive agency if the staff of An Foras Talúntais are to be taken under this umbrella of the civil service.  Any calculation of cost/benefit analysis must clearly show that the success of the research of An Foras Talúntais since their inception has been tremendous <Col N="57" /> for the farmers.  To brush away the years of work that the staff have done and to set them up as civil servants, as is suggested in this Bill, would be a retrograde step and I cannot understand the Minister taking it. Debate on agricultural services is a good thing and a very essential thing because of the importance to the nation of agriculture and of the agricultural sector.  But I cannot understand why the Minister, having been involved in this debate on the agricultural services, should have decided to go towards the elimination of An Foras Talúntais and their absorption into this executive agency mentioned in the Bill.  This was not suggested in the White Paper as I understood it. The Minister, as can happen to any Minister after a certain number of years in power, can become involved with the civil service and begin to be manipulated in the kindest sense of the word&mdash;by the civil service around him.  I feel that this is what has happened&mdash;that the Minister has gone in the wrong direction completely and is being swamped and drowned by the sinister forces within his Department who are hellbent on empire building on their own behalf.</P>
    <P>How has this tremendous success been achieved by An Foras Talúntais, the very body that is to be eliminated by this section 7?  It has been achieved through autonomy, particularly autonomy in research.  There was a free hand within the scope of the grant scheme.  The staff were motivated in the right direction.  They were dedicated and as a result of that dedication the output by any standards was phenomenal.  If research is tied up in the civil service structure the phenomenal value gained will be much reduced.  That is what I am afraid of. The motivation which drove them forward with such great strides will be destroyed in the civil service structure. If the Minister does not believe me all he has to do is to consult with the representatives of the staff.  They have proven their interest in the agricultural economy generally and in our farmers. They are not just interested in position for position's sake.  They have worked on behalf of the agricultural industry. <Col N="58" /> To bring them into the civil service structure will be a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>What will become of their autonomy and their research?  Will they be limited by monitoring and sanctioning by the Minister's agents?  Is this what will happen?  Will there be probing meddling by Department of Agriculture officials?  Where will research start?  Where will the probing and the meddling by the Department stop? Exactly what will happen?  Have we any guarantee that the present levels of research and success will be maintained? We have no such guarntee. I believe this is change merely for the sake of change.  An independent unit is being brought in under the umbrella of the Department so that the clammy little mitts of the Department of Agriculture can be put on what has been a very successful unit.  My great fear is there will be a levelling down rather than up, or any improvement in the situation, if there is room for improvement.</P>
    <P>This is another example of the politics of envy.  In this case it is departmental envy.  The staff of An Foras Talúntais were working in the best interests of the country.  What will happen to this staff?  What will happen to their promotional opportunities? What about their ambitions?  Will they be taken into the empire of the Department of Agriculture for the satisfaction of the hierarchy in that Department so that they will be under their control because they do not like to see&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is bringing An Foras Talúntais into the hothouse of civil service bureaucracy <Col N="59" /> where growth will be stultified and initiative will be eliminated.  The staff have worked hard for agriculture and their success is actually their own downfall.  That would appear to be the mentality behind the elimination of An Foras Talúntais under this Bill.  Over the years the staff have studied many problems and found solutions to them. Will the dynamism of approach now be lost?  The staff have never been associated with bureaucracy.  I believe this Bill tolls the deathknell of the record and the performance of An Foras Talúntais.  Should anyone think I am ascribing to the Minister and his agents powers that are not in this Bill then he need only look at section 30 to which we will come later.  The Minister has not taken the right approach here.</P>
      <P>The subject of the advisory services within agriculture needed debate and airing.  Agriculture is our most important industry and obviously there will always be debate on how best to improve the service to farmers.</P>
      <P>The Minister has adopted the wrong approach.  Research programmes are best decided by the members personally concerned.  If this Bill is passed, research on behalf of the farmers will be decided by bureaucracy and by pen-pushing operatives who have nothing to do with research.  There will be little understanding of the possibilities and goals of the research programme involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What kind of situation will exist if research programmes are drawn up by civil servants who are out of touch with what is going on and who may be totally unskilled in the area in which they are making decisions?  It will not be in the best interests of agriculture. The nub of this Bill is the elimination of An Foras Talúntais, transforming them from the progressive organisation they are into a wing of the civil service. It will be a retrograde step for the nation and for farming.  What the Minister is proposing in this section will not further the interests of our farmers.  It will tear down one of the finest institutions established since the foundation of the State.  An Foras Talúntais have proved themselves by <Col N="60" /> their autonomy but the Minister is proposing to tear down that organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>At one time I spoke about the amalgamation of education and research but I shall now give the Minister my reason for supporting the amendment.  An Foras Talúntais have done an excellent job for the country. What is contained in this Bill is completely contrary to the White Paper. The new board will be under control of the Minister and nothing can be done without consultation with him.  It is a tragedy that an autonomous organisation who have been doing a good job will be abolished and brought under the new structure as proposed now.  For many years I have had my own opinions about research and education: in my opinion they should be together in an autonomous body such as the Agricultural Institute.  My main reason for opposing the section is that we are abolishing an autonomous body who were doing an excellent job in research and we are putting them into an organisation that will be under the control of the Department. If the Minister were in opposition he would agree with what I have said.</P>
      <P>There is no need for me to repeat the points put forward by Deputies Gibbons and Burke.  I do not think the new board will have any autonomy. When I consider the matter I am suspicious why some of the important people on the board are so agreeable to come into the new structure.  I have a fair idea that a couple of positions have been given away already.  I cannot understand why an autonomous organisation who were doing good work should agree to dissolve themselves. I realise they will have no option if this Bill becomes law but I wonder why more people in high places have not protested about this section. As I have pointed out, I have personal views about education and research combining together in an autonomous body, as happened in the board that carried out research for the farmers.  I have stated my reason for opposing this section; I shall have a lot to say about other sections later in the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>As previous speakers on this side of the House have pointed <Col N="61" /> out, the reason we are opposing this section deals with the question of autonomy.  We are totally opposed to the Minister's proposal to put the board under the control of the Department and himself.  Throughout all the sections of the Bill the phrase &ldquo;subject to the control of the Minister for Agriculture&rdquo; is used.</P>
      <P>In the past the Agricultural Institute had a completely free rein.  There was no departmental control.  It is now proposed to withdraw the autonomy the institute have enjoyed since 1958 and to put them under the control of the new authority.  The latter will be subject to the control of the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for the Public Service and the Minister for Finance.  The new structure will be tied up in red tape.  The liaison which existed between the advisers and, more particularly, the liaison that existed between the farming community and the Agricultural Institute will be completely submerged in the new body which will be comprised of political hacks of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be aware of the unease this is causing to the farming community because of the statements made by the major farming organisations, the IFA, the ICMSA and Macra na Feirme with regard to the submerging of the Agricultural Institute under this new authority.  There is also considerable unease among the staff of the Agricultural Institute and among the advisory service of the various county committees.  They now realise that the close attachment which existed between the advisory service and the staff of the Agricultural Institute will exist no longer.  This will put Irish agriculture back many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several public statements have been issued by the different farming organisations, the organisations which represent the advisory service and the staff of the Agricultural Institute, that they will now be subjected to a delay and bureaucracy from the Minister for Agriculture and the other Ministers who will make the decisions regarding the working of this new authority. This will adversely affect the work of the Agricultural Institute and will also affect the advancement of agriculture. <Col N="62" /> At the moment the liaison with the county committees of agriculture and the advisory service is excellent but I am afraid that in the future this will not exist.</P>
    <P>Research should be independent of ministerial control as it has been since the establishment of the Agricultural Institute.  The Jones Davis Report, entitled <i>A Review of Irish Agriculture Advisory Services,</i> October, 1967, advised against linking the Agricultural Institute with the agricultural advisory services.  The Minister should consider this carefully if he has any interest in the development of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the farmers' confidence in the Agricultural Institute since they were established. Farmers will not have the same confidence in the Agricultural Institute when they are submerged in this new body.  I appeal to the Minister to have another think about this section and to allow the Agricultural Institute to continue as they have been for many years.  He should allow the institute to continue to give the service they have given to the farming community over the years.  If the Minister withdrew this section from the Bill he would be doing something worth while for agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to support our spokesman on Agriculture in asking the Minister to withdraw this section.  It is obvious to everybody that the Agricultural Institute have given tremendous service to farmers and to Irish agriculture generally.  The great strides made in promoting new ideas and new techniques are well known to all farmers.  Many a young farmer was launched into his chosen career by the advice available to him from the Agricultural Institute.  This was one of the most useful bodies ever set up to help the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The research carried out by the Agricultural Institute has benefited every farmer who sought their advice, from the dairy farmer to the tillage farmer, the farmer engaged in erecting new buildings or the man who wanted advice about purchasing new machinery.  It is a real body blow to <Col N="63" /> agriculture that the institute are now losing their autonomy.  The services of this institute will now be submerged in the new monster created by the Minister.  This cannot be seen as a step forward for agriculture.  I believe it is a retrograde step, as far as agriculture is concerned, to abolish the Agricultural Institute.  When new techniques are being put forward every day, when farming methods are changing daily, it is imperative that our farmers have the advice of a body like the Agricultural Institute.  If our farmers are expected to keep in step with the other farmers in the Community it is absolutely essential that they have available to them the very best service from people like those in the Agricultural Institute.  It is a sad day for our farmers to see the institute being abolished.  I appeal to the Minister to have a second think on this section.</P>

      <P>While I can readily understand Deputy Gibbons' views on the transfer of the Agricultural Institute to the authority being set up under this Bill I hope he will not oppose the Bill on this basis.  I accept that he holds those views very strongly but I am as fully convinced of the correctness of the course of action I am taking.  I am putting the research services into the authority, side by side with the education and advisory services, because nothing gives the same amount of stimulation as research, and I want this stimulation to be as close as possible to the other services. I want to create an overall integrated service with willing teamwork between all the agencies concerned.  I want to remove whatever barriers or lines of demarcation that may exist between them.  I am conscious that research results are not applied on as many farms as I would like or as quickly as I would like them to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agricultural Institute is concerned mainly with applied research and it tackles practical problems of interest to different branches of the industry. It is also involved in development work of various kinds.  The organisation which has been established will provide the present institute staff, together with the staffs of the <Col N="64" /> other services which are being transferred, with a more effective means of promoting the well-being of our agricultural industry than at present existing through those services working more or less independently or in isolation.  In this integrated organisation they will be every bit as free to carry out their work as they have been in the past.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for correcting the inferences that have been made, that in some way I have been pushed into this course of action of including An Foras Talúntais in this integrated organisation which we are endeavouring to set up.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  If there is envy in the Department of Agriculture, I have not been aware of it.  I have never seen any signs of it and since I have gone into the Department of Agriculture I see people from the institute coming in and out of that Department every day and there is the greatest measure of co-operation between An Foras Talúntais and the services operated by my Department.  The research services being carried out by the Department are also being transferred to this body.</P>
    <P>An Foras Talúntais has been greatly praised here and I agree with all the praise that has been showered on this organisation.  Nobody has a higher appreciation of their work than I have.  I want to give them a more effective means of doing their work and of getting their work accepted by the people for whom it is intended.  I cannot understand when Deputies on the opposite side of the House say that I am taking the autonomy away from these people.  In previous years and up to the present An Foras came to me and to the Minister for Finance in relation to their programme and they have had to get agreement on whatever money kept them going through that period.  We hear Deputies talking about their operating on an independent grant previously and up until now.  Where did this independent grant come from?  They got £100,000 from the American fund and practically £5 million from the State. Where was the independent grant that is being talked of?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="65" /> Deputy Burke says there was no question of the Agricultural Institute being brought into this integrated group in the White Paper.  Obviously, the man did not read the White Paper and does not know what he is talking about in relation to this.  They have to come to us in relation to their programme. They have to come to the Minister for Agriculture and they must come to the Minister for Finance as they have always done in relation to the sort of money they want for their programme.  What is wrong with this? Should we have an agricultural policy or not in this country?  Should we not know what the Agricultural Institute is doing with the money it is getting from the State?  It is perfectly correct that we should know and that the Minister for Agriculture should know no matter who is in this job.  It would be wrong if the Minister did not know. I said on Second Reading and at various times that once the decision is made about the money that they get they are free to operate after that and nobody will interfere with the day to day work of the institute.  We are getting all these services out of the Department of Agriculture and still we are supposed to be putting the dead hand of the civil service on this, morning, noon and night, as if the civil service was going to kill everything it touched.  I cannot understand or accept what all this is about.  Agricultural research in two countries that are the envy of Europe is directly under the Ministry of Agriculture, that is, Holland and New Zealand.  It does not pine away and die and become useless because this is so.  We have not put it under the civil service.  We are putting it out under a body of people who are going to be elected mainly by the rural organisations of this country who are close to and are concerned with farming. Somehow the case is being made that now we are bringing it in to get the civil service to kill it.  I do not accept the case that is being made for this amendment.  I ask the Ceann Comhairle and the House to confirm section 7 as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been trying to justify something that is unjustifiable and in the process has <Col N="66" /> got himself more embroiled in the toils of his own unsustainable argument. The Minister says that nothing has really changed and that An Foras Talúntais are just as independent as they ever were.  The Minister also said that he is second to nobody in appreciating the work they have done for Irish agriculture and that their position is virtually unchanged by the provisions of section 7.  If that is the case, why include it in the Bill at all?  If the Minister turns to section 19 of the Bill, he will discover that he is the one for whom the new service must prepare a list of research activities for the perusal of the Minister and presumably his board.</P>
      <P>The Agricultural Institute as we know it had developed a complete ethos of agricultural research.  Every farmer in the country knew it.  It is plain to be seen that some of the civil servants in the Department of Agriculture did not know it.  The thing was working beautifully and they had established centres in many parts of the country, including my own constituency. Like any living thing it had taken on an identity and an existence of its own for the benefit of Irish farmers.  Every man in this House who has any association with agriculture knows that this is so.  Every member who spoke from my party who has associations with agriculture knows this.  It is remarkable that the Minister's party does not seem to have any interest at all in this vital Bill as evidenced by the fact that there is no representative of the Fine Gael Party here except the Minister.  The Minister puts up a specious argument about the new integrated service, revealing his own lack of philosophy on the whole question.  This sticks out from the Minister's Bill from beginning to end, the failure to understand the basic needs of the Irish farmer.  What we are talking about now is research. There are other provisions in the Bill which we shall discuss in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister admits that we have a fine research service which has done a very good job.  It has a brilliant international reputation as a research organisation.  Does the Minister really believe it is necessary to kill it in its <Col N="67" /> present existence and then introduce it to a new bondage, to be administered by people unfamiliar with the ethos of research, people who have no grasp of the modern requirements of the agriculture industry and of farmers?  That is true of a great many people who will be involved in the administration of this new service.  The Minister is ignoring all that.  His attitude is that he does not care if the concept of the basic research, the growing, living, flourishing organism that we built up over the last 19 years, is destroyed and replaced by a slave of a thing, something brought into artificial bondage and hitched, on apparently equal terms, to other considerations like the advisory service and the educational content of the new service as well.</P>
    <P>There is a very serious breakdown in basic thinking there.  You said, Sir, that we must ascribe all things to the Minister.  On that basis we will ascribe the failure to the Minister.  I think the Minister knows enough about farming to know, especially in our conditions, with our weak agriculture, with our comparatively poor milk production, our comparatively poor land use, that we above any other country in the community need to have a really free and effective agricultural research organisation, and now we are going to destroy it.  Will the Minister not agree that this is so?  I know it is so. I am in the industry myself and I know what my colleagues in the industry with me think.  They are afraid of this and regret it, and in spite of the very great effort that was made by interested people in the media world to smooth over the anxiety of the farmers generally, it is beginning to bubble up now rather late in the day.  Journals which, according to themselves, are fearlessly on the farmers' side were very much missing when the interests of the farmers were being sabotaged by this Bill.  That is not anything to be wondered at either, and it will be something to be wondered at less before this Bill goes through the House.</P>

      <P>I have very little more to say about this except I simply cannot <Col N="68" /> understand Deputy Gibbons when he says that this new organisation is to be administered by people unfamiliar with the interests of research. Who is he talking about?  Who is running the present institute?  Are they familiar with those interests and in what way are they going to be different from the people we propose to run the board of the new authority?  What has been said does not make sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to the appeals being made from this side of the House to the Minister to have a re-think in this regard. For some reason the Minister has become heated arising from the remarks that have been made from this side of the House.  I myself have been hearing on the car radio and reading in the papers reports about the reaction from within the institute itself.  I suppose one can say those people have a vested interest in looking after themselves, but our experience down through the years has been one of a tremendous build-up of very good relationships between the farming community and the institute.  The Minister is going out of his way to react maybe in a predictable manner by conveying there will be no change in the status of the institute under this new authority that he is creating.  He may wax as eloquent as he likes in this connection, but we must accept that the people involved in the institute who are fearful of the outcome of this need to be reassured also.  I do not think there is anything the Minister has said today which will reassure them in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that up to now the institute have been very dependent upon Government handouts.  They have, but so also have a good number of other State-sponsored bodies, and those bodies are always mindful of the fact that while they are dependent upon Government subventions they are autonomous.  Two bodies with whom I have had the closest contact, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the IDA, are both completely dependent upon Government money but they have always been looked upon as autonomous.  In the discussion on the Bula Bill we <Col N="69" /> found that the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards were being used by an outside firm to extract more money from the Minister.  They were as autonomous as that.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister for Agriculture in this instance claim that this new body will be as free as that, despite what is involved in section 16 of this Bill whereby the authority has to work in close liaison with the Minister and other agencies?  My colleague, Deputy Gibbons, talked about the absence of Fine Gael back-up for the Minister in this regard.  I have been surprised that there has been no contribution at all from the Labour side of the Coalition movement here, because it is the Labour people who have been traditionally talking about nationalisation. As I see it, the Agricultural Institute represents the nationalisation of an advisory service to farmers.  I know the Labour Party are committed to putting the farmers out of business, but there will be a certain number of them paying lip service in the coming election to the interests of the small farmers.  It is here in the House today that we could expect contributions from those people thereby backing up the Agricultural Institute who have done so much for this State over a period and which the Minister is so surprisingly determined to gut.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the Minister's reply to the submissions made from this side of the House for the deletion of section 7.  The Minister's contribution so far has been justification of the fact that he is merely technically changing the name and not in any way changing the status of the Agricultural Institute, which does not impress me. My qualification for speaking on this subject&mdash;not being a farmer&mdash;is the fact that for a period I acted as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  During that time I became conscious of a certain amount of friction between the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries officially and the Agricultural Institute.  It is with that sort of background knowledge that I become worried about the re-embracing of the institute&mdash;or whatever it is to be freshly named&mdash;in the Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="70" /> There is no doubt that built into this Bill, there is more constraint on the new authority than there was on the Agricultural Institute under the former Act.  It is in that respect that we, on this side of the House, have a responsibility, not in defence of the Institute because, as it has operated so far, it does not warrant any defence.  I cannot imagine any agricultural organisation or body set up to liaise with farmers which could have done a better job. Despite the Minister's obvious commitment to doing away with it, I would ask him to re-examine his decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not that Deputy Lalor in any way taunts me but I find a peculiar illogicality in Deputy Gibbons' amendment.  I have the greatest regard for Deputy Gibbons' views on agricultural research, education and advisory services though he and I would differ sharply on other aspects such as farm incomes, taxation and so on not being discussed today.  The illogicality of Deputy Gibbons' position is that basically he, like myself and the Minister, would favour the rationalisation and integration of educational research and advisory services.  Nobody in the House would particularly disagree with the overall concept of and need for such rationalisation.  Unfortunately, his amendment stands the proposition on its head by removing the Agricultural Institute once again from that concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What particularly surprised me in relation to the Opposition's approach to the Bill is that I would have thought&mdash;and far be it from me to impose my views on the farming community; my advocacy of something is more likely to have the reverse effect&mdash;it would have been entirely logical, bearing in mind the outstanding development of An Foras Talúntais over a 20 year period, that one should have codified the Agricultural Act in relation to the committees of agriculture.  Likewise, I should have thought the Civil Service Relations Act should have been codified in relation to staff being transferred from the Department of Agriculture to the new authority, thereby having an expanded <Col N="71" /> Agricultural Institute.  I am of the view &mdash;this is very much a personal opinion &mdash;that one of the tragic failures of the previous Administration; was their omission dramatically to revise the statutes under which the Agricultural Institute was established and their failure to develop their scope and functions.  That constituted a tragedy in terms of agricultural development. Throughout the country I know of many persons working for committees of agriculture, particularly in the advisory services, who, integrated with the staff of An Foras Talúntais, would have been happier people in many respects, people who would have felt they could have made a greater contribution and who would have had a relative degree&mdash;I do not like the word &ldquo;independence&rdquo;&mdash;of autonomy from the public service, having a more flexible relationship with the Department of Agriculture as such.  Perhaps it is now past history.</P>
    <P>I do not see the logic of Deputy Gibbons' amendment because it would merely refragment what the Minister is attempting to integrate.  While I might not necessarily share the Government's or the Minister's views on the process of integration&mdash;and I shall have quite a lot to say on this later in relation to sections 32, 33 and 34&mdash; I do feel Deputy Gibbons could have put forward a more constructive, original approach to the Bill.  Perhaps the Opposition could have done so, perhaps with some mutual agreement in the House because there was not very much debate on the White Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we would not now be in this situation in which the Minister cannot accept the Opposition's amendment when, of course, everybody has to take up classical positions, resulting in a non-productive discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many reasonable and fair-minded observers of the tremendous contribution made to our economy, in terms of agricultural research, education and the advisory services who would see justification for having them <Col N="72" /> integrated and properly fused together. Perhaps we are over-integrating, over-fusing and over-rationalising it right into the heart of the public service.  In the process we may have lost the prospect of an integration that could be radically different from that which we are now setting about.  For that reason I could not support Deputy Gibbons' amendment to delete section 7.  That would merely revert to the <i>status quo</i> and, God knows, when he was Minister we were slow enough getting away with that.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister two questions?  Under section 20 of the 1958 Act, An Foras Talúntais were obliged to issue an annual report.  Will this practice be discontinued when the new authority is set up?  The Minister must be aware that voluntary contributions were made by various bodies over the years to An Foras Talúntais.  I notice that at the end of 1974 they acknowledged contributions from approximately 100 companies. Would the Minister not consider that the new authority will discourage companies from making voluntary contributions towards research?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall answer the last question first.  There is special provision in the Bill to permit such bodies making contributions to the authority, to the institute, as heretofore.  About the report, I could not imagine any authority stopping the institute or An Foras Talúntais from producing an annual report.  That will be entirely a matter for the board who will run this authority.  It will not be for me to say they should or must produce a separate report on their work, but I am sure they will.</P>

      <P>Eventually after the speech made by Deputy Lalor we had a contribution from a Member from the Government side of the House other than the Minister.  Deputy Desmond spoke on behalf of the Labour Party and I should hate to tag <Col N="73" /> the rest of the Labour Party with his contribution.  Because he was the only Member who spoke on behalf of the Labour Party, we can only assume he reflected their views.  To say it was a typical Pontius Pilate speech by Deputy Desmond&mdash;and I am sorry he has left the House&mdash;is an understatement.  His approach was: &ldquo;We agree with what Fianna Fáil are saying.  We agree with their amendment.  We agree An Foras Talúntais should not be interfered with.  At the same time we should not disturb the Minister at this stage.  It is in the Bill now and we will let it go through.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He supported the Fianna Fáil case. He was trying to have it both ways. He is an Assistant Whip who will be a teller when this issue comes to a vote. He is trying to ride two horses by supporting the Fianna Fáil case and the good work of the staff of An Foras Talúntais while, at the same time, hiding behind the Minister's coat tails in case he might disturb his colleague in his constituency, the Taoiseach, and somewhere along the line he might lose a third or fourth preference vote. He is trying to ride two horses and do his usual Pontius Pilate act.  Let him stand up and say he is supporting us on behalf of An Foras Talúntais or not stand up at all.</P>

I assumed that the <Col N="74" /> inquiry was whether the institute would produce a separate report and the answer I gave to that was correct. Under section 52 of this Bill there is the same obligation on An Foras Talúntais as there is under the Act setting up that body to produce a report to the Minister as soon as conveniently possible.  That same obligation is on the new authority to produce a similar report.</P>

      <P>Listening to the Minister, I have been convinced that the amendment put down by Deputy Gibbons to oppose the section is correct. The Minister has not convinced me as to why the institute should be submerged.  He felt the advisory and research sections should be under the one authority in order that the results would be available more easily.  I know of no occasion when there was a holdup in the conveying of the results of research by the Agricultural Institute to the advisory service.  The Minister's argument falls very flat.</P>
      <P>The Minister is evading the issue.  He has not replied to our cogent and coherent arguments.  He has stated that there is no difference.  Deputy Gibbons rightly asked why have the section in the Bill at all.  Heretofore the Agricultural Institute met the Minister and his staff to discuss policy, but their policy did not have to be approved by the Minister.  That is the great difference between what happened in the past and what is being incorporated in this Bill.  The work of the Agricultural Institute now has to be approved by the Minister.  Deputy Lalor spoke about the friction between the staff of the Department and the staff of the institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the White Paper published in April, 1975, it was stated that An Foras Talúntais was already an <Col N="75" /> autonomous organisation established in 1958 to review, facilitate, encourage, assist, co-ordinate, promote and undertake agricultural research.  It was held at that time that agricultural research should be detached from the Department of Agriculture so that research could be initiated in any area of agriculture without fear of being hindered or prevented from doing so by departmental or other pressures.  The White Paper went on to say it also became clear that a great need in agriculture was to get existing knowledge applied in the solution of problems of under-production, processing and marketing. That is as true today as it was in 1958. This section is taking away this initiative, this power, this autonomy from the Agricultural Institute.</P>

      <P>The Minister told us there was no difference.  There is no difference about the provision of money but the crucial point is once the institute got the money from the Minister they were completely free.  Deputy Desmond almost said we were right. He was in favour of amalgamation up to a point.  He as much as said we are right.  As Deputy Noonan pointed out, when the Agricultural Institute were established they were free agents, although they had to go to the Department for money.  This authority will not be free.</P>

      <P>No, they will not. This is the big point at issue.  This authority will be subject to the Minister. <Col N="76" /> The Agricultural Institute are free while this authority are not.  This is the kernel of our Opposition to this Bill.  I am surprised there are not more Deputies on the Fine Gael benches to speak on this because every farmer, no matter which party he supports, wants an independent body.  We all realise that this body must go to the Department for money and naturally they cannot squander it, but it should not be necessary for them to go to the Department, hat in hand, every day for money.  This is written into several sections, approved by the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We will be coming to them section by section.  I do not want to leave section 7 but right through the Bill there are phrases like, &ldquo;subject to the Minister&rdquo;, &ldquo;in consultation with the Minister&rdquo; used in connection with small items.  Neither the Agricultural Institute nor the advisers want to be directly under the authority of the Department.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the services in other countries which were directly under the authority of agricultural departments.  I can assure him that this will never be accepted by farming organisations and particularly by educational organisations.  Down through the years, no matter which Government were in power, I fought for a certain amount of autonomy for the people involved in educational research. That is being taken out of this Bill.  This is the kernel of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the extraordinary inelegant title he proposes to give to the new organisation. Needless to say, we strongly object to the impending destruction of the existing organisation but I suggest that the wording of the title of the new body, the National Agricultural Advisory, Education and Research Authority, be changed by the substitution of the word &ldquo;Training&rdquo; for &ldquo;Education&rdquo;. This would be the Minister's intention, at least I hope so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand training to be more confined than education which is a general preparation which should be afforded to all young men and women, more or less regardless of what careers they will follow afterwards.  Implicit in this title is a basic weakness in the Minister's thinking in that he tends to regard farmers as some type of aborigines who need to be specially trained in rudimentary facts and who labour under a condition of enlightenment that the Minister seems to consider a great deal less than the enlightenment of other members of the community.  If this were not the case surely the educational facilities that are in existence already for the community ought also to be available to the young people going into agriculture. <Col N="79" /> What the Minister is after is really specialised training, afterwards education.  You do not call the type of training that a soldier gets military education unless he is an officer and goes to a staff college.  Similarly, the specialised training that one might get in an agricultural college like Kildalton, Ballyhaise or Athenry, in specialised things like machinery maintenance, is not called education.  That is training.  For the sake of accuracy and also as a matter of good manners and courtesy to the agricultural population, I suggest to the Minister to delete this implication that it is necessary to educate them.  I accept that they have reached a level of education just as anybody else has, but say that they need specialised training in certain areas, and when you mean &ldquo;training&rdquo; say &ldquo;training&rdquo; in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not know why Deputy Gibbons always sees fit to impute extraordinary motives to what I am doing.  Why should I want to reflect on farming or farmers?  Why should I want to reflect on a section of the community that I am so responsible for and which I come from and was brought up and educated among?  I do not like the title particularly because it has to be so long and unwieldy but it is necessary if we are to describe the various elements in this integrated authority.  I do not agree with Deputy Gibbons when he says that students in an agricultural college get no education, they get nothing but training.  He is drawing a very fine distinction. I was at two agricultural colleges in my time and I got both education and training.  There is nothing inconsistent in describing it as education because in my view education includes training.  While I am in no way wed to the name it seems to me the only appropriate name that we could give it if it is to describe the various agencies being integrated into a national authority.</P>

      <Col N="80" /> SECTION 10.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 10 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing this section.  Section 10 is very short. There are only five words in it.  They are five of the saddest words that have been incorporated in legislation about agriculture in this House for a long time.  Section 10 says:</P>
      <P>The Institute is hereby dissolved.</P>
      <P>The Minister will probably remember that the Emperor Bonaparte's police minister, Fouché, said after a political murder that it was worse than a crime, it was a mistake.  The dissolution of the institute is quite certainly a crime.  It is effected through the passage of section 10 of the Minister's Bill.  It is also a mistake because in our position in the European Community we are more dependent on farming than any other nation in the Community.  It is more vital to us that the research mechanism that we have working for us as a nation&mdash;not simply for the farming part of the nation&mdash;is of the very best kind.  The mute, stupid jackboots that will come in through those doors in due course wherever they are now&mdash; and there is not a single one in the House at present&mdash;will come to bulldoze the Minister's Bill through the House.  They will do their country and its agriculture very serious and possibly permanent damage.  The permanency of it will be taken care of because as sure as the Agricultural Institute is destroyed by the Coalition Government a better Government will have to restore it.  In the context of the inescapable fact that a responsible Government must restore the proper establishment for agricultural research, I appeal to the Minister not to create a jigsaw, an unstable situation created by this wanton destruction of one of the finest agricultural research establishments in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fear&mdash;and this fear is shared by other informed people&mdash;that this thing is being done for unworthy reasons. If the reasons were merely political and base for that reason only it would be bad enough, but there is something further.  There is something even baser <Col N="81" /> than that and it is a great shame.  It is the greatest insult to all the fine men and women in the Agricultural Institute who have given of their superior training a superior dedication to their country and to their discipline and given unstintingly.  The gratitude of the nation and of the Government is to dissolve the establishment in which they work.</P>
    <P>The only thing that offers hope to us all, to the institute and to people like myself in the farming industry is the fact that this need not be a permanent arrangement.  We cannot afford this patchwork arrangement proposed in this Bill.  In one sense the amendment is a futility because you cannot amend something so stupid and so woodenly conceived by unimaginative people because you only end up with a botch-up which is neither one thing nor the other.</P>
    <P>We have all conceded that the advisory services need to be revised and improved.  These services since the Minister took charge have deteriorated very rapidly and there is no reason to believe that deterioration will now cease.  On the contrary, with the dissolution of the institute the general deterioration of the agricultural services will accelerate.  When you deliberately set out to destroy the good bits how can you hope that the bad bits and the indifferent bits will do anything but deteriorate further?</P>
    <P>Section 10 smacks of dictatorship, of the jackboot and the bullet.  It is reminiscent of the old Blue Shirt mentality.  It says the institute is hereby dissolved.  What it does not say, but clearly implies, is that anybody who does not like it can lump it.  We do not like it.  I do not think the people in rural Ireland like it.  I do not think anybody with any interest in the development of the resources we have could possibly like it.  According to the Bill, we are jolly well going to like it so there is quite definitely an echo of the 'thirties there.  We can see the old Sam Browne belts and the Blue Shirts and the Nazi salutes behind section 10. I can barely remember those days.  But there is no need for total despair because we will have another and a better government and we will restore the country's agricultural research.  Meantime <Col N="82" /> the country will be put to enormous and unnecessary expense because of the Minister's arrogance which shines out of every word in these five words in section 10.</P>
    <P>Speaking as one who comes from the land, with a fairly intimate knowledge of the institute, I must personally express my gratitude to them for the services they have given me and people like me and, if we can repair the damage being done to them by the Government, we assuredly will.  I do not know if there is any purpose in appealing at this late stage to the Minister. He has accepted what the machine has produced.  It can truly be called a dog's dinner, the mixture as before only more of it.  Pay off a few old scores and destroy anything of value. Bring in the pals and give them jobs and you will have a bigger political machine in the next election and more people under obligation.  That is what the Minister thinks of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be able to handle the publicity end of it all right.  The media are fully muzzled by now.  The Minister need not worry about that. Certainly he need not worry about Telefís Éireann or Radio Éireann. But that does not change the fact one damn bit that this is the dissolution of a worthy organisation, a splendid organisation that brought credit to the country, and its replacement by a machine for putting people under an obligation so that they will be of value to the Government in political campaigns. I do not think I am overstating it because the man in the street will tell you who is going to be the chairman and the director and he will give you the names of the people who are almost certain to be on the board. They do not even have to look at the tawdry disgraceful record of Cosgrave and his Government in the matter of political patronage to know this is going to be another mechanism for the distribution of patronage.  There never was in this country since the last old Cumann na nGaedheal Government such a disgraceful display of patronage as has taken place under Cosgrave and his present Government.  Now Irish agriculture is being dragged into this slime.</P>

While the wording of this section might be considered somewhat harsh, it is dictated by legal requirements.  I hoped it would not be necessary to put it in this way, but we are setting up an integrated organisation and, when doing so, one has first of all to dissolve the existing organisation.  Rather than emphasise the negative aspect I would prefer to stress the positive side of this section.  The institute is being integrated into a larger organisation where it will have greater scope in achieving its objective of promoting the further development of the agricultural industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very sad to see an institute set up as an independent body to advise on agriculture being wiped out of existence, put into one unwieldy unit and deprived of its independence.  It will lose its identity. The work of the institute was known the world over.  Come down to Grange in my constituency, go over to Lullymore, Carbury and Rathangan to see the work done by this institute. The money that established the Agricultural Institute came from America with the specific objective that they would be independent in their research. However, if this Bill is passed the institute will be integrated with the Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The personnel of the advisory services valued the independence of the institute.  They could express their views without worrying about whether they were in accord with Government policy but this situation will not obtain in the new board.  To give an example, if a committee of agriculture want to appoint a secretary they may not be able to do so because of the current ruling that new posts may not be created.  We do not want research to be hindered in this way.  We should give them their allocation each year and let the director work out what is needed.  An Foras Talúntais have considered every aspect of farming and have done valuable work.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that quite a few eminent people in agriculture have left the institute and have taken up other posts in societies dealing with animals and so on and this has been very disheartening. Their reason for leaving the institute was their fear that they would be taken over by a big unit where they would have no say or influence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the old institute all sections of farming had the right to nominate or elect a person to the board but now the Minister will have complete control. We know what is likely to happen.  Friends of his will be appointed and they will be subject to whatever he dictates.  Independent <Col N="85" /> research will be scrapped if this is what the Minister wants.  Rural domestic economy schools consider they should have somebody on the board.  In the old institute certain groups had a chance of being elected at some stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to point out the concern of various people about this matter.  Most of the farming community are disturbed because the institute will lose their independence. In the past the staff of the institute had complete autonomy but they worked hand-in-hand with the Department of Agriculture.  I do not see the reason for integrating them with the Department.  They have given good service to all sectors of agriculture and they were free to accept money for carrying out research.  If a firm wanted research carried out and if they did not have the staff to do this work they could ask the institute to carry it out for them.  We need an independent body to do research work for farmers and for agriculture generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleagues who are opposing section 10. Deputy Crinion has pointed out that the institute have done a very good job.  This was possible because they were an independent body but I do not think that the new body will have this independence.  They will be under the control of the Department and this will not benefit the farmers or agriculture generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It raises a doubt whether this Government are concerned about farming. Their record is not good.  The Minister tells us that we must abolish the <Col N="86" /> institute before the new body is set up but in that interim period research work will suffer.  At this period in our history research is most important and farmers have been influenced by An Foras Talúntais so far as their farming work is concerned.  They have brought out papers on almost every aspect of farming which are guidelines for most of our farmers.  I believe that when a body lose that type of independence their work is restricted.  The Minister said that a larger organisation would be more effective but I find it very hard to see how he can sustain that argument.  When organisations become large it is not to the benefit of the State or the community they serve.</P>
    <P>I believe the institute did a very good job and that their work is required in the future.  I do not believe the institute will be as effective when they are integrated with the Department of Agriculture.  I believe they will lose their independence and that agriculture will suffer greatly.  This is one of the many knocks agriculture has got since this Government took office.  Agriculture needs all the assistance possible at the moment.  I join with my colleagues in opposing this section.</P>

      <P>The Minister amazed me when he stated, in reply to Deputy Gibbons, that neither farming organisations nor any other associations have issued statements about their opposition to this Bill, particularly this section. The Minister must not have read the newspapers about this.  Farming organisations, in particular, have issued statements about their fears when the Agricultural Institute are abolished. The institute are being merged into this great big body, where, the Minister states, there will be greater scope. He will certainly have greater scope in regard to their deliberations, functions and work as far as research is concerned. If the Minister is talking about his own scope the abolition of the Agricultural Institute is a sad day for the development of agricultural research. Since the Agricultural Institute were established in 1958 they have built up a reputation inside and outside the country in regard to research, their various documents and particularly their personnel.</P>

      <P>It refers to the dissolving of the institute.  Will we regain under the new authority what will be lost by the abolition of the Agricultural Institute?  I believe we will not. I feel that in An Foras Talúntais we have people with specialised research training and people who have experience with research in other countries.  I feel in the future that the scope for research workers will not be there.  When An Foras Talúntais are abolished we will have the new authority taking over their functions which will be subject to the approval of the Minister for Agriculture.  That is bad enough, but they must also have the approval of the Minister for the Public Service and the Minister for Finance.  The autonomy as we know it will be gone.</P>

      <P>A number of Deputies opposite have been making the point that we have been robbing the institute of their independence.  It is not relevant on this section, but at least two Deputies referred to the wonderful way the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards worked because of this great independence and it was not required to do anything&mdash;it banged away on its own.  Section 18 of the Industrial Research and Standards Act says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Institute shall carry out such researches, including researches on a laboratory or on a pilot plant scale, and such investigations, tests and analyses as the Minister may, after consultation with the Board, <Col N="89" /> request, and may, in addition, carry out such researches as aforesaid and such investigations, tests and analyses as the Board may from time to time think proper.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 23, to delete &ldquo;and research&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have been underlining that the inclusion in this new compendium organisation of agricultural research is a fundamental error.  That can readily be appreciated by people within the industry, and we would accept that it is more difficult for people, such as those who framed the Bill, from outside the industry to appreciate this point.  Section 11 includes a reference to the allocation of the general functions of the authority and speaks of advisory and research services.  I would strongly urge the Minister, even at this very late stage, to delete the research content in section 11.</P>

      <P>This section is the same as those dealing with research. This authority will take over the running of the educational courses under Directive No. 161 now being run by the committees of agriculture. The county committees of agriculture can advise on what type of courses should be run out but they will have no authority over the running of the courses as they would wish to see them run.

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 15.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 15 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a couple of questions referring, in particular to subsection (b) at lines 31 and 32 which read:</P>
      <P>take steps to encourage, through co-operative effort and otherwise...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would elaborate <Col N="94" /> somewhat on the intention of that subsection.  It is a great many people's conviction&mdash;I dare say that of the Minister also&mdash;that the way forward in Irish farming is through co-operative effort.  I note that the words &ldquo;co-operative effort&rdquo; are used in this subsection.  It is to be hoped that the Minister's intention here is to have some positive proposals for the development and improvement of the co-operative system in agriculture as we have it at present.  The inadequacies of the co-operative effort in agriculture at the present have been painfully revealed to everybody concerned.  It would be very much welcomed if, in this section, some new and positive proposals were being put forward by the Minister in this regard. If that is the case, it has not been made clear in this or any subsequent section that I can see.</P>
    <P>Subsection (e) reads:</P>
    <P>arrange for the conduct of field and livestock experiments and demonstrations;</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would tell us what is his estimation of the type of field and livestock experiments contemplated here.  It seems to me that it overlaps to some degree on the diminished research role envisaged in the Bill for what used to be the institute and which is now to be attenuated into some part of the new service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing new in this.  Under the present scheme of instruction in the county committees of agriculture the advisers have an obligation to encourage co-operative effort. They have the obligation to do all of the things outlined here.  We are simply saying that this will become the responsibility of the new authority.  It is merely a transfer of functions to the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the whole of this section is like the chemist's prescription, the mixture as before.  It is the acceptance of the proposition that the old advisory services we have known over the decades, and whose improvement we have recognised to be a necessity, will be carried <Col N="95" /> on under this section just as if nothing had happened, except for one thing, that they now incorporate the remnants, the dead body of the Agricultural Institute.</P>
      <P>Possibly I misunderstand the use of the words, but in paragraph (b) there is a reference to &ldquo;co-operative effort and otherwise&rdquo;.  I thought that possibly might mean a new recognition and a new emphasis would be given to the need for the reconstruction and the rebuilding of co-operative efforts in farming which would be catered for under this section.  If this is so, what are the new measures which are contemplated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea behind the integration of the services, the teaching, the advisory, the research services, is to get team work and co-operation between all the agencies to provide a better service for farmers.  The things which are listed here are already supposed to be done by the advisory services. We only hope that, as a result of the reorganisation of the services, they will be done better in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is well aware that a good many committees of agriculture are unable to expand their advisory services at present. Does he envisage that, under this section or any other section of the Bill, that situation will cease and an adequate and full advisory service will be provided in all the counties who want to expand their advisory services or, if the contrary is the case, will the Minister say so?  Will the old situation continue and, in spite of the demands of the implementation of the EEC directives on the advisers' time, the staff will not be expanded and, as a result, the type of service will actually shrink and diminish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The staffing of the new authority will be a matter for the board of the authority.  They will make the decisions as to the sort of staff and the numbers of staff they will require to do an efficient job.  They will have that freedom.  That is what it is all about&mdash;the provision of a <Col N="96" /> first-class service, the best service it is possible to provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister let the cat out of the bag as he sat down &mdash;the best service it is possible to provide.  Surely we all know that, board or no board, no matter how carefully the Minister may pick them, the numbers of personnel and the size of the service will be determined by the amount provided by the Minister to pay for them.  The amount being provided at present is not sufficient to enable individual committees of agriculture throughout the country to maintain even a respectable stab at an advisory service.  The Minister has just confirmed our gravest suspicions on this side of the House that the stranglehold of the Department of Finance will prevent any sort of a respectable service being provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say in reply is that before I became Minister the Agricultural Institute were frequently in trouble because of insufficient money to do their work.  They have not been in such trouble since.  They got sufficient money to carry out their work I hope they will get sufficient money in future to carry out their work as part of the new organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

      <P>In this Bill we are buying a pig in a bag.  We do not know who will be on the board.  If we knew what type of organisation there will be within the board, we could have a fair idea of what was likely to come from the board.  We are discussing a Bill which provides that certain types of people may be on the board.  We have not the foggiest idea who they will be.  The Agricultural Institute and the county committees of agriculture are being handed over to this board who are unknown to anybody.  The Bill does not say the board will consist of so many members from this organisation, that organisation and the other organisation.  That is not in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>We oppose section 17.  This section moves right into the area of agricultural research and proposes <Col N="98" /> that the Minister's personal jackboot, the one he is wearing, will go walking through the whole area of agricultural research and, in effect, put an end to any vestige of independence which may possibly survive the change-over which has been a traumatic experience for the agricultural industry and which was so unnecessary.</P>
      <P>The first subsection seems to me to mean that, in effect, everything that happens under the section in the matter of research will now be decided by the Minister and by the Minister alone.  We have been expressing our objections to this principle since the Committee Stage began this afternoon. We must reiterate our objection on this because the assertion is made again in this section that the controlling hand of the Minister must penetrate to the furthest limits of research.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the likelihood that there will be a number of changes in the Ministry of Agriculture, one can only say that the stultifying effect of the control conferred by this section on the whole concept of research will be total.  It will not be possible any longer for a sustained research effort of any worth to be made because the provisions in the section are so stringent and stultifying.  They introduce into a fairly specialised field the personal intervention of the Minister, presumably acting through the agents in his Department, who would not have the necessary educational background to evaluate proposals that might come from the people coming under the new umbrella under this Bill.  I do not think that effort will be successful.</P>
      <P>A long succession of tabulation under this section circumscribes even further what must and must not be done in the matter of research by the new organisation, by the new creation of the Minister incorporating the corpse of the Agricultural Institute.  This section, more than any other, illustrates that Minister's total intellectual failure in his approach to the subject of the advisory services, the educational services or the agricultural research services. They are incapsulated in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to understand that this <Col N="99" /> section could have been drafted by people who are familiar with the needs and shortcomings of the industry and the country.  To people who do not believe me I suggest they read the section and observe the manner in which it is proposed to bind the hands of the agricultural research people whose organisation has just been destroyed by the Minister in passing section 10.  This continues the stultification process.  We on this side of the House can do nothing about it at the moment except to raise our voices in protest.</P>

The functions of An Foras Talúntais will remain exactly as they were, but they will be taking on additional research which was formerly carried out by the Department.  In other words, there will not be two research bodies.  The new authority will be doing all the research.  Not only is there no diminution of responsibility but there is an increase in the scope and the amount of research that will be done under the new authority.</P>

      <P>I may have misread the section but it seems to suggest that its only purpose is to provide for co-operation between the universities and the new authority to avoid duplication. I regard that as an unnecessary constrictive provision and I suggest that before Report Stage the Minister should consider widening the scope of the section to provide for this co-operation. Particularly because of the destruction of An Foras Talúntais, it would be well to provide that some agricultural research would be done with some measure of freedom which would probably evade the stultifying effect of ministerial and departmental interference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the intention.  The Deputy will be aware that from time to time there had been some overlapping and this provision is an effort to avoid that in the future. This has been provided in the hope and expectation that that sort of co-operation will be there.  We think it has already begun and the intention of the section is to provide for its continuance.  We cannot go in and tell the universities they cannot do research, because they must do it.  We want to ensure they will not be doing the same sort of research as the new authority at the same time, with duplication of expenditure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the introduction of Bye-Law 582 and Bye-Law 584 by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Fisheries and calls for their immediate withdrawal.</P>
      <P>The bye-laws in question relate to drift-netting on the south coast principally and as a result of their enforcement fishermen who up to now used a net 60 meshes deep are being asked to halve the depth of net to 30 meshes and thereby they are severely restricted in the traditional way in which they have been carrying on the fishing.  This type of fishing has been carried out on this part of the coast for a considerable time and it has come as a severe shock to fishermen to find their efforts restricted in this way.</P>
      <P>The argument of the fishermen is that because of the type of boats they use&mdash;small boats ranging from about 20 feet to 32 feet&mdash;they are confined to fishing during daylight.  If the fishermen found it possible to catch salmon with the short type of net, then it would be in their own interest to use that kind of net.  However, from experience they have found it necessary to use the deeper type of net because during daylight salmon do not swim towards the top of the water.  They are inclined to swim deep and they are caught in the bottom portion of the net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With this new order the fishermen are placed in the position that they might as well stay at home.  Already the increase introduced in the licence for drift-netting from £3 to £50 is pretty harsh and tough on these men who are, in the main, part-time fishermen and who depend entirely, apart from what they receive in social welfare, on the earnings they get from this type of fishing.  One might say that they need to revert to night fishing as is done on parts of the north and north-west coasts.  On the south coast the volume of shipping would mean that the fishermen would find themselves <Col N="104" /> in the shipping lanes.  We are all aware that at present many large boats and many large trawlers use the automatic pilot, which means that there is nobody on watch and it would be suicidal for fishermen to attempt this type of fishing during the hours of darkness.  Furthermore, the boats they have are unsuitable for conversion to lighting.  Again, having their boats properly lighted for this kind of fishing would impose a great deal of extra expense and hardship on the fishermen.  In most instances it would not be possible to have the boats fixed up with the necessary lighting that would have to be used if they tried to do the drift-netting during the hours of darkness.</P>
    <P>The whole position of the part-time fisherman is, indeed, most unsatisfactory. He is regarded as a self-employed worker and is not treated as most industrial workers are.  He has not the privilege of being allowed to put on an insurance stamp like a worker who is employed on buildings and so on.  At the end of the season he has to give an account of his earnings to the social welfare officer and in most instances the social welfare officer does not accept the word of the fisherman in relation to his earnings, which means that every part-time fisherman along the coast is drawing unemployment assistance at a very much reduced rate.  I know this applies on the Mayo coast and right along the whole coast, and it simply goes to show that this type of fisherman is not getting a fair deal from the Department of Fisheries and he is also being hampered by restrictions from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The fishermen involved have a very important part to play in the whole of the fishing industry.  Experience has shown that many of our larger boats are owned by men who started with small boats, with half-deckers, and tried to make a few pounds for themselves until eventually they could realise their ambition to become full-time fishermen.  Any restriction on their earnings is going to hamper them very much in their efforts to realise this ambition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="105" /> The decision here has hindered fishermen more than anything else introduced in the last few years.  The net result is the fishermen are annoyed and frustrated.  Indeed, they are prepared to take drastic action to try to maintain something they regard as a traditional right.  The Parliamentary Secretary, his Minister and the Department acted hastily in arriving at this decision.  One of the things this Government have boasted about is that they have open government and are prepared to consult.  In this particular instance everybody was consulted except the people directly involved. Although they have made representations&mdash;I understand they have seen the Parliamentary Secretary and officials, but I cannot say whether or not they have seen the Minister&mdash;the fishermen have been given the deaf ear.  One would expect that some notice would be taken of their request.</P>
    <P>The fishermen were prepared to compromise.  They were prepared to accept a reduction of 15 meshes in their nets.  They were prepared to fish with 45 mesh nets rather than 30, as suggested by the Department and, when they were prepared to go so far, the Parliamentary Secretary and the Department should have been more generous.  The chairman of one of the biggest boards of conservators was prepared to accept this compromise. Before the end of the season I believe the Minister will see that it would have been much wiser to have compromised and taken more heed of the fishermen's suggestion.</P>
    <P>We all accept there is need for conservation to preserve salmon stocks. On the rivers there are weirs, nets, traps and all sorts of devices for catching salmon.  No restriction that I am aware of has been imposed and that makes the case worse as far as the commercial fishermen are concerned. Today I asked the Minister what restriction, if any, had been imposed on the legal catching of salmon, other than by rod and line, in salmon rivers since 1966 and the reply the Minister gave did not relate at all to the question asked.  He said:</P>
    <P>The principal measures introduced since 1966 imposing restrictions on <Col N="106" /> commercial fishing for salmon were the Control of Fishing for Salmon Orders which limit the number of net licences that may be issued in each fishery district, by-laws limiting the length and depth of drift nets and a by-law prohibiting the use of monofilament nets.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing restrictions which are on a national basis, various by-laws have been made restricting fishing in specified areas.  These by-laws relate mainly to length of fishing season, weekly close time, etc.</P>
    <P>There is not one word in that answer about restrictions on the catching of salmon in rivers.  To me, it is quite obvious that the Minister and the Department are concerned only with protecting the rights of the landlords. This is most unsatisfactory and most annoying as far as the fishermen are concerned.  After all, if one drifts for salmon on the high seas the chances of escape for the salmon are very great indeed.  On the other hand, salmon entering the rivers in which nets and traps and weirs are used have absolutely no chance of escape.  There is no comparison at all in the way the fishermen have been treated and in the way the landlords are being protected by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question of mine in relation to commercial fishing in the rivers a note at the end of the reply given today states:</P>
    <P>Details of the catches by the fishing traps in the freshwater portions of rivers are confidential and may not be published.</P>
    <P>We make a great deal of play about the increased amount of fish being caught by drift nets but we are not prepared to give the figures for commercial fishing in our rivers.  Every fisherman with a licence has to give a return each year stating the amount of salmon he caught.  Those who use the rivers for commercial fishing do not have to make this kind of return. It is argued they are private companies and the details cannot be published. One could apply the same argument in the case of the fishermen.  A boat in many instances may be owned <Col N="107" /> by a company.  Why is there one set of rules for the ordinary fisherman and another for the landlord?  I find it very hard to see the logic behind this particular regulation.  This is a matter that should be cleared up and it is one I shall continue to probe until I get a satisfactory answer.</P>
    <P>Another factor which creates a big problem for the fishermen drift netting is weather conditions.  It is well known that fishing on a calm day in fine weather is of no benefit to the fisherman. He might just as well tie up his boat because the salmon will not mesh when the weather is fine.  The best time for drifting for salmon is when the seas are choppy and when the fisherman may be undecided about fishing because of weather conditions. This means that in many instances the fisherman may fish for only half of the the season because of weather conditions. On the west coast there may be heavy seas in the middle of summer when even large trawlers are tied up.</P>
    <P>Briefly, that is the case we are putting in relation to this motion.  We consider the Minister's order is too drastic coming as it does when the cost of the licence has increased.  In addition, the people involved are part-time fishermen and for a considerable part of the year they have to exist on small social welfare allowances.  We think the Minister should have compromised, that he should have been more generous when dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>There is one other point worth mentioning in relation to the question of salmon being caught at sea and the amount of salmon going up the rivers. As far as I know, there is no scientific evidence to prove that fishermen are not doing a good job by catching salmon at sea.  It is well known that rivers can feed a certain number of fish but if too many salmon go up a river many may die because there is not sufficient feeding in the river.  There may also be a problem at spawning time where too many salmon come to the salmon beds.  There are people who argue that drift netting is doing a good job in helping to have better stocks of salmon in our rivers.</P>
    <P>This whole matter should be examined. <Col N="108" /> It should be possible to have co-operation between all sections, where the boards of conservators, the Department and the fishermen would have regular consultation about the preservation of stocks and the amount of fish that should be caught.  A few years ago the Federation of Fishing Co-Operatives tried this method of having more consultation between the boards and the fishermen.  At the time the chairman of the national board and others met the co-operatives and there was some discussion and some element of agreement in relation to what might be done but unfortunately the matter was not followed up closely enough.  Now we are back to the old situation of one group bashing the other, the fishermen bashing the boards of conservators and the boards and others bashing the commercial fishermen.</P>
    <P>Another point worth mentioning is the anomaly that exists in relation to development of the fishing industry, where BIM provide grants for boats but where the Department try to restrict the use of the boats.  It is a rather strange situation; the fishermen are given substantial grants by BIM but the Department tell them they cannot use the boats for this kind of fishing. Apart from fishing for lobster and crayfish it is the only kind of fishing they can do.  The fishermen find it difficult to make the repayments on the boats because of this restriction.</P>
    <P>In this motion we ask the Minister, even at this late stage, to accept a compromise.  We ask him to meet the fishermen more fairly than has been the case so far.  There is plenty of trouble in the fishing industry and we should not do anything to aggravate the situation of the inshore fishermen. We should not try to impose any further hardship on them by way of orders that may be introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a number of discussions on fisheries in the past few months and tonight we are dealing with the most important species, namely, salmon.  Figures indicate that the value of salmon catches for last year and for 1975 are more than 50 <Col N="109" /> per cent of the value of all the other species caught around our coasts. Salmon is the most important species.  There is a particular obligation, naturally, on whoever is Minister for Fisheries and on whichever Government are in power to take whatever measures are necessary to ensure the conservation of our salmon stocks.</P>
      <P>The question of conservation is an ongoing one.  It was first brought to light very forcibly in 1972 when Deputy Fahey was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Gibbons also addressed himself to this question.  They expressed their deep concern about drift-netting around our coasts.  The number of licences issued in 1972 amounted to 1,156 and they claimed that if that upper trend were to continue our salmon stocks would disappear altogether within a short period.  Formidable action was taken.  This gave rise to a great deal of resentment by our salmon fishermen.  The figure of 1,156 drift licences issued was reduced for 1973 by 507, which brought the figure down to 649.  It was indicated quite clearly then that more drastic measures were in store for our salmon fishermen if, as the then Government said, they were going to conserve our stocks.</P>
      <P>The position was so serious then that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries took time off during the 1973 election campaign to issue a statement on our salmon stocks.  This statement is dated 15th February, 1973.  This statement was issued ten days after the dissolution of the Dáil.  Naturally Deputy Fahey was out of office then.  The Minister must have been deeply concerned when he took time off from his election campaign to speak about this question of salmon conservation and to make the position, so far as he was concerned as Minister and so far as the Fianna Fáil Party were concerned, quite clear to the salmon fishermen.</P>
      <P>What did the Minister say?  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons behind these limitations have been evolving over a <Col N="110" /> number of years past and they have an international as well as a national aspect.  Because of the vastly increased exploitation of salmon stocks there is concern everywhere for the survival of this species.  This has led to the adoption by international agreement of strict limitations of salmon fishing seasons and the declaration of certain closed areas to cut down exploitation on the high seas.  Commercial fishing for salmon has been banned altogether in some areas.</P>
    <P>This is what the Minister for Fisheries had to say on the 15th February, 1973.  He continued:</P>
    <P>In this country a considerable amount of commercial salmon fishing is carried on by drift nets at sea and in river estuaries.  Rod fishing accounts for only about 5 to 10 per cent of the total catch.</P>
    <P>I asked Deputy Gallagher to bear that in mind because one would think from his statement tonight that it is the rod fishermen who are mainly responsible for the decline in our salmon stocks.  Deputy Gallagher referred to fishermen as some kind of a landlord group.  That is not true.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order I made no reference to rod and line fishermen.  I referred to commercial fishermen.  I do not regard rod and line fishermen as commercial fishermen. The Parliamentary Secretary should withdraw the statement he made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>If I misinterpreted the Deputy I will certainly withdraw it because I do not want to misrepresent the Deputy's view in any way.  I understood him to refer to landlord fishermen.  He also mentioned that they were the rod fishermen.  Deputy Gallagher was not in the House in 1972 but he was a member of the Inland Fisheries Commission which submitted two interim reports to the then Government.  They were mainly responsible for the order made by Deputy Fahey in 1972 and the statement made by the Minister during his election campaign in 1973.  This was the importance attached by the then Minister and Government to those reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> Is Deputy Gallagher's recollection reasonably good?  Can he say to me in the House that one of the recommendations made by the Inland Fisheries Commission in their reports was to do what this by-law has done quite clearly?  They said that consideration should be given as a conservation measure to a restriction on the depth of net used in drift netting for salmon. That was a unanimous recommendation of the Inland Fisheries Commission, of which Deputy Gallagher was a member.</P>
    <P>So much for the viewpoint of the then Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary on the need for conserving our salmon stocks and on the need for drastic reduction in the availability of drift nets.  Fianna Fáil regarded them as the villians of the piece. Fortunately, so far as our fishermen were concerned, the people made a change on 28th February, 1973.  The new Government had a fresh look at this whole question.  Whilst it was agreed that conservation of our salmon stocks was of paramount importance at the same time it was generally felt that the panic-stricken Fianna Fáil group in the issue of their statements and in the order made by Deputy Fahey in 1972, went too far and that some easement of the situation should be provided.</P>
    <P>The Government set about easing the situation by giving many of our fishermen an opportunity to acquire licences.  We got a great deal of criticism from the Inland Fisheries Commission, and as far as I remember from Deputy Fahey who put his name to this motion.  They said then that this change was detrimental to the conservation of our salmon stocks. We made it perfectly clear in the order of 1973 that the reviewing of the control of salmon fisheries would be an ongoing one.  In the 1973 order it was clearly implied that if circumstances warranted a change in that order the change would be made.  I need not remind the House of the many additional fishermen who got a share in the income accruing from salmon fishing.  We confirmed that order in 1974.  I know the scientific advice which I have is first class and it <Col N="112" /> is highly rated by both myself and the Minister.  It indicates that we must take more measures if we are to conserve our stocks and Deputy Gallagher was informed of some of the measures we have taken in reply to a parliamentary question today.</P>
    <P>The making of this order for 1976 is alleged to be a hurried decision.  It was published widely in the summer of 1974 and we had a departmental meeting in October, 1974, and all the advice available to me at the time was that this order should be put in force for 1975.  Taking into account that it would be rather too drastic at that time I held my hand.  Many of our salmon fishermen around the coast were in complete agreement with this measure.  It was brought in in 1976 for the purpose of giving a better escapement to our salmon.  It would be grand if salmon were so plentiful that there was no danger to stocks.  The Government would not sponsor or approve of any by-law that would be detrimental to the interests of our fishermen.  We were trying to conserve stocks for future years.  We did not want to kill the goose that laid the golden egg.</P>
    <P>In relation to the continuance of the order into 1976, representations were made by a number of fishermen along the southern coast that they had bought 60 mesh nets, that they were unaware of the order, and taking all the circumstances into account, with the approval of the Government I deferred the implementation of this order until 1st January, 1977.  That was very fair and reasonable, but it was made quite clear then that it would come into force on 1st January, 1977.  We felt it was necessary to prevent our salmon stocks from being depleted, such as is now happening with the herring stocks.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil seem to change like the wind.  Their approach to fisheries generally has changed very much. With the exception of this outburst in 1972 in relation to salmon, we heard very little about fisheries generally during their term of office from 1957 to 1973.  In 1975 our fishermen, according to the official departmental statistics caught 2,188,305 <Col N="113" /> kilograms of salmon.  In 1976 the figure was 1,491,582.  That is a drop of 32 per cent in salmon catches from 1975 to 1976.</P>

      <P>The drift net is the one at issue here tonight and the 1,046,102 kilograms caught by them was valued at £3,722,256.  The anded value of our salmon catch for 1976 was £5,301,737 which is a marked increase in the value from 1975.  The average landing price for salmon, large and small, sold last year was £1.61p per pound.  That is helpful for our economy because we export a great proportion of our catch.  No ordinary person in this country could possibly have salmon for dinner, because the price has gone beyond his reach.  We are dealing with depleted stocks of a valuable species that represent about 50 per cent of the value of all sea fish catches which was the subject of so much discussion here and elsewhere during the past number of months.  A 32 per cent decline is a very serious one and the Government would be neglecting <Col N="114" /> their duty if they did not take some measures.  The measures taken are, in our view, essential, fair and just.  They were drawn up by our scientific staff who consider that this by-law is necessary as one of several measures aimed at the conservation of our diminishing salmon stocks.</P>
      <P>We are making every move possible in regard to restocking and if our stocks increase, as I hope they will, and if more salmon is available, I would like to see additional licences allocated around the coast, because a drift net licence today is very valuable. There are many qualified applicants, crewmen who have served their apprenticeship, to whom we have given the right to acquire a licence but they cannot get one by virtue of limitations on the numbers allowed to be issued by boards of conservators.  The bulk of the £5 million-odd is confined to a relatively small number of people, many of whom, particularly trawler owners, should be very thankful to this Government because they would not be sharing this money if Fianna Fáil were in office.  This is quite clear even from their statements issued at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Waterford people seem very annoyed at this measure and we met them in the Department and gave our reasons for it.  We would only be too pleased if it were possible to accede to their request, but we must take a long-term view, and I am surprised that some of our fishermen do not adopt that view too.  We must think of 1978, 1979 and of 1985, 1986 and following years.  I may add that the legal length of net for the Lismore district was increased from 200 to 800 yards when regulations were changed recently.  This improvement in Deputy Fahey's new constituency increased the permissible area of net from 4,680 square feet to 16,320 square feet at a depth of 30 meshes.  It would be completely unreasonable to ask us to double that amount.  According to departmental records fishing with a 60 mesh is a recent innovation.  Our information is that along the southern coast whatever netting was done was mainly carried out by the 30 meshes. As well as that, this measure will <Col N="115" /> benefit not only the conservation of stocks by an estimated additional escapement of 10 per cent but will benefit draft net men also.  Some of them are complaining that the drift netters are picking up the bulk of the salmon and that there are very few left for them.</P>
    <P>Therefore, over the past five years, from 1972 to 1975, the conservation of salmon has engaged our close attention. Once mention was made of it, and made very formally by the previous Government in 1972, we have watched it carefully and closely.  We have been as liberal as possible.  There are new techniques coming in every day for catching salmon more easily and more effectively than in days of old.  Unfortunately, we cannot allow these new techniques to be utilised because in the not too distant future we may have no salmon to catch.  That is the question at issue.  Someone asked me: Why do you ask a man to spend two days fishing when he could catch that fish in one day with deeper nets? That question might be reasonable if one added this question: why not reduce by half the high season for salmon?  Some step like that would have to be taken if deeper and larger nets were allowed.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat during the few minutes I have left that generally around the coast this bye-law has been welcomed by many drift net men. The Minister has indicated since he took office that it is laid down for 1977 and in the light of what happens it can be reviewed.  As I made very clear this question of salmon orders is reviewable; it must be.  We do not know what the position will be when the 1977 season closes.  However, we know how the herring stocks declined in Dunmore.  Possibly we were too lenient.  Possibly we did not like bringing in measures which were necessary. I would agree that maybe I made blunders in that respect, but I did so because of fishermen's representations. The claim was made that if they were not allowed to catch the herrings they could not repay BIM for boats.</P>
    <P>We must take cognisance of advice, and this Department is well advised. <Col N="116" /> Deputy Fahey knows all the people attached to the Department of Fisheries and I am sure he will agree with me that they are first-class men and women who are interested in their work and who have given this House and the Government the benefit of their advice.  It is our duty to make a fair assessment of that advice and act reasonably on it.  The action we have taken in regard to salmon over the past four years is fair and reasonable.  Unfortunately it is essential to have this bye-law in accordance with the recommendations made to us in order to ensure that our stocks will continue not only this year but next year and for many years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to support this motion I want to make it clear that we on this side of the House have not changed our attitude as regards the need to conserve salmon stocks.  As mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary, we brought in an order restricting the number of licences being issued, but we did protect the traditional salmon fishermen. Because of the scarcity of stocks, we thought it only right to keep out people who had other means of livelihood such as doctors, business people, veterinary surgeons, gardaí and so on.  We realise that quite a large number of people depend for their livelihood over a number of years on salmon fishing.  One of the main provisions of that order was that it was necessary to be a member of a crew fishing for salmon for three out of the preceding five years.  This was a clear indication of our interest in conserving salmon stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have this motion down this evening because this bye-law is interfering with the livelihood of traditional salmon fishermen.  This leans very heavily on a small section mainly along the south coast; the west coast is not affected.  That is the reason why there have not been protests from that latter area.  My own area, off the Waterford coast, is one most affected, particularly Ardmore.  I shall not refer to its effects on Ballycotton and Youghal; I shall leave that to Deputy Brosnan.  I want to point out to the <Col N="117" /> Parliamentary Secretary that Ardmore is an area with a long tradition, going back almost 100 years, of fishing with the 60 mesh net and that anything less&mdash;certainly 30 meshes deep&mdash;is absolutely useless.  The reason for this is that such fishermen fish in very deep water off the Waterford coast.  It is at night-time that one can catch salmon at the top, when 30 meshes would be quite effective.  However, this area is peculiar in that they fish mainly with small boats.  That is their tradition.  I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that they have not found any new-fangled ideas for catching any additional salmon and that their methods have not added in any way to the great loss that has taken place in salmon stocks.  They cannot fish at night because they would then be fishing in the shipping lanes going in and out of Cork harbour which would be of great danger to themselves and their equipment.  Therefore, it is out of the question that they fish at night.  Were they to abide by this bye-law their catches of salmon would be reduced by at least 75 per cent. They have already been restricted by way of cutting out weekend fishing and so on.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House consider it altogether unreasonable to introduce a bye-law affecting traditional salmon fishermen to that extent.  This bye-law was brought in without consultation with those people.  I believe that if any other section of the community had its livelihood taken away in such a manner there would be a far greater outcry than there is from the salmon fishermen in Ardmore and its surrounding areas.</P>
    <P>We are all perturbed by the fall-off in salmon stocks.  We would dearly wish it was otherwise and that restrictions were not necessary.  Neither do I like any implication or attempt to divide between rod and line men and drift net men, or any other type of salmon fishermen because, where there are fallen stocks, they are all affected.  I suppose it is reasonable to aim at a target of cutting them all back by 10 per cent if such were feasible.  But it falls too heavily on this small section of fishermen; they <Col N="118" /> are being asked to make far too great a sacrifice.</P>
    <P>I wonder also are we doing enough about restocking of our rivers and could we do more in regard to salmon hatcheries.  The amount of money being spent in this very important field is very small and goes no way towards creating sufficient salmon from the hatcheries for the restocking of our rivers so vital to the whole question.  One can go so far with the introduction of restrictions to preserve stocks but we should also go as far as we possibly can with regard to the building up of our salmon stocks. I know it is a slow process, that it calls for a lot of effort but, where there is any possibility of doing so, we should explore that line.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his new appointment in which I hope he will be successful.  I would ask him to apply himself to that question of restocking and have his Department do likewise.  The Minister must be aware of what this bye-law is doing to a small section of our salmon fishermen.  I am sure he has sympathy for them.  I was glad to note that the Parliamentary Secretary said the position would be reviewed at the end of 12 months. I interpret that as a sign that there is some rethinking within his Department on this issue.  However, I believe it to be more urgent than that.  I would ask that this bye-law be waived once more.  It was done last year and we appreciated that fact.  I believe it was waived because the hardships entailed were foreseen.  Unfortunately, it came into being this year and I would ask that it be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>There must be some confusion involved because, in a reply given me by the Minister dated 28th February, there was a paragraph saying that the bye-law came before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Of course, we know that the bye-law did not come before both Houses; bye-laws do not; orders come before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do not know how many people received that reply, signed by the Minister, but quite a few people who did felt that we had approved of it in this House.  That placed us in a very false position on this side of the <Col N="119" /> House.  Those people affected said: &ldquo;If you people approved of it, what are you moaning about now?&rdquo;  I know that when I put down a question enquiring as to the date on which this bye-law came before the House the question was disallowed.  Subsequently I received a letter from the Minister apologising for the error involved. There seems to have been some attempt by the Minister to gloss over the issue in this case because I do not believe that any official within that Department made such an error. During the time I was in charge of that Department I found the officials conscientious, competent, co-operative and really outstanding so far as service to their Department was concerned. Therefore, I take it that this was a deliberate attempt to mislead and wrong-foot us on the matter.</P>
    <P>I am glad I have a letter from the Minister admitting it was a mistake. I would wish that it was because it would clear the issue.  I should like the Minister to refer to it when he is speaking in this debate.  In fairness to us it should be cleared up.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the large trawlers and the mopping up of the salmon stocks. This is something we deplore.  We are mainly concerned with the small traditional salmon fishermen.  We want to protect their livelihood.  That is why we put down this motion.  When we brought in that order restricting the issuing of licences we succeeded in taking out of the industry those who made their livelihood elsewhere.  Unfortunately, when the Cork board was abolished, instead of being reduced, the numbers of licences issued escalated. The fact that the Parliamentary Secretary comes from that area must be seen to have something to do with it.  This brought protests and dissatisfaction from the other areas around the coast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about the Waterford coast.  We <Col N="120" /> have evidence of fishing for salmon with 60 mesh nets going back over a long number of years.  I should like to say again how unjust and savage this bye-law is.  The small fishermen who fish from those small boats draw unemployment assistance during the off-season and wait for the salmon season to come around again to go to work and earn money for themselves and their families.  They have the respect of the inland people and other people as well.  This was indicated quite clearly in Ardmore when they went out to fish, despite the bye-law, as a protest.  A large number of people turned out to support them on the pier. One would want to be there to witness the support they got.  People realised how they depended on fishing for their livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government increased the licence fee to £50.  Those small-time traditional salmon fishermen did not protest against that to any great extent.  They accepted it even though they had to borrow the money from people to whom they intended to sell the salmon in order to pay for the licence.  They were willing to do that if they were allowed to fish as they did in former years.  Having paid that huge increase in the licence fee, they now cannot catch salmon if they have to use 30 mesh nets which have been tried off Ardmore on several occasions but without success.  If anybody can show that 30 mesh nets can be successful in deep waters the fishermen will accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So desperate were they that they offered to compromise on 45 mesh nets.  This was turned down ruthlessly by the Department and by the Minister. With a little more thought and a little more knowledge of the area I do not believe the Minister would turn down this request to compromise. Having paid the huge licence fee it was only right that the compromise should have been agreed to.  If the weather is not suitable there are long periods in which the drift net men cannot fish.  They have long lean spells <Col N="121" /> which should be taken into account especially off areas like Ardmore.</P>
    <P>Dunmore East and other areas are affected.  Let me say that in case I should be taken as mentioning Ardmore too often.  In Dunmore East only about nine boats are affected, whereas all the boats fishing out of Ardmore are affected.  If these men are forced to fish with 30 mesh nets they will have no choice but to go back and fish in the mouths of the rivers where already there is overcrowding and where the effects on the salmon stocks will be all the greater.  They will not be able to use the 30 mesh nets to effect in deep water.  If they are forced to do this it will have the opposite effect from what the Minister desires.</P>
    <P>This is worth having another look at.  If the Minister has another look at it and concedes, I assure him it will not be looked upon as backing down in any way, or as a victory for any section.  It will be regarded as common sense having prevailed and it will be appreciated by the people concerned, not only by the fishermen, but by all the people who live in the areas affected and who realise what it means to the fishermen.  Only a small section of the coast is really affected by the bye-law.  It does not affect the west coast.  Mainly the Cork and Waterford coasts are affected and the Cork coast only in a limited way, and very little even on most of the Waterford coast. The entire fleet fishing for salmon out of Ardmore will be affected.  Helvick will be affected to a lesser extent.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House, and particularly myself, have not changed our opinion one iota about the protection of salmon stocks.  Having served in the Department I realise full well the seriousness of the position.  I have a perfect understanding of it and of the need for conservation and all that goes with it.  We put down this motion because we believe this leans far too heavily on a minority section of salmon fishermen.  We put down this motion in their interests and the interests of fair play.  It should be seen in that light.  It should be understood by everyone concerned that we are at one as regards conservation.  We may <Col N="122" /> differ on the means and ways of achieving it but we can all see the need for it.</P>
    <P>There should be no attempt by anyone to draw a divide between the rod and line men and those engaged in drift net or any other means of salmon fishing.  People who poach salmon or indulge in illegal salmon fishing should be shown no mercy and this practice should be stopped.  I ask the Minister to pay particular attention to this.</P>
    <P>Those entrusted with the job of protecting our fishermen are not on a sound footing because they are not permanent, full-time, pensionable officers.  This must be put right.  I realise Fianna Fáil can be accused of neglecting many of those matters but that type of argument will not get us anywhere.  When I got that position I did my best.  I believe the Parliamentary Secretary has a responsibility to do his best as he sees it.  We would be only too happy to co-operate in any way we can.</P>
    <P>The restocking of our rivers and hatcheries is very important.  The Inland Fisheries Commission have issued their report.  We would like to see their recommendations examined in detail and accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I said the recommendations should be looked at and examined thoroughly.  This recommendation was accepted without being examined in depth.  There are many recommendations which are not being put into effect, but this recommendation, which is having a severe impact on the livelihood of traditional fishermen, is being put into effect without a proper assessment being made of its effects on our fishermen and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of boats and gear has soared.  The traditional salmon fishermen who are affected by this order, cannot be described as wealthy.  They draw unemployment assistance in the off-season because they must provide <Col N="123" /> the necessities of life for themselves and their families.  These people, who are the hardest hit by these increases, are being put out of business.  If they were to fish with the 30 mesh nets their catches would be reduced by 75 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so. There is no evidence of that.  Our information and advice is that the catches would be reduced by 20 per cent which in the circumstances would be desirable.  The Deputy got the figure of 75 per cent off the top of his head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>A local survey has not been made.  If it had, the Parliamentary Secretary would have to accept that the catches would be reduced by approximately 75 per cent.  These men who are not well off would have to cut the size of their nets in half to comply with this bye-law.  A compromise was suggested that they cut the size of their nets to 45.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that small fishermen are never sure of their salmon markets or when they can go out to fish because of weather conditions.  They have to borrow from their prospective customers to pay the licence fee of £50 and this puts them at the mercy of some of these merchants.  This is not what they want and, therefore, they <Col N="124" /> are dissatisfied.  Nevertheless, they did not protest too much, although other sections of the community would protest if anything like that increase in licence fees had taken place.</P>
    <P>The Department and the Minister refused to accept the licence fee in instalments and this has caused hardship. This concession should have been made in view of the exorbitant increase that has taken place in just one year.  The Duke of Devonshire has made a concession and offered to take fees in instalments.</P>
    <P>There has never been trouble with the fishermen off the Waterford coast. They are very easy to deal with&mdash;the easiest and most decent people live there.  They do not want any trouble. We do not want any trouble but these fishermen will be up against it if this bye-law stands.  I do not think anybody will quibble with the Minister if it is withdrawn or even abandoned until next year.  In the meantime, the matter could be investigated and the Minister could have consultations with the fishermen concerned because so far there has been no consultation between the Minister and the people who are vitally involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>The claim for unemployment benefit made by the person concerned on 23rd November, 1976, was disallowed by a deciding officer on the ground that the statutory condition for the receipt of unemployment benefit which requires a claimant to be available for employment was not satisfied. She appealed against this decision and, following an oral hearing on 3rd March, 1977, at which the claimant attended and gave evidence the appeals <Col N="46" /> officer upheld the decision of the deciding officer.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the determination of claims for unemployment benefit is a matter for statutorily appointed deciding officers and appeals officers.  Accordingly, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on how the decision of the deciding officer or the appeals officer was arrived at in this case.</P>
      <P>It is regretted that due to a breakdown in internal co-ordination in this particular case the letter to the Deputy of the 8th March, 1977, was issued without knowledge of the fact that arrangements had already been made to have the appeal heard at an earlier date than had been thought possible when the letter was being prepared.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid unemployment benefit up to 23rd February, 1977, on his claim of 28th August, 1976.  Payment was suspended after that date while inquiries were being made as to whether the claimant continued to satisfy the statutory conditions for the receipt of benefit.  A deciding officer on the information available to him subsequently disallowed his claim in respect of two days the 15th February, 1977, and the 17th February, 1977, on the ground <Col N="47" /> that the person was not unemployed on those days.  Arrangements have been made to have all arrears of unemployment benefit, after deduction of the resultant overpayment, paid to the claimant and further payments will continue as they fall due.</P>

This decision was confirmed by an appeals officer. The decision of an appeals officer is final save when there are new facts or new evidence such as would warrant its revision.</P>

      <P>The list of areas designated as disadvantaged in this country, as approved by the EEC Council of Ministers in accordance with the relevant directive were announced by my Department in July, 1975.  These areas corresponded closely to the former 12 &ldquo;Western Counties&rdquo; which have been traditionally regarded as underdeveloped and in need of special assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently, claims for inclusion were received from a number of other areas throughout the country and in the special circumstances I agreed to have these claims examined and the boundaries of the designated areas reviewed.  This examination and review was carried out during 1976 and confirmed that our original boundaries <Col N="50" /> were substantially correct and that only marginal adjustments in certain areas could be justified.  The review was carried out in close consultation with the Commission Services and our proposals for adjustment, which took account of Commission views on the interpretation and application of the directive, were duly approved by the Commission and announced by my Department in December, 1976.</P>
    <P>A large proportion of the total area of this country has now been classed as disadvantaged and my Department is satisfied that a case could not be sustained for the inclusion of other areas which have been seeking designation.

    <P>As indicated in reply to a question from the Deputy which was answered <Col N="53" /> on 8th February, 1977, the only possible way in which the flow of work in an office the size of the Land Registry can and ought to be managed is on the basis that applications are dealt with in order of receipt, subject to the qualification that where it is shown that hardship will result from delay, special efforts will be made to deal with the case as early as possible. Consequently, inquiries unsupported by that kind of evidence cannot be allowed to accelerate the processing of any particular case.  Any inquiry as to the position in regard to an application may be addressed direct to the Land Registry.</P>
