      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), after line 17, to insert &ldquo; `the Director' means the holder of the office of Director of Consumer Affairs established by section 9 of this Act;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make it easier to identify the provision establishing the Office of Director of Consumer Affairs.  It appears that Opposition Deputy O'Toole's amendment and the Minister's amendment are similar so there is no reason why we should not accept amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2. subsection (1), line 18, after &ldquo;includes&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;houses&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know if houses are <Col N="1010" /> included in the definition section.  It includes definition of goods, ships, vehicles and aircraft, land, things attached to land and growing crops, and I see no reason why houses should not be included under that definition. I would like to know if there is any technical or legal reason that would preclude houses from this legislation. The only case that I can find where houses were excluded is the Sale of Goods Act. 1893.  The problem here is that there is a basic difference between legislation in the United Kingdom and legislation here in that in the United Kingdom it would seem that courts and court personnel may in reaching agreement consider the intention behind the legislation; there is what is known as &ldquo;the spirit of the Act&rdquo;, which does not apply in this country.  Here it would seem that the courts are obliged to come to a decision on the basis of what they see in front of them on paper as the Act. Therefore I see no reason why the definition should not include houses.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary and the Members of this House are aware of the enormous difficulties that we face as public representatives in dealing with matters on behalf of constituents who are all consumers.  Indeed, much of the time spent in trying to solve these problems is wasted because there is no legal backing or legal protection and in many cases our efforts are futile.  The purchase of a house is the major investment in so far as the average family is concerned.  I have not had time to check with the household budget inquiry what proportion of the average family's income is absorbed in this, but at a guess I would say that between initial purchase, service and upkeep it is about 30 per cent of one's whole life income. Despite the importance of this in money and social terms, what do we find?  When an opportunity is offered to a consumer of some protection, the consumer is not being given an opportunity to avail of this protection under this Bill.</P>
    <P>To aggravate the situation, builders may not be registered.  Anybody can build a house and offer it for sale and there is no check as to the standards <Col N="1011" /> applied.  It is only at a much later date that the consumer discovers that he has been duped into buying and paying dearly for something which does not come up to his or her expectations. There are guarantees.  There is a structural guarantee given by the Construction Industry Federation, but such guarantee has no teeth and there is no way in which that body can deal with recalcitrant members who fail to live up to the objectives set by the profession. Another baffling aspect of this is that this structural guarantee is for only a two-year period at present.  The financing of a house goes on for possibly 25 or 30 years.  I am talking about the ordinary individual, not the man who can fork out £50,000 or £60,000 immediately.  I am talking about the person who buys a house and has to have it on mortgage.  The guarantee lasts two years and the financing goes on for 15 times that period.  Is it implied here that the fitness for purpose clause, about which we will be talking later, applies in the case of houses; or is it that after two years a house need not be fit for the purpose for which it was purchased in the first place?  This is worth considering and it strengthens the case for having houses included in this definition.</P>
    <P>A further difficulty here so far as the consumer is concerned is the question of inspection of houses.  It is no secret in this country that the standard, particularly in joinery, does not come anywhere near the Irish standard specification as laid down by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  It is estimated that something in excess of 70 per cent of all joinery work is below that standard yet many of those houses are grant aided.  If houses were included in this Bill this could be looked at and the matter could be rectified.  There is also &mdash;this bears out the strength of my argument for having houses included&mdash; the practice here, and I presume this is a universal one, that where there are major developers in housing companies are set up specifically to develop sites they have purchased.  The developer builds 100 or 200 houses on that site <Col N="1012" /> under the name of this new company. When the estate is completed the company are dissolved and the purchasers of those houses are left with their faults. In many cases they have no redress whatsoever because the company who were specifically set up for the development of that site have now been dissolved. There is nobody to go to even though the parent company are still in existence and have moved on somewhere else to repeat that performance.</P>
    <P>This happens every day of the week. It is a major drawback.  It is most unfair that consumers, the house purchasers in this case, should not be safeguarded against abuses which arise due to shoddy work, indeed, incomplete work in many cases and, as I have already stated, a poor standard of work in joinery.  Those are some of the problems which face a consumer in purchasing a house, which is the major investment in his lifetime.  I do not see why houses should not be included in this definition and also in the straightforward definition &ldquo;goods attached to land.&rdquo;  I do not see any reason, if a ship is included as goods, why a house should not be included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy makes a very reasonable case to have houses included in the definition.  In Irish law when we refer to land, houses are included.  The Deputy made the case that in English law houses are specifically mentioned in their Acts and houses are not included when they talk about land.  I agree that possibly the biggest investment that many of our people make in their lives is when they purchase a house and that with the continuously rising price of houses it is essential that they be covered under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Houses sold in business, that is houses sold by description, &ldquo;advertisements inserted by auctioneers or house agents&rdquo; are included in the Bill.  When estate agents or auctioneers insert the description of a house, whether it is a new house or a secondhand one, they must ensure that the description which they are given by the person for whom they are acting as agent, is correct.  If it is found that it is misleading they come under the terms of this Bill. <Col N="1013" /> House sales by developers or large builders, as Deputy O'Toole mentioned, for example new houses in large housing estates, are included in &ldquo;advertising and description&rdquo; because most of these new estates, as we see in all the national and provincial papers, are advertised every week.  All other houses which are sold by auctioneers or estate agents are included in the Bill as to their description and the advertising which auctioneers do in the course of their business.  A private house sold by description by a private owner is not included.</P>
    <P>The Deputy spoke about standards in housing and &ldquo;fitness for purpose.&rdquo; Standards of housing are a matter for the Department of the Environment. Guarantees of contract in civil law are not proper to a criminal law Bill, which this Bill is.  The case may be made again, when the Committee Stage of the Bill is discussed in the Seanad, but at this stage I cannot say it is likely that I would include houses. As I said, in Irish law when we talk about land we are including houses.  I hasten to assure the Deputy and all Members of the House that houses are included under the Bill.  It is important they should be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely one could argue that one could quite easily envisage a situation where a private individual, which is not unknown to happen, would buy two or three houses, renovate them and then put them up for sale.  He could include in a newspaper advertisement a description of the properties he proposes to sell.  He may not necessarily be an auctioneer, an estate agent or a builder. He may not be registered at all.  One often finds odd speculative individuals, many of them in regular employment, who decide to do a bit of investment on the side.  Such a person buys a rundown property for £8,000 or £10,000 and spends £3,000 or £4,000 on it.  He could do the work in his spare time and then offer it for sale for £15,000, £20,000 or £25,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A deal like this has often occurred in my constituency.  It appears that the kind of consumer information made available by such an individual does <Col N="1014" /> not come within the scope of this Bill. I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary could see her way, through her involvement in the Bill, or through consultations with the Minister, to having cognisance taken of that type of situation on Report Stage.  Deputies receive substantial complaints on occasions from constituents who have either been conned up to their eyes or who have bought a major piece of property ranging from £12,000 to £50,000 and their redress is protracted litigation through the courts, very often against somebody who may be a person of straw, but who handled that particular property.  That can mean the end of a lifetime of financial security for that person.  If most of us own one, two or three properties during our lifetime that is probably the maximum of our involvement in terms of changing our homes.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the scope of the Bill should be extended.  I do not think that would give rise to any tremendous reactions.  It was feared that, if this concept were broadened, some of the major construction companies would be very perturbed, but they are not.  In any event, the advertisements of our major construction companies would be covered.  The vast majority of our major construction companies are reputable and there is no worry in that regard.</P>
    <P>We are starting again on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  We have the considerable benefit of the discussions on Committee Stage which took place last March and April.  The Bill will go through Report Stage and will go through Committee Stage in the Seanad where, presumably, the former Minister, Senator Keating, will be available to make observations.  On our side of the House we have Deputy Bruton, who guided the Bill through Committee Stage.  That was a testing experience between himself and Deputy O'Malley.  Reading through the debates of 29th March, one can see why an amendment should be put down this morning by the Opposition. Therefore, I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary could see her way to extending the scope of the Bill in this direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Desmond made the point that, if a person buys one or two or three houses and offers them for resale after spending a certain amount of money on them, he is not included under the terms of the Bill.  If a private individual buys houses and renovates them for resale, then he is selling in the course of business.  I think everyone would agree with that.  Therefore he is covered by the Bill.</P>
      <P>To include private sales other than that type of private sale in the Bill would be going against the whole principle of the Bill in that we are concerned in the Consumer Information Bill with sales in the course of business. However, as I said before, on Committee Stage in the Seanad I will be prepared to have a look at that amendment again and see whether it would be possible to include &ldquo;houses&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree there are many occasions on which it would be extremely difficult to prove that any individual, who may be a public servant, or a member of the Garda, or a Dáil Deputy, who buys a house and does it up and does not advertise it in the local newspapers, is formally engaged in trade or business under the Bill.  He may do this intermittently. There are quite a number of individuals who do this both in public and private employment.  Very often they are not caught for income tax.  They dispose of the odd house now and again.  Quite a number are landlords, even though they are not registered as landlords with the Revenue Commissioners.  That is the kind of activity to which I am referring. It is in that area that the most trouble tends to occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one is dealing with a big builder or a reputable auctioneer, one has automatic redress.  I am talking about intermittent individual sales.  You will always get the shady individual who is able to deal in property by word of mouth, as a cash transaction, with no public advertisement.  He is very careful to avoid the consequences.  He may be selling property which is riddled with dry rot.  He may make a handsome <Col N="1016" /> profit of £8,000 or £10,000 and then he moves on to the next killing. In a major conurbation like the greater Dublin area, it takes Dáil Deputies, the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda some time before they can catch up with these individuals.  If there was a clear indication that such individuals could have their ears clipped under this legislation, that would act as a salutary warning to them.</P>
    <P>I do not want to press the matter unduly because the Parliamentary Secretary's approach is generally in the direction we want to go and we can consider the matter again on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate the Parliamentary Secretary's willingness to have another look at this, to put it mildly I am confused on two issues. The Parliamentary Secretary said the legislation will cover builders and other people who advertise their wares, in other words, people who are in the business of building houses in a big or a small way and who advertise the kind of houses they are selling.  She also said that if a person who is not a builder in the accepted sense builds or purchases one, two or three houses at different times and expends some money on them and sells them, that person will also come under this Bill.</P>
      <P>That person does not advertise.  He disposes of these houses by word of mouth.  In towns of a certain size everybody knows so-and-so has bought a house, is doing it up, and it will be coming on the market.  Therefore, there is no need to advertise. That is a private sale.  The Parliamentary Secretary has reiterated that these are matters of trade and business.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Desmond said, the individual who buys the house could be a Member of this House.  He does up the house and resells it.  As I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is aware, there are people, possibly in her own city, who are not registered builders who build or purchase and sell houses. In many cases they could sell three or four houses a year.  They do not advertise. Are those sales covered under this Bill and will the purchasers get any protection from the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> I would recommend to the Parliamentary Secretary that she should look at it this way.  To get over all our problems we should stick to the definition of &ldquo;goods&rdquo; in the definition section which states that &ldquo;goods&rdquo; includes ships, vehicles and aircraft, land, things attached to land and growing crops.  For the life of me I do not see what difficulties would arise if houses were included under the heading of &ldquo;things attached to land&rdquo;.  We are not dealing with bicycles.  We are not dealing with some small commodity of which hundreds of thousands are sold every year.  We are dealing with houses and these are major purchases for which high prices are paid.  To my mind it should not be impossible to include houses and have a very strict check on all sales of houses advertised or otherwise disposed of.  To what extent does the Parliamentary Secretary envisage the terms of this Bill applying to sales outside of business and trade?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right the House should be so concerned about sales of houses.  The Parliamentary Secretary has said she will have another look at this.  Both Deputy Desmond and Deputy O'Toole have made the point very strongly that the purchase of a house is the biggest single transaction by any purchaser.  It is no use saying to people who come to our clinics every week asking us to fill in forms for them or get houses for them that the houses will be awarded to them <i>caveat emptor.</i>  Needing houses so badly they would buy even though they may be suspicious and so it is vitally necessary to ensure that legislation will give them the fullest protection possible.  We may have a glut of houses some day and we can then ease up.  We cannot ease up at the moment because there are so many people looking for houses.  It is a healthy sign that the House should show such concern about this and I have every confidence that the Parliamentary Secretary will have another look at this before a final decision is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy <Col N="1018" /> O'Toole has raised the point once again of small builders who do not advertise houses for sale.  They build three, four, five or more houses a year or over a certain period and offer them for sale. Obviously they are in the business of selling houses and making money on the sale of houses and they will, therefore, be covered under this Bill because, unlike the previous Act, a trade description whether it is in a handbill, a letter or an oral statement to a purchaser is covered and all such sales are included under this Bill.  It is a descriptions Bill.  It is a criminal measure.  The principle is not to try to enforce against private sales for the good reason that it just would not be possible to enforce it.  With regard to the contract rights of purchasers, as I said before, these are a separate matter.  However, I hasten to assure Members that small builders who do not advertise will be covered by this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This is where the major deficiency arises because there is the odd individual who will advertise a house in Dalkey, perhaps, with a magnificent view over the sea front and the prospective purchaser finds it is looking into the back of a reservoir. There are people who purchase sight unseen on the basis of a newspaper advertisement.  It is an incredible situation but I have heard of it happening. Apparently, since it is a private advertisement containing a misleading description, it will not be covered by this Bill.  I do not know to what extent it is appropriate in that context to describe this as a &ldquo;Consumer Information <Col N="1020" /> Bill&rdquo;.  A great many transactions are by private treaty.  Surely they should be covered.  One can, of course, take an action against the vendor but. since the position can be widespread, I believe protection should be accorded under this Bill to the purchaser.  I am not giving away any secrets when I say that there was a reluctance, regrettably, on the part of the parliamentary draftsman to broaden the scope of the earlier Bill because of the disastrous Constitution we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary would be in favour of maximum protection for consumers. What is the difficulty in having houses included?  Is there any legal difficulty or technical complication that would preclude houses?  Or is there overlapping legislation in regard to what we are talking about?  Why the reluctance, which I would guess is on the part of the Parliamentary Secretary, to have houses included in the definition?  Is it a drafting problem?  If it is, I would assume that it could be got over in time and by the exercise of grey matter. If houses were included it would get this problem out of the way and give protection to all consumers, purchasers of houses, right across the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We seem to be back to the question of whether houses are included and I said at the beginning that houses are included in the description under &ldquo;goods&rdquo; which include land.  In Irish law when we talk about land we are in fact talking about houses.  Therefore I see no problem, drafting or otherwise. This matter arose during my own reading of the Bill and the preparation for the Committee Stage today, whether houses were included because I am very concerned, like the Deputy, that maximum protection should be afforded not only to the consumer but also to the builder or whoever may be selling the house.  It is in his interest as well as the consumer's that houses should be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond spoke of the case of a person he knew who bought a house in Dalkey, I think, which was supposed to have a magnificent view <Col N="1021" /> of the sea and in fact looked into something totally different.  My experience has been that if one goes out to buy an item of clothing, for instance, one looks at it and checks it or indeed, tries it on.  If one is spending a great amount of money on something which will be the largest investment of one's life, such as a house, obviously it is up to the purchaser, and it would seem logical, that he should go out and ensure that a description given in an advertisement or statement is correct and that it has &ldquo;a magnificent view of the sea&rdquo;.  If the Deputy feels that a number of people in his own constituency may be prepared to accept the description given in private or in an advertisement in a national newspaper, they should realise that the State cannot do everything.  We try to do as much as possible and give the maximum amount of protection which I think is given in this Bill but we must leave a certain amount to the private individual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be well to come in here and mention my disappointment at the fact that this matter has arisen.  The principal Act is the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887. When I looked at the Bill, on its circulation, I tried to find a copy of the Merchandise Marks Act.  Some very reputable solicitors failed to produce a copy and the only copy I could get was in the Library of this House.  The title of the Bill is Consumer Information Bill, 1976, and if information means anything it means that something must be available to the consumer. The unavailability of a copy of this Act is a major stumbling block to the ordinary person who wants to discover his rights.  There are references and cross references to the principal Act in this Bill.  As far as I can see there are only three sections which are relevant, sections 2, 3 and 5 of the Act.  Would it not be possible to have these sections in the principal Act repealed and brought in in a consolidated, amended form in the Bill? In the past fortnight or three weeks one of the Parliamentary Secretary's colleagues introduced a Bill which repealed major sections of other Acts and gave us in consolidated form a piece of legislation which was complete and an entity in itself with all relevant facts in the one document. In view of the references and cross references in this measure to three sections in the principal Act I see no reason why they could not have been repealed and brought into this Bill in amended form.  On inquiring from the Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor about the same matter.  I was told this would delay introduction of the Bill. I do not know what the Parliamentary Secretary was told but I appreciate that she was concerned with the speedy introduction of legislation for consumer protection and information.  In five months I think she might have checked this at an early stage and if it were possible to have sections 2, 3 and 5 of the principal Act repealed, the drafting would not have delayed the Bill if they could have been <Col N="1023" /> brought in in amended form.  I was disappointed when I received the amendments yesterday and did not see this type of approach applied to this Bill.</P>

The copyright had run out but we had the Act reprinted some months ago and it is now for sale in the Government Publications Sale Office in the GPO Arcade.  I hasten to assure the Deputy that if at any time in future he has any similar difficulty, if he comes either to me or the Department we shall be glad to assist in any way we can.  Repeal of the Merchandise Marks Act and its consolidation with the present Bill would, as he rightly gathers, have delayed the Bill to a certain extent.  Both consumers and the Consumers' Association of Ireland are extremely concerned about the Bill and are anxious to have it put speedily through the House.  It would be unfair to them to hold it up for a considerable period.  It is important that the Bill be passed as soon as possible and I submit that this amendment is acceptable to the House.</P>

      <P>The amendment is acceptable.  On reading the Act, the sections in the Act which are relevant to this Bill have been amended right up to 1970.  If this is to be for the information of the consumer I presume on the enactment of this Bill consumers should be in a position to get a copy of the Act so as to know their legal rights, but with the references, cross-references and the amendments of the 1887 Act up to 1970 that kind of information is denied them.  I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for offering to help me in resurrecting copies of Acts or amended Acts as I need them, but I am one consumer and, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, most Deputies know where to go and can look after themselves in this matter.  I am talking about the hundreds of thousands of people outside to which this Bill refers and the Parliamentary Secretary must <Col N="1024" /> admit that it would have been better if we had a consolidated Bill that could give all the information inside its covers without having references and cross-references to Acts and amended Acts.</P>

      <P>In page 4, after line 3, to add a subsection as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  In this section the word <Col N="1025" /> `false' and `misleading to a material degree' shall be construed to mean `likely to mislead members of the public to whom it is directed'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Having read the Bill, and the report of the debate, I note that Deputy O'Malley as he then was, now Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy put down the same amendment and to my mind he made a very convincing argument as to why this amendment should be accepted.  It might be misconstrued that in our efforts to get a fair deal for the consumer we are by implication condemning the manufacturer or the trader.  This Bill is concerned primarily with the protection of the consumer, but it is also in the interests of manufacturers and traders, the vast majority of whom are honest, decent people going about their daily chores, earning their living in an honest way.  What we are getting at is a very small minority who take advantage of the consumer who is unaware of his or her rights and who exploit many people.  Most of them are fly-by-nights and there is no redress.  We are not getting at the vast majority of traders and manufacturers who go into competition with their peers and try to earn an honest living.  The reason for this amendment is to ensure that manufacturers, producers and traders are not put upon too heavily by the terms of this Bill.  The definition of &ldquo;false trade description&rdquo; is very broad and it could lead to difficulties if it is left as it stands without this extra subsection which I regard as essential. A manufacturer or a producer could advertise goods in a very specialised range.  We are living in an age of advanced technology, advancing more every day and many people read newspapers, look at television, read periodicals and trade magazines in which goods are advertised by manufacturers. In most cases people do not read the advertisements because the type of article advertised does not apply to their livelihood.  There are people, however, who read these advertisements and who purchase goods in many cases out of curiosity or out of mistaken faith in what has been said in the advertisement.  Deputy O'Malley as he then was, mentioned a specific ease of <Col N="1026" /> medicines being advertised, the advertisement probably being for the medical profession.  As a result of some lay person's curiosity or out of mistaken faith the goods may be bought and may cause damage.  The advertiser in this case, according to section 2, would come under severe pressure as a result of this Bill, even though he did not intend to aim his sales campaign at the person who purchased the article.</P>
    <P>It would be very easy for a court to decide at whom a particular article was aimed.  For that reason I have put down my amendment.  There are people who buy specialist magazines and who may be enticed to buy something unsuitable.  There is also the great danger that people may be enticed to buy medical preparations. Trade magazines carry advertisements for many articles which could be dangerous if they got into the wrong hands.  It would be unfair to hold the advertiser responsible for damage caused by the misuse of his goods.  To stay in business a manufacturer must advertise his goods.  How do you tell him that he is running the risk of conviction if the goods which he advertises are bought by the wrong people?</P>

      <P>While I sympathise with Deputy O'Toole, I believe that the original draft Bill is better than the proposed amendment. To take a classic example, a Cheann Comhairle, if there was a preparation to cure baldness, you and I could be affected by the amendment.  While you and I might feel that it would be a false trade description to offer such hope, I believe that legislating against it would place an impossible burden on the courts.  It is a matter for the courts to define false or misleading trade descriptions.  I recall Deputy O'Malley's attempt to have the Bill amended on 29th March last.  The response on that occasion by the Parliamentary Secretary was a stronger one.  One would have to define the people who would be affected by a false trade description and this would pose insurmountable problems for the Parliamentary Draftsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a doctor was misled by a false description of a medical preparation <Col N="1027" /> I have no doubt that the court would rule that it was a false description under the 1887 Act.  A consumer information Bill of this nature cannot be expected to cater for all exigencies. The court must be allowed to define what is meant by a false or a misleading trade description.  While I sympathise with Deputy O'Toole's views, I am not convinced of the need for his amendment at this stage.  It is no harm for members of the Opposition to disagree from time to time.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Toole's amendments would, as Deputy Desmond said, place a great burden of proof on the State.  The State would have to prove that a person had sufficient knowledge of, say, medicine, before the court could rule on the advertisement.  A false or misleading advertisement should be an offence.  Whether or not an advertisement is an offence should not depend on the knowledge of the consumer.  The essence of this Bill is that we are trying to correct false advertising.  As Deputy O'Toole said, the State would have to be discreet in judging specialist magazines such as those directed at the medical profession.  As it stands, the amendment would place a great burden of proof on the State in that it would have to prove the extent of a person's knowledge of the advertised goods.  As the amendment would not improve the Bill it would be better to leave the section as it stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties mentioned by Deputy Desmond and the Parliamentary Secretary.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the level of education of the consumer, but I am concerned with specific advertising which provides reasonable information for specific consumers.  The information given in that consumer's case is not adequate.  There is an omission in his case where as in his neighbour's case to whom the advertisement was beamed on the first day there is not an omission in the information. It could be unfair and it could work against the interests of the <Col N="1028" /> advertiser in some cases.  I am pointing out that there is a danger, that we may have gone overboard in using this in a blanket form.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties and at the end of the day all we can hope is that the courts will differentiate between what is right and wrong.  However, the fact remains that the advertiser stands charged with an offence regardless of whether or not he can reasonably be expected to provide the information down to the lowest common denominator.  We could have the position of the advertiser being hauled into court in the case of a person who is illiterate because he misused or abused a commodity which was beamed at some other category of person who would use this article.  It is a heavy imposition to place on that advertiser.  What is the lowest common denominator?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>8.  In page 4, after line 52, to add a subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Notwithstanding any provisions of the Acts or of the foregoing subsections of this section, this Act shall apply to sales of vehicles otherwise than by way of trade.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1029" /> We discussed housing at length this morning and I want now to bring in another aspect of trade prevalent here, the sale of vehicles other than by way of trade or business.  The reason I want this new subsection added is that I am convinced that the volume of sales by private individuals which takes place in this line of business is very large. Legislation was introduced in England in 1968 to investigate abuses in this regard and it transpired in the first year of its operation that the vast majority of complaints referred to the unsatisfactory position with regard to the sale of cars.  We are all aware that speedometers are interfered with and that the descriptions given in advertisements about cars in many cases are not what they might be.  In fact, in many cases those descriptions are false.  Many small advertisements in Dublin evening newspapers offer cars for sale.  The year of manufacture of the car is given and the make and most of the advertisements finish with &ldquo;PMO&rdquo;, perfect mechanical order.  Some of those advertisements carry a box number.  In fact, I have seen 1967 cars advertised as being in PMO.  It is obvious that that is false information.  Just as in the case of houses, cars are expensive commodities. We are not talking about tins of beans or firelighters; we are talking about a commodity which makes inroads into a person's finances.  From the point of view of the consumer we are talking about value for money and to what degree protection can be given to the consumer so that he can get the maximum value for his investment.</P>
    <P>While the sale of cars in the course of business or trade is covered in the Bill I should like to know if it would be possible to cover the sale of cars by private individuals.  There are people who buy cars, carry out some work on them and sell them as a sideline. They do not advertise them openly and in many cases use a box number.  The danger is that if this Bill is passed and the sale of a car by private individuals to their neighbours or other people is left outside its provisions, the small operator who sells cars in the course of his business&mdash;I am talking about the unscrupulous operator&mdash;and who will be caught will be given the incentive to go underground. <Col N="1030" /> He would no longer sell cars as a business but sell them as a private individual, and by so doing evade and avoid the provisions of this Bill.  This is a distinct possibility and I am quite sure there are people who will avail of the opportunity to go underground and cease to trade officially.  They will go back to using the box number and overcome the problems which might cause some difficulty under the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>For that reason I have put down this amendment and I should like to know if the Parliamentary Secretary has any basic objection.  If so, is it because of the enforcement difficulty or is there some other reason?  I presume it is difficult to legislate for isolated commodities because of the difficulty of definition, but a motor vehicle is definable and is defined in other Acts.  Legal protection can be applied to that kind of commodity without any great trouble or difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment.  If the proprietor of a garage inserts an advertisement in a newspaper or puts a notice in his window offering for sale a car which has done 20,000 miles and if it is subsequently discovered that the car has done 40,000 miles, he can be subject to criminal liability under this Bill. This is proper and fair, but if I sell my car to some gullible member of the public under the same kind of pretence, the only redress of the individual is to take a civil action against me.  There is clearly an anomaly here and it is correct to suggest that it would be healthy and desirable that this situation should be circumscribed. A massive number of private motor vehicles and an increasing number of larger public service vehicles are sold by way of private treaty between individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason why we should not consider an extension of criminal liability.  I have always had the view that an extension could be useful in relation to certain products and commodities. There has been an enormous amount of litigation through the years in relation to sales of land.  It has broken families and destroyed neighbourhoods and even destroyed local <Col N="1031" /> political parties.  Criminal liability should extend to these transactions where there is obvious criminality proven.  The same applies in relation to house sales and to the third biggest aspect of private property, the possession of a motor car.  When we speak of a car, even one five or six years' old, we are talking in terms of a couple of thousand pounds.  There should be basic protection given.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not digressing too much, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, when I say that there was a very interesting question yesterday when Deputy Horgan asked the Minister for Health how much smoking costs the country.  The Minister gave a global figure and said that smoking costs the country £15 million a year in paying for people to go into hospital, preventive medicine and so on.  I often wonder how much money it would save the country if we had an extension of criminal liability in relation to the sale of motor vehicles.  We would not have fellows flogging radial tyres with repairs on the side walls.  There would be an immediate blow-out if a car were driven at 60 miles per hour with such a tyre.  There are so many opportunities for sharp practice in relation to the sale of motor vehicles that very often the only redress one has is to go through a protracted period of civil litigation.  Cars are lethal to the public at large, quite apart from the large segment of the population driving around half drunk after 10 p.m.  This is unique in Europe, and Ireland has a reputation in that regard.  The extension to motor sales should be included.  Deputy O'Toole has made a coherent case.</P>
    <P>In fairness to Deputy Bruton and his reluctant non-acceptance of a similar amendment last March, he did indicate that he regarded motor vehicles and land as prime considerations for inclusion within criminal liability.  Having read all the debates and listened at great length at various other symposia, I will never forget the sheer bitchiness of the former Opposition spokesman, Deputy O'Malley, during the course of the debate on this Bill.  He was absolutely impossible and I do not know on what side of the <Col N="1032" /> bed he got out during last March and April.  He really was incredibly critical of that Bill and there were sections of it which were wide open to amendment. He has initiated this Bill again without many changes.  We now have a unique opportunity of going through a double Committee Stage.  We ask the Minister to be open in the matter and to be as broadminded as he always wanted us to be when we were in Government.</P>
    <P>The motor trade would welcome this amendment.  It must be galling for a reputable motor trader trying to sell cars on the basis of giving a fair deal when there is a cute hawk down the road who buys and sells the odd car. One can make a lot of money if one is cute enough and has some training as a motor mechanic.  In the old days they used to stuff and axle with a few stockings to deaden the sound but nowadays quite sophisticated repairs can be carried out which will carry a car for 5,000 miles or so.  Such repairs are almost impossible to detect.  From my own trade union experience I know a large number of qualified motor mechanics and they would frighten one about the capacity of people to doctor cars and sell them for several hundred pounds and do this every few weeks. There should be an opportunity for the consumer to take civil proceedings against individuals.  A defective car can kill a child or the driver himself or his family or another motorist, just because some fellow was so avaricious and greedy.  The sale of such a car should be the subject of civil proceedings not just civil litigation between the parties concerned.  For these reasons I support the amendment of Deputy O'Toole.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of regret that on the previous occasion Deputy Bruton was not in a position to accept the amendment. With the abolition of car tax the volume of sales has increased, especially in the case of young people in rural Ireland.  The abolition of car tax was one of the main factors in the general election campaign, particularly in rural Ireland where the only tax a young person had to pay was in respect of cars.  He did not have to pay income tax and paid little by way <Col N="1033" /> of social insurance.  However, such a person could find himself caught badly in a private sale, and on that basis the amendment could be considered perhaps on Report Stage.  It would be widely welcomed.</P>
    <P>I am not unduly fussy about this matter.  I have a healthy jaundiced approach to those in jurisprudence who are always trying to ensure the division between civil liability and criminal liability and between the areas of rigid jurisdiction.  They maintain that we cannot possibly extend the net of criminal liability in this or that direction, that every judge in the country will have a heart attack. Nowadays the vast majority of families own a car.  Very often they buy only four or five cars during a lifetime and they want to buy a decent vehicle.  Cars are outrageously expensive here in comparison with Northern Ireland or Great Britain.  In these circumstances the law should be updated.  There is no reason why criminal liability should not extend to such transactions.</P>
    <P>There is an anomaly in the Bill and I am sure Deputy Connolly, as an auctioneer, is aware of it.  If he describes a car as a 1977 Fiat with a mileage of 5,000 miles and if it is taken out and driven down the road and somebody is killed, as an auctioneer he has criminal liability attached to him under the provisions of this Bill.  However, if a man privately sells a car to his next-door neighbour by way of cash transaction and if an accident occurs, the only remedy is a civil action against him.  It will be obvious to all that the situation is unfair.  This matter should be rectified.</P>
    <P>Because of the provisions in the Bill there is an incentive for people to disengage from the trade and to go underground, as Deputy O'Toole pointed out, and to operate through newspapers and box numbers.  People who buy cars through advertisements could well find that they are not worth the money paid for them.  The amendment is sensible and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that the parliamentary draftsman takes account of the view of the House in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Somewhat the same case has been made for the <Col N="1034" /> inclusion of private sales of cars as was made earlier by both Deputies for the inclusion of houses.  The principle of the Bill is to catch those people who mislead in the course of business or trade.  The inclusion of private sales of cars would not be capable of enforcement. It would be virtually impossible to do so.</P>
      <P>With regard to the description of cars referred to by Deputy Desmond, this would amount to misrepresentation and would be a matter for a civil action by the purchaser.  The market for cars is essentially a buyer's market whereas in the case of houses it is a seller's market.  In the second Bill, the Consumer Protection Bill, there are serious provisions with regard to the sales of cars which would include business sales and private sales.  The provisions include certificates of road-worthiness and guarantees covering all sales, whether private or business. Descriptions by private sellers are not included in this Bill and, therefore, I would be slow to accept that private sales should be included in this measure.  A person is not obliged to buy a car privately.  He can go to a garage or a reputable dealer.  While the argument is somewhat on the same lines as that made in the case of houses, I would not be as sympathetic as I was in the case of houses.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Toole spoke of the many advertisements in the evening newspapers under box numbers.  As the Deputy is aware, another section in the Bill covers box numbers, and trade sales through box numbers will be included in the Bill.  Because of that I would be slow to include private sales of cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary rightly saw the similarity between the case made in this instance and that made with regard to houses. If I interpret her correctly, she relented to some degree in the case of housing in that somewhere between the absolutely private sale of one individual selling his house to another and the big developer selling hundreds of houses there is a person who sells a few houses each year and who will come under the provisions of the Bill. Just as the person selling one, two or <Col N="1035" /> three houses a year is deemed to be in the trade, there are people who sell five or six cars a year from door to door.  Let us consider the position.  As Deputy Desmond rightly pointed out, if an auctioneer sells a car on behalf of a client and the car is not as it was described, he is held responsible.  If a private individual sells the same car and it kills somebody, perhaps due to a mechanical fault, the seller is free. There is no redress for the purchaser. There may be redress under another heading, but this Bill is for the information of the consumer.</P>
      <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary will agree, it is logical to have as much information in this Bill as possible and to cover as many activities as possible. This is the first Bill of its type and we are now having the second bite of the cherry.  When enacted this Bill should be better for having a second run through on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>In refusing to adopt this amendment the Parliamentary Secretary is differentiating between consumers.  This is 1977 and the concept of <i>caveat empter</i> should be left behind, as has happened in other countries.  It is illogical to say that this Bill should not apply to a commodity being disposed of by one type of person while the same commodity will come under this Bill if disposed of by another type of person.</P>

      <P>Subsection (1) says that where a trade description is used in an advertisement in relation to any class of goods, the trade description shall be taken as referring to all goods of that class whether or not in existence at the time the advertisement was published.  How can law enforcement be applied if a company undertake an advertising campaign for a commodity which is not yet on the market?  A commodity could be advertised six months before it comes on sale to the general public.  When it <Col N="1036" /> comes on the market it may not be exactly as it was described in the advertising campaign.  It could happen that it was improved because of technical or similar advice.  Would that type of information be regarded as misleading if a charge was brought by a consumer against the company?</P>

      <P>If an advertiser places an advertisement for a commodity which is not yet on the market and when coming on the market it is improved, obviously the courts would have to decide whether it was a legitimate case or if the advertisement has been misleading.

      <P>This matter was discussed previously.  The definition of &ldquo;service&rdquo; and the question of whether or not the singular or plural form might <Col N="1037" /> be used were discussed before.  I do not see what the improvement in substituting the word &ldquo;services&rdquo; is about because there is a case to be made for allowing the section to stand, as drafted.  I do not want to hold up the proceedings but there was a long discussion on the definition of the words &ldquo;service&rdquo; and &ldquo;services&rdquo; as to whether both or one of them should be applied.  I feel it would be safer if the word &ldquo;service&rdquo; was left because there are cases where the word has a specific meaning&mdash;for example, in the case of CIE giving a &ldquo;service&rdquo; in the form of a rail or bus service, in the singular. For that reason I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary how she will get round the definition of singular &ldquo;service&rdquo; if she substitutes it with the word &ldquo;services&rdquo; there.</P>

    <P>Section 6 (2) (b) sets out to define the word &ldquo;recklessly&rdquo; which is used in section 6 (1) (b).  The effect of the amendment is to ensure that any statement made without positive reasons for believing that it is true will be a reckless statement.  In addition, the point <Col N="1038" /> has been made to me that proving knowledge by a person in section 6 (1) (a) could be too onerous a burden on the prosecution, in which case the prosecution can fall back on the offence of 6 (1) (b) in respect of which the definition now proposed in this amendment is clearer.</P>

      <P>Section 6 (2) (b) concerns the onus of proof.  In discussing this with many people it would seem to be their opinion that the onus of proof should be reversed in this case. The Bill as drafted at present means the prosecutor has to prove that the statement was false, either the defendant knew it was false or made it recklessly within the meaning of (2) (b).  The proof of either of those will depend on facts which are within the knowledge of the defendant and consequently would be difficult to prove. I should like to know the Parliamentary Secretary's reaction to the suggestion that the onus of proof might be changed.</P>

      <P>a statement made regardless of whether it is true or false shall be deemed to be made recklessly, whether or not the person making it had reasons for believing that it might be false.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment contains the phrase &ldquo;unless the person making it had adequate reasons for believing that it was true&rdquo;.  In other words, there is a very basic change here in that, from the original draft of (2) (b), we have the word &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; now included. The word &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; is not in the definition section for the very good reason that, as we are all aware, it is not definable.  It is a discretionary kind of definition which would apply in the case of the word &ldquo;adequate&rdquo;; in other words, what is &ldquo;adequate&rdquo;?  Obviously the courts will have to decide on the <Col N="1039" /> adequacy or lack of adequacy on the part of the person for believing that it was true.  While I have all the respect in the world for our courts and their procedures, this could cause a problem in that there need not be a uniform application in court, or in different courts, because what one person might regard as adequate somebody else might not.  Consequently, the word &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; included there could leave the application of the section open at least to some problems in that it could be at the discretion of a particular person to define what &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; means.  Again, the definition of &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; could be coloured by other circumstances relating to the person himself.  I should like to know how the definition of the word &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; will be approached in practice in the courts.  As the Parliamentary Secretary will appreciate, it is a new concept; we are dealing in something new, which did not arise in the Bill as published and which could cause problems.</P>

      <P>It might be no harm to refer to the fact that the amendment was introduced originally by my predecessor, Deputy O'Toole's colleague.  During a very long debate the whole question of adequacy was dealt with&rdquo;.  Indeed, the question of how adequate is adequate will be a matter that will be up to the courts to decide.  It is not for the Deputy or I to say, to instruct the courts to say or to impose on them our interpretation of the word &ldquo;adequate&rdquo;.  Our courts will use discretion in deciding its meaning. The shifting of the onus of proof in this case to the defendant will mean that the defendant will have to produce his reasons for basing his judgment, and that it will be for the courts then to decide on whether they were adequate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As drafted the provision in subsection (2) could cause difficulties.  In the case of a person buying a commodity which would normally carry an installation charge, the position is clear.  One cannot think of very many commodities in respect of which the installation charge would be included in the cost as indicated by the vendor.  Let us take the case of carpets, for example, for which there is usually a specific charge per yard.  If the cost of laying the carpet is included in the price quoted the position is fine, but under <Col N="1041" /> this section if that cost is not included in the price quoted the question arises as to whether the vendor would be obliged to lay the carpet without charging anything extra.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (f) of subsection (2) can be applied in the case of carpets without much difficulty, but one can think of many other commodities in respect of which ancillary equipment is required and in which very often specialist knowledge is required for installation purposes.  It is in such cases that problems could arise as a result of this paragraph.  For example, a person buying a kitchen sink or a vanity unit for a bedroom would be likely to require the services of a plumber.  In most cases a person selling such commodities will not be the one to install them.  Consequently, the cost of installation cannot be shown at the time of purchase.  In the case of a major electrical appliance, too, there would probably be an installation cost involved and, as in the case of the other items I have mentioned, the vendor in this instance will not be likely to be the one installing the appliance.  If a price in respect of installation is not mentioned in the price quoted for the appliance, does that mean that the purchaser can require the vendor to carry out the installation at his expense?</P>
    <P>There is an area here that is not defined.  In practice dealers selling items in respect of which installation is necessary and which consequently involves extra cost either in respect of ancillary equipment or at installation stage are aware of this extra cost as are the purchasers of such items. If we buy a kitchen sink or a washing machine that must be plumbed into the water mains direct supply, after making some inquiries and having shopped around we become aware of the problems that might arise about water and so on and that we would be faced with installation costs.  If this paragraph were deleted it would ensure that no difficulties would arise. If the section is allowed to stand this could be interpreted as providing that if the price does not include installation costs and there are installation costs the vendor would be responsible for these costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for including the paragraph in the first instance was to get at shopkeepers who quote one price and omit reference to installation.  Deputy O'Toole mentioned carpets and I agree that there is an easy way of overcoming that, but he has made a very reasonable case of where, for instance, a person wishing to buy a bath goes to an ironmonger's sees one price in the window there, and realises that that does not include the installation costs.  If he goes to an ordinary hardware shop in any part of the country he may assume, rightly or wrongly, that the price quoted for the bath there includes installation.  This matter was discussed before on Committee Stage and it is a matter about which I am not happy because, as the Deputy has rightly pointed out, many ancillary things are needed for various items purchased and there may be installation costs involved which we may not be fully aware of.  If the Deputy wishes to withdraw the amendment I might consider it with the one regarding houses on Committee Stage in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 8, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>8.&mdash;(1)  A person shall not publish, or cause to be published, an advertisement in relation to the supply or provision in the course or for the purpose of a trade, business or profession, of goods, services or facilities if it is likely to mislead, and thereby cause loss, damage or injury to members of the public to a material degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1043" /> (2) Any person who contravenes subsection (1) of this section shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>(3) The Director may, upon giving notice of the application to any person against whom the order the subject of the application is sought, apply to the High Court for, and may, at the discretion of that Court, be granted, an order prohibiting the publication, or the further publication, of an advertisement the publication of which is or would be a contravention of subsection (1) of this section.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment makes two changes in section 8; (a) it excludes private or non-business advertisements from the scope of the provision, following the same principle as in the case of the trade descriptions and the sale of goods to which they are applied; (b) it limits the power to seek injunctions restraining advertisements to the Director of Consumer Affairs.  It was formerly proposed in the old section to be available to &ldquo;any person&rdquo;.  If such a right were to be available to any person there is a danger that traders could avail of it to stop their competitors' advertisements or to delay them in such a way as to render them useless.  To prevent this happening it is proposed that any such applications to the High Court should be possible only with the approval of the Director of Consumer Affairs in writing.  The Attorney General has advised, however, that that would be undesirable because such a provision in creating a new right would limit this new right &mdash;which would be of a public rather than a private nature&mdash;to cases where the Director of Consumer Affairs gave consent, and thus perhaps involve judicial functions by the director who would have power to prevent a citizen from having access to the courts.  This new right, though undesirable would not be unconstitutional because it would not affect existing rights.</P>
    <P>There would also be an administrative burden on the director and problems of a legal nature would place him in an invidious position. <Col N="1044" /> For instance, he might be obliged to give reasons to the courts for the refusal of his client's consent and these reasons could be the subject of challenge in the courts and there could be criticism in the courts also in cases where he had given consent.  Therefore, as it is not possible to ensure that this power would be confined to <i>bona fide</i> cases if available to any person and as it is considered adequate for the preventive measure in mind, it is necessary to confine its use to the Director of Consumer Affairs himself.</P>

      <P>The proposed substitution will narrow the field of access to the courts.  Section 8 (3) (a) says:</P>
      <P>Any person may, upon giving notice of the application to any person against whom the order the subject of the application is sought, apply to the High Court for, and may, at the discretion of that Court, be granted, an order prohibiting the publication.....</P>

      <P>(3) The Director may, upon giving notice of the application to any person against whom the order the subject of the application is sought, apply to the High Court for, and may, at the discretion of that Court, be granted, an order prohibiting the publication....</P>
      <P>This narrows the field very much.  I presume that, in any case, regardless of what is said here, any person would still have access to the courts in the normal way whether or not that access is now open to him as a result of section 8 (3).  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to comment on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the ordinary individual having access to the courts, if he or she thought that an advertisement was misleading or could cause damage either to himself or to somebody else, what is the position?  Does it have to <Col N="1045" /> be the director who will bring the prosecution?  We will be discussing the creation of the director in section 9, but at the moment if a person turns out to be an aggrieved party as a result of misleading information can that person go into court or is it confined to the director to go in on behalf of that person and have charges brought against the misleading advertiser? If that is so it is a major departure from section 8 as it was meant to operate and it would be a step detrimental to the interests of the ordinary consumer.  I would like a further explanation from the Parliamentary Secretary on it.</P>

      <P>Under the old section 8 the definition of any person going to court meant that in fact only a person who was aggrieved or who had been affected personally by a misleading advertisement or trade description could go into the court. Under the new section any person who feels that an advertisement is misleading or to whose attention it is brought that a trade description has been misleading, whether in fact it affects himself or herself personally, has the right to go to the Director of Consumer Affairs.

      <P>All this depends on the director.  So far we have only had the definition of the word &ldquo;director&rdquo;. Section 9 will determine whether or not this is acceptable.  I am not suggesting that it is unworkable or might not work well but I strongly object to the consumers at large being denied the right, if they feel they have a case, to go into court without having to be routed through the director's office.  If subsection (3) of this section is allowed stand as it is consumers' grievances and action taken as a result of their <Col N="1046" /> grievances will be a discretionary power on the part of the director.  I can see all types of difficulties arising here.</P>
      <P>For example, if the director feels that a particular consumer or a particular category or group are cranks or may be annoying him for other reasons he may very well not accept their grievance as being a genuine one and he may not process it through the judicial channels, even though that grievance may be entitled to that treatment.  The director has a biased view of what that consumer is, or that group of consumers are complaining about.  The power is being centralised in the hands of this new officer.  It is taking the teeth out of section 8 as it originally stood.  While the original section 8 was not quite satisfactory it at least gave broad access to the ordinary man in the street to bring his grievance to court and it was up to the court to decide whether or not he had a grievance.  They acted accordingly in the case of advertising.</P>
      <P>That basic right has been taken from the consumer who may be genuinely aggrieved or damaged by somebody.  Under this Bill he will not be able to bring his grievance to the appropriate authority.  He must channel it through somebody on whose discretion he will depend.  I am not saying that this director will say to everybody coming before him: &ldquo;Do not bother me&rdquo; but there is danger in giving him that kind of power that this will arise.  I agree that the director must have powers and he must have the means of applying them but if this is to be at the expense of the individual aggrieved consumer I am against that kind of approach.</P>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary saying that there is no way in which I, if I am an aggrieved or damaged individual, can go to the court and sidestep the Office of Consumer Affairs? Am I at the mercy of the Director of Consumer Affairs?  Am I in the position that he may say to me: &ldquo;I do not like the colour of your eyes so I will not process your claim?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not think, basically, that there is any great <Col N="1047" /> difference between my amendment and Deputy O'Toole's because both amendments are in connection with any member of the public applying to the courts.  The amendment proposed by Deputy O'Toole states that the public can apply but only with the director's consent.  My amendment states that a member of the public can apply to the director and then only the director can apply to the court. The old section 8 was fine and we could have left it in the Bill if we were sure that the power which the section gave would be confined to <i>bona fide</i> cases.  The point can rightly be made that if such a right was available to any person there was a danger that traders might avail of it in order to curb advertisement by an opposite trader or to delay competitors so much as to make their advertisements useless.</P>
      <P>The view has been held that it should be open to any person to apply to the High Court for an injunction to prevent the publication of an advertisement which was misleading and by virtue of the fact that it was misleading that it would injure the interests of the public. This proposition obviously departs from the general principle which normally operates that only a person who is affected by an issue may bring that issue to the courts.  I cannot see adequate justification at present for changing that situation.  There could well be a concealed personal interest as regards one trader in competition with another one where this could be abused.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Toole also made the point about leaving a consumer at the mercy of the director, that if he were biased against a certain person or felt the person was a trouble maker and was not interested in the public interests or in correcting a misleading advertisement, that person was at the mercy of a man or woman, whoever the director may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 9 the Minister has considerable powers where the director is concerned.  We will discuss this when we come to the section.  One of them is that if he has adequate reason to feel that the director is not carrying out his functions properly&mdash;obviously the instance Deputy O'Toole has given <Col N="1048" /> would be one of them&mdash;that he is performing his duties in a biased way then the Minister would have power to remove the director if he felt these reasons were sufficient for his removal.</P>
    <P>The amendment I proposed and the amendment Deputy O'Toole proposed are not all that different.  Under the ministerial amendment any member of the public can bring a misleading advertisement or a complaint to the attention of the director and it is up to the director to proceed or not to proceed. Under Deputy O'Toole's amendment any member of the public could bring the case before the courts himself but would have to have the director's consent in writing.  Basically there is very little difference between them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On the surface I agree it would seem the difference is slight between the ministerial amendment and my amendment.  The major difference lies in who and what the director will be.  I have not legal training, but I would strongly question the denial of the right of the individual to go to court under this Bill if he felt sufficiently aggrieved or damaged.  I understand that under the Constitution people have the right to do that if they feel so aggrieved.</P>
      <P>The difference between my amendment and the ministerial amendment basically is &ldquo;with the consent in writing of the Director of Consumer Affairs&rdquo;.  I sought to allow the individual to go to court, but to keep out the vexatious type of complainer who by nature would enjoy himself doing that kind of thing.  The director would have to give possibly a very superficial look at the matter to see what chance it had of succeeding and his consent in writing would be necessary.  The director would not be processing the claim through the court.  Having given his consent, that would be a matter for the individual.  That is the basic difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to my amendment the consumer would not be left at the mercy of the director, or the claim would not depend on the director's discretion. Under my amendment the director could ensure that a business <Col N="1049" /> competitor would not be allowed to go into court and promulgate something false or wrong about his opposite number.  It would safeguard that kind of complaint.  It would safeguard the courts from having to deal with cranks, professional complainers, if you like.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment denies the right of the individual to have direct access to the court if he thinks his grievance warrants that action.  That is wrong.  It denies him a basic right.  The Parliamentary Secretary may say that person will have access to the court.  He may, but not under this Bill.  I am all for this new Director of Consumer Affairs being all things to all men but, if that is to result in the denial of the rights of the individual consumer, I would not be at all happy.</P>
    <P>It may well be that after section 9 has been discussed we will discover exactly what this new creation will be and that I will be happy with section 8 (3) as proposed by the Minister but, as of now, I have very great doubts about the effectiveness of subsection (3).  My amendment will obviate the necessity for the courts having to deal with vexatious complaints not motivated by the highest ideals.  The director's consent in writing would obviate the necessity for having to deal with that type of thing.  I wanted to cut that type of time-wasting effort and professional cribbers bringing actions for reasons best known to themselves.  The director would very quickly decide on the <i>bona fides</i> of such a person.</P>
    <P>At the moment everybody must go to the director that in hand and we will come to the stage of: &ldquo;An bhfuil cead agam dul amach, a mháistir no a mháistreás?&rdquo;  The Consumer Association of Ireland, the Irish housewives, the ICA, and many other groups, as consumers are concerned in an organised way about different things. What happens if they feel they have a case to make and the director turns them down?  The Parliamentary Secretary may say that if a genuine complaint came from that type of responsible group he would not turn it down, but there is always that possibility.  It depends on the kind of person he will be.</P>
    <P>Not having discussed section 9 we <Col N="1050" /> are in the dark.  If we accept this without complaint or without knowing what is in store for us in section 9, it will be like buying a pig in a poke. I hope the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will excuse my ignorance of procedure, but I wonder would it be possible to defer discussion on section 8 (3) until we know what is in store for us in section 9, because the implementation or application of section 8 will depend to a large degree on section 9?</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that there is an area of doubt here which may or may not be cleared up as a result of the discussion on section 9?  I would suggest that, despite what may come after section 9, there is a major shift in section 8 (3) and something should be done to ensure that the individual has a right to take action in court if he feels so aggrieved without having to go through this nebulous person, at the moment, the director, which may nor may not be the best way to approach it.  Could we get any indication that, as a result of the Parliamentary Secretary having a look at this again, hopefully the individual might be given the right&mdash;in other words, having a look at section 8 (3) (a) as it stands and the proposed subsection (3)?</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Toole says that the director's consent in writing to be given before an application to the High Court is made would only necessitate a superficial look by the director but I do not think that would be the case because constitutionally the director would, in fact, have to give good reasons for his refusal to consent, if he refused, and good reasons for his consent, if he consented, because either might be questioned in subsequent court proceedings. This whole section 8 has been the subject of grave deliberation by me, as it was by my predecessor, and there have been several discussions with the Attorney General about the section since we were worried about the implications in the old section 8 and how best the new section might be fitted in.  If the director were to allow an individual to approach the court the court might well criticise the director for not appreciating that the matter was sufficiently serious to justify the director himself going to court.  On the other hand, if the director refused his consent it might be held he was preventing a citizen's right of access to the court.  The director will be a specialist in this whole area and he will, therefore, obviously be the most effective person to bring a case before the court and, no matter which amendment is accepted, cases which the director thinks should go to court will go and those which he thinks should not go to court will not go.</P>

      <P>Before proceeding to the amendment there is a minor matter which might create quite a number of problems later. Members will note that in line 7, the first line of section 9, the word &ldquo;office&rdquo; appears.  The initial letter of the word &ldquo;office&rdquo; in this line was a capital &ldquo;O&rdquo; in the first print of the Bill.  On Committee Stage in the last Dáil it was changed to a small &ldquo;o&rdquo; and, as the practice is to revive a Bill as it stood at the start of the Committee proceedings in the last Dáil, &ldquo;office&rdquo; in this print should have a capital &ldquo;O&rdquo;.  However, if the House agrees, I think the best course is to regard it as a small &ldquo;o&rdquo; requiring no amendment.  Is that agreed?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 11 to 15, to delete subsections (2) and (3) and to substitute the following subsections:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The office of Director shall be a position in the Civil Service and no person shall be appointed to the office unless the Civil Service Commissioners, within the meaning of the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, after holding a competition under section 15 of that Act, <Col N="1053" /> have, under section 17 of that Act, selected him for appointment to the office.</P>
    <P>(3)  A person appointed to be the Director shall hold office for a period of five years but the Minister may, if he thinks fit, continue the appointment (including the appointment previously continued under this subsection) for such further period not exceeding five years as he considers appropriate.</P>
    <P>(4) (a)  The Director may be removed from office at any time by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(b)  If the Director is removed from office under this subsection, the Minister shall cause to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas a statement of the reasons for the removal.</P>
    <P>This is the section on which Deputy O'Toole had all the points to make on the previous section.  The provisions of subsections (2) and (3) that the director should be an officer of the Minister, a serving civil servant who could be removed at any time, were felt to be too restrictive and allow of too little status or effectiveness to the director. This amendment will ensure that (a) he will be selected from the widest possible range of candidates available; (b) that his appointment will be for a fixed term; (c) that the Minister cannot remove the director from office without reasons acceptable to the Oireachtas&mdash;such a removal would be from the office of director only and not necessarily from the civil service&mdash; and (d) if the Minister removes the director his successor must also be chosen by the Civil Service Commissioners in accordance with these provisions. The successor cannot be selected by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will recall that when this matter was being discussed in the last Dáil, Deputy O'Malley, Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy now, made a very strong case&mdash;in fact he fought tooth and nail&mdash;about where the Director of Consumer Affairs ought to be, whether inside or outside the public service, and he gave umpteen reasons why he should be outside <Col N="1054" /> the public service.  The shoe is now on the other foot and the shoe must obviously have squeezed because the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary find it impossible to have the director outside the public service. Under subsection (2) &ldquo;The office of Director shall be a position in the Civil Service&rdquo;.  While I appreciate the appointment is in line with my amendment it will be as a result of a recommendation by the Civil Service Commissioners following on an open competition and the appointee, though he will come from the widest possible base, will end up in the civil service acting as a civil servant.  I said earlier that I hoped at the end of the discussion on this section we would have some idea of the kind of office that would be set up.</P>
      <P>To my mind the office is more important than the personage appointed to the office.  While the person appointed is very important, naturally, the overall approach in this must be whether this person will have the wherewithal in terms of backup service and finance to give the service which the consumer expects and desires without constraint from other considerations. From the proposed amendment it would seem that this person will be a civil servant.  Here we are entering an area of delicacy in one sense but I think it best to call a spade a spade. It is widely felt inside and outside the House that what is required in this office is a person who will crusade on behalf of the consumer and, I may add, also in the interests of the manufacturers and traders, the vast majority of those people in whose interest that person will also be acting.  He will be acting against the small minority who cause all the trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that small minority who cause damage through exploitation, misrepresentation or misdescription in the advertising of their commodities there is also the ugly spectacle of monopolies.  We have those, and whether the word &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo; has dirty connotations in that it gives the impression of exploitation by that monopoly due to it being a monopoly is another matter.  There are areas of life that are governed by monopolies and they do not seem to exploit us. <Col N="1055" /> We do not know because the problem with monopolies is that we have nothing to compare them with.</P>
    <P>This director will be a civil servant, it seems, and in regard to monopolies the problem is that most, if not all, our monopolies are State monopolies. We have P &amp; T, the transport system, the ESB, gas supplies, air lines&mdash;one can read holidays for air lines&mdash;the National Building Agency, sugar&mdash; provision thereof is a monopoly&mdash;Board na Móna, cement&mdash;there is supposed to be some competition there, I understand. There are many others but all these are State-owned companies engaged in the manufacture of commodities or in providing a service.  Some of them act very ruthlessly and there is nothing we can do about it.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the spectacle of a civil servant as director of consumer affairs.  As a civil servant he is within the mechanism of the State; he is part of the infrastructure; he is within; he is a cog in the wheel and all the monopolies I have mentioned are cogs in the same wheel.  The problem I can see for the director himself as a person, and for his office as an office, in bringing complaints to the stage where the aggrieved party can get redress, is one that will cause him great difficulty because, I think, of his being part of the State structure as a public servant within the civil service.</P>
    <P>Recently, I saw a heading: &ldquo;First Consumer Council Near Collapse&rdquo; in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 29th October, over an article by the consumer affairs editor, John Foley.  It said that the first consumer council for a public utility, the Post Office Users Council was on the verge of collapse barely three years after it was set up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will consider the present attitude of the Government towards the inclusion of civics on the secondary school courses; if he considers it desirable that civics should form a much more basic part of the secondary school course than at present; and whether it might be included in the Leaving Certificate as an examination subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Civics is compulsory in secondary schools up to the intermediate certificate.  The Syllabus Committee for Civics, which includes representatives of the Department, teacher's associations and school management, have always advised that civics should not be a subject for public examination. The reason for this is that the basic purpose of civics is to foster social awareness and a sense of social responsibility, along with appropriate social attitudes and habits.  It has been thought that a public examination in civics would inevitably shift the teaching emphasis from attitudes, habits and awareness to the memorisation of facts, and to a shift in methodology from inquiry and activist learning to a more academic approach to the subject.</P>
      <P>I consider that the views of the Syllabus Committee deserve to be given due weight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the implications for other subjects in the Minister's reply in relation to what the examinations system would purport to be doing to them, would the Minister accept that because of the present situation and because of the low priority it has in schools, civics is very much a charade?  Would he not agree that in many cases it is omitted totally from the syllabus and the time with which civics should be taken up, is occupied by examination subjects and that the noble attributes in the Minister's reply are not being dealt with at all in some schools and are being dealt with most inadequately in others?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that there is cause for concern about the manner in which civics is taught in relation to the priority it has in the average timetable of schools and with the effect which this would undoubtedly have in trying to inculcate a respect among our young people for our institutions?  Would the Minister also accept that civics is particularly important in view of recent events, particularly the reduction of the voting age, and in view of the on-coming European elections?  Young people need to be encouraged to take an interest in civic affairs.  Would the Minister accept that in many cases that aim has been supplanted by an examination factor?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education the number of (a) one-teacher and (b) two-teacher primary schools in operation; and if he will state Government policy in relation to the continuance of these schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>On 30th September, 1976, the latest date for which statistics are available, there were 172 one-teacher and 1,135 two-teacher schools in operation.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that no new one-or two-teacher schools should be built except in exceptional circumstances, for example, on islands or where there is a small number of children of a particular denomination who cannot otherwise be suitably catered for. Where amalgamation is pending, no grants are available to modernise small schools by providing electricity for heating and light and water for lavatories and other sanitary facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate his policy in relation to existing one-and two-teacher primary schools?  Does he intend to amalgamate more of these schools in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy could gather from my reply that I consider one-and two-teacher schools to be inadequate in the context of the new curriculum in primary schools.  The Deputy mentioned technology, which is one aspect of the matter.  We cannot provide expensive technological aids in a scatter of small schools.  There are many other facilities which we cannot provide where the schools are very small.  This being so, it is not my intention to build any more two-teacher schools.</P>

      <P>In view of the Minister's belief that exceptional circumstances can exist where there is a <Col N="1067" /> small number of people of a particular denomination, would he accept that exceptional circumstances might exist in regard to a small number of people with a particular linguistic attitude, for example, towards the need for schools in the Irish language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>For the future my Department will continue to initiate action in these cases of amalgamation but their role will be to discuss the pros and cons with the local interests in each area in the light of the particular situation in that area.  Where local people wish to retain the existing small schools that position will be accepted by my Department and where appropriate grants will be made available to modernise schools.  That statement was made by my predecessor and I agree with it.  I agree that where amalgamations had already started we continue with it but that we consult wherever there are any other difficulties.  Where money has already been spent there is no question of going back.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 11 and 12 together.  Permission to close schools on Monday, 3rd October, 1977 was given to managerial authorities of schools in that part of the Archdiocese of Armagh, which is in the Republic of Ireland.  I regret that I could not give it for the parts in Armagh and Tyrone.  The managements that closed schools as a result of the GIS statement are being authorised to regard the day &ldquo;as a day of exceptional closing&rdquo;.  Permission to close schools on certain religious occasions is normally given at the request of the religious authorities and it would not be possible for me to specify such occasions as might arise in the future.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that the amendment of Article 44 of the Constitution has any relevance to the granting of permission for the closing of schools for particular occasions.</P>

      <P>I have a great friend down there, Paddy McMahon, and I would not like him to be uncomfortable, so what I say here is that I will be able to approve the revised sketch scheme as a basis for proceeding to the next stage planning, namely the preparation of the developed sketch scheme.  We are taking steps as quickly as possible towards building the extension.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a state of mind approaching <Col N="1082" /> panic among the people who live in the area which this school would serve as time goes marching on&mdash;I realise the Minister has not been there very long&mdash;and the school still is not appearing?  Is he aware also that the child population in the primary school has grown from 200 in 1965 to nearly 1,500 today?  What would he advise local representatives to tell the people who are in this quite justified state of panic about where to send their children who live on a road where there is no other school between Enniskerry and Dublin.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that a site was purchased for the school.  It was discovered that a large water main was running through a section of that site and this discovery meant that extra space had to be purchased which delayed getting the school under way. Negotiations are proceeding for the acquisition of that site.  As somebody said earlier at Question Time, that kind of site is very expensive.  There has not been final acceptance of my Department's offer for the site but we are pushing ahead as fast as we can to get the additional accommodation and get going on the school.</P>

      <P>I just want to ask the Minister two more questions.  Is the <Col N="1083" /> Minister saying&mdash;I do not want to trap him into something which will embarrass him&mdash;that the obstacle lies in the unwillingness of the vendors to accept what the Department are now offering?  That is one question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 22 together.  The basis for ministerial action in relation to national schools is set out in the rules and regulations which are made by the Minister for Education with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  Authority for such rules and regulations was conveyed by Government, with the agreement of Parliament, in 1831 to a body to be known and later incorporated as the Commissioners of National Education. This authority was confirmed by annual appropriations of public funds to be expended by the commissioners. Authority in these matters became vested in the Minister for Education under the Ministers and Secretaries Act of 1924.  Arrangements for the <Col N="1085" /> local management of national schools and for local contribution towards their establishment has been a feature of the system since its beginnings in 1831.</P>

      <Col N="1093" /> The total of 379 qualified guidance teachers at present employed in post-primary schools is distributed as follows: 245 in 242 secondary schools; 102 in 95 vocational schools; 13 in 10 comprehensive schools; 19 in 18 community schools.</P>
    <P>All of the 379 qualified guidance teachers at present serving in post-primary schools are employed on a whole-time basis.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Before lunch we were dealing with section 9 and the Minister's proposed amendment.  I referred to the problems that might arise if the director were a public servant and it would appear from the amendment that that is the intention.  While I would be slow to point the finger at the director as a civil servant, difficulties will arise if this new director is from the public service.  I referred to the constraints that would be on him when dealing with State bodies.  I listed some instances of State enterprises where he would find it difficult to act without having restraints put on his activities.</P>
      <P>I was about to mention what happened in the case of a consumer council which was referred to on 30th October, 1977, in the <i>Irish Independent</i> by John Foley, Consumer Affairs Editor.  In quoting one of those members he said:</P>
      <P>Nobody knows we exist and the council is dying a slow death.  Many of us are giving up in frustration.</P>
      <P>That council did not have any teeth. They did not have any function to deal with the kernel of the problem with regard to Posts and Telegraphs, that is, the type of service given and the cost. These two areas are outside the duties of this council because they come directly under the aegis of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned State bodies as monopolies&mdash;in the manufacturing sphere there are the Sugar Company, Bord na Móna and so on, or in the giving of a service, such as the ESB, CIE and so on.  The Post Office Users' Council failed.  I would like to draw attention to their activities and show why they <Col N="1103" /> were ineffective in protecting the consumer. The Post Office is a State body giving a service.  What hope has the consumer if this new director is merely a cog in the wheel of State bureaucracy? When the Post Office send a bill they need not, and do not, give an itemised account under certain headings. This is the only area I know of where anybody may demand payment without giving an itemised account. We all know the difficulties that arise if we question the validity of a telephone bill.  This is an area where I presume the director would have some function but because he is in the service, and human nature being what it is, I presume he would find it difficult to follow this through to its logical conclusion.</P>
    <P>As we all know, the ESB arbitrarily cut off supply from a household.  This is nothing short of what I would call commercial tyranny.  At least they provide a meter and there is some redress in that the meter tells the truth.  This power to cut off supplies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to establish the problems that will arise when the Director of Consumer Affairs, who is a public servant, is dealing with problems in State monopolies.  Most monopolies in Ireland are State monopolies. Last week a Fianna Fáil Senator suggested in the Upper House that we create a further monopoly&mdash;a biscuit monopoly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the director is to be effective he must, first of all, be above suspicion.  I want to reiterate that to my mind his civil service status is no reason why the finger of suspicion should point to him. According to this amendment he will be a civil servant and there is a grave danger that as he is part of the bureaucratic infrastructure of the State he will find it extremely difficult to act fairly on behalf of the consumer.  While he might find it easy to act fairly he would probably find it difficult to act in the kind of practical manner that would result in some redress for an aggrieved party.  Deputy O'Malley while in Opposition made a very <Col N="1104" /> strong case during the debate earlier this year for this approach.  Presumably the pressures of office have been brought to bear on him because he now puts forward an amendment which is the opposite to what he was advocating then.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with the appointment of a director does not specify the type of person to be appointed. I appreciate that it would be difficult to do this in drafting the Bill, but could we not amend section 9 in a way that would tell us something about the office of the director&mdash;for instance, what facilities will be made available to him to enable him to carry out his duties?  We are told that he shall be independent in relation to the performance of his functions.  That is a laudable objective, but we must be practical about it.  A public servant, by reason of his being within the public service, would be restricted in anything he might do.  It is important, too, that the office of the director carry with it a proper back-up service and, most important, that a budget be designed for the director.  Otherwise, he will be ineffective and hamstrung. There is no mention of these matters in the Bill.  While there are references to the functions to be performed, there is no information regarding the facilities that will be made available for this purpose.  Without a budget the director would not be able to act freely.  Rather, he would be looking over his shoulder at his colleagues within the civil service for guidance.  That sort of situation would be totally unsatisfactory and would be of no benefit to aggrieved consumers.</P>
    <P>I agree with the proposal that the appointment be made by the Civil Service Commission, but that need not necessarily mean that the person appointed shall be a civil servant.  Indeed, I would urge strongly that the director be someone who is not a civil servant; but it may happen that on the basis of their interviews the commission may decide to appoint a person who is a public servant.  In such event I would suggest that what would apply then would be the reverse of what is provided for in the Bill.  I <Col N="1105" /> can appreciate that this would give rise to certain difficulties.  A civil servant is a permanent official with certain pension and gratuity rights, but it should not be outside the bounds of possibility to arrange that in the event of a civil servant being appointed to this office there would be built-in guarantees with regard to these issues. I expect that the Parliamentary Secretary would be advised by her officials in the Department that an impossible situation would arise so far as they were concerned in the event of somebody from outside the public service being appointed and remaining outside the public service.  Civil servants would probably think in terms of insurmountable difficulties in respect of grading and so on, but such difficulties should be capable of being overcome.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a person from outside the public service would ensure that the director would not be subject to the restraints, imaginary or otherwise, that would be placed on an appointee from within the civil service. The person from outside would be in a position to act more independently and there would be the question also of the Minister having the right at any time to dismiss the director.  Traditionally public servants are jealous of their status within the public service and I am sure that the chances would be nil of a stage being reached where a specific approach on the part of the director would draw the wrath of the Minister of the day. In any logical argument the balance would seem to indicate that the person appointed should be from outside the public service.  Such a person would be able to react more quickly, not necessarily more favourably, to public reaction and to consumer interest and consumer demands be they unorganised or organised, if he were one of themselves.  While the type of person to be appointed is of major significance, the office which he holds is more important still.  No matter who is appointed, what status he is given or whether he reposes inside or outside the public service, unless he is given the wherewithal, which means adequate finance and personnel, he will not be in a position to act and carry out his functions on behalf of the consumer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill as originally drafted provided that the Minister was to nominate an officer of his own Department&mdash;that would be the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy&mdash;to be the director.  Following considerable pressure from the former Deputy O'Malley, now Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, the proposed amendment which is now before the House was introduced by my predecessor, Deputy O'Toole's colleague. Under this amendment it is provided that a public competition will be held, that is a competition open to the whole country, in which civil servants and non-civil servants from every walk of life would be free to apply for the position of Director of Consumer Affairs when the position is advertised. However, it does provide that on appointment as Director of Consumer Affairs the person will then become a civil servant.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill as drafted originally the director was to have been an officer of the Minister.  This would mean in effect that, although it was the intention originally that he should be as independent as possible, he would in fact or in law derive his authority from the general direction which would be given to him by the Minister. However, at the discussion on Second Stage and after Deputy O'Malley's suggestion at the time, this amendment was brought in.  Under the amendment the director will be the holder of a statutory post and will derive his authority from the powers which will be given to him under this Consumer Information Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These two changes which are brought in in this amendment will ensure that the director himself will be independent. I think this is the main thing which concerns Deputy O'Toole.  He seems to have doubts as to whether the person, whether he be a civil servant or not at the beginning, on his appointment as civil servant, would be able to perform his functions independently. He will be a civil servant but he will not be an officer of the Minister.  Therefore his powers <Col N="1107" /> will be not those derived from the Minister and not directions given by the Minister to him as director, but powers which are being given to him under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the subtlety that this House is giving this new creation the powers to carry out certain functions but this House has not the power to dismiss this new creation.  That rests with the Minister, and in that sense there is a contradiction here in that the Minister takes unto himself the power of dismissal while he does not have the power of appointment.  I am not suggesting that because this person is a civil servant the finger of suspicion and compromise points to him.  But, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, the traditional outlook of civil servants in this country is that they carry out their functions to the best of their ability under the political head of their respective Departments.  It is strange that the Minister in this case, while <Col N="1108" /> he does not have the appointment of this creature, has the power to dismiss him.  Even though this House sets up the machinery through which this person is appointed, this House subsequently in the case of dismissal is simply told that Mr. So-and-So was dismissed last Friday because of a, b, c and d.  I do not know if even a, b, c and d are necessary.</P>
      <P>Subsection (4) (b) of the amendment refers to &ldquo;a statement of the reasons for the removal&rdquo;.  There is something contradictory here, and with this diehard approach of this person having to be a civil servant we should take a fresh look at this whole area.  We are breaking new ground here in this Bill. The Parliamentary Secretary says that other consumer Bills will follow and I would hate to think that the whole of our consumer legislation would be centralised in a Department or in the State structure.  We are dealing here with matters which concern everybody. We are dealing with consumer information in this Bill.  The provisions of this Bill would be much more appreciated by the consumer bodies and by the consumers in general if they could say: &ldquo;Here we have a man speaking on our behalf, one of ourselves, outside the trammels of State bureaucracy, making our case for us.&rdquo;  They would have confidence in this type of person and with him they would not be in a position to say: &ldquo;Well, he failed because he was a civil servant.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am speaking now on behalf of the civil servants.  If anything goes wrong with this appointment, who is going to shoulder the blame?  The public service, because he is one of them. It is a question of &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo; and there are more of &ldquo;us&rdquo; than &ldquo;them&rdquo;.  I am not trying to make a political point here because we are all concerned that we get in this Bill the optimum advantage on behalf of the consumer.  I do not believe that at any time it crossed anybody's mind in the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy that this person should be outside their ranks.  The whole thinking is that he should be inside their ranks and anyone outside of that would be anathema to them.  It is a kind of <Col N="1109" /> closed shop affair, not that it may result in any grave disadvantage to the consumer.  I feel on balance that this person should be from outside.  Not alone must he be independent but he must be seen to be independent.</P>
    <P>As things stand in the amendment this person may be independent but to the ordinary man in the street he may not be seen to be so.  This is one of the problems with our present approach to such matters as the appointment of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  We should let a little bit of fresh air into the whole structure and see if it will work.  Subsection (2) of the amendment states: &ldquo;The office of Director shall be a position in the Civil Service ...&rdquo;.  If that were left open it would let a little bit of fresh air into this section.  If at the end of the day the person appointed turns out to be the best man or woman for the job and turns out to be in the civil service, fair enough, but it should not be written into the Bill that the person must be in the civil service.</P>
    <P>It may well turn out that some time in the future a crusader on behalf of consumers generally may appear on the horizon and it might be seen to everybody that this is the person that is needed.  We should not tie ourselves down in legislation which will last for years to come that this person must be a civil servant.  We should not write that into the Bill.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to have another look at this between now and Report Stage or on Committee Stage in the Seanad to see if it is possible to get over some of the practical difficulties with which I know she is confronted. I have a feeling that in State Departments it is not possible to do something like this.  If the Parliamentary Secretary can convince her officials that it might be possible with careful scrutiny to do this she will be going a very long way to satisfying the needs of the consumers and she might start a trend in the public structure that will lead to greater things.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Toole spoke about bringing fresh air into legislation.  I feel this is what <Col N="1110" /> this amendment is about.  If we left the section as it was originally in the Bill the Director of Consumer Affairs would virtually be under the Minister's thumb.  The Minister, whatever Minister of the day he might be, could direct the director to carry out his duties in a particular manner or he could direct or not direct him to bring a case before the courts.  Under this amendment one of the limitations on the director's freedom is that the Minister has the power to dismiss him.  I am sorry that I may have misled the Deputy when I said that he will not have to consult the Oireachtas.  In fact, he cannot remove the director from office without first presenting sufficient reason to both Houses of the Oireachtas for so doing.  The second limitation is the Minister's power not to reappoint him.</P>
      <P>I believe both of these things are very important because in the event of something going wrong somewhere and the wrong person being appointed to the office of director, which may become evident immediately after his appointment or it may be two or three years before this becomes evident, if the Minister did not have this power we would saddle the country with a person who was incapable of carrying out his duties, whether he had a personal problem or whether it was a bias, as the Deputy mentioned earlier. It is very important that the Minister's power in this be upheld.  If the country was saddled with some person totally unsuitable the Act would become inoperable. I feel that the powers are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's powers are limited because if he thinks the director has to be dismissed he must present sufficient reasons to both Houses of the Oireachas for his dismissal.  It may be well to remember that at present holders of statutory posts under this Department who are civil servants have not received and do not receive any instructions from the Minister as to how they should carry out their duties. These holders are the Controller of Patents, the Examiner of Restrictive Practices and the Registrar of Companies. While I feel that Deputy O'Toole has made a very reasonable <Col N="1111" /> case I do not honestly see that anything can be gained by deciding at this stage that the director should not become a civil servant.  It is important to remember that the competition will be open to every member of the public, male and female, who wants to apply and, therefore, the widest possible range of candidates can and, I am sure, will apply when it comes up for appointment.  The person may be from within the civil service and probably may not but I feel it is important on his appointment that he should become a civil servant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to see that this appointment is not to be a political one.  It is a further example of the openness of the policies of the Government.  Deputy O'Toole was very concerned about this person being a member of the civil service.  We should bear in mind that we are not establishing a pressure group.  We are establishing a body and a director who is to investigate and see that we are given the information necessary to understand what is happening in the trade description advertisements and various other factors which affect consumer information.</P>
      <P>It is very important to have somebody who is clearly seen to have integrity and objectivity and to have an overriding reasonable approach because we must bear in mind the very conflicting and varied interests which are part of the whole consumer, producer and middleman scene.  On the other hand, it is important to bear in mind that there is great scope for further development in the area of consumer representation.  There is scope for development between the producers and the consumers.  Basically the interests of the producer and the consumer are very much akin, but the changes which take place between the original production and the ultimate retail consumption can be very hard to distinguish and identify and can give great scope for misrepresentation, misunderstanding and misinformation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially in most producer situations as we find them, the cost of production can be fairly readily established and monitored.  Basically the <Col N="1112" /> consumer is interested in fair practice and fair and reasonable costs.  If the consumer can be informed properly and truly of the reasonable costs, the consumer will have the best deal he or she can get.  Very frequently the inefficiencies arise in the various chains of distribution, and sometimes they are only inefficiencies in the system of distribution.  At other times there may be a question of excessive margin taking.  This is the area where the greatest concentration of effort will be required by the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    <P>On the point made about the civil service, we should look at what has been happening in recent years.  As far as the work of the Department of Agriculture is concerned in the fruit and vegetable area, it is quite clear that standards have been improved tremendously over the past number of years. With painstaking and very difficult work by the staff carrying out the instructions of the personnel within that Department, there have been tremendous advances.  Of course, there is scope for further considerable improvement; but this work has been done by people who can be clearly seen to be objective in their approach, and their objectivity was one of the key factors in their success with the consumers, retailers and producers.  There is a need for diversification, if you like, and the further development of consumer bodies and organisations.  It is to these organisations that consumers should look for the very strong pressure groups some people seem to be thinking of at this stage.</P>
    <P>The question of monopolies was raised.  Here again this amendment makes the director answerable to the Minister.  This gives Deputies scope for seeking information from the Minister on the operation of the Bill in practice. I would hope, as Deputy O'Toole hopes, that the director will have considerable freedom of action and be given staff, finance and access to information to enable him to do a worthwhile job not only on behalf of the consumers but of all of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

She said the Minister must give reasons to this House prior to his removal from office.  The subsection provides:</P>
      <P>If the Director is removed from office under this subsection, the Minister shall cause to be laid, before each House of the Oireachtas a statement of the reasons for the removal.</P>
      <P>There is nothing there to suggest the Minister must come in here and give reasons for the removal prior to his removal from office.  I should like to have that clarified because, if there is nothing in the Bill which would suggest this is so, I should like to know what would happen in the event of this House deciding otherwise than what the Minister thinks.  It could be rather awkward and I should like to have that matter cleared up.</P>
      <P>I should also like further clarification. Would it be possible for the Parliamentary Secretary to elucidate what type of back-up service she has in mind for the new Director of Consumer Affairs and to what extent finance will be available for the carrying out of his functions?</P>

      <P>The Minister is required under the Act to place before the House the reasons for which he feels it is necessary to dismiss the Director of Consumer Affairs from office.  He is not, in fact, required to present a resolution to this effect to the House.  Whoever the Opposition spokesman of the time might be if this were to arise&mdash;and it may never arise &mdash;it would be open to him to submit a resolution to the House which may be accepted by the Ceann Comhairle of the day.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am trying to ascertain is this.  When is the Minister obliged under subsection (4) (b) to do this?  Is it subsequent or prior to the removal of the director?  If it is subsequent to his removal, the horse has bolted and, if I were here as spokesman, there would be no point in my putting down a resolution criticising the Minister.  I may criticise him but it is wasting time.  The man has now been removed from office.  It is a question of when the Minister is obliged to come before the House with the reasons for the removal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsections (4) (a) and (b) provide:</P>
      <P>The Director may be removed from office at any time by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Director is removed from office under this subsection, the <Col N="1115" /> Minister shall cause to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas a statement of the reasons for the removal.</P>
    <P>It seems to be up to the Minister.  In most cases the dismissal would possibly take place first and a statement of the reasons for his removal would possibly be made on the same day.  It would be highly undesirable, however, to give the reasons for dismissal if the main reason was that he was unsatisfactory in his job or there was some personal disability, such as alcoholism.  It would not be practicable to have these discussed in the Oireachtas.  If he were to develop an incapacitating disease it would not be proper to discuss this in Parliament in the interests of his family and himself.  Deputy O'Toole will appreciate that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept all that.  What I am trying to ascertain is the timing of the Minister's statement.  A while ago the Parliamentary Secretary stated it would be prior to removal from office.  Now she uses the phrase &ldquo;It seems&rdquo;.  We are legislating and words relating to this kind of operation must be very definitive.  We must be very sure of our steps.  Words like that show the uncertainty that exists in section 9 (4) (b) which reads:</P>
      <P>If the Director is removed from office under this subsection, the Minister shall cause to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas a statement of the reasons for the removal.</P>
      <P>Reading this as intelligently as I can, it seems to me&mdash;I can indulge in the luxury of using the word &ldquo;seems&rdquo; whereas the Parliamentary Secretary cannot afford that luxury&mdash;that the Minister will come in here and make a statement subsequent to the removal from office by him of the director. May I have that verified because, if that is so, discussing the removal subsequently or the reasons attendant on it do not make much sense?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, as the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out, the reasons for removing the individual from office may not be proper for discussion here <Col N="1116" /> at all.  Now I can see instances where removal from office might take place for reasons other than the delicate ones implied in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement&mdash;in other words, reasons that could very well be discussed here, reasons which we, as public representatives, might be obliged to discuss publicly.  If these reasons are to be discussed subsequent to removal by the Minister there is no great point in airing the matter at all except, perhaps, for personal satisfaction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would be well advised to take a very sharp look at this section between now and Report Stage.  Because of a debate by a sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges relating to accommodation, I was regrettably unable to be here for the initial discussion on this section.  There are several worrying features here.  Suppose, for example, an officer of this House was deemed to be unfit by the Minister for the Public Service to hold his job any longer, will the reasons for his removal be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and will the reasons be discussed by this House?  This is a very odd provision. I have tried to check through the 1956 Civil Service Regulation Act and I have been unable to find anything like this.  One could table a Parliamentary Question to find out why the officer was removed, but appointing someone for five years and reappointing that individual for another five years is a very restrictive provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the case.  The director can be appointed for five years, a subsequent five years and a subsequent five years, and so on, until the Minister decides he does not want to reappoint him or the individual concerned wants to retire. It does not specifically tie the Minister or the director to ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but in practice there is an obvious inference.  I am not so sure that a trade union civil servant would agree to that kind of appointment.  I am sure a principal officer or an assistant secretary would <Col N="1117" /> not agree to that kind of appointment and would look askance at it.  I am not happy about this.  It is a bit of a mishmash.  There were discussions in the previous Administration between the civil service trade unions and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  There is an elaboration here of the process of appointment.  Despite reservations by some people, I go along with the idea of appointment by the Civil Service Commission.  There are two unnecessary restrictions in subsection (4) (a) and (b) which may prove detrimental in the long run.  For example, at the end of 12 months it may become obvious that the director is the greatest disaster that ever hit us in terms of consumer information.  Yet the period of appointment is for five years.  Why not three?  Why not ten? This is not the way in which people are appointed to State-sponsored bodies.</P>
      <P>Why not have another look at this? I can understand how this has evolved. I remember long tortuous discussions between Deputy Haughey and Deputy Bruton, when he was Parliamentary Secretary, on the appointment of the director.  I am aware of the discussions between the trade unions and Deputy Bruton prior to the Bill being debated last time, the unions making representations about the conditions of employment of the director and how they felt the matter should be handled and Deputy O'Malley, working at a tangent, had separate views when we debated this last April.  Now we have the present proposal.  I can sympathise with the Parliamentary Secretary's dilemma in trying to bring some finality to this matter.  We have opened up some issues without which I think the senior advisers of the Department would feel better off.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, I cannot stay for the remainder of the debate as we have a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges at 4.30 this afternoon.  Probably, I shall be better off: these heaters have been the subject of a United States report on consumer safety and the report was not very flattering.</P>

When he looked at the conditions of employment he might be put off leaving some reasonably remunerative employment with far less onerous conditions to accept these conditions which I am not sure many public servants would wish to work under and which might be very inhibiting in bringing the director's work to full fruition.</P>

      <P>We would all agree that public service appointments which are normally made would be made from within the public service and therefore there would have been considerable experience of working with the individual who might be appointed, but where the appointment is being operated and an open competition being held we shall be depending on the opinion of an interview <Col N="1119" /> board of the Civil Service Commissioners. It is important, therefore, that a specified term of office be stated and in the event of the appointee proving satisfactory at the end of five years he could be appointed and, perhaps, at the end of another five years, reappointed again.  Further, the present position of Examiner of Restrictive Practices is on the same basis.  If a situation arose where the director would have to be dismissed by the Minister it is important to realise that it would only be a dismissal of the Director of Consumer Affairs; in fact he would have been appointed a civil servant on his appointment as Director of Consumer Affairs and would remain on as a civil servant after his dismissal as director.</P>
      <P>As regards the very valid point raised by Deputy O'Toole, that the Minister would have dismissed a director when he would lay his statement of the reasons for the removal before the House, if a debate took place on the statement, I feel that what the House would be debating is not whether the director should have been removed but whether the Minister had acted properly in removing him and that what would be under discussion would be a check on an arbitrary decision of the Minister, whoever he might be.</P>

      <P>Why not have a decision of the Government in regard to the dismissal?  I know this has been debated before.  The Minister, Deputy O'Malley, is a rather testy individual at the best of times and I should not like to fall into his bad books.  It could reach the stage in personal relations between the director and the Minister where the Minister might say: &ldquo;That is it.  That is the end of four-and-a-half years; it is coming up to your fifth year and out you go.&rdquo;  In the case of a major public service of this kind I should prefer to have a Government <i>caveat</i> and a provision whereby the Government, not a Minister, would dismiss the director.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with Deputy Desmond's comments on the <Col N="1120" /> five-year term of appointment, the Parliamentary Secretary gave what I regard as a very lame excuse, that because very little would be known about the new aspirant director it would be better to have a time limit on his appointment; in other words, it would be foolish to jump in at the deep end and appoint him on a permanent basis. All civil servants at some stage are individuals who present themselves for examination and are appointed on a permanent basis.  This note of suspicion which has crept into the Parliamentary Secretary's assessment of the individual bears out what I have been saying.  The excuse of not knowing him because it is now an open competition and that we must tread very wearily seems to me to imply that if this were a closed competition within the Civil Service we could make a permanent appointment with no time limit because we would know the people we were dealing with, &ldquo;we&rdquo; being the bureaucratic establishment within the public service. This is another aspect of what we have been discussing this afternoon.</P>
      <P>Finally, this five-year term aspect with dismissal hanging over the head of the new appointee surely prejudices his independence, human nature being what it is.  The 11th commandment to me is &ldquo;Mind thyself&rdquo;, and if it is a question of this person acting on behalf of the consumer but knowing in doing so that it might be detrimental to his own position as director because of the view taken by his superior officer, the Minister, he might well scratch his head a few times before he acts, despite the fact that he knows and is convinced that action is necessary in a specific direction.  We all know that he might find himself in a position of compromise because of that.  I want a categorical assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that this five-year period is not because this competition is open to non-civil servants.  If that is the Parliamentary Secretary's line of thinking she has been totally absorbed body and soul into her Department.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (5), after line 45, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(g) to ensure that the provisions of any legislation providing for the protection of consumers that, in his opinion, should be brought to the attention of the public are brought to the attention of the public and for this purpose to publicise those provisions in such manner and to such extent as he thinks appropriate&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> The purpose of this amendment is to place an obligation on the Director of Consumer Affairs to publicise the provisions of consumer protection legislation in this and other measures.  As I said this morning, a Consumer Protection Bill will come immediately on the heels of this Bill and I hope to have it passed early in the next session. It is intended that the director should provide this information from time to time as necessary or in combination with other suitable reports or statements that he may have to make as time goes on.  It is generally considered that the consumer movement has a large role to play in relation to consumer education and so on.  The consumer education <i>ad hoc</i> committee which was set up in the Department, and which I hope will report by next March, will suggest the appropriate channels or the areas and means of consumer education and publicity for consumer laws, and the director's duties in this need not be widened to more than a general basic function.</P>
    <P>Both amendments are very similar and Deputy O'Toole and myself are very anxious to ensure that any information about subsequent legislation will be generally known to the public.  Very often legislation is put through the Houses of the Oireachtas and for various reasons the provisions of that legislation are not publicised enough.  I believe that all on both sides of the House are anxious to ensure that consumer information and consumer legislation will be made available to all members of the public on a regular basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse what has been said by the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to the similarity of the Minister's amendment and my amendment, except that the second part of my amendment concerns dissemination of information about consumer affairs generally.  We are at one on the dissemination of information with regard to consumer protection legislation and regulations and laws concerning consumer affairs.  The reason for my adding &ldquo;and about consumer affairs generally&rdquo; is not lost on the Parliamentary Secretary, I am <Col N="1124" /> sure, because this concerns a much broader field.  We are talking about information and education in the broader sense.  In the debate earlier this year this matter was discussed, but I must impress on the Parliamentary Secretary that the second part of my amendment is important.</P>
      <P>The National Prices Commission have a limited function here in that they provide a certain amount of information, they investigate prices, they do in-depth investigations in some areas of the economy and in the production and the manufacture of some commodities, they do comparative assessments between this country, and other countries, and so on.  I am talking about information through the office of the director.  We are setting up an office with a director who shall be, I hope, speaking in the interests of the consumers and of the manufacturers and traders who provide an honest service.  Unless that director is seen to be there on behalf of the consumer and on behalf of the manufacturer, unless that office disseminates information which is useful to the consumer above and beyond the basic information concerning legislation and the interpretation of legislation in layman's language, unless the director has the facilities to go beyond providing such information, he will be falling short of the expectations of consumers.  The director should be in a position to give information on the price of any commodity and should be able to advise consumers at any time.  Many consumers are being fooled by persuasive publicity campaigns which create the wrong impression.  While this legislation will restrict this type of activity and protect the consumer, there will be loopholes in it.  The person who finds the loopholes will be known to the Director of Consumer Affairs, who should be able to inform consumers of these loopholes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their manifesto Fianna Fáil undertook to produce a weekly survey of prices because they were not happy with the workings of the Prices Commission. So far, this information has not been produced.  There has also been a delay in the publication of the report of the Prices Commission which is, we have been told, due to the illness of the <Col N="1125" /> chairman.  Prices are being sanctioned by the Minister all the time but it may take six weeks for the new prices to be made known generally.  This kind of information could be channelled through the director's office.</P>
    <P>We are inundated with EEC directives on standards of which the ordinary consumer knows very little.  Many Members of this House, including myself, are ignorant of many EEC directives. The director could undertake to inform the public of these directives.</P>
    <P>Apart from these two functions, the director's efforts on behalf of consumers will be nil.  The preventive and corrective aspects of the director's functions are important.  The dissemination of information would be preventive and would surely obviate the necessity of instituting court proceedings against traders for misdemeanours. For example, if the director was able to alert consumers of dangerous or doubtful products, they would respect his warning and would not purchase such products.</P>
    <P>The IIRS are concerned with the inspection and examination of products. Prior to Christmas there are many new toys on the market and some of them are found to be dangerous on inspection by the IIRS.  I should like to know if the IIRS have any means of warning the public of dangerous products.  A short time ago I read a newspaper article on an imported bicycle which was found to be dangerous, but many people may have missed that article.  There should be close co-operation between the director and the IIRS.  For instance, the IIRS should notify the Director of Consumer Affairs of the results of their examination of any product.  On receiving information from the IIRS, the director would be in a position to warn the public.  In the long run this would save the State money because it would reduce the number of proceedings instituted against traders and manufacturers for misdemeanours.</P>
    <P>The director should also be able to supervise consumer education.  I assume that the person appointed will be an expert in this field.  I assume that he would also be in a position <Col N="1126" /> to educate consumers as to their rights, their obligations and so on. At present there is a guarantee system for certain products and the purchaser who signs that guarantee is actually signing away rights instead of establishing any basis in law for bringing a charge.  In many cases people sign these because they are ignorant of what they mean.</P>
    <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary is aware, the documentation presented contains very small print and people are asked to sign on the dotted line without having a clue as to what they are signing.  That is caused by a lack of education.  I see the director's office and the director as a means for the dissemination of education, of educating the public.  I do not suggest that they simply put an advertisement in the national newspapers for one day. Generally speaking advertisements published by the State to alert the public&mdash;for example those issued by the National Health Council&mdash;are very dull when compared with those prepared by professionals engaged by big companies.  In 1976 the amount of money spent here on advertising was in the region of £34 million.</P>
    <P>The success of the efforts of the director to counteract some of the misleading advertisements will depend to a great extent on the resources made available to him.  The amendment tabled by the Minister is too restrictive in that it deals specifically with dissemination of information with regard to legislation only.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to have another look at this with a view to broadening it so that the onus can be put on the director to ensure that information and details about commodities is issued by his office.  That would do it a great deal of good.  It would also be a link with the consumers because, ultimately, the director will depend on the public for information with regard to the sale of goods, the type of goods being sold and so on.  He will have to depend on complaints being sent to his office.  If he was in a position to give consumers information and establish educational programmes whereby consumers would be made more aware of their rights he <Col N="1127" /> would be establishing a further link with consumers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of the dissemination of information down to the consumer is extremely important. In fact, it is probably one of the most important aspects of this legislation. Contrary to what Deputy O'Toole has said, I consider that the amendment proposed by the Minister which seeks to bring to the attention of the public the terms of this legislation must be read in the broadest sense.  I regard his remarks as relating to the implementation of that amendment rather than being necessary as a separate amendment.  I accept the point the Deputy made in this regard.  It is important at this time because, as Deputy O'Toole has stated, we now have many EEC grading standards which include classes, sizes and descriptions of goods and commodities. At this stage the consumer is not aware of the reality of the legislation.</P>
      <P>I should like to mention some examples.  If one goes to a fruit and vegetable market one finds that under the legislation fruit and vegetables must be presented in accordance with class and size categories before being sold in the market.  I hesitate to mention tomatoes as an example but I have had some experience with them over the years.  They are sold in classes and sizes in the market under the legislation.  They are sold at different prices for different classes and sizes but in the retail store one does not see the different sizes and classes on display at different prices.  There must be a great temptation along the line to remix the sizes with a possibility of considerable financial gain.  If the consumer is fully aware of the legislation which exists and the way in which it should be implemented then the consumer is more likely to get a fair and right price for the particular goods.  A retailer should be required to sell only in accordance with the classes and grades which have been specified under the legislation for the producer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar situation arises in relation to capacity as distinct from the size, weight or shape if one considers hair shampoos and washing-up liquids. <Col N="1128" /> Although legislation requires that they be in standard categories they are displayed in many stores in millimetres, fluid ounces or cc's.  Even scientists are confused as to what exactly they are buying in this regard.  Consequently, there is a need to ensure that the descriptions are carried through in the uniform way required by legislation. On the question of the country of origin, legislation currently requires that the country of origin be described. Very often stores introduce own brand packaging of a variety of things.  One finds this in relation to beans in particular. Stores sell their own brand beans as distinct from some particular proprietary type of beans.  The own brand may be a little cheaper or dearer but it is only right that consumers be given the packers' identity so that they can judge the situation properly.  Some shirts, under legislation, must carry a label detailing the country of origin but yet one finds a shirt which it is believed was made in Hong Kong is sold here carrying the &ldquo;Empire&rdquo; brand name.  If the consumers were made fully aware of these legislative requirements they would insist on getting the proper information conveyed to them at the retail store.  I need hardly mention that the same thing has been quite common in recent times in relation to footwear. I believe that legislative requirements must be conveyed to the consumer and I fully support the Minister's provision by way of amendment, while understanding that the question of dissemination would be catered for under that amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that what Deputy Woods says is true but I would not fully accept his interpretation of the section.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that I have a suspicious mind.  This is too narrow in that it concerns dissemination of information with regard to legislation only.  We must be specific in legislation.  I will be quite happy if I can get an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that this can be interpreted to include something other than the dissemination of information with regard to legislation. If not, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have a look at <Col N="1129" /> the second part of my amendment to see if it could be worked in to include information other than in regard to legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Here we have a problem about the definition of the functions of the director regarding the dissemination of information.  I believe his primary function is as an enforcement officer and, therefore, the information which he should be required to disseminate to the public should be information regarding this Bill and future legislation.</P>
      <P>I have already explained that the whole area of consumer information, education and protection could not be given to the Director of Consumer Affairs.  He will have a very full brief as his functions are specified at the moment.  Deputy O'Toole is aware that there is a provision in the Bill whereby the Minister, if he feels at some time in the future that an extension of these functions would be advisable, can make such an extension.</P>
      <P>The Consumer Education Committee which was set up in my Department will, I hope, report by March, 1978.  They have instructions to examine the whole question of disseminating information on consumer affairs and the best means of conveying this information to the public. They will consider whether this should be done through the schools or through the media, using the press, television and so on.  I know that the Deputy opposite is just as concerned as I am that this committee should report as soon as possible and that any action which they recommend will be taken. There are areas in consumer protection and information about which the public are ignorant in many cases.  The Consumer Education Committee will suggest areas where information can be given to the public.  All of us would realise that the best possible way to give this information is through our national media, through radio and television.  The committee will examine the questions and will be reporting and I can assure the Deputy that whatever measures they suggest will be implemented.</P>

      <P>I would hope so.  Deputy O'Toole mentioned that the enforcement of standards should be a matter for the Director of Consumer Affairs.  This would place an enormous burden on the director.  He will have a lot to do in enforcing the provisions of existing and future legislation. I realise that the IIRS perform a tremendous service in enforcing standards and examining various objects which are put on sale, toys and so on.  I know that a very warm relationship exists between the IIRS and the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy and I would hope that this relationship will exist between the IIRS and the director, whoever he or she may be.  As the legislation stands, it would be unwise to add to the functions of the director.  If it becomes obvious in the future that other functions should be given to the director, if it is suggested that he is sitting around twiddling his thumbs waiting for work to come in, then the Minister can say that he feels certain other functions should be given to the director.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not particularly concerned about who disseminates the information as long as that information is given and disseminated.  If as a result of the report of the Consumer Education Committee the Parliamentary Secretary is advised to look at other channels through which information might be given, that is fine with me.  I am concerned only that adequate information should be given to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned that this obligation might rest with the office of the director for two reasons.  The first is a purely psychological point.  I would envisage in years to come that organised consumer bodies would grow and become more effective in their approach and that they would become a strong lobby <Col N="1131" /> to ensure that they and their members get value for money.  I expect that the director would be a man whose views would be respected.  He would be the person by whom everything relating to consumer affairs would be regulated. He is the person to whom people would go.  I would point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that I am not asking that the director would enforce directives of the EEC; all I have said is that he would give the public information regarding these directives and let them decide whether they want to go to court or take their complaints back to him.  What I have asked is that his office would be such and would be given the resources to be able to advise the public at large as to directives.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods mentioned tomatoes. What grading is there for tomatoes at present?  You have potatoes, all classes of vegetables and fruit.  What is the grading?  These are matters about which the public are ignorant.  In many cases they are paying very high prices for grades which are below standard or below the standard of the price being paid.  That is not enforcement. That is purely disseminating information. It is up to the person on the ground, if he feels strongly enough or is aggrieved, to seek redress from the director's office or elsewhere.  If we are to build up this director, if he is to be advantageous to consumers and to work in their interests, we should give him responsibility for all aspects of consumer products, the workings of these areas, not necessarily to enforce them but at least to disseminate information. It will be his function to enforce them in so far as this Bill and its provisions are concerned.  If the Parliamentary Secretary can give me an assurance that a system under which information will be disseminated will be brought into being as a result of the Report of the Consumer Education Committee, then I shall be quite happy.  I hope we will have a chance of discussing the ways and means of doing this when the time comes.</P>

      <P>In page 7, subsection (6), lines 50 and 51, to delete &ldquo;in relation to any matters to which the Acts or this Act relate&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;in respect of any matters to which the Acts or this Act or any other enactment making provision for the protection of consumers relates&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This will enable the Minister to extend by order, under section 9 (6), the scope of the director's functions to matters arising under other consumer protection legislation which cannot be specified here.  In specific Bills, such as the Consumer Protection Bill or the Consumer Credit Bill, the additional functions will be set out explicitly; but the phrase now being inserted will cover the more generalised area of a situation of statutory order to be made or enacted&mdash;for example, a food labelling directive or another EEC directive that may arise from time to time.  It is quite similar to Deputy O'Toole's amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 8, between lines 12 and 13, after subsection (9), to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(10)  (a)  Whenever it appears to the Minister that the Director is temporarily unable to discharge his duties, the Minister may appoint a person to act in place of the Director during such inability or for such shorter period as the Minister thinks proper.</P>

    <P>This amendment is an essential provision in a case where the director may become unable to discharge his duties for one reason or another.  There is a similar provision in the Restrictive Practices Act of 1972 in relation to the office of the Examiner of Restrictive Practices.

It will ensure publication of such report in the Oireachtas within 12 months of its receipt by the Minister.  The case made for the 12 months period is that Ministers, having received reports, for one reason or another may not be in a position to publish them within a <Col N="1134" /> meaningful time.

      <P>This section concerns advertising orders where a Minister finds it necessary or expedient to have further information provided by advertisers. Is the director involved here or is it purely a ministerial function?  My limited knowledge of ministerial procedure in this Department would indicate to me that it is purely a ministerial function.  For example, section 10 deals with marking orders, section 11 with advertising orders and section 12 with definition orders.  I assume these are purely ministerial functions and that the director is not involved in any way. In that case I assume that the Minister would be acting on the advice of the director whose office would first have determined whether or not an advertisement was in compliance with the standards laid down and if an omission was noticed that the Minister would ask that it be rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under these three sections dealing with marking, advertising and definition orders, I hope the Minister will use his powers to ensure that, first of <Col N="1135" /> all, such orders are made and subsequently acted on.</P>

      <P>In page 9, subsection (1), lines 25 and 26, to delete &ldquo;give to any person so requesting, if the request is made within 18 months of the publication of the advertisement&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;, if the Director or an officer of the Minister or an officer of a council of a county or corporation of a county or other borough in whose functional area the publisher has a place of business so requests within 18 months of the publication of the advertisement, give to the Director or officer&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section in its present form entitles any person, whether or not he has an interest in what is being advertised, to demand the name and address of the person who procured the advertisement. As such, it is too far-reaching. Representations have been made to me, and indeed to my predecessor, that it could also have serious implications for the confidential relationship existing between newspapers and those who advertise in them in relation to advertisements not in the course of trade or business.  Accordingly it is considered that the power to seek the names and addresses of advertisers should be restricted to the persons designated.  It would not be possible to limit this to business advertisements because information as to whether it was business or private would not be known in advance.  But it will ensure that only officers enforcing the legislation can demand that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree basically with the sentiments expressed by the Parliamentary Secretary.  We have a longstanding <Col N="1136" /> tradition in this and in many other countries in relation to publications in newspapers, periodicals and so on concerning box numbers and the confidentiality attached to them.  As the section stood it would be drawing a coach and four through that long-established tradition.  The time limit with which I am concerned and where I disagree slightly with the Minister's amendment is something that might be looked at.  From discussing this matter with interested parties it appears to me that 18 months is an extraordinarily long time.  It is a period that seems to have been pulled out of the air.  The Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor did the same thing and at that time it seemed to me to be a rather strange period.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of accounts, I am told that six months is the normal period for which files and documents are kept.  There is also the added difficulty which concerns the keeping of files for 18 months and it is purely a physical problem.  I was told a month ago by those concerned with an evening newspaper that for this year so far they had reached the figure of 500,000 for small advertisements.  We have heard of butter and cheese mountains but we do not want to have paper mountains.  I understand that the industry generally will run into trouble with insurance if they have to provide large storage facilities and keep files for such a long time.  I realise that with modern technology it is possible to keep records of 500,000 small advertisements even in one's pocket, but there are high capital costs involved in such methods and in some parts of the industry they are doing things the traditional way.  There is the danger that they will run into difficulty from the point of view of storage and insurance cover if they are obliged to keep records for 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see some reason in saying that they should keep the files forever but 18 months is a kind of arbitrary period that has been taken out of the air.  It would be more appropriate to have a period of six months because this would coincide with the requirements of the people concerned in the matter <Col N="1137" /> of accounts.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give this matter serious consideration.  I do not think it will cause any great difficulty.  If a person does not inquire about a matter within six months I do not think he can claim that his complaint is urgent.  I propose that the six months be substituted for the period of 18 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that many goods are on the shelves of shops for periods considerably longer than six months after the original advertisement.  It is important that the period be 18 months for the simple reason that if goods were sold after six months they would have escaped the net.  It is more logical to specify 18 months.</P>
      <P>On the question regarding insurance coverage, there have been no representations to the Department since the Bill was published.  This is a new point and is one that was not raised by consumers, manufacturers or traders in the many representations they made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked to comment on this aspect.  I should like to quote from a letter received from the advertising manager of a Dublin newspaper, speaking on behalf of his colleagues in the Dublin newspaper industry.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the time span of 18 months raises some serious difficulty. <Col N="1138" /> Details of advertisements are normally retained for six months and any extension of this time could create a serious storage problem.  I feel our insurance would be very unhappy with the possibility of a paper mountain.  Any queries re advertisements are raised very quickly after publication and a period of six months would seem to provide an ample safeguard.</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary realises the problem here.  I am not in a position to comment to what degree the problem of insurance is a factor except to say what I was told by people who are interested in this section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Parliamentary Secretary's problem with regard to six months.  However, if the reason for allowing 18 months is to ensure that the maximum protection is given to the consumer, the obvious thing is to let the people concerned keep the files forever.  In this way there will be absolute satisfaction for the consumer because ten years hence he can air his grievance.</P>
    <P>While what the Parliamentary Secretary said may be true in some cases, I should like to know what proportion of commodities or goods would be affected.  I would be prepared to hazard a guess that the vast bulk of what is sold in shops would be the subject of an inquiry within a period of six months.  The Parliamentary Secretary would be in a better position to know what commodities would be in the shops for six months or longer.  The reason given for the period of 18 months is rather weak because if that is followed to its logical conclusion the people concerned could be told to keep their records forever in order to give absolute protection to the consumer. Can the Parliamentary Secretary give me a definite reason for keeping the period of 18 months?  Would it be possible to compromise on this matter?  In country fashion could we split the difference and have 12 months?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary consider six months because there may be a strong possibility that six months would cover most of the problem created.  I mentioned 12 months as a compromise if six months were not acceptable under any circumstances.  The Parliamentary Secretary might try to find out what proportion of commodities could be dealt with if six months were substituted here.  That would be preferable and newspaper and periodical publishers would be happy because they would not have to consider the storage problems or the increased insurance cover.  They might pass these increases on to the consumer by increasing the price of newspapers and periodicals.  In this way the Parliamentary Secretary might be doing a disservice to the consumer by insisting on 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that 18 months is not unreasonable.  What the Deputy said may be true, that is, that the vast majority of goods would be sold within six months and any action to be taken would be taken within that period.  We are not concerned only with the vast majority of goods: in this legislation we want to include everything.  The Deputy said that if six months are not acceptable we should scrap the 18 months and let them keep their files for ever so that a consumer in ten or 12 years' time can bring an action.  In that case, it is important to remember that consumer protection must not only affect the consumer it must also be seen to be fair to the manufacturer and trader.  To insist on a trader holding records forever would be most unreasonable.  I am sure the Deputy agrees with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy O'Toole wants to press the matter, we could compromise on <Col N="1140" /> 12 months.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle suggested that we discuss this on Report Stage.

      <P>In page 9, subsection (1), line 27, after &ldquo;agent&rdquo; to add &ldquo;This section shall not apply to box number advertisements in newspapers, magazines or periodicals.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that this Bill is concerned with consumer information and that the information which might be sought from the publisher of a newspaper or a periodical might be of interest to a consumer.  As box numbers have a long tradition of confidentiality here, it would be unwise to insist on disclosure of information under a box number.  I do not know exactly to what degree this amendment would affect the volume of information that would come from newspapers but my natural reaction to the disclosure of information under a box number was that it should not be given.  This is also the reaction of most people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very personal and delicate items can be advertised under a box number. One very delicate area is where <Col N="1141" /> a person may be seeking new employment. A man may not want his present employer to know he is seeking employment elsewhere.  If this information were to leak out, it could cause a great deal of embarrassment and prejudice his chances of getting employment.  I am not talking about a person who goes behind his present employer's back.  He may be in a position where he need not give information as to his intentions because he may be employed on a month's notice either way.  In such a case, until he secures employment through a box number, he would not have to tell his current employer.</P>
    <P>There are other times when it would be favourable for this information to be made available.  For example, we all know of cases where goods have been inherited and sold piecemeal by one member of a family without the knowledge of the co-owners.  If administration had not been taken out the goods would not be available for distribution later because they had been sold.  I am talking now of furniture and other items which could be of substantial value.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there are cases for and against, but with the tradition of confidentiality of box number advertisements, the balance is in favour of non-disclosure.  If the Parliamentary Secretary does that it would be a step in the right direction.</P>

The points the Deputy has made would seem to justify the inclusion of the amendment. However, having accepted amendment No. 31 I do not consider this amendment to be necessary.  We have just agreed that the information inserted in advertisements will be available to full-time officers and because these officers will not be in a position to disclose the information, the confidentiality of the private individual is being protected.</P>

      <P>In page 9, subsection (1), line 40, before &ldquo;prevent&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, without reasonable cause,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Chamber of Commerce have represented that this provision as drafted could create problems for city-centre shopkeepers who have had to take special precautions to keep out undesirables.  The provision was inserted originally on the basis of representations from consumer interests who found that <i>bona fide</i> price surveys were inhibited by unco-operative shop owners and managers who would not permit visitors to collect such data. However, there is the difficulty expressed by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and, accordingly, this amendment has been devised to ensure that a shopkeeper who may refuse access to undesirables will not be automatically in breach of the Act if he can establish a reasonable basis for refusing admission to his premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 40 will allow proprietors of premises to exclude or eject undesirables without committing an offence provided that a price list is displayed on the premises in such a way that it does not necessitate entrance to the premises in order to be read or be seen.  In the case of goods <Col N="1145" /> that may not appear on a price list, the visitor retains the right of entry. The shopkeeper can exclude that right by displaying on the price list the prices of all the products he sells.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised in regard to amendment No. 39 is acceptable having regard to the times in which we live and to the difficulties that have arisen concerning access to premises by undesirable persons.  In such circumstances shopowners must have some protection.</P>
      <P>In regard to amendment No. 40 I suggest that we are breaking new ground because up to now, so far as I am aware, a person had not the right to enter a premises in order to take a note of prices.  I do not know whether he had any protection in law but in the recent past in this city we had an example of a person entering a shop for the purpose of checking prices and being ejected unceremoniously. Had that person taken the matter further I do not know whether any existing Act would have given him legal protection, but I understand that there is nothing on the Statute Books that would have allowed him access to the premises.</P>
      <P>This amendment will regularise that situation and will give the consumer an opportunity of checking prices and, consequently, of getting the best bargain. In addition, it allows the competitor to do likewise and, perhaps, to come back and adjust his prices.  The amendment is worth while and, therefore most acceptable.  I would like to have the Parliamentary Secretary's comments on amendment No. 41 because, as she knows, difficulties arise here.  Are they covered by amendment No. 39?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment alters the definition of &ldquo;authorised officer&rdquo; to ensure that only full-time officers are empowered. Normally all authorised officers of the Minister or of a local authority would be full-time officers and are intended by the Bill to be so.  There may, however, be a slight risk of an official also being a trader in competition with another trader or other traders whom he would be inspecting, or being a <Col N="1147" /> member of the consumer movement appointed on a part-time or casual basis.  This amendment would preclude that possibility.  At a very early stage it is intended to consider removing the reference to local authority officers so that no local authority officers other than in Dublin or Dún Laoghaire&mdash; and these also may be subsumed&mdash; can be appointed.  This is with the aim of having a single, centralised service.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that if a trader has voluntarily made an effort by corrective advertising to make amends for any faults or misleading descriptions, the court may take that into account in its judgment on the case.

      <P>I move amendment No. 44:</P>
      <P>In page 10, after line 49, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) (a)  Where a court imposes a fine or affirms or varies a fine imposed by another court for an offence referred to in subsection (1) of this section, it may, at its discretion, on the application (made before the time of such imposition or affirmation) of any person who was summoned as a witness on behalf of the prosecution in the proceedings in which the fine was imposed and who suffered personal injury, loss or damage resulting, wholly or partly, from the offence provide by order for the payment of the amount of the fine or of a specified part of it as compensation in respect of the injury, loss or damage to the person making the application.</P>
      <P>(b)  An application shall not lie under paragraph (a) of this subsection in respect of any personal injury, loss or damage if proceedings claiming damages for the injury, loss or damage have been instituted in any court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  Where the whole or part of a fine imposed under this section is paid to a person pursuant to this subsection and the person is awarded damages by a court in <Col N="1150" /> respect of the personal injury, loss or damage to which the payment relates, the payment shall be deemed to be in satisfaction of so much damages as is equal to the amount of the payment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Many of the observations on the Bill which have been received have laid emphasis on the lack of any provision in the Bill for the payment of compensation to those who have suffered as a result of faults or misleading trade descriptions or advertising. The omission of any such provision was initially intended for the reason that claims for compensation, even when arising out of criminal cases, are a matter for civil suit. Additionally it was felt that large numbers of claims could be involved in any case, and that a degree of &ldquo;cashing in&rdquo; could follow when a criminal case was being heard in the District Court which could easily become clogged with a multiplicity of frivolous claims and be diverted from their main function of arbitrating on the criminal cases.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it is accepted that persons with genuine grounds for claiming compensation are dissuaded from proceeding civilly because of the complexity, the cost or, indeed, the risk involved, and the loss very often not being commensurate with the burden involved.  Accordingly it is considered that the Bill would be weakened significantly if it were not possible to include in it some provision for compensation.  The number of genuine claimants is likely to be small and the individual amounts involved are not likely to be great, since they would be limited, in any event, by the amount of the maximum fine possible, that is £500 on summary conviction. However, any fine imposed may be used at the discretion of the court for the purposes of paying compensation to only such persons as have been called as witnesses for the prosecution and who have proven claims. All other claimants would have to sue civilly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an area where many people have shown concern and have reacted accordingly.  We are <Col N="1151" /> talking here on behalf of consumers and have spent much time, on the part of the civil service, in having this Bill drafted and, on the part of the House, in discussing it.  We are now on Committee Stage and at the end of all this we are left in the position whereby the aggrieved person, the damaged party, the consumer, will not in the normal way be entitled to compensation.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with law in the criminal code.  The aggrieved party, having been damaged as a result of purchasing a commodity, can bring the vendor to court.  The court fines that vendor and that is the end of the matter unless the purchaser pursues the matter further and takes a civil action.  I see no reason why the person who gets a conviction in the criminal code cannot automatically be entitled to some redress as is now given as a result of civil action.  In regard to the question of civil redress in criminal cases the legal profession would throw up their hands in horror at the idea of any crossing of demarcation lines.  I am quite sure the Parliamentary Secretary would agree that if she had her way she would devise some rather simple way whereby such clients would be entitled to compensation. Her amendment goes some way towards ensuring that that possibility is there.  The NCAC recommended that civil redress be given in criminal cases.  It would compensate victims who otherwise would not take a civil action.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of cases would be concerned with small amounts.  If I buy something which costs £5, £10 or £15 which turns out to be a dud and I find out I have been conned there is no way I would bring a civil action because of the smallness of the claim. It would cost me three or four times the cost of the article in legal expenses. I can bring a criminal action, have the vendor fined and I can feel that I have saved somebody else from the same fate.  But that is no good to me, even though I have been damaged by this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the argument that stopping claimants from taking a civil <Col N="1152" /> action would mean some reduction in the burden of the courts, this is another aspect of the matter: you might have the courts cluttered up with small actions.</P>
    <P>There are three other Acts which have similar provisions, the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, section 8 (4) (c) (ii), the Road Traffic Act, 1961, section 57, and the Factories Act, 1955, section 103 (2).  While the Parliamentary Secretary has stated that the amendment goes some way towards meeting the demand I feel we could have gone further.  The watertight demarcation lines which seem to be erected between civil and criminal legalities is beyond me.  Once liability has been accepted, once a person has been fined for committing an offence, I do not see the logic in coming along in the next breath and saying &ldquo;Sorry, the law says you cannot be compensated&rdquo;. This sounds absolutely ridiculous to me.</P>
    <P>The only way out of it is to ensure that the fine imposed includes an element of compensation.  If the aggrieved person decides that the blame is sufficient to warrant a civil action and having gone through the criminal code and won his case he then decides to take a civil action, what is the position with regard to the consequences of this action?  If that person is successful and is given compensation and if the grievance has arisen because of damage done through purchasing some article, the same article having been bought by 700, 800 or 1,000 people throughout the country, where does this thing end?  Have the 700, 800 or 1,000 other people similarly damaged the right to pursue the case?  Have they to go through a criminal action?  If they have, may they then go through a civil action?  If in theory the same damage has been caused may they get the same compensation as a result of their civil action?</P>
    <P>This does not make very much sense to me because it would result in the vendor, the manufacturer or the trader being put out of business overnight.  I presume what happens in practice is that a settlement is reached for all the <Col N="1153" /> aggrieved parties.  There could be thousands of people affected by this. How would the Parliamentary Secretary deal with that under her amendment if there were hundreds of people damaged by the use of some commodity purchased?  There may be one case proved but there could be 700 cases pending.  Is there any way that this attitude of criminal <i>versus</i> civil can be broken down and a victim can get redress in the form of compensation having gone through a criminal action without having to retrace his steps and go through a civil action?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Toole asked if the amount allowed under the law in the District Court and the amount of compensation is exhausted, what is the position then? As we know, the person cannot take another criminal case.  It will have to be a civil case if a huge number of people are involved or affected.  Once the amount of money allowed for compensation purposes is exhausted, it must be a civil case.  I imagine the burden of proof would be considerably easier once it had been proved in the criminal case that the advertiser was at fault, and therefore the people protected by it would have an easier case in a subsequent civil case.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has made very logical points.  They are very similar to those made by the Minister when he was in Opposition.  All of us realise it is important to have the maximum compensation possible, or the maximum civil redress possible under this Bill. We have gone to the limit of what we are allowed to do constitutionally.  It boils down to this.  If we go any further, the Bill may be regarded as unconstitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to a case which was decided in the High Court on 7th July, 1977.  This case took place after the previous debate on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  It is the Cullen of Wexford case in which Mr. Justice Hamilton ruled that, under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, section 57 (1) and (2) were invalid having regard to the provisions of the Constitution.  The judge was satisfied at that time that the punishment provided for in section 56 <Col N="1154" /> (3) was not of itself sufficient to exclude the offence from the category of minor offences.  Section 57 (1) of the Act, however, purported to increase the penalty the court could inflict to such an extent that, in his opinion, it would not permit an offence under section 56 to be regarded as a minor offence properly triable by a district justice.</P>
    <P>That decision had a tremendous bearing&mdash;and I know Deputy O'Toole will agree&mdash;on how far we can go in the provisions of this Bill dealing with compensation.  The National Consumer Advisory Council in their report recommended that a provision such as the Deputy suggested should be in the Bill.  We have considered this point exhaustively.  The Minister was emphatic about it when he was in Opposition.  If I remember rightly the amendment was carried on a division in the Dáil at that time.  The Minister and I feel just as strongly about it now as we felt then but, under the Constitution, we have gone as far as we can possibly go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a serious drawback and that is putting it very mildly.  We have been talking about consumer information and protection, and discussing the status of the director, what he might and might not do, his resources, and so on.  At the end of the day, what we are talking about really is the degree of redress to which the individual is entitled.  It would seem from what has been said that the consumer is left in a very poor state in that he has literally no redress except in a very limited number of cases. Because of the nature of the claims which will come before the court, in many instances we will have a multiplicity of claims and a number of people&mdash;and that number could be from ten to 10,000&mdash;will be affected because of the nature of these provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about damage resulting from misleading advertisements and the use of a commodity resulting in many people being affected.  It is a very substantial drawback at the end of the day that this is so.  I am sure on the basis of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said <Col N="1155" /> there is no way out.  There is an old saying: &ldquo;Where there is a will there is a way.&rdquo; I am not suggesting the Parliamentary Secretary is not willing to give the maximum protection and redress to the consumers.  I would ask her to go again to the Attorney General's office to see if there is any loophole he can find, before he closes it, which would allow this kind of compensation to be made available.</P>
    <P>To my mind, some of the arguments in the previous debate did not hold water.  One was that it would reduce the revenue to the State.  The amount of revenue <i>vis-à-vis</i> the volume of revenue in the State coffers would be very small.  Secondly, it is revenue which is not there at the moment.  We are talking about a new source of revenue.  Therefore that argument does not hold water.  I am disappointed that the Parliamentary Secretary has not found some way out and I should like to know if it is possible, even in the distant future, to hope that this problem might be overcome.  Is there any way in which we can ensure an aggrieved party taking a criminal action can get civil redress?</P>

The Minister and I were particularly anxious to have this provision included in the Bill.  As I said before, we have gone as far as is constitutionally possible.

Short weight packs, therefore, have to be prosecuted as carrying a false trade description.</P>
    <P>It is possible for the corporation to take such proceedings only by having their weights and measures inspector act as a common informer, as it were. This creates difficulties because relevant legislation does not authorise payment of any costs except directly by the corporation.

      <P>In page 11, lines 25 and 26, to delete &ldquo;prove its truth&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;establish that on the balance of probabilities the indication is true&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As it stands in the Bill, this section places the onus of proof on the defendant in the case of virtually all matters which could be complained of under the Bill where the truth of any indication given is an issue.  This section was included in response to the National Consumers Advisory Council recommendation that advertisers should be able to prove the validity of claims made.  Opposition to the provision in the Bill, however, has been widespread.  It was not found possible <Col N="1157" /> to find a suitable form of words which would limit the section to claims, statements about results to be expected, and so on.  The effect of the amendment therefore is to require defendants to prove the validity of statements on the balance of probabilities rather than beyond all reasonable doubt.  This is the civil basis of discharge of onus. The section will be used only for claims and statements of a kind where it would be reasonable to expect the maker of the claim or statement to be in possession of substantiation or justification.  It will not be used for other kinds of prosecution.  It could be argued also that the section could uncover product formulations or trade secrets.  Discretion will be used to ensure that no trader will be prosecuted and forced to such disclosure unless all efforts by inspectors or the director beforehand fail to find a reasonable basis for the claim or the statement.</P>

      <P>This is a provision designed specifically to exclude banks licensed under the Central Bank Act, 1971, from the provisions of this Bill. I am opposed to the section because I believe banks licensed under the <Col N="1158" /> 1971 Act ought to come under the provisions of the Bill.  I understand the associated banks have, through their standing committee, recently taken certain steps pending the introduction of this Bill.  Circulars were issued stating specifically that, pending the introduction of the Consumer Information Bill, they proposed to take action under headings (a), (b), (c), (d) and so on, and they are prepared to give information to the consumer now which heretofore they did not give.  From what I know of the circular they are going far beyond the requirements that would normally be made by this Bill.</P>
      <P>There are other institutions besides the associated banks, such as merchant banks and lending institutions, and I am more concerned with their operations than I am with the operations of the associated banks.  The information these people give seems to put it mildly, to omit a great deal. It is rather sensational in production and it tends to induce people into entering into contracts where the repayments eventually become impossible and people find themselves in dire trouble.  If the whole information were given prior to entering into a contract people would probably never enter into such a contract at all.  I do not regard licensing by the Central Bank as a good and sufficient reason for excluding these institutions.  Banks in general, and the associated banks in particular, give the correct information and far be it from me to castigate these.  Even though there is cut-throat competition between them they do a good job.  And they do inform the public.  While there are omissions those omissions do not affect the consumer to the extent that he is led into entering a contract involving him ultimately in heavy repayments.  Any bank manager will advise a prospective client about what he is doing and even though all the information may not be presented on paper, the client will nevertheless be well advised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another side to the coin. On receipt of a bank statement a person normally does not know what rate of interest is being charged on overdrafts for instance.  I understand from <Col N="1159" /> the circular that this information will now be given on statements from the associated banks plus information with regard to term loans, personal loans and so on.  The current rates of interest will be displayed in branch offices.  That is something to be welcomed and I am sure the associated banks would not worry one iota if they were included in the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are exceptions at which we might look with a more jaundiced eye.  The exorbitant rates of interest extracted from consumers of some financial institutions are something which should be looked into.  It would seem that the Central Bank, having granted a licence to these people to operate, plays no further part of any kind in the operations of these institutions and anything the institutions do thereafter is beyond the capabilities of the Central Bank to control or even to comment on.</P>
    <P>They are not in a position to interfere in the day-to-day running of these institutions.  They are solely concerned, I understand, with licensing and their responsibility for their activities ends there.  They are concerned with the solvency of the bank but what happens between the licensing of the bank and its becoming insolvent, as the case may be, is anybody's business. In some cases the consumer is the victim of exploitation&mdash;not in all cases or in many cases, but in a small number. The problem here is that these are the people who push their wares more than the people going through the normal channels and applying the going rate of interest.  It is the person who is really exploiting, obviously making the most money, who is in a position to advertise loudest and longest and by doing so get more clients.  It is a vicious circle.</P>
    <P>We were talking earlier about used cars being excluded in certain categories. Many of these financial institutions, strangely, rely heavily on the trade in used cars to keep themselves solvent.  In many cases they are lending money which results in very shady deals where descriptions are false and so on.  On behalf of the consumer we are here dealing with an area where, <Col N="1160" /> apart from the house, the contents of the house are concerned.  Having built the house, the big investment in the house is possibly the kitchen in that you have very expensive electrical gadgetry there, cookers, washing machines, refrigerators, deep freezers and so on, all large money items.  In many cases, people pay off the cost of those items on HP or deferred payment terms and in many cases the same people are being exploited by financial institutions which lend money at exorbitant rates in excess of the going rate.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider the decision to allow section 23 to stay in the Bill because while 95 per cent, possibly 99 per cent of our financial institutions would not worry at coming under the provisions of the Bill, you would bring in that 1 per cent that are exploiters.  Even in the days of the Bible, money lenders were looked on with a jaundiced eye.  Most of them are reputable, I think; they treat clients fairly, but there are a few who do not and their exclusion from the Bill is detrimental to the interest of the consumer.</P>

      <P>The question of all banks coming within the scope of this legislation has been raised. The licensed banks are governed by the Central Bank Act, 1971, and if the powers therein need to be amended or extended that can be done as the need arises.  The advertising of our other banks, savings, credit or financial institutions come under this Bill.  There is no express intention that any class of bank should be free of the general requirement that trade information which they issue to the public should be true.  In the case of those banks which are subject to the specialised supervision of the Central Bank we feel it should be left to the Central Bank, which is the expert in this matter, to see that they behave correctly.  I believe the Central Bank will do that.  All other banks come under this Bill but forthcoming legislation on consumer credit will go further towards what the Deputy has in mind in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have strongly felt that as an interim measure, pending the updating of our consumer <Col N="1161" /> credit legislation in particular, it would have been very wise to include the banks even those covered by the Central Bank Act of 1971, under the general umbrella of this Bill.  Earlier today we pointed out that in regard to houses and motor vehicles, dealings in the nature of private sales, the scope of the Bill has not been made broad enough.  Likewise, I am sceptical that the simplistic exclusion of banks licensed under the 1971 Central Bank Act meets the exigencies of the situations that can arise regarding consumer information.  I do not want to re-open any old wounds concerning consumer information in relation to banks licensed under the 1971 Act, but it is not unknown that at least one bank, licensed under that Act went into liquidation fairly rapidly and the Government, for their own political reasons which we very much still dispute, had to find £2.3 million in order to overcome the obvious deficiencies in the information which that bank made available to investors.  In that instance it seemed that the licensing and so-called supervision arangements of the Central Bank under the 1971 Act were quite deficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember participating in the debate when the 1971 Act went through this House and at that time the main preoccupation of the House was to ensure that where banks were established and obtained licences their overall solvency would be ensured. That was the most important criterion, that their liquidity would be guarded in the public interest by the Central Bank.  But even between licensed banks of a reputable public nature, in many instances there is cut-throat competition to secure customers, to secure favoured treatment by major investors.  These banks offer deals to such customers or prospective customers and to large sections of the community&mdash;witness the extent to which banks offer services to students now in terms of the possibility of opening a cheque book account and so on.  There is need on a consumer basis to ensure that these banks come under the general aegis of this Bill.  One certainly finds that in other European countries, and particularly in American countries, legislation <Col N="1162" /> of this nature does not hold the banking services in such an exalted and sacrosanct exclusion situation as we find them held in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The services provided by the credit card firms, for instance, would come under the general auspices of this Bill; and if they were operating in a shady manner they would be hammered under this Bill.  I accept that as being quite valid.  I presume that licensed moneylenders and financial trading firms would come under this Bill also.  I see no reason for this exclusion of the banks. I suspect that when the Government of the day originally drafted this Bill they had enough on their plate trying to get through a general Consumer Information Bill without getting embroiled with the Governor of the Central Bank.  In a situation where consumers have a multitude of relationships with banks, whether in regards to term loans, special services, bridging loans or ordinary overdraft accommodation, and where many industrial firms have complicated financial arrangements with the licensed banks, the consumer is very often in a position of considerable disadvantage. The banks have made enormous profits in the past few years; and it has been proved, except perhaps with one notable exception in the past 12 months, that the banks are not too easy to take to court if one feels one has been duped by an arrangement. The opposition to this section by Deputy O'Toole is reasonably well-founded.</P>
    <P>I would be less hostile to the exclusion if, for example, we had managed to have updated prior to now the Hire Purchase Act of 1950.  Good work was done by the previous Minister for Local Government in relation to building societies and so on.  Credit unions, for example, operate in an entirely reputable manner, but updated legislation is needed.  There are other areas where banks, with their multifarious investments in a wide range of industrial, commercial and personal services, need greater supervision.  I am very sceptical about the capacity of the Central Bank to monitor on behalf of consumers the services provided by the <Col N="1163" /> banks.  The Central Bank is not regarded as having a major function in regard to the day-to-day conflicts that can arise between a customer and a bank, and is analysing what they might regard as being fair in terms of advertisements and so on.  I recall that not so long ago one of these licensed banks advertised in America a very handsome rate of interest tax free.  A lot of Irish-Americans and other individuals trying to make a few bob quickly investigated this advertisement and got their fingers burnt.  Had this legislation been there that kind of advertisement could have been brought into question immediately. I know that the Minister for Finance is responsible for Central Bank legislation.  I suspect that when the Bill was originally being drafted it finished up on the table of the Department of Finance, and probably a curt note was sent back to the Department of Industry and Commerce telling them to mind their own business in relation to banking operations.</P>
    <P>This exclusion was not argued very effectively when the Bill was before us previously.  Admittedly, at that stage we did not get down to a detailed Committee Stage to find out what precisely was in the mind of the Government's predecessors in regard to the exclusion.  We can only surmise as I have been doing.  Certain operations of the banks could be brought under this Bill.  I am not suggesting a global supervision, but certain trading operations of the licensed banks could be included in the scope of the Bill.  I imagine that, if one went to the Governor of the Central Bank between now and Report Stage and asked him to point out any segments of the operations of the licensed banks which the Director of Consumer Information could usefully supervise, one might get a sympathetic hearing.  I do not see the staff of the Central Bank being able to control on behalf of the consumer the various offers from licensed banks to their customers in relation to different facets of accommodation.  Even in the past 12 months this has become of greater importance.</P>

      <P>The essential point and purpose of this motion is to ensure that the wishes of the people, as expressed in the general election result on the basis of pledges made prior to that by the now Government, are implemented.  The Minister's amendment asks us, rather than accepting the good faith of the Opposition, to instead express confidence in him in regard to his ability, intention and integrity to introduce the desired measure at an early stage. It is not our desire at this stage to call into question the Minister's handling of this.  We would prefer not to be deflected into personality clashes. The Minister has a difficult job and we do not wish to make it more difficult.  It is reasonable to say that the understanding of the electorate was that legislation would be introduced <Col N="1165" /> within a short time to eliminate the creation of new ground rents and to abolish existing ground rents.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister made great play of the alleged failures of the Coalition Government.  The Coalition Government have more than paid for their omissions.  The proposition that the Coalition erred and that Fianna Fáil will do what the Coalition failed to do is an unreal one.  The truth is that Fianna Fáil were given a mandate to do the job because the people believed their promises.  The residents' associations played their cards democratically in regard to this specific issue.  The Coalition Government did not feel empowered to make the commitment entered into by Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>The Government's pledge must be met soon without any effort to deflect attention from the issue.  The issue is that there has been an increasing abhorrence by public representatives and the electorate of the concept of ground rents.  The payment of ground rent does not mean a great deal to many people.  Once you begin paying it you do not take much notice of it. However, there are more important principles, one of which is ownership. Many people are now worrying about ownership because of its implications in their lifetime and the lifetime of their children.</P>
      <P>It is time that we threw off the yoke of ground rents.  It is an antediluvian measure which was inspired by a desire to ensure a feudal-type grasp on homes and properties throughout the country. We are at one with the Government in our abhorrence of the system.  That is not to say that the law can suddenly be set aside because of the undoubted opposition of all parties to ground rents.  There are major difficulties in relation to the abolition of ground rent.  One difficulty would appear to be the implications it has in regard to the Constitution.  Another difficulty is the cost of abolishing ground rents.  In both cases efforts have been made to get information from the Minister.  We have not been given any helpful information or any information which would lead us to the conclusion that the Minister is seriously considering the abolition of ground rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1166" /> I suspect that a Bill will soon be introduced to eliminate the creation of future ground rents.  That Bill will be similar to the Coalition's Bill.  The work and effort put into it will be that of the previous Government.  The subsequent debate will give the impression that the Government have kept their promise.  The issue is no longer the abolition of the creation of ground rents but the abolition of existing ground rents.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to say that this motion would not have been introduced if we had been given a hint of the Government's intention in regard to ground rents.  The Minister has only been active in the Dáil for a few weeks but there was a substantial honeymoon period during which other Ministers aired their proposals through the media.  The Minister for Justice has also been given an opportunity to air his views in public.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot leave the House this evening without saying whether his proposed legislation will need a constitutional amendment.  He appears to be confident of his ability to introduce the necessary legislation within the time available to him.  Therefore, I would assume that a constitutional amendment is not necessary.  Another way for the Government to abolish all ground rents is to buy them out and I should not be surprised if the Government were thinking along those lines.  If that is the case, we would be talking of a figure in excess of £100 million, which would be an enormous burden.  If the pledge had not been made and if the Minister had said he would consider the question of ground rents after the election, we would not be as anxious as we are.  But the pledge was made and common sense tells me that promises are not made lightly, particularly promises that involve enormous amounts of money and have major implications for the Constitution.  I would assume that the Fianna Fáil manifesto was not merely a set of political tricks but was a carefully considered document.  It is unfortunate that the Minister has changed the tone of this debate into a debate of confidence in him.  We do not wish to undermine the confidence of the House <Col N="1167" /> in the Minister.  He has a difficult job to do and we wish to support him.</P>
    <P>ACRA have publicly questioned the wisdom of holding this debate.  Any measures taken by public representatives at any level could jeopardise the introduction of legislation.  We would like to assure them that we will be vigilant not just tonight but in the next four years to ensure that the many pledges&mdash;and specifically in the context of this debate the one on ground rents&mdash;will be implemented and honoured.  I ask ACRA to accept that this pledge must be delivered and that it is the job of the Minister to do so within a short period.</P>
    <P>I would like a public assurance from the Minister that what we are witnessing now is not a long debate on a Bill to prevent the creation of new ground rents, which will sap the will of the Government and waste the time of this House, to avoid, prevent and inhibit a further Bill being introduced to abolish all ground rents.  It is the latter we are concerned about, because it is the policy of Fine Gael and was the policy of the National Coalition to eliminate all ground rents. That is the unanimous view of the House, but what about existing ground rents and the six months pledge?  In fact, what about the many pledges on the record?</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister a number of questions.  Firstly, will the legislation which the Minister is to introduce involve a change in the Constitution? Secondly, has the Minister any idea of the cost of the abolition of ground rents?  Thirdly, when exactly will the Minister be in a position to bring legislation before the House abolishing existing ground rents, the primary political pledge of the Government in the context of ground rents?  Fourthly, will the Minister give a public guarantee that the legislation dealing with the abolition of existing ground rents will be introduced within the time limit clearly implicit in the pledge in the manifesto and compounded by his letter to ACRA, that is, six months or thereabouts?</P>
    <P>Assurances, direct and unequivocal answers to those points, would do <Col N="1168" /> much to allay the concern we have. In all other matters we wish the Minister every success.  Many of us have admiration for the manner in which he is going about his difficult job&mdash; and we say that sincerely&mdash;but the matter before the House is one of extreme political and social concern. We would appreciate a straight response to the points I put.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I find a distinct difference between the tone of the debate tonight and that which existed last night.  It is possibly because the Opposition have had their go at this issue, got their headlines and done their political thing or political trick, as Deputy Keating said.  Tonight we are faced with a soft shoe approach, perhaps in an effort to overcome some of the irresponsible and rash statements that were made last night.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed with the approach of the Opposition to this fundamental and important question. It was totally negative.  No positive proposals or suggestions were put forward. All the difficulties involved in solving the ground rents problem were put, but no solutions were offered.  The possible costs were thought out, imagined and emphasised.  It is not surprising that this was the approach of the Coalition partners to this problem, because for four years they looked at the problem, perhaps thought about it, but certainly took no positive action.  Why was this the case? Was it because they lacked the initiative to do anything about ground rents?  Was it because they lacked the originality of thought, the formulation of new ideas or the breakthrough in new legislation?  Was it their inability to overcome practical difficulties posed by legislation such as this, or was it simply their inability to conceive methods of abolishing ground rents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rather than all of those things, or indeed in addition to them, it may have been the lack of a political will to initiate difficult change and to abolish ground rents.  I find it extraordinary that after such a short time the National Coalition, who were in power and had plenty of time at their disposal <Col N="1169" /> to take action, should attack so vehemently a Minister who is obviously making preparations to deal with this question.  It was the view of Deputy Quinn that Fianna Fáil do not have the guts for structural change. At the same time he described our manifesto as an action programme. That is a compliment in itself, but then he asked where the action was. A lot of action has taken place in this House.  As a new Member I find the operation of the House quite efficient, something that will surprise many of those who look at it from the outside.  One thing that I enjoy&mdash; and I realise that the more experienced Deputies have found this out over the years&mdash;is that if one does not wish to listen to a Member speaking one does not have to, although all Members have the right, democratically, to make their point. After only one month the Government have put through two Bills dealing with Ministers and Secretaries and setting up a new Department of Economic Planning and Development.</P>

      <P>We have also dealt with the Bill proposing to spend £350 million on telephones, a Bill concerning the IDA and some other Bills. Deputy Keating told us that ACRA sought pledges, and got them, from Fianna Fáil and that the National Coalition would not give a promise. He said they only promised to review the situation and keep it under review. After four years of thought and consideration why was that still the situation? I believe it was because of the lack of political will to bring about the necessary changes.</P>
      <P>In my experience ACRA never asked the Minister to provide the money. They only asked the Minister to provide a means for abolishing ground rents.  Deputy Keating referred to this tonight.  According to an evening newspaper a representative from ACRA made it clear that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1170" /> It was never envisaged, nor have we ever suggested, that the State should bear the cost of this proposal. In fact, money was never mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Keating's evaluations in my view are not helpful to the cause of ground rents abolition. In fact, I regard them as most unhelpful. He should tell the House the present market value of ground rents. I regard his estimates as grossly inflated. Who would buy ground rents at present if they were up for sale? What is the net value of ground rents, bearing in mind the tax which must be paid, the collection costs and the other difficulties associated with them? Let us be realistic about this.  Why suggest grossly inflated values?  This is unhelpful to the cause the Deputy says he supports.  In my view the real value is somewhere between nought and three times the face value of the ground rent.  The Minister is taking action and the Opposition know this. Perhaps this is why they staged this debate in an effort to regain something from their own disastrous policy of inaction.</P>
      <P>The Opposition raised the point that ground rents were put up for auction as an election issue.  I did a little research today and found that on 6th June, 1974, just before the local elections, the Coalition put ground rents up for auction.  A statement issued by the Government Information Services on 6th June, 1974, on behalf of the Minister for Justice reads as follows:</P>
      <P>At their meeting on 6 June, 1974, the Government decided that legislation should be prepared on the basis of proposals that had been submitted by the Minister for Justice, Mr. Patrick Cooney, T.D., on the subject of ground rents. Accordingly, the Minister intends to introduce legislation as soon as possible which will contain a provision to prohibit the creation of future ground rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government was also concerned with the difficulties regarding <Col N="1171" /> title and legal costs being experienced by persons wishing to buy out their ground rents under the 1967 Ground Rents Act and will seek to include proposals in the new legislation to ameliorate these problems.</P>
    <P>In coming to their decision the Government took cognisance of the view expressed in the Ground Rents Commission Report of 1964 in favour of a prohibition on the creation of future ground rents.  An extension of the right to purchase ground rents is also under consideration.</P>
    <P>That was immediately prior to the elections of 1974.  Since then the Coalition had four years in office and left office without any ground rents legislation on the Statute Book.  They now want Fianna Fáil to accomplish all aspects of the abolition of ground rents within six months.</P>

      <P>The Landlord and Tenant Bill was introduced in February, 1977.  The Second Stage was discussed but the Committee Stage was never tabled.  Why was this the case? Is it because of lack of political will to put through this kind of legislation? This has been an election year and I should like to point out that despite all the arguments made by the Opposition the Fine Gael manifesto made no reference whatsoever to their policy in relation to ground rents.  Presumably this is because ground rents had a very low political priority for the Fine Gael Party.  Alternatively, perhaps this highlights what the Fine Gael Leader has been stating for some time, that the Fine Gael Party had lost touch with their grass roots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Had the Coalition been prepared four years ago to prevent the creation of future ground rents, many people <Col N="1172" /> now appearing before the courts would not have to do so.  Ground rents are a unique device.  One must consider how much money has already been paid by many householders who have occupied their houses for quite a number of years.  The solution to the ground rents problem lies in terms of practical settlement, not in terms of the kind of compensation which the Opposition were talking about.  Practical settlement is a matter of agreeing figures on an individual basis and establishing a speedy method of legal process, perhaps even making provision for hardship cases because there are exceptions to every rule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy understands the nature of the ground rents problem or the nature of the problem facing people who are currently threatened in relation to ground rents or the real market value of these ground rents.  The more he speaks the more I am concerned that he is putting forward arguments which are unhelpful to those who wish to see the abolition of ground rents with the most reasonable marketable settlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This vexed question is one which has given all Deputies a great deal of concern and worry over a number of years. It concerns the right of the householder to full ownership of the piece of land on which his or her house is built. Surely it is not a very extreme or radical aim in this enlightened year of 1977&mdash;I do not say that with any party political bias&mdash;that we should strive to help ordinary citizens to achieve this aim.  Over 100 years ago Michael Davitt achieved this goal for the farmer tenants.  In this regard we are fortunate to have a Minister for Justice who has committed himself to this issue.  His post is extremely demanding in many respects and we can have only the highest admiration for him in that he has already given us an undertaking that he is proceeding rapidly with this legislation.  I have <Col N="1173" /> every confidence that the Minister will do so and that he has the necessary plans and initiative.  He has told us already he has plans immediately to introduce a Bill to abolish future ground rates.  I am confident he will keep to his promise and follow up by meeting the promises of Fianna Fáil in the election as close as he possibly can to the time limit he has allocated to himself.  I am so confident because he has approached all of his work with the same painstaking detail.  Consequently, those people at present worried, concerned and under threat in relation to the whole vexed question of ground rents can look with confidence&mdash;as I and my party do&mdash;to our Minister for Justice in the action he is taking to correct this problem which has been left to fester over the last four years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since it is the first occasion I have spoken in a debate at which the Minister for Justice is present, I should like to welcome him and congratulate him on his appointment.  I am sure he will not take it as a slur on his party or indeed on his Leader if I say that the events of June last, spectacular though they were, were nothing like as spectacular as some of the electoral triumphs enjoyed by the Minister when he was a student at University College, Dublin.</P>
      <P>Nobody will be gladder than I if not only future ground rents are prohibited from being created but existing ones abolished.  At the same time I have considerable difficulties about the amendment the Minister has put down. I propose to analyse this in such a way as to put a major question mark against it.  I would also urge our friends in ACRA&mdash;and I believe I am right in saying that ACRA have friends in all parties in this House&mdash;not to count their chickens before they are hatched, not to pat too many people on the back before they see the Bill the Government will introduce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find the amendment in the name of the Minister to be deficient on at least two counts.  It is semi-literate for one thing and devious for another.  If it is not semi-literate it is at least not entirely literate.  If time allowed us I should be very grateful if somebody <Col N="1174" /> like Deputy Power could apply his scholarly mind to the syntax of the words of the amendment.  The motion, if it were amended, would read:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann expresses its confidence in the Minister for Justice to introduce at an early date a scheme leading to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.</P>
    <P>That, to me, does not make sense.  It is quite in order for the Dáil to express its confidence in the Minister for Justice and to welcome his decision to introduce at an early date such a scheme, or something like that.  But the amendment, as it is phrased at present, has a large gap in the syntax in the middle of it, in fact such a large gap as to render it very nearly meaningless.</P>
    <P>I also find the amendment at fault in its deviousness or at least in its lack of clarity.  If the Government thought it necessary to put down an amendment to the Fine Gael motion it was obvious that they did so because they disliked the terms of the Fine Gael motion and because they wanted this House to pass a motion of a different kind.  Therefore, we have to scrutinise the motion and the amendment to find out what are the differences between them.  The chief difference is a very significant one.  Whereas the original motion calls on the Government to abolish existing residential ground rents, the amendment falls considerably short of that and, instead, merely promises the introduction of a scheme leading to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.  Between abolition and a scheme to abolish, I would suggest, there is a large gap.</P>
    <P>It is precisely because there is a large gap that this amendment has been put down by the Government. Unfortunately the nature of this large gap has not yet been disclosed to us but will, I am confident, when the Bill is actually produced.  Agreeing to produce a scheme leading to the abolition of existing residential ground rents is not by any means the same thing as saying that the Government will abolish existing residential ground rents.  It is not the Government who will abolish ground rents under this <Col N="1175" /> amendment, it will be the scheme.  We are entitled to ask: who, when, and how, under this scheme, will be paying for the abolition of the ground rents in question?  When we do this we will be scrutinising the Bill, when it appears, with considerable attention.  I would be very surprised if it goes as far as many people who voted for the Minister's Party expect it to go.</P>
    <P>Certainly I will grant that I was one of those who was disappointed by the failure on our part to process the necessary legislation before we left office. We are still in one of the most anomalous situations of any country in the world in regard to the ground rents problem.  Only in Britain, I believe, does it exist to anything like the same extent.  In many other European countries this sort of anomaly has been completely dispensed with.  Not only is it an anomaly in itself, it is one which has spawned and which continues to spawn even greater anomalies.</P>
    <P>Sometime before the last election I was approached by a resident of this city&mdash;somebody who is now a constituent of Deputy Woods&mdash;whose ground lease involved her not only in the necessity to pay her own ground rent but to collect ground rent from a number of other tenants on the same estate and to pay the money over to the solicitors.  She was not only being humiliated by having to pay ground rent on the house she thought she owned but she was further humiliated by being forced to act as an unpaid collection agent for the solicitor and, ultimately, for the absentee landlord involved.</P>
    <P>It is probably also true to say that, when this country became effectively independent after 1922, there was a considerable expectation on the part of many of the ground landlords of that day that they would be speedily dispossessed.  They must have been very relieved to find out that a native Irish Government was not proposing to do anything of the sort.  I am sorry that the Fianna Fáil administration which came in in 1932 did not take advantage of the fact that they could <Col N="1176" /> have, at any time between 1932 and 1937&mdash;and I am sure the then Labour Party would have supported them if it had come to that&mdash;abolished existing ground rents without any of the complications created by the subsequent passage of the 1937 legislation and Constitution.</P>
    <P>When we talk about ground rents we must never forget that we are talking about land.  Land is still the major source of wealth in Ireland, whether rural or urban.  I was very interested to hear Deputy Woods refer to Davitt because it is true that, for a century&mdash; and certainly also in our own time under successive native Governments &mdash;there has been a policy with regard to rural land which has been highly progressive.  The activities of the Land Commission in acquiring and re-distributing holdings, while not perhaps managing to give everybody on the land at least a living, has tended very substantially in that direction.  It is extraordinary that this land policy, which was such a feature of rural areas, in no way was carried over into urban areas.  If it had been we would not have the ground rents problem we have today.</P>
    <P>Of course the critical question, if existing ground rents are to be abolished, is a cash one.  I say that despite what Deputy Woods said.  He quoted a statement by ACRA to the effect that they did not expect the Government to buy out ground rents.  That may or may not be true, but one thing I am fairly sure of is that they do not expect to have to buy them out themselves.  If the Government are not going to buy them out and if they are not going to buy them themselves, we are left with very few options.  There is the option of expropriation, which might create constitutional difficulties. But there is another option I would recommend to the Government, one that is being followed in rural areas. It is that if the Government are going to buy out ground rents they should do so on the basis of exchanging them for land bonds.  This solution has been adopted for years in rural areas and I do not see why it should not be adopted with similar success in urban areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> Under the previous administration some progress was made even though the Bill we are talking about was not passed.  The actions of the then Minister for Local Government in requiring comparatively low, and sometimes nominal, ground rents as a prerequisite for the granting of certificates of reasonable valuation to new houses was a major step towards removing this anomaly.  We now have to wait and see if the anomaly will be removed finally by the Government. As I suspect, and as people may be deeply disappointed to find out, all the Government will do is to streamline the machinery a little and expect people to abolish the anomaly themselves at their own expense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I wish to support the motion standing in the names of Deputies O'Keeffe and Keating and myself calling on the Government to honour without delay their commitment to abolish existing residential ground rents.  Before doing so I should like to join in the words of welcome to the new Minister for Justice and to wish him a happy and successful term of office.  So far he is behaving as the pleasant man he is.</P>
      <P>Ground rents have been blistering householders for many years.  It is generally accepted that they are an undesirable burden on owners of houses and that they should be abolished.  It is unnecessary for me to go into the long history of ground rents because that would necessitate a longer speech than I have time for this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil set up a Ground Rents Commission on 2nd December, 1961, under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Conroy to inquire into and report on the whole question of ground rents. That commission reported to the then Minister for Justice, a member of the Minister's party, on 26th June, 1964. They recommended that tenants should be given the right to buy out their ground rents and recommended a method for so doing.  They also reported that it was undesirable that future ground rents be created.  While the commission did not give any specific recommendation in regard to the manner in which the creation of <Col N="1178" /> future ground rents should be prohibited, they said they should be prohibited and advised accordingly.</P>
    <P>No steps were taken by the Fianna Fáil Government from 1964 until they introduced the Ground Rents Bill in 1967.  That measure provided machinery for the purchasing of certain categories of ground rents but it did nothing whatever about the prohibition of further ground rents.</P>
    <P>The Bill was a good measure as far as it went.  However, I wish to emphasise that it ignored completely the creation of future ground rents although the Minister is on record here on several occasions as saying that the creation of future ground rents could be prohibited by a two-section Bill. The legislation in 1967 that was put on the Statute Book by Fianna Fáil ignored the question of the prohibition of future ground rents.  However, it provided machinery for a limited category of lessees to purchase their ground rents.</P>
    <P>Although it was a move in the right direction that Bill proved to be unsatisfactory even in respect of the purchase of existing ground rents because it transpired that the category of tenants that could purchase was limited.  The people concerned were involved in very heavy legal costs in the purchase of their rents.  For those reasons it was held that the Act needed amendment but that was not done between 1967 and 1973 while Fianna Fáil were in office.</P>
    <P>On the change of Government, Fianna Fáil got busy about the matter. They urged the new Government to do the job they had not done between 1964, when the Conroy Commission reported, and 1973, when they went out of office.  They were very energetic in urging the National Coalition to do the work they had not done.  They put down a motion deploring the lack of action by the National Coalition in regard to ground rents and it was debated here on 9th December, 1975.</P>
    <P>The present Minister contributed to that debate.  I think I can summarise his contribution to the debate by saying that the 1967 Act needed tidying. that future ground rents should not be <Col N="1179" /> created and that so far as existing ground rents were concerned something would have to be done about them.  In the Minister's view that was a long-term policy that would involve constitutional amendments and it was something that would take a long time to remedy.  In case I am not correct in my summary I propose to put two short extracts from the Minister's speech on the record.  At column 1123 of the Official Report of 9th December, 1975, he said:</P>
    <P>It is part of the Fianna Fáil package in relation to the ordinary householder that not only should he be relieved of the burden of rates but also of ground rents.  Fianna Fáil now urge that legislation be introduced immediately to stop the creation of further ground rents.  We also urge that the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967, be extended to remove the restrictions on tenants who are precluded by that Act from purchasing their ground rents.  This enactment should abolish the 25-year period below which a tenant cannot purchase his ground rent.  It should further abolish the restriction on buying out ground rents where the lease is not a building lease.</P>
    <P>The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of ground rents which is more difficult and that is the abolition of ground rents altogether.  This aspect can be dealt with after the new legislation is enacted because it causes certain constitutional problems.  We are absolutely in favour of the total abolition of ground rents but we are acutely aware that this could cause constitutional problems and that by doing away with one injustice we might be creating another.  The Constitution, in Article 43, guarantees the individual the right to private property and any attempt to abolish ground rents without compensation is, to my mind, likely to be unconstitutional.  It could be argued that it is not in accordance with the common good or the principles of social justice <Col N="1180" /> that ground rents should be imposed on tenants and the constitutional problems might be got over in that way.  However,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and this is very important,</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;this is a matter for further argument and it will obviously take a long time before it is remedied.</P>
    <P>That was the present Minister speaking on ground rents on 9th December, 1975.  He regarded the abolition of existing ground rents as something for the future, far into the future, involving constitutional changes, new legislation and a lot of thinking.</P>
    <P>The next step was the introduction of a comprehensive Bill entitled The Landlord and Tenant Bill, 1977, and was introduced by the Minister's predecessor, Senator Cooney.  That Bill did exactly what the Minister wanted. Section 108 prohibited the creation of future ground rents.  It extended very considerably, in section 66, the categories of people entitled to participate. I might summarise section 66 by saying that it covered every possible individual ground rent lessee who could reasonably expect to be covered.  It provided a cheap method of buying out ground rents.  It cured the defects in the Fianna Fáil Act which imposed a heavy legal burden on the tenants who had to buy out.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to contradict something he said last evening.  When he was told by one of the speakers from this side of the House that this measure was introduced and died with the general election, he very unfairly said that Senator Cooney introduced this measure, put it into cold storage and did nothing about it.  I want to put the facts before the House.  I hope the Minister will then avail of an opportunity of withdrawing his allegations of delay in respect of that Bill.</P>
    <P>It was initiated, in accordance with the procedure of this House on 19th January, 1977.  The Second Stage was taken on 2nd, 3rd and 24th February, 1977.  A very full debate was given and many points were raised.  As the House knows, and the country should know, the Second Stage of any Bill is an opportunity for discussing the principles in the Bill and giving the Minister <Col N="1181" /> an opportunity to put down amendments to deal with points raised and also giving Deputies an opportunity to put down amendments.</P>
    <P>Between the Second Reading Stage, which concluded on 24th February, 1977, and 20th May, no fewer than six lists of amendments, 113 amendments, were tabled to the Bill.  Many of them were in the name of this Minister of Justice and his colleague, the Minister for Health and Social Welfare and other Deputies.  Half of those amendments were in the name of the previous Minister, Senator Cooney.  They had to be worked out by the Parliamentary Draftsman and the Department of Justice.  Surely that was action between the Second Stage and 20th May when the Bill fell with the general election.</P>
    <P>I want to be perfectly fair to the Minister.  I understand&mdash;I cannot prove it in writing&mdash;the Bill was put back at the request of this Minister for Justice who was not ready to deal with it because it usually takes an Opposition time to prepare their amendments.  As I said, I cannot produce that in writing, but I was told it on reliable authority.  If I am wrong I am sure the Minister will avail of an opportunity to contradict me.  If it is right&mdash;and the massive number of amendments put down would suggest that it is right&mdash;then the Minister should withdraw his attack of yesterday evening on his predecessor, Senator Cooney, for deliberately soft pedalling and putting the Bill into cold storage.  In that Bill we have every blessed thing this Government were advocating in their motion which they put down in the name of the Fianna Fáil Party, in December, 1975, and to which I have just referred.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his election manifesto undertook to introduce a scheme which would lead to the abolition of ground rents, not a scheme to facilitate the purchase of ground rents.  It was not a scheme, as Deputy Woods would have us believe now, that would enable lessees to purchase their ground rents. That scheme was published in the now famous Fianna Fáil manifesto and was carried in many of the mini-manifestoes, <Col N="1182" /> issued in every constituency in more attractive language. The Fianna Fáil canvassers at the doors of tenants did not use hairsplitting language: they promised to abolish ground rents.  By the abolition of ground rents we mean that they would be abolished without expenses to the lessees.</P>
    <P>One thing is certain and that is that the Minister is not going to confiscate ground rents.  If he were he would have to have a constitutional amendment.  He is not going to have that because he told us last evening, and in reply to questions, that he is going to introduce this Bill which will lead to the abolition of ground rents within the time given in his undertaking to ACRA, namely six months. We know we are not going to have a referendum in a few days' time. Therefore, it is a matter of logic that he is not going to confiscate the ground rents, and I am glad of that.</P>
    <P>As he said in a part of his speech which I did not quote, ground rents are the income of many widows.  When ground rents were more desirable than they are now, men bought them and settled them on their wives in order to provide for them.  Many charitable organisations, too, have ground rents as their main source of income.  Indeed, some institutions that could be regarded as semi-State bodies&mdash;insurance companies guaranteed by the State&mdash;are some of the largest owners of ground rents.  Therefore, I am glad that for the sake of the widows involved and for the sake of others who are dependent on ground rents for an income and also for the sake of policy holders in the insurance companies concerned, that it is not proposed to confiscate ground rents. However, this does not relieve the Minister of his obligation to deliver the goods to the electorate whom he wooed with his manifesto in June last. We are here this evening in an effort to have him honour that manifesto.</P>
    <P>Since there is not to be confiscation of ground rents, they will have to be paid for but the question is who will pay for them?  If we take Deputy Wood's contribution at face value we <Col N="1183" /> may assume that the tenants or the lessees will pay for them.  If that is so they should say to the Minister, &ldquo;thank you very much but most of us could have paid for them at any time between 1967 and today&rdquo;.  Those who could not have paid for them during that time either because of the category being too limited or the legal costs being too high should say to the Minister, &ldquo;you are not doing any more than your predecessor in office did in the Bill that he introduced on January 19th, 1977 and consequently, your manifesto was nothing but a load of waffle&rdquo;.  If the Minister is to honour the solemn undertaking given in the manifesto, repeated in his letter to ACRA and by all of his party's candidates in the election, he should be the one, at Government expense, to pay for these ground rents.</P>
    <P>I would disagree with Deputy Horgan in his reference to land bonds being used to pay for ground rents.  I had the privilege of being Minister for Lands for a few years and I know that the history of land bonds is not good. I can assure the Minister that any attempt to introduce bonds as a means of purchasing ground rents will not be acceptable to the people concerned. Land bonds got a very bad name and rightly so because one only has to read the financial pages of any paper any day of the week to realise that the people who sold their land for four per cent land bonds would get less than £50 for every £100 worth of them on today's market.  Those who were given 99 per cent land bonds would lose about £20.  There were various rates of land bonds ranging from four per cent up to the ones I introduced at 16 per cent.  These latter ones were of some good because they are still standing at a premium.  They are good land bonds.</P>
    <P>I am warning the Minister not to try to introduce a land-bond type of purchase scheme in respect of ground rents.  He will have to pay for these in hard cash.  The people concerned will not be satisfied with less.</P>
    <P>We are accused of putting down this motion in bad faith.  Is it any wonder <Col N="1184" /> that we tabled this motion?  If it brought nothing more before the House than the contribution of Deputy Woods, it was worth while because we know now that in his opinion the people concerned will buy the ground rents out of their own money and that in the event of their being unable to do that, they will continue to pay for them indefinitely.  The contribution of Deputy Woods alone might shame the Minister into having second thoughts about his proposal in this regard.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, people are deceived by election manifestoes.  Yesterday while travelling in my car I listened to that very good programme, <i>The Gay Byrne Hour.</i>  Mr. Byrne had read all the national morning papers and also some of the English papers and he said that he was very honoured to read that an English paper had complimented this country in the most glowing terms on doing a good job of work in a certain respect and setting the lead for the country.  They were complimenting Fianna Fáil on abolishing rates and showing how this could be done.</P>

      <P>In the limited time at my disposal I would like to compliment the speakers.  We have had Deputies O'Keeffe, Quinn, Keating and Horgan and at least they had the good luck that they were not tainted by being members of the previous Government. The only one to stand up for the Opposition who was tainted with being a member of the previous Government was the last speaker.  He spoke about hard cash being needed.  Indeed, it was hard neck that was needed in his case to stand up here tonight.  Years ago I knew a priest who used always refer to the penny catechism when he would be giving his sermons.  I find it very difficult to know what the Members over there would now refer to were it not for the Fianna Fáil manifesto.</P>

We have had it up to now.  It will be very hard for us to deal with the misrule of the last four years, but we will apply ourselves to that too.  The abolition of ground rents is a continuation of Fianna Fáil policy.  It can be said that our founder abolished land annuities despite opposition from other quarters.  The Opposition had the chance in three Coalitions to abolish ground rents and they did not do so. Even in the last four years the previous Minister claimed that he was building 25,000 houses a year.  If he was, that was 100,000 opportunities he had that he let slip by.  Céad míle teach atá i gceist agamsa, 100,000 houses <Col N="1187" /> where there could have been ground rents that he did not apply himself to.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>One matter that is not clear to me at all after listening to the Government speakers, is why they will not accept our motion.  The motion simply calls upon the Government to honour without delay their commitment to abolish existing residential ground rents.  We have speaker after speaker on the Government side telling us that they are going to abolish existing residential ground rents and furthermore they tell us they are going to do it very quickly, in fact without delay.  At the same time, I presume in a quarter of an hour it is the intention of the Minister to muster his troops and put them through the lobby to defeat this motion.  Why?  An amendment was introduced which is rather nebulous.  I tried to discuss the amendment in my opening speech last night and I have had no explanation as to why this amendment has been put down or what exactly is the meaning of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as my party are concerned I would not wish the Minister, the Government, the tenant organisations, the ground rent householders or the general public, to have any confusion as to where we stand on this motion. There could be a certain amount of confusion arising as a result of the many references to the Bill which is to be circulated, as was variously mentioned, next week, in a few days, and at one stage the Minister referred to &ldquo;in a few hours&rdquo;, relating to the prohibition of the creation of future ground rents.  The question of future ground rents is common case and does not arise at all.  It has nothing to do <Col N="1188" /> with this motion.  As the Minister, the House and the country well know, the question of future ground rents was dealt with in that it was included in section 108 of The Landlord and Tenant Bill, 1977, which was introduced by the last Government. Obviously the Minister must be very well aware that, subject to any discussion on the technicalities involved, any Bill of a similar nature is going to have the full support of this side of the House.  He, the tenant organisations and the ground rent householders can take it that we will not delay the introduction of any such Bill.</P>
    <P>However, that has nothing whatever to do with this motion.  This motion relates to existing residential ground rents and a number of questions arose which are still on the table and remain unanswered.  What were and are Fianna Fáil's intentions in relation to the abolition of existing ground rents? These are the questions which were never explained at the time the commitment was given or at the time that any letters were written about the matter, and they have never been explained since.  The purpose of Fine Gael in putting down this motion was two-fold.  Firstly, it was to ensure that Fianna Fáil honour their commitment, and in that regard I thought it fair to point out that that commitment was understood by the people to mean that ground rents would be abolished in the context of the fact that an individual could at the moment&mdash;in fact since 1967&mdash;purchase his own ground rent.  That commitment was understood by the people&mdash;and that understanding was developed by the Fianna Fáil canvassers in the last election&mdash;as meaning that the tenant would not have to pay for the privilege of getting his freehold.  Our concern is to ensure that that commitment given to the people will be carried into effect as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>We come back to the reference to confusion.  If the Minister intends to abolish grounds rents without delay why not say so very quickly?  Why not accept our motion and so finish the matter?  Immediately afterwards he can introduce his two Bills, or if he <Col N="1189" /> is ready to abolish existing ground rents he has not explained why the two matters should not be included in the one Bill.  I endeavoured to trace the history of the Landlord and Tenant legislation in an effort to find a true and proper interpretation of what is involved here.  Since 1967 there has been a provision on the Statute Book giving ground rent lessees the right to purchase their ground rents and acquire their freehold title.  Considerable difficulties arose for many tenants in that regard because of the title problems involved.  Those difficulties were dealt with by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Cooney, in his Bill because that Bill provided not alone for the prohibition of the creation of future ground rents but also for a very simple way for the tenant to buy out, avoiding the difficulty of tracing superior interests, and mortgages affecting those interests.  The only thing the tenant had to do was to lodge his money with the county registrar and get statutory freehold title.</P>
    <P>It was against this background that the commitment was made by Fianna Fáil and it is only in that context it can be considered.  I tried to read the Minister's mind in the absence of any proposals from him.  I thought that last night he would give us some clear idea of what is involved but he did not tell us anything.  Questions which trouble my party and householders remain unanswered.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred at some length to the question of future ground rents. I regard references to future ground rents as a red herring.  Deputy Fitpatrick brought up a point I did not know of, and which the Minister will not like to be reminded of: the fact that this apparently was recommended prior to the 1967 Act and that recommendation was not adopted, by the Minister's party at the time.  In that context the Minister's reference to the many, many houses built during the days of the National Coalition&mdash; 100,000 or more&mdash;seems rather odd.</P>
    <P>(<i>Interruptions.</i>)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not introduce this to give a pat on the back to the National Coalition which would be <Col N="1190" /> well deserved.  This seems to be a sore point in the light of the interruption from the other side.  He introduced it in the context that a number of additional ground rents were also created during the same period, conveniently forgetting the number that were created during the period 1967 to 1973.  I accept that the rate of house building during that period was much less.</P>
      <P>When the proposals are made details are normally given and any wrong interpretations are denied or corrected. The interpretation that was accepted by the people has never been denied or corrected by the Minister either before the election or since.</P>
      <P>The contribution of Deputy Woods was interesting on a number of points. He suggested that positive proposals should come from this side of the House.  It is no harm to remind the Deputy that it was not this side of the House gave this commitment.  My party, hopefully for a short period, is in Opposition.  It was very often mentioned by the Deputy's party during the last four years that it was the duty of the Government to produce proposals. This is much more the case now when the commitment was given by the party in Government.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also said that the valuations given were not helpful.  I was at pains to stress that I made many efforts to get accurate figures and included in them was a supplementary question I put to the Minister for Justice on the 27th October last asking him to give me certain figures which he did not have.  I did the best I could.  It was time somebody brought the problem before the House and looked at the basic question involved in the abolition of ground rents&mdash;the question of money.  This basic question has been ignored by the Minister, other members of the Government and his party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background, which we went into in great detail, is quite clear.  The right of the tenant to purchase is there since 1967.  The 1977 Bill made it quite clear that this right was to be extended to a number of other people who did not qualify under the 1967 Act.  A very easy scheme was proposed in that Bill to enable the tenant, if he <Col N="1191" /> wished to pay his money to get his freehold.  It cannot be overstressed that it was in the context of that Bill in the background that this commitment was made by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>It is fair to mention that some criticism was levelled at Senator Cooney in relation to that Bill.  It contains 122 sections and is a monument to Senator Cooney.  It deals not alone with ground rents but with the whole question of landlord and tenant reform.  I strongly recommend the Minister to re-introduce that Bill in its present form or <Col N="1192" /> to redraft it and bring it before the House as quickly as possible.  There are thousands of tenants around ther country waiting to see many provisions in that Bill implemented.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House merely asks the Government to do what they committed themselves to do prior to the election in their manifesto.  The Minister said he has every intention of doing this.  I suggest there is no reason why this motion should not have the unanimous approval of the House.</P>
