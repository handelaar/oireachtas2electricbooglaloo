    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking last night I referred to the remarks of the former Minister for the Gaeltacht that science, technology, research and development had failed in the creation of industrial jobs.  I was making the point that the record of the previous Government in the allocation of funds for that important task was not great. The report of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards for the year ended 31st December, 1976, gives a small indication of that Government's failure.  The chairman reported that he and his colleagues had informed the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and through him the Government, of their grave concern about the inadequate funding of the institute in recent years.  He also stated that there had been a reduction in real terms in the amount of money from State resources to the institute by the previous Government to deal with research and development.  In their programme for future work the institute stated that in the circumstances in which no additional resources are available to the institute little could be done to introduce new services or expand existing activities and that consequently the emphasis would continue to be on the consolidation of existing services and that the resources were needed to meet immediate needs rather than to expand services.  It rings hollow today to hear former Ministers criticise the failure of science and technology and research and development in the creation of industrial jobs when they did not make enough funds available so that the institute could undertake the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the IDA and the other development agencies in their efforts to create employment over the <Col N="522" /> years.  I congratulate the IDA, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company which administers for the IDA in my area, AnCO, Manpower and all the other agencies who have done such tremendous work over the years in spite of the difficulties.</P>
    <P>We must keep in mind that from 1961 to 1971 there was a fall of about 106,000 in the numbers of people employed in agriculture, fisheries and forestry.  This distorts to some degree the efforts made in relation to job creation by all these agencies over the years.  But for the magnificent job being done by the industrial development agencies we would be much worse off than we are.  It is expected that a further 3,500 jobs will be lost in agriculture, forestry and fisheries over the next four or five years.  In these areas as well as in the industrial field it is essential that we have proper policies so as to create employment.  If we could do something to employ more people in agriculture, forestry and fisheries it would help to stem the job losses that we will otherwise experience in the next two years.</P>
    <P>In my region, the Shannon industrial zone, we have had tremendous success.  Something like 4,500 people are employed there and will bring home an estimated £13 million in wage packets this year.  These things should be put into perspective.  We should recognise the achievements and put them on the record.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, has introduced the provision to set up a consortium to deal with some of the problems we have in job creation.  I am glad that one of the functions of the consortium will be to co-ordinate the activities of existing State agencies and maximise their contribution to the development.  There is scope here for a formulated and co-ordinated policy for all the various agencies involved in industrial development. Some of them seem to be overlapping.  It is vital that we have no overlapping of State agencies and that we have co-ordinated effort by all the agencies involved.  This is where the consortium can be most effective in the matter of regional development.</P>
    <P>All of us have been disappointed <Col N="523" /> with the response of the EEC to regional policy.  We need now a proper regional policy and we have not got that.  Within the regions the people involved in development have at all times to come to Dublin for the final decision in relation to the problems ahead.  It appears that nobody at local level has the function of making decisions, particularly in small industries. First of all the project has to go to the county development team charged with responsibility for small industrial development.  In turn the small industries division of the IDA do a separate projection, and then the whole decision-making process comes back to Dublin.  Many small industrialists feel frustrated, give up hope and drop the project.</P>
    <P>It is outrageous that when a company is in crisis, which is often the case, separate appraisals have to be carried out by the IDA and by Fóir Teoranta.  Instead of simplifying the system for industrialists this seems to make it far more complicated.  If a company is in a crisis situation the agencies should be there to come in very quickly, take up the problem and deal with it effectively.  At times when separate appraisals are done by the IDA and Fóir Teoranta different decisions come from both bodies.  That is undesirable and would need to be examined by the people involved in these agencies.</P>
    <P>The regions will have to have power to make their own decisions in certain cases.  You cannot deal with regional problems by applying overall national policies and some allowance will have to be made for regional imbalance within the overall national strategy of industrial development. People within the regions should not have to wait for a national overall policy decision as to whether aid should be applied in individual cases, especially in crisis cases.  In this regard the local development people, who are the people most available to the region, should have the power of decision-making and the money to deal with emergencies that crop up within regions.  Regarding my own area, listening to Deputy Ryan last week one <Col N="524" /> would form the impression that everything was well in County Clare and that they had done particularly well in the matter of job creation there.  We have had the very same problems in west, north and east Clare as Deputy Ryan has had in his constituency in Tipperary.  These are the problems that exist in regions.  The general infrastructure is not suitable for the attraction of industry.  We must go ahead with the infrastructural development needed, such as the provision of telephones, proper road networks and other developments of this nature.</P>
    <P>We need freight subsidies as well to enable companies to compete with bigger concerns.  It is difficult to attract industry into a remote region of west Clare where freight costs are very high. If some freight subsidies were made available to the remote areas it would help them to get over some of the difficulties. Interest subsidies would also be desirable.  The high cost of borrowing the money now is putting many companies out of business.  In the underdeveloped regions some provision should be made for the payment of subsidies in cases where companies are getting into difficulty because of high interest charges.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is time too that we had some sort of State intervention or purchasing agency who would undertake to purchase the produce of small, delicate companies especially when they are undergoing temporary difficulties.  This would ensure maintenance of employment and of some of our basic skills.  In the mid-west region of my constituency in the past few years we have seen a magnificent industry go to the wall because we did not have the financial resources to keep it in operation.  That was the piano industry which had a highly skilled and competent work force completely shattered because the parent company decided to run down the plant at Shannon and eventually to close it down.  Foreign industrialists are important to us.  We need to attract them in here, and once they are in we should try to make our basic skills and techniques available to them.  With a work force capable of dealing with the problem we should <Col N="525" /> at a very early stage work towards Irish participation and when the parent or other companies decide that their operations are no longer important here we should have the management and basic skills to enable us to take over these companies and run them ourselves.</P>
    <P>Although we have had some setbacks, the overall situation is pretty bright.  We can press ahead with the drive to attract further industries.  In this regard quite a lot can be done in the regions to create white-collar jobs and some work has already been done in the Shannon region to attract this type of work.  We have had some success in getting overseas companies to set up their offices here.  There is great scope for development in this field.</P>
    <P>It is going to take time, energy and thought to make this Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy work. The Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary have the capacity, the intellect and the will to tackle these problems.  The electorate have given them some time but time is running out and we have got to be active in pursuing the goal of full employment. Every effort we can make in this House and elsewhere should be made to do that.  I welcome the Bill and hope that industrial development in this country will continue to be successful in the next few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with my colleagues I welcome this Bill and in doing so pay tribute to the work the IDA have been doing since they were founded in the early 1950s.  I should like to pay a tribute also, based on personal experience, to the efficiency of the officials dealing with industrial development, indeed with all aspects of its responsibilities in the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.  The Minister has a large task to fulfil but, if he fails, it will be his fault and not that of his officials because I know them to be people of a very high level of dedication and competence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not a great deal to say about the detail of the Bill beyond making two points.  First, it is evident from the IDA five-year plan drawn up for the <Col N="526" /> 1973-77 period that the targets set were exceeded in all regions apart from the eastern region.  One might argue that the targets originally set were inadequate in the case of the regions in question but the fact is that they were set in 1973 at a time of great economic optimism.  Yet, as matters turned out, they were exceeded in a five-year period which was marked by a great deal of economic pessimism.</P>
    <P>The eastern region, as Deputies may know, includes my own constituency; it includes County Meath, County Kildare, County Wicklow and County Dublin, including the city and county of Dublin.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to convey to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy my concern that, given that the people are now living in the eastern region, it behoves us to bring jobs to them, ensuring that employment is provided where they are residing.  I know the previous Government took a number of initiatives in this direction. These included the introduction of a large advance factory programme in Dublin, including the building of, I think, the largest ever advance factories at Finglas and Coolock&mdash;if I am not mistaken&mdash;of 40,000 sq. feet as against the previous standard size of advance factory of 6,000 square feet. They also extended the provisions of the small industries programme in respect of engineering, and one or two other forms of industry to Dublin where previously these grants had not been provided.  I would ask the new Minister to keep a close eye on these measures and, if they are inadequate, if jobs are not being attracted to the eastern region on a scale commensurate with the level of unemployment in the area, to consider further action.  I realise this poses problems because there are other parts of the country feeling that their claims are equally strong.  I would not wish anything that would be done to favour the eastern region to act to the detriment of any other area.  Indeed there is no reason why it should because, in many ways, a healthy industrial base in Dublin will have its effect in promoting development elsewhere; whereas if the capital, and the region around it, including <Col N="527" /> Counties Kildare and Meath are allowed to run down, this will have an overspill, detrimental effect on the west and south, and other areas as well.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I should like to make.  It concerns the development of inventions or new ideas in technology.  There are perhaps quite a number of people employed in State companies or the academic field&mdash;we have a very good example of this in Professor Timoney and the armoured car&mdash;people who have ideas but perhaps who do not have the capital to take the risk of going out on their own and developing.  They also run the risk that if they leave a job in the public service or the academic world they are leaving one which is both permanent and pensionable to go into the industrial field where there is no permanency and where, unless one is prepared to pay a handsome sum to an insurance company, there is no pension either.  We need to encourage such people who have these ideas and techniques to leave the safe haven of the public service, of the academic world, and go out and create jobs rather than remain in public employment where they are being paid out of the taxpayers' money by other people engaged in directly-productive activity.</P>
    <P>A suggestion was made to me&mdash;and I conveyed it while I was in office to various people in the industrial field &mdash;that some form of tax relief might be granted to people who propose to develop patented inventions, or some other limited category, which would distinguish the novel idea which would otherwise not be developed without the expertise of that particular person. One cannot envisage every new industry as availing of a tax relief of this sort, which would obviously include many which would be mere developments or replicas of other ideas.  If such relief was granted one must confine it to genuinely new inventions or new industrial processes.  I believe there is something to be said for such an initiative.  Quite clearly the bait of tax relief is a good deal more attractive to people than is the bait of a grant, again possibly because, as a people, we have a fascination with getting <Col N="528" /> away without paying tax or doing the Revenue man, whereas the possible receipt of a grant does not carry the same sense of excitement even though the monetary advantage may be even greater than the tax relief.  The success of the export tax relief is very good evidence of the particular attraction of tax reliefs in getting, in that case, exports and, I would argue, in this case, new inventive ideas put into practice in the interest of the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>Those are the main points I wanted to make.  I am glad this Bill has been introduced.  A great deal of the preparatory work for it was done in the period of office of the previous Government. I do not make that point in any party political sense&mdash;merely to set the record straight&mdash;because industrial development here has never been a party political issue; rather it has been one on which both sides of the House were agreed.  Therefore, for a third time, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill on the grounds that it will do something for the establishment of small industries here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment has always been our biggest problem.  The question has been: how shall we tackle it?  This Bill will afford us an opportunity of dealing with this ever-prevailing problem. There are plenty of opportunities for industry, based on agriculture.  It is time we realised this fact and took advantage of it.  Some might say: why the long delay?  The fact is we have had to overcome many difficult problems in the past but now conditions for improvement have emerged very clearly. I can see a tremendous future for agricultural development and I can see the same opportunities for industries based on agriculture.  Since 1968 our young people have had free education and they are today far better prepared for the challenges ahead. The people have a tremendous potential, given a lead.  They think this lead should come from the Government without any undue delay.  I believe that lead must be given immediately by setting up a support <Col N="529" /> system in terms of organisation, distribution and financial encouragement. Financial encouragement or support&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;will act as the spark but to achieve the best results it must be accompanied by plenty of advice to every young person so that every young person will be in a position to establish an enterprise on his own and get on with his own project.  It should be remembered that no venture is too insignificant. Every venture deserves encouragement and our young people should be given every opportunity to do their own thing both on the farm and in industries based on agriculture and native raw materials.</P>
    <P>In the 1960s the whole emphasis was on the establishment of major industries. We forgot all about the small man and woman wishing to start in business.  We forgot the important fact that the bulk of employment in England, France and the United States of America, to mention a few countries, occurs in small industry, in home and farm industry.  This is the type of industry we must develop now.  We must concentrate heavily on helping people to set up their own industries using their own resources.  We must give them every encouragement because not only will they provide good employment, and plenty of it, within a very short time but they will also provide tremendous social advantages and give a tremendous boost to national morale. We should never lose sight of this because what is basically needed today is a boost to morale.  We should give the young men a chance to prove themselves. Quite a few have set up their own little industries, many of them based on agriculture, and the employment created is not founded in money but rather on the sense of achievement and satisfaction it gives.  Financial rewards admittedly follow in time and these rewards will grow with the expansion of their efforts.</P>
    <P>The real wealth is in the land and what it produces.  The spin-off from agriculture is not yet fully appreciated. There are thousands of young people who can only realise their potential in achievement on the land or on processing what they take off the land. <Col N="530" /> It is clear that here the Government must give the lead.  Small and beautiful can be applied to home industries based on agriculture.  It will create a healthy development and, if the Government follow this line and face realities, Ireland and her youth will benefit.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to take a special look at the north-west and Donegal especially.  It is a county with twice the national average in unemployment. It is a county that is underdeveloped. It has a great potential in agriculture, forestry, bogland, tourism and so on which has never really been properly developed.  We had a thriving textile industry but, due to circumstances beyond our control, this industry has fallen off badly and unemployment in that industry is very high.  In the Inishowen peninsula 25 per cent of the male population is unemployed.  I would appeal to the Minister to give special consideration to the many small industries there working at a disadvantage because their opposite numbers in the Six Counties in the timber and cement industry are subsidised. Indeed, this affects people right along the Border.  They are all at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> their opposite numbers in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>Is there some grant aid that could be given to these small industries? There is at the moment a cross-Border study going on and possibly Donegal will benefit as a result of this study. Inishowen is the hinterland to Derry city.  It is envisaged there will be major developments in Derry and so we in Donegal should get special consideration in this particular region.  The IDA, the county development team and other agencies have been working hard but with little success to date.  The fault does not lie with the local organisations. I believe a great deal of the blame must rest on the previous Government who removed the incentives given to industrialists coming into the north-west.  The same incentives as those given to industrialists setting up in the east should be given to the west and north-west.</P>
    <P>I pass through three northern counties on my way to Dublin and I see in them industrial sites being established. I see them in Derry, Strabane <Col N="531" /> and Omagh.  It would appear that in that region the people are being geared for the establishment of industry.  It would be to our advantage if a similar drive were in progress in the north-west and western areas.  When this drive occurs I trust it will give a better opportunity to small industrialists, to our own people, who will be prepared to avail of the opportunities offered by this Bill.</P>

      <P>Like other Deputies, I welcome the Bill and congratulate the IDA and the Minister.  The IDA have deservedly earned a great reputation at home and abroad as one of the finest agencies for job creation in the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak for the mid-County Dublin <Col N="532" /> constituency, an area which includes the new town of Tallaght with its population of 85,000 and projected population of between 125,000 and 135,000 in the next few years.  I regret to say that I do not think the IDA have been as active in that area as we would have wished.  I am grateful that Tallaght attracted a number of small industries whose promoters came there many years ago.  They have provided much needed employment there and we are grateful to them.  I should like to put on record in this context that just before the general election this year a number of these industrialists were threatening to lay off employees. However, their confidence was restored and all that has changed.</P>
    <P>As a representative of the people of Tallaght, I criticise the previous Government particularly in relation to their neglect of the telephone service there.  It is incredible that the telephone service was not developed in that new town.  The lack of an efficient modern telephone service there meant that industrialists who might have come in to give good employment were discouraged.  It is a bad situation if people who wish to set up industries in an area like Tallaght cannot do so because they cannot get a telephone.</P>
    <P>There is another problem there and it relates to planning permission.  In this respect the IDA and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards could play a much greater part.  Dublin County Council and Corporation have provided industrial sites in Tallaght but the difficulty is that there are industrialists who wish to set up heavy industries there and the sites provided are not suitable.  People anxious to set up heavy industries in any region&mdash;I am interested mainly in Tallaght&mdash; should be helped by advice and the result of research by such bodies as the IDA and the IIRS.  When applications for planning permission are made and when local residents hear about them they have doubts in their minds as to the type of industries planned, and the IDA and the IIRS could help to remove these doubts.  Another problem is that too much advance publicity is sometimes given to a new industry <Col N="533" /> coming to an area and residents are not informed correctly about it.  A Bill was introduced by the last Government which removed the matter of planning appeals from the Minister and put it in the hands of a planning body.  The question of planning permission is a major problem in Tallaght and in many similar areas.</P>
    <P>I again congratulate the Minister for having introduced the Bill and I am glad to have been given the opportunity to speak here today on behalf of Tallaght and its people.  Before I conclude I should like to urge on the Minister to persuade AnCO to take a greater interest in the area, to set up a training centre there.  I understand that negotiations are taking place.  I hope they will result in the establishment of a training centre in Tallaght. Another matter the Minister might interest himself in is the provision of roads more suitable to an industrial area.</P>

      <P>Like other Deputies, I welcome the Bill and pay tribute to the work already done by the IDA which has played such a big part in the development of the country.  Our main problem is that of unemployment and never before has there been such need for the job-creating expertise of the IDA.  The IDA should be looked on as an integral part of a total plan involving physical, economic and social development, and it would be wrong for us here or throughout the country to sit back and hope that the IDA will do the job.  The IDA will not have the success they deserve unless they have the backing of all sectors of society.  We should consider what other bodies could play a significant part in supporting the efforts of the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today more than ever the role of the trade unions is being spotlighted.  This is not mentioned in the Bill and I realise that it would not be in order to discuss the merits and demerits of the trade unions and the employers. We must be firmly committed to solving our unemployment problem and make all possible efforts to make sure that each person who wants to stay in this country will be provided with a job.  Our experience since the foundation <Col N="534" /> of the State has taught us that a national effort will be needed if we are to succeed.  This Bill is an instrument in the drive for more employment, but I am not sure that we are all playing our part towards ensuring the success of the efforts being made.</P>
    <P>As a politician, one hopes to see the IDA bringing a large industry into one's own constituency.  This is understandable because the politician is under pressure from people seeking employment.  We must adopt the larger view and accept that an industry should be located where it has the best prospects of success.  Many promising industries have been set up which were heralded with great publicity and it was thought that prosperity would come to the areas in which they were located, but many such industries closed down.  In some cases this was unavoidable because of economic or other reasons.  Perhaps the necessary goodwill was lacking and there was a weakness which foredoomed these industries to failure.  The IDA should go outside their normal scope and consult with all sectors in an area to which they propose to attract a large industry. They should involve the trade unions and the employers and other State agencies such as Manpower and AnCO.  There must be goodwill on all sides to ensure the success of such industries.  Unless this is achieved we will simply go on providing a certain number of jobs each year but we will not bring about a real change in the pattern of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Despite the picture being painted of the Irish worker, we know with certainty that he is just as capable and efficient as any other worker if he is given the opportunity and the conditions to prove his ability and dedication to work.  It is the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing to make jokes about the attitude of workers towards their work but it is a perverted type of humour.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties to be overcome in industrial development and the Government are playing their part.  We must create real prosperity in order to provide gainful employment for the thousands of young people leaving our educational establishments every year. Although our legislation in this area is <Col N="535" /> enlightened, we must consider whether we are backing the legislation by our own efforts.  We cannot legislate our way to prosperity; legislation will help but it is not enough.  We must ensure that never again will any major industry close down because of disagreement between the shop floor and the manager's office.  There were probably grievances in most cases where this has happened and these could have been smoothed out.  Time is not on our side. Perhaps the officers of the Labour Court could be involved even before an industry is established in order to assure the industrialists concerned that we are doing everything possible to make their enterprise a success.</P>
    <P>Many years ago I read an OECD report on this country which emphasised that we should try to develop industries based on our own natural resources.  We have made great strides in mining and in harnessing our rivers but the land is our greatest asset and we must look to the land to provide for the needs of industry.  Our scientists should be examining the resources which could be developed as raw material for manufacturing industry. Other countries have done this and they are very prosperous.  They may have some unemployment but it is very little compared with the rate of unemployment here.  This Bill is the start of a really big drive towards the road to prosperity.</P>
    <P>We have never known the great prosperity or great poverty of many other countries.  We have been told that emigration is non-existent but there is always some emigration.  In the past we did not have the same pressures and may have been a bit lax.  If a man was unemployed he could always emigrate, but that day has passed.  Out of respect for ourselves we should never again accept emigration as a safety valve for our population.  If we are worth our salt and the sacrifices that have been made for us by previous generations, we should now try to emulate the feat of the West Germans and other Europeans. When they and the Japanese managed to pull themselves together after the Second World War we <Col N="536" /> should at least be capable of developing our resources and we should show that we can do it too.</P>
    <P>The location of industry is a touchy subject.  For some years it has been the policy of the IDA to take industries out of larger urban areas like Dublin and to locate them in areas where they thought the purpose would be served.  An industry should be placed in an area in which it will have the best prospects for success.  There is no point in locating industry in areas where it will not thrive.  Recently, the IDA have been considering their priorities in regard to the location of industry.  The greater Dublin area has suffered from the loss of employment. A Minister in the previous Government admitted that Dublin was always a disaster area in regard to industry. I cannot remember whether he took any steps to cure the situation. The Government are committed to attracting new industry and developing existing industry.</P>
    <P>The location of industry should be carefully planned.  Decentralisation will help to some extent but it is not the be-all and the end-all of our problems. We should plan comprehensively and use every factor in our society that can contribute to success.  Some people have the audacity to criticise the unemployed.  They say there is work available for them but we know there is no work for them.  People want employment and it is our duty to provide the instruments for the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>During his speech, Deputy Walsh said there was resentment and opposition to industries in certain residential areas.  We must face the fact that these protests are sometimes justified. Recently there have been many court cases on this issue.  One of our weaknesses is that we do not plan the location of industry.  Having completed their plans the IDA should present the facts to residents' associations.  It is our duty to ensure that the development of industry is not hindered.  We must acknowledge that unemployment is worse for an area than a slightly unsuitable factory.  At the same time, the IDA should not encourage noxious industries and industries that have <Col N="537" /> been rejected in other countries.  We escaped the horrors of the industrial revolution but technology is creating many new problems as well as improving standards.  We should not attract industry at any price.  Most cases of &ldquo;aggro&rdquo; to use the modern word between residents and authorities can be solved.</P>
    <P>It is a good sign that the Government have not forgotten the Third World.  Section 4 of the Bill provides for the IDA to offer assistance of a technical or advisory nature to developing countries.  We are glad that the ESB and other semi-State companies are sending their workers to developing countries.  I welcome the provisions in section 4 of the Bill.  Even though we have many problems we have not forgotten the people of the Third World.  Perhaps it is another aspect of our missionary spirit which inspires us to help those who cannot help themselves. The ESB and other semi-State companies gain a great deal of knowledge from having representatives in the Third World.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the ESB doing so well in that line.  It is another part of industrial development.  Naturally, we must plan for our own country but it is good to realise that there are people worse off than we are and that we are in a position to offer them some help in spite of the fact that we do not have such great resources.  It is good to know that we can offer some help to those developing countries and to be able to assure them that they have our goodwill.</P>
    <P>I should like to see all legislation concerning industrial development being codified because we would then be in a position to see where the weaknesses are.  If that was done we could move forward on a big drive to attract capital and industry here.  Our people have a trust in us and they are waiting for us to provide employment for their sons and daughters.  We must accept that mistakes have been made but we should not have a guilt complex about that.  There will be casualties in the industrial line in the future and we must face that.  However, that is all part of the industrial theme and we must learn from such happenings. When an industry is established problems <Col N="538" /> may occur but we must admit the existence of such problems and then let each side involved work out a solution in the interests of all.  We are slowly getting people to realise the importance of Bills such as that before the House, but we must ask ourselves if we are developing that goodwill and intelligent outlook to back up our legislation.  Unless our legislation is supported by public opinion it will not do much good.</P>
    <P>We cannot legislate ourselves into prosperity.  This House can give powers to the IDA but there is more involved than that.  I should like to see progress-chasers taken on in our industries. It is his job to examine every line contributing to the manufactured product and if he discovers any bottleneck or hold-up he must remove it.  The role of the progress-chaser in Irish industry has not been fully developed and it must be developed in the interests of efficiency.  We must examine the industrial scene and legislation introduced to help us become a more industrialised nation in conjunction with all sections involved&mdash;industrialists, trade unions and the universities.  They must all contribute in the effort to improve our situation.  There is no point in blaming the Government or the IDA.  Failure in any industrial drive starts with each one of us.  The question of whether or not we are going to achieve prosperity depends on what we are willing to put into this drive.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because I know it will help the IDA attract more industries. However, unless the IDA get 100 per cent support from us the legislation will not do the job we want it to do.  We want thousands of jobs in order to satisfy the people who sent us here and to make this a better country to live in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of a prior and long-standing commitment overseas in the cause of industrial promotion, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy cannot himself be here today as he would have wished.  So, it falls to me to reply to what has been a very lengthy debate <Col N="539" /> on a subject of major importance. First, I should like to thank on my own behalf those Deputies who in the course of the debate extended their good wishes to me in my new office. I also want to thank, for the Minister, those Deputies who likewise extended similar good wishes to him.</P>
      <P>The debate has truly been a very wide-ranging one, extending well beyond the questions of industrial development and of job creation which depends on industrial development.  Indeed, at one stage the contributions from the Opposition took in such topics as the need for large-scale reclamation of land west of the Shannon and the difference between &ldquo;work&rdquo; and &ldquo;toil&rdquo;.  Apart from some reservations, expressed particularly by Deputy Kelly, Deputy Desmond and Deputy Collins on the proposed establishment of an industrial development consortium, there has been a considerable degree of consensus on all sides of the House on many of the matters raised during the debate and there has been a general welcome for the Bill which was recognised as being, in Deputy Kelly's words, &ldquo;plainly desirable and overdue&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>With one exception, those Deputies who spoke of the work of the IDA expressed their appreciation of the work of the authority and of the magnitude of the task before it.  These expressions of appreciation were by no means uncritical and are all the more valuable for that.  There was, however, one dissenting voice, that of Deputy Browne whose criticisms of the authority went beyond what was fair and reasonable, and who was, in fact, taken to task from the opposite side of the House for some of the things he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the Minister's opening references to a more comprehensive review at a later date of the powers and functions of the IDA, some Deputies opposite, particularly Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy White, seemed to think that the introduction of the Bill should have awaited a review of the IDA.  Such a review at this stage, apart from delaying overdue and necessary legislation, would inevitably <Col N="540" /> have led to some diversion of the scarce resources at a time when urgent attention has to be given to the work of job creation and job maintenance and related industrial promotion.</P>
    <P>The work of the industrial development consortium would also be relevant to any such review.  However, from what I know of the Minister's thinking, I would envisage that the main emphasis in any such review, and indeed in the work of the consortium, would be on how to intensify and give greater impetus to the development and expansion of domestic industry, especially small firms located in smaller towns.  In this regard the views of Deputies from all sides of the House as expressed during this debate are particularly valuable.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I am struck by the fact that some of the criticisms made during the debate mainly had to do, not with what is in the Bill, but with the proposals for the establishment of an industrial development consortium and the fact that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy chose the floor of this House to announce these proposals. I am rather surprised by the attitude of Deputy Kelly in this respect, because I cannot think of a more appropriate place to mention such a proposal than the floor of this House, nor a more appropriate time than at the introduction of a Bill dealing with industrial development.  Certainly the Deputy's criticism is in contrast to the criticism we have heard from time to time in the past that Ministers tended to avail of functions outside the House to make statements that should more properly be made within it.</P>
    <P>If there was one theme which might be said to have run right through the debate, it was that the most urgent and the greatest problem confronting us is that of job creation, and that the Industrial Development Authority have a major contribution to make to the solution of this problem.  Other recurrent themes were the importance of small industry, particularly to smaller towns and communities; the need for further development of industries based on natural resources, particularly agricultural products and beef especially; the need to maintain and <Col N="541" /> if possible improve our industrial incentives; and the importance of proper industrial relations to industrial development, a point which we did not require a tragedy like Ferenka to bring home to us.</P>
    <P>Neither the Bill nor the consortium is envisaged as a panacea for the very great problems of employment and job creation that confront us.  They are intended as a contribution&mdash;not a radical solution&mdash;to the solution of the job creation/industrial development problem.  In the coming years we need every job we can manage to create on a sound basis and we equally need to maintain every job in existing industry that can be maintained on a sound basis.</P>
    <P>The concluding stages of the debate have taken place in the shadow of the very upsetting developments at Ferenka, which have very serious implications not just for the Limerick area and the mid-west region but for the country as a whole.  The Taoiseach said in the House on 29th November that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy would now pursue in conjunction with the Industrial Development Authority such proposals as there are to see if employment can be sustained in the Ferenka factory and that the Minister for Labour will be looking into the question of personnel relations in factories such as Ferenka to see how they can be improved.  I want to comment, however, on the wider implications that the Ferenka situation could have for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The dominant theme running through this debate was that of the urgent need for job creation, and the magnitude of the effort needed to provide jobs for all our young people over the coming eight to ten years. We have never in our history been able to create jobs on this scale.  A very great deal of effort and co-operation will be required if we are to do so.  In fact, the National Economic and Social Council some weeks ago expressed the view that the achievement of our employment targets was not an unattainable objective</P>
    <P>Export sales relief as an aid is <Col N="542" /> provided the community, that is to say the Irish people, will its achievement and accept the policy that will achieve it.  What has happened at Ferenka and the events leading up to last Monday's announcement certainly make the achievement of our employment objectives much more difficult than they were.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed more than once during the debate about the need to retain our industrial incentives at their existing levels at least.  I will have some comments to make on that later, but the point I want to make now is that our incentives, generous though they are, would in future be of diminishing value to us if in the eyes of the world there appeared to be the prospect of a Ferenka-type situation recurring.</P>
    <P>In his visits to the United States within the past two months, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy has, as part of his industrial promotion efforts, met and spoken to hundreds of United States businessmen, a number of whom have been showing interest in establishing factories here.  One of the first questions the Minister was asked&mdash;and I am sure it was also being asked of him with even greater emphasis at similar meetings yesterday and today&mdash;had to do with the state of industrial relations in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are many problems to be sorted out in connection with Ferenka, and many lessons to be learned if we are willing to learn them.  I am sure I speak for everybody in the House when I say I hope the IDA will be successful in their efforts to sustain employment in the factory.  But, above all, I say to the House&mdash;though it is not a matter for the House or for the Government but for all of us as a people&mdash;we cannot afford to let another Ferenka-type situation develop.</P>
    <P>During the debate a number of Deputies raised the question of export sales relief and indeed this question has again been in the news in the past few days.  The Minister made a detailed public statement in this matter on 21st September last and copies of that statement were made available to Deputies. <Col N="543" /> generally considered to be incompatible with the spirit of the Treaty of Rome. We have always accepted that at some stage it might be necessary to change the system.  However, it was recognised in the declarations associated with Protocol 30 to the Accession Treaty that, if the system had to be changed, it would be replaced with a system which would be equally effective as an incentive.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that the time has now come when we must look for a new system.  Apart from any other consideration, export sales relief is beginning to lose its attractiveness as an incentive for new industry because of the expiry date of 1990.  A number of possible alternatives are being examined, but a final decision has not been taken and in any event a change will not be made for at least two years.  In examining possible alternatives, considerations such as those mentioned by Deputy Ruairi Quinn regarding the encouragement of developments downstream of export projects will be very much to the forefront. In the meantime those enterprises which have qualified for export sales relief, or which may qualify before the changeover to the new system, will continue to benefit from export sales relief up to the expiry date of 1990.  Those who qualify under the new system can expect to do as well and to get as much support as they would under the present system.</P>
    <P>Since 21st September, discussions have continued between member states and the Commission concerning the establishment of new arrangements to co-ordinate the regional aids of all member states, including Ireland. A document has been drafted by the Commission and will be finalised following consultations with the member states beginning in mid-January, 1978.  This document enunciates general principles only and the manner in which these principles will be applied to individual member states will be settled in bilateral discussions with the Commission.</P>
    <P>At this point I should like to refer to the position of Dublin which was mentioned by several of the Dublin <Col N="544" /> Deputies during the course of this long debate.</P>
    <P>The IDA Regional Industrial Plans 1973/77 stated that &ldquo;while recognising the need to contribute to the provision of jobs for the natural increase in Dublin's population, the IDA, in accordance with the Government policy, grant aids manufacturing industries in the Dublin area only in the case of new enterprises for which an alternative location is not feasible, and expansion of existing enterprises in Dublin&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The IDA strategy with regard to Dublin was based on the assumption that non-grant-aided growth of existing industries would be adequate to meet employment needs arising from the natural increase in population.  This was the case until the recession, which resulted in very high levels of job losses in established industries and which reduced the growth rate of non-grant-aided industry.  It is estimated that in the four years 1973-76, manufacturing employment in Dublin declined by approximately 12,000 compared with a net gain in the rest of the country of approximately 8,000.  Dublin also experienced a faster rate of growth in the number out of work as measured by the live register; at present there are over 36,000 persons unemployed in Dublin.</P>
    <P>As a result of these developments, the IDA reviewed their strategy with regard to grant-aiding projects in the Dublin area within the overall objective of retaining the population growth of the Dublin area to the equivalent of its natural increase.  The following are among the initiatives that have been taken in this connection :</P>
    <P>(i)  The Dublin area is now being promoted as a location for large scale industries.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The small industries programme was extended to Dublin early in 1976 for the following selected sectors: engineering, plastics, and chemicals and pharmaceuticals.</P>
    <P>(iii)  The IDA are building two 70,000 sq. ft. advance factories at Coolock and Finglas; other advance <Col N="545" /> factories will be provided if required.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Under the recently announced programme for the construction of cluster units, two cluster units for small industries are to be constructed in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Another point which occurred and recurred during the debate was the role of the IDA in connection with domestic industry and the encouragement which should be given to it.  It is an inescapable fact that we must continue to attract new overseas projects and this will continue to be the case for many years to come.  But side by side with that we need, as Deputies on all sides urged, to do everything possible to maximise the contribution of domestic industry, particularly small industry, towards increasing output and employment.  In fact the IDA are at present organising specialised divisions dedicated to small and domestic industry and its special problems and needs.  More staff resources are allocated to these areas than to overseas industry.  The contribution of domestic industry, and in particular small industry, to the IDA's overall programme over the past year has been particularly encouraging.  In his opening remarks the Minister pointed out that the purpose of the present Bill is to facilitate the IDA in giving more assistance to domestic and small industry.  He also mentioned the Government's commitment to double the rate of project approval for small Irish industries and mentioned the measures recently introduced to enable this target to be met.</P>
    <P>When people speak of assisting small firms they generally have in mind Government assistance.  It has been suggested, however, that there are a number of ways in which these big or larger companies could help small firms.  The Minister, I feel, would suggest to the bigger companies in Ireland, whether manufacturing or distributing companies, the following ways in which they could help small industries.  First, the big companies could pay their bills to small firms on time.  In general, the small firm cannot afford to wait for its cash. Secondly, in placing orders with small firms big companies should resist the <Col N="546" /> temptation to use their bargaining power to the point that it stretches the resources of the small firm unfairly. Thirdly, big companies occasionally come across products of commercial interest but which are not worth developing in a large company.  Smaller firms should be encouraged to develop these products against firm purchase orders for their early production.</P>
    <P>Much of the criticism levelled at the proposal for an industrial development consortium was based on the claim that it would not have the same powers or teeth as the national development corporation which had been spoken of in the latter stages of the lifetime of the previous Administration. I was intrigued by some of the references made to the national development corporation, notably Deputy O'Donnell's assertion that the previous Government had taken a firm decision to establish such a body when in fact this is not the case.  Proposals for the establishment of such a corporation had under the previous Administration been circulated by the Department of Industry and Commerce in April, 1977, to other Departments as the start of the process of detailed consideration by the Government of the establishment of such a body. With one exception reactions from Departments had not been forthcoming at the time of the change of Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly felt that the proposed consortium, as he understood it, did not include the agricultural sector and that this was a major failing.  Although the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy did not name the Minister for Agriculture as one of the members of the consortium that is not to say that all agriculture-based activities will fall outside its area of operations. The consortium will be flexible in its approach; insofar as developments in the agricultural sector can contribute to the process of industrial development they will receive due consideration from the consortium.  It should also be remembered that some of the greatest opportunities for growth in this sector lie in the further processing of agricultural produce and these activities fall within the scope of industrial policy generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="547" /> Deputy Desmond felt that the idea of a consortium should be buried quietly and replaced by something &ldquo;more responsive to our needs&rdquo; which, however, he did not define.  He also referred to the views of ICTU on the matter.  I can say that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy exchanged views on this matter with representatives of ICTU on 23rd September last at the meeting with the Taoiseach and economic Ministers. He made it clear that there was no ideological opposition to the idea of a national development corporation but that it was not clear what it could do that could not be done by existing institutions.  The Minister indicated that he was prepared to discuss the matter further with them during the present month and in the meantime would be interested in seeing their side of the case developed.  The Minister will be arranging further discussions on the subject.  Without prejudice to these discussions the Minister does not consider that there is very much that ICTU would expect from the development corporation that could not be equally well dealt with by the consortium.</P>
    <P>There were many other points brought up during the debate which I think could be better and more fully dealt with during the Committee Stage of the Bill.  A number of Deputies drew attention to the particular problems and needs of their own constituencies and areas, particularly the provision of new industry and also the special problems which exist in the case of Border counties.  It would not be invidious if I were to mention in this connection Deputies Cowen, Flynn, Leonard, White and Conaghan among many Deputies who brought up the point.  I can assure the Deputies that the Minister, the Department and the Industrial Development Authority are very much aware of the industrial development needs and the special problems that exist in these areas.  The comments made during the debate by these Deputies will be given due attention and particular consideration by the Minister, the Department and the IDA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have the opportunity to be here during the discussion on the 10th Report but the Minister tok a very careful note of what Deputy Ryan said in his contribution and agreed with many of the points raised by the Deputy.  Deputy Ryan expressed concern that debates on European affairs be held on a regular basis.  The Minister shares that concern and hopes that debates such as the one we are now dealing with and debates on the reports on developments in the European Communities will provide a suitable opportunity for broad discussion.  The Minister also agrees that debates should be held as soon as possible after publication of the reports, and feels that it should also be possible for the House to consider reports of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Community at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving the motion on the 13th October the Minister mentioned that we were looking forward to the visit the following day of the commissioner in charge of agriculture and fisheries, Mr. Gundelach.  The Minister believes that the visit was very valuable because it afforded two Ministers an opportunity to make personal contact with Commissioner Gundelach in a relaxed atmosphere away from the pressures attendant on council meetings in Brussels and because they could discuss in a constructive way a wide range of important problems of particular interest to us at present.  In this respect the Minister believes that the talks were useful to both sides.  On the fisheries question the Minister for Fisheries, Mr. Lenihan, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs took the opportunity to reiterate the Government's conviction that in the revised fishery policy <Col N="550" /> Ireland must retain a broad exclusive coastal zone, that being the only effective way to ensure conservation and the access to fish stocks necessary for the expansion of the Irish fishing industry and shore-based activity dependent on increased catches.  A discussion took place on the new commission proposals, which had only just emerged, on catch quotas for the member states for 1978, on control and conservation measures throughout the 200 mile zone, on structural assistance to the fishing industry, and on financial assistance from the Community for the cost of fishing protection.  Of necessity these discussions were of a preliminary nature as the documents needed to be studied in detail, but they afforded an opportunity to Mr. Gundelach to explain the Commission's thinking.  The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and for Fisheries made it clear that the discussions were without prejudice to our general position on a coastal zone.</P>
    <P>There was a most useful discussion on the agricultural side, between the Ministers for Agriculture and Economic Planning and Development and the commissioner on a broad range of issues of current importance.  These included for example, the question of changes in the directives on structures, the common organisations of the market for sheep meat, the monetary compensation amounts and the Commission's recent memorandum on the beef support arrangements.  On structures proposals are expected from the commission shortly and the Ministers emphasised their deep concern that the changes to be proposed should meet the needs of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>In relation to the MCA question. Deputy Ryan mentioned the danger of a repetition of the sort of situation which we faced about a year ago when these charges to currency fluctuations became a very serious burden on our agricultural exports.  The Minister entirely agrees with the Deputy that this is a most important matter for us as large net exporters.  It is essential that there should be progressive reduction and abolition of MCAs throughout the Community.  The Minister was glad to say that Commissioner Gundelach was able to assure him that <Col N="551" /> revised proposals could be expected from the Commission in the very near future.  Deputy Ryan referred to the danger of weakening of the common agricultural policy as a result of the enlargement of the Community through the admission of the present applicant countries.  The Minister did not feel it appropriate at the time to go into the details of the problems of enlargement but he assures the House and Deputy Ryan, in particular, that it is a cardinal principle of Irish Government policy to ensure that in any enlargement process, the principles and mechanisms of the common agricultural policy will be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>During the course of Deputy Ryan's contribution the Minister noted that he referred to the Regional Fund as a mere pittance.  The Minister agrees with that.  This view is shared in Commission circles as well.  In the course of an address to the European Parliament earlier this year.  Mr. Jenkins, the President of the Commission, referred to it as &ldquo;tiny&rdquo;.  If the Regional Fund is to have any significant impact on the poorer regions of the Community it will have to be increased substantially. Something on the lines of a new &ldquo;Marshall Aid&rdquo; programme, which would transfer resources from the richer centre to the poorer peripheral regions, is what is really required.  As the Minister indicated last week the budget for the Regional Fund for 1978 has not yet finally been fixed.  The Commission's original proposal was that 750 million European units of account should be allocated to the fund's budget.  At the present exchange rate this works out at somewhat less than £400 million.  Of this Ireland can expect a commitment for next year of £20 million at the very most.  The entire £400 million would not be too much if our regional problems were to be considered seriously by our partners. The Minister feels that the Community still lacks the political will to tackle its regional problems.  Unless there is a complete change in the attitudes of the richer member states this situation will continue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan also referred to the trading surpluses being accumulated by some of our partners and how these <Col N="552" /> surpluses compare to their reluctance to contribute to the Community's fund. Even more interesting is the comparison between the Community's budget and the total national budgets of the member states.  The draft Community budget for 1978 before it was cut back was a mere 2.3 per cent of the total national budgets of the Nine.  The Regional Fund is only about 6 per cent of the Community's budget.  The Minister feels that he need hardly say that we will continue to strive to improve the benefit under the fund.  As the Minister indicated earlier, the regulations governing the distribution of the fund are at present under review.  It is hoped to complete this examination by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that in future the fund will be distributed partly by quota as at present and partly outside that system.  The Irish Government support in principle the idea that the fund should have a non-quota part.  It will give a flexibility which is not possible under the fixed quota system.  The Government will, however, resist most strongly any attempts to use this section of the fund to help regions outside the present designated regions or to aid problems which are not strictly regional in character.  The fund's resources are already meagre and we feel they should be confined to regional problems in the areas which most urgently require help.</P>
    <P>The Commission have also made a number of suggestions which if accepted will make the administration of the fund more efficient and effective.  Firstly, applications for aid at present can be made only for infrastructural projects which are directly linked to industrial projects already being aided.  It is now proposed to remove this link, and since we have found this provision rather restrictive in the past we welcome this change. Secondly, the Commission propose that the system of payment would be speeded up, and this would also be welcomed by the Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  It is understood that there is no proposal to change the present quotas.  Deputies will recall that ours stands at about 6.5 per cent, but should the question arise we will press for a share which <Col N="553" /> will reflect more accurately the seriousness of our regional problems compared to the rest of the Community.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked me to refer specifically to the question of elections to the European Parliament, and Deputies have a special knowledge of this, having regard to the fact that the time of both Houses, the Dáil and the Seanad, has been taken up with the European Elections Bill.  The prospective date for the European direct elections is May or June of next year. That date was first recommended by the heads of state at the meeting of the European Council held in Rome on 1st and 2nd December, 1975.  This recommendation was subsequently incorporated in the Council decision of 20th September, 1976, which set down the broad provisions governing the holding of the elections.</P>
    <P>The May/June, 1978, deadline therefore represents a commitment by the member states at the highest level that direct elections will be held on that date.  The Government support that commitment and furthermore consider it our vital concern to do everything possible to ensure that all the other member states will also be in a position to meet the deadline.  This means that not only must we in Ireland be ready to hold direct elections in May or June, 1978, but the other member states should be in a similar position.  The Minister has made this clear at every opportunity to date and especially when the member states have discussed this matter in the Council.  There can thus be no mistaking Ireland's attitude towards direct elections.  I have already mentioned that the legislation in connection with the realisation of that ideal as already expressed is about to become law.</P>

We left them in no doubt as to where we stood.  I understand, again from my knowledge of the matter, that the British are taking a very serious view of it.  There is a problem there in relation to the question of whether it will be a regional list system or whether the present form of election in Britain will be the test.  There is a conflict there between the regional list system and &ldquo;first past the post&rdquo;.  That is nearing resolution in the British context.

      <P>I am trying to help the Deputy.  As Deputies well know, it is not merely a matter of holding direct elections.  We must also do everything in our power to make sure they are a resounding success.  We as politicians and the political parties have a special responsibility in this regard and we must avail of every opportunity to bring home to the electorate the importance of direct elections and the potential they will give to the European Parliament to help create a community which will not only be better but which will be more responsive to the people's interests and desires.  A good poll is, therefore, essential because it is, after all, ultimately the degree to which the electorate participate in the direct election which will determine the impact which the European Parliament can have on the future development of <Col N="555" /> the Community.  The greater this impact the better it will be for long-term interests of the Community.  One of the main defects of the Community up to now is a lack of real participation. This has meant that the institutions have had to operate in an atmosphere in which they are not subject to direct democratic control, and this effectively is what the direct elections would be all about.  It would be involving the people directly for the first time in Europe.  Direct elections will help to change that situation and ensure that Community policies reflect the real needs of the people.  To perform this function effectively, however, it would be necessary for the European Parliament to possess the strong mandate which can come only from a good poll.  It is, therefore, in all our interests to ensure that the direct elections are successful.  The Government are fully committed to this.</P>
      <P>I hope that Deputy R. Ryan in his absence will not feel that he was taken short.  I understand from the Minister that the Deputy may have made his full contribution, and we are not making any issue about his absence or otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move.</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £21,700,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1977, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, for certain services administered by that office, for payments to the Social Insurance Fund, and for sundry grants.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is required to meet increased expenditure arising from the increases in rates of payment in April and October and the other improvements in social welfare schemes during the current year.  The increases arise on two of the three sections of the Social Welfare Vote for the current year, namely social insurance and social assistance, while there is a small net saving on the section dealing with administration.  The original Estimate, as shown in the Estimates Volume, which was passed by the House in July last, was for the sum of £257,758,000.  The present Estimate is for an additional £21,700,000, which brings the total Exchequer spending on the services administered by my Department this year to £279,458,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the section for administration &mdash;subheads A to D&mdash;the net saving amounts to £108,200, which is the result of increases amounting to £138,000 on subheads A.1, B.1 and C offset by savings of £246,200 as shown at the foot of the Supplementary Estimate. The additional expenditure of social insurance&mdash;subheads E and F&mdash;amounts to £5,297,000, while the extra amount required for social assistance&mdash;subheads <Col N="557" /> G to L&mdash;is £16,334,000, making an overall increase on the three sections of £21,522,800.  There is, however, a reduction of £177,200 in the receipts from Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash;subhead M&mdash;which amount falls to be added to the total of the three sections, thus increasing the additional requirement on the Vote to £21,700,000.</P>
    <P>The sum of £5,297,000 required for social insurance is the additional amount payable by the Exchequer to the social insurance fund to meet the deficit on the working of the fund.  The gross cost of the general increase in the rates of benefit granted in April and October last, and of the other improvements in social insurance schemes during the past year, is £23,648,000.  The main constituents of this figure are £6,370,000 for disability benefit, £5,495,000 for old age contributory pensions, £4,400,000 for unemployment benefit, £4,098,000 for widows' and orphans' pensions and £2,120,000 for retirement pensions. There are, however, variations from the original estimates due to trends in claims during the year, such as an increase in the number of persons claiming disability benefit and a reduction in the numbers claiming unemployment benefit.  The net result of these variations is a reduction of £1,311,000 leaving the increase in expenditure from the fund at £22,337,000.</P>
    <P>On the income side there has been an increase of £15,000,000 in receipts from contributions payable by employers and employees while increased income from investments amounts to £54,000, making a total of £15,054,000, which reduces the deficit to £7,283,000.  After making allowance for the sum of £2,000,000 which was overdrawn from the Exchequer at 31st December, 1976, the additional amount payable by the Exchequer this year to the social insurance fund is £5,283,000. As regards the overdraw at 31st December, 1976, the position is that final draws must be made each year on an estimated basis because actual figures of expenditure and income are not available until after the close of the year.  The actual outturn on the fund for the financial year ended 31st December, 1976, indicated that the <Col N="558" /> sum of £2,000,000 had been overdrawn from the Exchequer at that date. Accordingly, the revised Exchequer contribution for the current year, as now estimated under subhead E, is being reduced by that amount.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the additional expenditure required in the Supplementary Estimate relates to social assistance and amounts to £16,334,000.  This additional expenditure has arisen mainly from the increases in assistance payments, including non-contributory pensions, granted in April and October, 1977, at a total cost of £18,631,000.  In addition, extra amounts have to be provided for miscellaneous grants £484,000 and unemployment assistance, £120,000. These amounts are, however, offset by savings of £1,890,000 on old age non-contributory pensions, £500,000 on children's allowances, £305,000 on widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions and £206,000 on social Assistance Allowances, totalling £2,901,000.</P>
    <P>The reduction of £177,200 in Appropriations-in-Aid, arises mainly from a reduction in the amount of the administration costs on the social insurance and occupational injuries schemes which have to be refunded from the social insurance and occupational injuries funds.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, this Supplementary Estimate, for an additional sum of £21.7 million, is required mainly to meet the cost of the increases in the rates of social insurance and social assistance payments and other improvements in 1977.  It was originally estimated that the increases in question would cost £30.6 million but due mainly to an improvement in the employment situation, particularly since June last, it has been possible to reduce the additional amount required by my Department by almost £9 million.  In fact the reduction in the numbers unemployed has meant that the cost of the increases in the rates of unemployment benefit, amounting to £4.4 million, has been met out of the original estimate of £45.73 million for this service.  In addition, income from contributions by employers and employees during the <Col N="559" /> year exceeded the estimate by almost £5.5 million.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I think that it is relevant to point out that the overall expenditure by my Department on social insurance and social assistance services is at present running at an annual rate of £560 million and that the contribution by the Exchequer this year is almost £280 million.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should avail of the moving of this Supplementary Estimate to reiterate that it is my intention, in accordance with Government policy, to continue to compensate social welfare claimants for increases in the cost of living.  In compliance with that policy the rates of all social insurance and social assistance payments were increased by 5 per cent from October last.  It has also been decided to reduce as from January next the employee's share of the social insurance contribution for persons earning less than £50 a week and to introduce a scheme for waiving telephone rental charges for pensioners living alone early next year. The question of further social welfare improvements is, of course, a matter for consideration in connection with the forthcoming budget.</P>
    <P>I think that I have now covered the principle matters affecting this Supplementary Estimate.  I shall be glad to furnish any further information which Deputies may require.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a real indication of the revolution that has taken place in the attitude of Government to social welfare and the enlightened expansion of the services that has taken place over the last few years that the Minister should be coming into the House at this stage of the financial year and be able to tell us that the expenditure of the Department of Social Welfare in the current year will amount to a sum of £560 million.  I and my party hope that policy of enlightened expansion of the social welfare services to those who are unable, for whatever reason, properly to provide for themselves will be continued by the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context I am somewhat taken aback at the final part of the <Col N="560" /> Minister's remarks&mdash;I hope his speech was not worded as intentionally as it might appear&mdash;where it is indicated that it would be the intention of the Minister, in accordance with Government policy, to continue to compensate social welfare claimants for an increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>All of us would agree that that, of course, is very necessary.  In the recent past the Minister himself has from time to time often pointed out areas of anomaly, areas needing improvement and ones where no real benefit still obtained.  But I would be taken aback to think that the policy of the Government in relation to social welfare would consist solely of deciding to compensate existing recipients for any loss they might suffer because of a rise in the cost of living.  It is a much bigger job than that, and I know the Minister agrees with me.  When he comes to reply I hope he will expand a little on Government policy, which is apparently to continue compensating social welfare claimants for increases in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>This is just one aspect of a very complex job.  It is an area in which there have been considerable improvements over the last number of years but it is an area needing constant attention and revision and, as I said, an enlightened expansion of the services. With that expansion there should be a proper index link so that we would no longer have the sort of hit and miss situation which prevails at the moment whereby recipients may get an increase commensurate with the rise in the cost of living&mdash;sometimes an increase that is a definite improvement in their position <i>vis-à-vis</i> others, while at other times they may discover they are falling behind.</P>
    <P>The Government should endeavour to bring about a situation when satisfied that benefits are at a satisfactory level in which all benefits would be index linked so that people would not have to wait for the budget in the following January.  Some effort in that direction was made this year.  In the early part of the year it was announced that there would be an increase in the autumn to compensate for a rise in the <Col N="561" /> cost of living.  It is a little ironic to have the Minister saying that, in compliance with the policy of his Government, social welfare payments were increased from October last.  That undertaking was given earlier in the year, long before the unfortunate events of last June.  It would have been only fair for the Minister to pay tribute to the person who introduced the concept of an additional increase halfway through the year to compensate for a fall in the real effect of these benefits.</P>
    <P>We should also look at the code with a view to ensuring there is equality of treatment for all.  We have all had experience of people who appear to be getting better benefits than others. There is need to examine the system. In the Fianna Fáil election manifesto there was a commitment that there would be a simplification of application forms as early as possible.  The sort of person making a claim for benefit is generally the sort of person unable to cope with complicated forms. It may be due to educational difficulties, emotional stress or family circumstances. Very often the so called explanatory memoranda are anything but explanatory.  Indeed, sometimes one would almost need a memorandum explaining the explanatory memorandum. Simplification would bring about an improvement in the system and cut down the mass of paper in the Department.</P>
    <P>Again, every effort should be made to inform as wide a spectrum of the public as possible of the myriad different schemes available.  Many people do not even know there are schemes in existence under which they would be entitled to benefit.  We have all had experience of constituents coming to us asking if they are entitled to benefit, people quite clearly entitled, in some cases entitled for years back, to such benefits.  A certain amount of education needs to be done.  In the last few year benefits have been more widely publicised but some of the old schemes are not as well known as they should be.  All schemes should be properly publicised.</P>
    <P>There are many anomalies.  There are all sorts of statutory instruments and ministerial orders and regulations as <Col N="562" /> well as legislation and it is difficult to identify all the anomalies.  Recently I had a case brought to my attention where a woman in receipt of a widow's non-contributory pension discovered. when she reached 65 years, that she would receive less by way of old age pension than she did by way of widow's non-contributory pension.  Apparently, there is some idea that a widow is more likely to have more expenses than an old age pensioner.  I am not quite sure how anyone can justify that. It is very difficult to understand the thinking&mdash;perhaps, I should say lack of thinking&mdash;behind that.  It is an anomaly.  Perhaps this is something that will receive attention when new schemes are introduced.  There are real discrepancies and they operate to discriminate against people and naturally these people feel very frustrated.</P>
    <P>Again, there is the traditional discrimination against women right through the code.  The Minister has given a commitment to end discrimination but in the light of his kicking-to-touch reply to a Parliamentary Question of mine yesterday, I am fearful that the commitment may take some time to implement.</P>
    <P>As well as endeavouring to remove such anomalies, there should be a real effort to remove all other forms of discrimination against women.  The simplest one is that between the employer's and employee's social welfare contributions in the case of men and women.  In the case of male industrial workers the percentage deducted from employer and employee amounts to 10.1 per cent, but in the case of female industrial workers the average is 19.5 per cent.  That is a glaring area of discrimination. It starts from there and runs right through the entire code. It must be tackled quickly and effectively.</P>
    <P>In relation to the reduction in the rates of contributions for persons earning less than £50 per week.  I accept that it will probably affect the percentage of weekly pay paid in contributions as between male and female workers because many female workers are earning less than £50 a week and therefore the difference in <Col N="563" /> the percentage contributions will not be as marked.</P>
    <P>When that measure was being introduced some weeks ago I suggested that the Minister might have considered abolishing social welfare contributions by both employers and employees in respect of people under 21 years of age and people entering employment for the first time.  I suggested that would have proved a real stimulus to employers to provide extra jobs and to young persons who at the moment are offered small weekly payments of which their social welfare contributions represent a big chunk.  Perhaps because he ran out of time, the Minister did not reply to that suggestion.  Now that we are discussing a Supplementary Estimate for Social Welfare, perhaps the Minister will give us the benefit of his thinking.  If my suggestion were implemented it would give a stimulus to employers to create more jobs and to young people to take these jobs.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of discussion on the Bill I also suggested that there is a real case to be made for introducing reduced rates of social welfare contributions by people who do not work a full week.  At the moment, an employer and an employee must pay the full rate if the employee works more than two days in a week.  That is not an incentive to an employer to give a few days' work in a week. We could cure the situation if we introduced a graded system of contribution in respect of numbers of hours worked per week.  I hope the Minister will reply to these points when he is closing the debate.  I am merely trying to be helpful to him, appreciating that budgetary strategy and policy are being discussed now, but if the Minister endeavours to introduce a better social welfare code the House will endeavour to help him to do so.</P>
    <P>Another matter about which all of us receive complaints is in relation to delays in the processing of claims for benefits.  In any endeavour to modernise our social welfare system attention should be paid to delays from the time claims are lodged until decision are made.  The position has been improved in recent years but what <Col N="564" /> has not been improved is the position where an applicant who has had a decision made against him lodges an appeal.  Sometimes appeals can drag on for as long as six months before determination.  It is not fair or equitable that a person in receipt of unemployment assistance or benefit and about whom some neighbour, perhaps maliciously and anonymously, complains will have his benefit stopped and no further payments made until the complaint has been investigated.  I appreciated that if it is found the person is still entitled to benefit he will get his back money, but that is scant consolation for a man who has been without money for a period up to six months.</P>
    <P>There was a brief reference in the House yesterday, and it has been discussed in public, to the unfortunate situation that obtains when a man in receipt of unemployment or disability benefit, say, at the rate for a married man with two children, decides not to make a fair contribution towards the support of his wife and family.  In such a case a very unsatisfactory situation can obtain.  Apparently, and I was not aware of this until a month ago, the wife, after great difficulty, may get separate payment, but the first step she must take is either to go to the local employment exchange or to write to the Department to ask that -a separate payment be made to her of the difference between a single man's benefit and the rate at which her husband is being paid.  The first thing the Department will do is to ask the husband whether he is agreeable that the separate payment should be made. It does not take too much imagination to think of a situation where a wife, who has been getting either too little or nothing, will be subjected to pressure, possibly even of a physical nature, by the aggrieved husband to ensure she does not follow up the claim.  It is ironical that even if the husband disagrees about the separate payment being made, the Department are at liberty to dispense with his objection and pay the wife anyway.  Another ridiculous situation is that when a wife claims for payment of the difference between a single man's benefit and the married rate, the husband gets paid <Col N="565" /> as a single man, she gets paid the wife's allowance and neither of them gets any payment in respect of the children.</P>
    <P>This area is in need of attention.  I admit to the House that I am not sure how best to deal with this problem.  It would involve tremendous administrative costs and difficulties to suggest that in every case two separate cheques should issue, one to the husband on a single rate and the remainder to the wife in respect of the additional payment. Where a man claims in respect of married rate or married rate plus children, perhaps the cheque should issue in the joint names of husband and wife.  As the House will recall, a change in legislation some years ago now requires that all private homes should be registered jointly in the names of husband and wife.  That was a good move, and I digress for a moment to congratulate the local authority of which I am a member. They were the first public body to implement such a policy in the sale of council houses to tenants.  We have insisted that all sales and tenancies should be in the joint names.  Perhaps a way out of this problem would be to consider paying the married rate with children's allowances in the names of husband and wife.  The present situation is definitely unsatisfactory and in need of change.</P>
    <P>Another area about which I have had complaints concerns the 12 designated countries.  Small farmers were assessed on a notional system based on the valuation of their land rather than assessed on the amount of their income. It has been suggested that during the past few weeks the officers investigating claims have been instructed by the Department to change from the notional basis of assessment to an assessment of the income of claimants. This is an area in which I am not involved but I believe the matter should be clarified for the House.</P>
    <P>There are also complaints relating to payment in respect of home help where an aged or infirm person is living alone and someone, usually a neighbour, comes in and endeavours to assist that person.  He or she may make a claim in respect of time put <Col N="566" /> in; but if the neighbour is good enough to stay overnight and to be in constant attendance on a sick person, he or she would no longer qualify for the home help allowance.  This appears to be an anomaly.</P>
    <P>We are talking merely about a Supplementary Estimate, and I appreciate that the major Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare will be debated within the next few months and a widespread discussion on the workings of the Department might be more appropriate then.  I wanted to outline several areas of anomaly simply as examples; there are many more such areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy corrected himself because this does not permit of a full-ranging debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Chair's point of view.  Part of the Supplementary Estimate refers to the sorts of benefit I have been talking about. One of the areas in which there has been a shortfall in the provision is in relation to the departmental grant equivalent to half the cost to certain local authorities of providing school meals.  We did not have as wide-ranging a debate on this subject at Question Time yesterday as we might have liked.  Perhaps today we could go a little further into this matter.  I was somewhat taken aback yesterday to hear the Minister say that he was unhappy with the operation of the school meals system, that for the cost involved benefit was not forthcoming and that the money might well be better spent in some other way.  I hope he was really saying that the money would be spent in providing better school meals and not that the system should be replaced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a case to be made for the expansion of the system, not just in urban and certain Gaeltacht areas but throughout the remainder of the country also.  This expansion is even more important now than it was a few years ago because of school transport facilities.  Small children nowadays are often transported many miles to educational centres and are away from home from very early in the morning <Col N="567" /> until late in the evening.  The State, in conjunction with local authorities, should become involved in providing adequate hot and nutritious meals half way through the day.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Bruton mention this morning that he was anxious to raise on the adjournment the failure of the Government to implement a policy of providing a diet of milk and milk products for school children.  Generous contributions are available from the EEC to member states to provide milk, cheese and dairy products generally for school children.  I further understand that the IFA are tremendously interested and concerned that the Government should implement such a policy.  Obviously we are all well aware of the nutritional value of milk and milk products. Since the Minister is unhappy with the existing system and since grants are available from the EEC, is this not an area which should be exercising the Minister's mind, together with the expansion of the school meals system throughout the whole country?  I was disappointed that the Minister was merely unhappy and had no intention of expanding the system and I would ask him to reconsider.</P>
    <P>Regarding the additional cost of grants to local authorities for the supply of fuel for necessitous families, there should be considered an expansion and a complete revision of that scheme.  It was introduced as a wartime measure, apparently only in certain designated urban authority areas, for the provision of turf to necessitous persons.  It did not apply in rural areas at all.  The system has staggered along over the years and no one has endeavoured to update or improve it.  In certain health board areas, the health boards, under a different heading, are giving vouchers or direct cash payments to certain people to provide adequate fuel for the winter.  The Department of Social Welfare should investigate the possibility of operating this fuel scheme on a national basis.</P>
    <P>A very unsatisfactory situation obtains in parts of Dublin.  Fuel is delivered to a central depot and old people very often experience great <Col N="568" /> difficulties in collecting that fuel and have to pay high costs to have it delivered.  Instead of that system they should be issued with a voucher which would be exchangeable for certain types of fuel or other heating costs. Yesterday, Deputy Dr. Browne made the case to the Minister that many people live in old people's homes which have not open fires and that, while they are eligible for the existing scheme, it was not of benefit to them. There is no point in giving half a hundredweight of turf to a man who has not got a fireplace.  It was suggested that these people should be given vouchers so that they could use an electric fire or some other form of heating.</P>
    <P>An additional grant of £203,000 is required for a scheme which does not operate as it should and which is limited to certain areas.  In some areas only the scheme is being supplemented by the health boards and from that point there is a need for standardisation.</P>
    <P>If the wife of a man who is eligible for free travel accompanies him, she should also be allowed to travel free. If his wife has not reached the qualifying age and her husband does not accompany her, she is not entitled to free travel.  This is a ridiculous situation and it should be investigated.  What sort of a situation would we have if the free travel permit holder does not accompany his wife?  If he is in hospital and his wife wants to visit him, he cannot accompany her.  I accept that free travel is given to all persons, irrespective of income, when they have reached the qualifying age.  From that point of view the wife of a free travel permit holder may not need free travel. In the case of people with low incomes, it is ridiculous that wives are not entitled to free travel unless they are accompanying their husbands.</P>
    <P>In relation to free electricity, the case can be made for giving that benefit to people who do not live alone. People who would be eligible for the scheme are sometimes living with others whose incomes are restricted. There is no point in refusing the electricity allowance to an old person who is living with another old person of <Col N="569" /> slender means.  The whole area needs attention.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said that the Government have decided to introduce a scheme early next year for waiving telephone rental charges for pensioners living alone.  I am sure he knows that there is great confusion in regard to this scheme.  My understanding of the scheme is that it is the intention of the Government to meet the telephone rental charges of elderly people living alone but not to meet the cost of calls or installation charges. This is a worth-while scheme and I am sorry we did not think of it.  It seems extraordinary to suggest that pensioners who live alone can have their telephone rental charges met but that husband and wife pensioners cannot have their telephone charges met.  It appears that pensioners who receive an extra £1 per week for living alone will benefit from the scheme.  The best estimate is that we have 30,000 pensioners living alone and that only 6,000 of them have telephones.  What about the others who live alone and who would dearly love to have that benefit, They may apply for a telephone but they will not be able to pay the installation charge, which is approximately £60 at present. What about husband and wife pensioners who live together.  They ought to have their telephone rental charges met.</P>
    <P>It might be interesting to finish by quoting from the information bulletin of the NSSC in which patterns of inequality are defined.  They may exercise the Minister's mind in relation to future social welfare policy reviews.  Five patterns of inequality are listed as follows:</P>
    <P>...differences in income; differences in status between people, usually referred to as class differences; urban, rural and regional inequalities; inter-urban inequalities, these would be inequalities between wards and neighbourhoods in large towns and cities; and finally, discrimination in work, pay and status against different categories of people.</P>
    <P>The Department are involved in all those areas.  Great strides were made in the last three or four years and it would be disappointing if similar <Col N="570" /> policies were not implemented.  The inference in the Minister's speech is that existing benefits will only be kept in line with increases in the cost of living.  It has been suggested that one of the reasons we lost the election is that we went too far to improve the lot of those who were not able to help themselves.  It has been suggested that we lost votes through our efforts to introduce fair play in respect of social welfare.  I do not accept that that is true; but, if it is, it is an honourable cause for losing an election.  The Minister need not fear a similar fate if he continues to adopt the enlightened approach of his predecessor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate gives us the opportunity to review some aspects of the social welfare policy pursued and enables us to evaluate the whole range of benefits, the allowances, pensions and the assistance which comprises the system of social welfare here.  It gives us an opportunity also to expose areas of injustice in society and in the whole social welfare code and to highlight the need for specific Government action and reform.  Unfortunately, too often we become bogged down in specifics. While specifics such as discrimination in social welfare benefits, the erosion of social welfare payments due in inflation and the lack of public information and advice are all key issues in their own right, we fail to link them together and address ourselves to the overall question of what exactly we are trying to achieve with our social welfare system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to cover specific areas where reforms are badly needed and I hope to do this within the context of an overall philosophy on what a social service system should be all about.  I take as the fundamental base of this philosophy my party's objective of securing for each person a basic standard of living in terms of income and services thereby eliminating once and for all the scourge of poverty from our society.  I accept that this is the goal to which every political party adheres, on paper at least, but to be specific when I speak of an overall philosophy guiding our efforts in social welfare I am thinking in terms of four <Col N="571" /> basic principles, planning for social development, the rights of social welfare recipients, State responsibility in financing and administering a social welfare system and the principle of equality of the law for all social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>When speaking about planning for social development I must state that there has been a lot of attention of late devoted to the whole question of economic planning with promises of new job production and the institution of a new Department.  The Government have seen fit, and justifiably so, to nail their political flag to the mast of economic planning which is vital for the country.  On it the hopes of those who put them in office must rest but in all the hullabaloo about economic planning and development there has been too little discussion about social planning and development.  We must ensure that economic planning and development does not take place in isolation.  It must occur in conjunction with the establishment of goals and targets for our social services and the allocation of finance to help them meet their goals.</P>
    <P>For too long the approach to social welfare has been to throw money when it is available piecemeal into existing services without questioning whether they are complementing one another or whether they are orientated towards any specific policy or objective.  For too long that has been the policy.  In the past the aim has been merely to keep the benefits as close as possible to the cost of living as far as it was politically practicable and convenient. This is a policy of papering over the cracks and that kind of philosophy is most unsatisfactory for our country. To throw a bit of money into poverty and deny that it exists in society and hope that everything will go away is a very short-sighted approach. This cosmetic approach has left us with an ineffective system of social welfare here and it certainly has been unable to close the poverty gap in Irish society.  Not only was there never a consistent effort over a long period of time to link the different services provided by our social welfare system <Col N="572" /> but there was also a lack of planning and co-ordination in linking the social welfare service with the health, education, housing and justice services. They are inextricably entwined with these services and this is what has been wrong.</P>
    <P>There is a battery of practical arguments for planning the social dimension with all the same energy, authority and ingenuity that is presently being devoted to the planning of the economic dimension.  The very size of our social welfare services makes planning over a long time absolutely mandatory in the interests of efficiency and effectiveness.  Expenditure must be tied to immediate and future goals and it should be monitored to ensure that theory and practice are in absolute harmony.  There is also the fact that financial resources are scarce when compared with the needs that exist.  Because of that planning is essential in that it establishes priorities so that the available resources are given to the greatest needs.</P>
    <P>There is also the fact that nearly all Government activity and expenditure has a redistributing effect&mdash;that is the whole purpose of it&mdash;but planning is necessary to direct redistribution towards defined social welfare goals and objectives.  I do not think equality in society is the logical consequence of the capitalist system.  If we want greater equality and less social injustice, we have to plan for it; it does not automatically come.  We have to make it a target and consciously give it the priority in our scheme of social values.  I do not think we should talk about social planning in the abstract alone.  We should put some flesh on this theoretical thing.  There should be two dimensions to the whole question of expansion of social welfare.  There should be regular increases to keep pace with inflation and there should be regular increases geared to expanding existing services to meet specific long-range targets.  Doing one without the other means that we are back where we started, merely keeping pace with inflation.</P>
    <P>In the past most social welfare benefits introduced in the various budgets dealt mainly with money increases <Col N="573" /> to keep pace with inflation.  I am sure the Minister, and Members, will agree that we were lucky to achieve that on many occasions.  I am sure the Minister will agree also that in the last four years, for various reasons&mdash;I am not considering one party as against another or one government as against another&mdash;increases went some way beyond inflation and extra expenditure was aimed at to expand the services which might be considered good but because the social welfare services were so bad and poor the increases were seen as a tremendous breakthrough.  In fact, it was not.  A lot of this was identified and associated with our entry into the EEC and was demanded of us.</P>
    <P>As part of an overall social plan there are two things necessary in relation to social welfare expenditure, statutory linkage of all social welfare benefits to the cost of living and agreement on a percentage of growth of the GNP which would be allocated automatically to the reorganisation and expansion of social welfare benefits.  Both of those should be key components of a five-year plan for social development.  It would ensure that the existing level would automatically rise with inflation and that, as a matter of policy at which we should aim in economic planning, there would be an expansion in social welfare.  A start was made in the last four years to raise it to civilised standards and we all know that that took place in a period of acute inflation and recession but benefits were raised by 24 per cent.  That was a significant achievement but I am cynical about the factors that created it.  After much thought I believe a great deal of that was dictated by our membership of the EEC.</P>
    <P>Pilot schemes specifically dealing with the problem of poverty were established, and a research and development section was set up within the Department of Social Welfare to formulate long-range policies.  A few of those were initiatives from the Labour Party.  Those initiatives are indicative of our commitment to the two dimensions in social welfare, increasing benefits in line with inflation <Col N="574" /> and expanding and extending them. Much more remains to be done.  Social planning should not be constrained by conventional ideas and existing services. It must reach out for new, fresh thinking on the part of the Minister on the whole subject and there must be an examination of the viability of a completely different approach to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not digress very much from the headings and sub-headings of the Supplementary Estimate, but it is important for me to direct the Minister's attention to certain aspects of the Department of Social Welfare.  If we direct his thinking along these lines, his will be a very persuasive voice in the Cabinet for more money for the extension of his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ask ourselves whether the myriads of unrelated benefits and allowances which comprise our social welfare system could ever stamp out poverty regardless of the level of finance we provide for them.  I do not think social injustice can be stamped out or eradicated in the context of a bits-and-pieces approach.  I am asking for some new thinking on that.  A proper research section in the Department of Social Welfare has been left in abeyance for too long.  As a result, there is no cohesive policy in that Department.  There is no evidence, as a result of the policies of the Department over the years, of a proper redistribution <Col N="575" /> of moneys to ensure social equality and the elimination of social injustice.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will agree that the whole purpose and planning of the social welfare system should be the elimination of poverty. I do not think we have gone very far along the road towards the elimination of poverty in our society.  We must talk about a guaranteed minimum income.  We should get away from the poor law mentality which exists in our social welfare services at the moment. Rather than piecemeal handouts, we should move towards something like a guaranteed minimum income related to the cost of living.  This should be done for every household in the nation as of right.  This is important.</P>
    <P>The administrative corollary to that is negative income tax.  The Minister should consider the whole question of negative income tax, where the individual becomes either a net beneficiary of or a net contributor to the Exchequer.  It is wrong for the State to hand out money with one hand, and to take it back in direct taxation with the other.  The administrative burden of that is enormous. We should be talking seriously about deciding that those in need will get the money and it will not be taken back from them, and those who are not in need will pay.  If we could rationalise this it would be to the advantage of the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, as part of our social welfare plan.  I know the Minister is thinking along the same lines, and sees advantage in it.  A guaranteed minimum income is essential if we are to take any positive steps towards eliminating poverty in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would listen to one suggestion of mine.  I know that setting up committees can become a habit if we are not careful.  The Minister might consider an all-party Dáil committee on the social services to seek areas in which we could link together services which are so disjointed at the moment.  We are doing <Col N="576" /> this in an effort to rationalise our health services, and we might consider it in relation to the whole question of social objectives, social problems and social policies.  It might be an ideal mechanism for hammering out a five year plan for the social services.  We might consider how such a committee could be given assistance from the research section of the Department.</P>
    <P>I should like to discuss now the rights of social welfare recipients.  This arises under unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, information, appeals on unemployment benefit and supplementary allowance schemes. Therefore, it is important that I should discuss this principle.  Under our social welfare system in Ireland, benefits are supposed to be given as of right.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has had long experience in his constituency and I am sure he will agree that the system has been stigmatised as a system of charitable handouts from a benevolent State.  Unfortunately our people have been brought up in this tradition.</P>
    <P>I say this without fear of contradiction. I have known people to practically starve rather than apply for social welfare benefits because they thought they were charitable handouts. Unfortunately, we have nurtured this type of thinking in our society.  That is what is wrong with our whole social welfare system at the moment.  Our treatment of social welfare applicants is demeaning and unjust.  It is my firm belief that social injustice will never be eradicated so long as that type of thinking is conceptualised as it is at the moment.</P>
    <P>We should be talking about the rights of social welfare applicants, their right to the services, their right to appeal, their right to information, their right to complain about the system and their right to the maintenance of their dignity as human beings.  We as TDs have a major role to perform in reforming the whole public conception of what the social welfare system is all about.  If I may say so without being too derogatory about Members of the House, over the years, unfortunately, TDs have perpetuated the notion that their efforts <Col N="577" /> were indispenable towards securing what was basically a right to social welfare benefit.  We have done this.  We have done nothing to remove the poor law stigma from social welfare recipients. Our whole political system runs on the fact that people believe social welfare entitlements are political entitlements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A discussion on the whole system of social welfare benefits would not be in order on this very limited Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I want to refer now to something I saw recently in a Sunday newspaper.  Within the context of changes in the social welfare system, an ombudsman is important. It is important that people should have redress against what they think is an injustice.  If we do not provide an ombudsman, We should have a public campaign giving information on all the social welfare benefits.  I am not talking about a passive approach and a willingness to provide information if you are badgered and hounded persistently.  I am talking about an active, dynamic approach by the Depeartment. The media should be utilised in full to inform the people of their rights and entitlements under the social welfare code.  This is vital.</P>
      <P>Only a massive publicity campaign carried out over a long period of time will suffice.  Thousands of people to-day are not claiming social welfare benefits because they do not know they are entitled to them.  We must act on that without delay.  A few weeks ago the Minister promised a journalist on a Sunday newspaper that he would personally investigate the individual cases of deprivation she was highlighting each week.  I know the Minister is genuinely concerned.  With due respect to him, he would not have had to do this if information about people's rights to social welfare were readily available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, his action might be misread as perpetuating the belief that social welfare entitlements are really political entitlements, benefits to be gained only by intercession of those <Col N="578" /> high up in the political system.  I am not attempting to score a political point.  Indeed, I must confess that, if I were in the Minister's place, my instinct would have been to do exactly the same thing.  I would have taken quick action and cut through the red tape.  I am not blaming the Minister personally for what he did, but the thinking behind it would be wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

      <P>I must remind the Deputy that we are not having a debate on the whole social welfare system now.  We are dealing with a Supplementary Estimate for £21 million out of £280 million and all the points the Deputy is making would be very appropriate to the debate on the main Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>But they come up under unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, information, the right of appeal&mdash;it is all embodied in this Estimate which I examined very closely.  What I say is in order because of the headings and sub-headings under which this Supplementary Estimate is introduced.  All I am seeking is to insist on people's right to information about their claims.  Many a social welfare applicant has met with a sort of aggressive, suspicious and belligerent attitude, unfortunately, from social welfare staff.  The attitude still prevails that the person seeking social welfare benefits is hoodwinking the Department.  It is important to realise that there is this negative and unhelpful attitude at the first point of contact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday, I made a phone call to the Department of Social Welfare about unemployment assistance because even as a legislator I am all at sea as to the general breakdown of what constitutes the means test for unemployment assistance.  It was a case of a single person in his late teens applying for unemployment assistance He is told that because his means exceed a certain figure he is not entitled to it but no explanation is given as to how the means is calculated.  I phoned the information section of the Department and they told me they did not know, that I should get in touch with somebody else.  That is an information <Col N="579" /> section concerned with unemployment assistance for which we are voting money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is no point in talking about voting £21 million under the headings set out here unless we discuss how we can improve the services.  I am not asking the Minister to spend one penny on this aspect of the matter but to ensure that the information is available and that perhaps we would have seminars for those officials of the Department of Social Welfare who are in the first line of contact with the public.  We would not expect them to know everything but if we set up an information section we should have the officers there really knowledgeable on the various aspects of the social services.  Seminars at regular intervals are essential in this regard.  People are directed from one place to another, from Phibsborough Tower to Store Street, to Pearse Street to D'Olier Street.  This is frustrating.  These people deserve to be treated properly; they are people in need and we should go out of our way to help them.</P>

    <P>The social welfare supplementary allowances were brought in last year and constituted a long overdue legislative reform.  Under it every person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his needs and those of his dependants is entitled to a supplementary welfare allowance.  This allowance is provided as a right and it is a supplementation of the standard allowance and other social welfare payments where these are insufficient to meet special needs.  The Act also confers a right of appeal against a refusal of the allowance.  This scheme was introduced to replace the old home assistance poor law scheme established, I think, under the 1939 Public Assistance Act.  Home Assistance was given to a person unable by his own industry and lawful means to provide <Col N="580" /> the necessities of life for himself and his dependants.  He had no right to it.  It depended on the arbitrary decision of a home assistance officer and there was no right to appeal.  It was administered by public assistance authorities or health boards acting on their behalf.</P>
    <P>The scheme contained major inequalities in relation to the standard of eligibility and the amount of assistance as between one health board and another.  It was a demeaning and very embarrassing experience for anybody who had to claim it.  The social welfare supplementary allowance in theory made enormous progress in this regard.  It is a milestone in social welfare legislation because it talks about the rights of the applicant to assistance and it provides appeals machinery for the first time. Unfortunately, in practice there is a big gap between what we as legislators intended and what actually happens. There is more to social reform than passing legislation through the Dáil: there must be the political will and moral conviction there to ensure the spirit as well as the letter of the law.</P>
    <P>It is a mind boggling exercise to try to see how the supplementary allowance scheme operates.  The old application forms are still being used in some cases.  Social workers and all involved in the scheme say that it creates enormous problems.  First, it has not been sufficiently publicised and too few people are aware of their rights under it.  I estimate that over 30,000 people are potentially eligible for supplementary social allowance.  If we do not publicise the scheme and explain it in full detail we are reneging on the whole spirit of the legislation. Applicants are not given a full explanation regarding the means test or the grounds on which they are given reduced benefits.  If the spirit of the Act were being observed, applicants receiving reduced benefit would get written notices setting out the details of their means and so on in full.  This is not being done, so that there is in effect a return to the old system and the attitude of the old home assistance days: &ldquo;They will take what they get.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> The supplementary allowance scheme was intended to redress the anomalies in payments in different health board areas.  That is not happening due to lack of training of community welfare officers.  There is confusion about the handling of claim forms by the health boards and people experience unexpected delays in payments.  Even more important, the right of a claimant to appeal is being subverted by bureaucratic confusion, departmental intrigue and the resurrection of the spirit of the old home assistance scheme.  It seems that the poor law mentality refuses to die.  I know that recently community care programme managers have been appointed to handle appeals for the time being but there are still reports that claimants are not being told of their rights.  I know this is a fact. No standard form is issued by the health boards.  Only two health boards to my knowledge supply applicants with written notice indicating why they did not get the allowance.  I also think there is some move afoot within the Department of Social Welfare to dilute the right of claimants to appeal by instituting an informal appeals procedure when the community care programme managers end their appointed terms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We as legislators never intended it to work as it does. Every Minister had the best intentions but there is a big gap between what we pass in the House and its implementation.  The Minister should take immediate measures to ensure that the supplementary welfare allowance is implemented as originally envisaged in this House and that nothing is done to subvert the rights of social welfare recipients as set down in the Act.  I am aware that there are abuses of the social welfare services and that there will always be abuses.  An extreme right-wing Minister for the Department of Health and Social Welfare Services in England, Sir Keith Joseph when at a conservative party conference in Blackpool there was a cry for a tightening up of the services, said that the Department could not be closed down just because of a few abuses. There is a lot of logic there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though we would be poles apart politically, I concede that there is logic in his thinking there.  I know that the Department has stepped up its efforts to combat fraud in relation to penalties and convictions and I know there has been an increase in the numbers of cases brought to justice.  By defrauding the Department these people are depriving others and are not behaving as honourable citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Too much has been said about people on the dole living in the lap of luxury and it took a report by Mr. Jim Murray of the National Social Services Council to dispel the myth.  He said that over 14,000 people on the live register were receiving no payments and that 126,000 people were living off unemployment assistance of £25 a week for a family of four including 62,000 dependent children.  These stark facts will give some idea of the level of poverty.  We are in Cloud-CuckooLand if we think that people on social welfare benefits are living in the lap of <Col N="583" /> luxury.  They are living in abject poverty.  More must be done at government level to counteract the flow of misinformation about social welfare recipients.  If the social welfare system is to operate as a genuine redistributive mechanism of wealth in society it is incumbent on any Government to ensure that it is equitably financed. The reduced contribution of the Exchequer to the social insurance fund is a matter of considerable concern. The Minister for Finance in the last Government said that it was the intention of the Government to reduce its contribution to the social welfare fund and that they aimed to follow the example of the other EEC countries in asking employers and employees to contribute more.  The shifting of this burden onto employers will act as a disincentive to the employer to increase his work force.  To shift the burden to the employee in the present form of flat rate contributions is a regressive step.  This decision will mean that instead of taking an active role in extending the funds of the Department into the proper centres the Government will assume less and less of a role in eliminating poverty in our society.  Enough consideration has not been given to the ramifications of this fall in the level of Government contribution to the insurance fund.  A review of this is necessary at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently referred to the provision of a national income related pension scheme.  A discussion document on this was published and I thought that it was intended to introduce a programme of legislation for a national pension scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be borne in mind that there are 840,000 people employed in the public and private sectors and that roughly 45 per cent of them are not covered by an adequate pension scheme.  They are only covered for the social welfare <Col N="584" /> flat rate of pension.  We are leaving these workers and their families to face financial hardship on retirement. The Minister will admit that the present system is bedevilled by many anomalies.  There is no social welfare pension scheme for the self-employed and there are other areas where anomalies exist.  The Minister will know of cases in the Government services where people were paying stamps, their salaries were increased, they went out of benefit and did not have to pay stamps. Many of these people are now without retirement pensions.  This is a very serious injustice.  No attempt has been made to help them in their retirement even though they had contributed in social welfare stamps.</P>
      <P>The Minister should give urgent consideration to the aspect of the pension scheme.  The whole future of 400,000 workers is at stake and action is needed.  The present scrappy system is not adequate to meet the needs.  I hope that the Minister will also consider social insurance for the self-employed. I noticed that the Minister has not been dragging his feet.  I saw in <i>The Irish Press</i> on 30th November that a draft discussion document on the provision of social insurance for the self-employed was put before the Government by the Minister, and that it is to be published as a preliminary to the introduction of legislation to enable the self-employed to provide cover for themselves and their families in the case of illness or loss of life.  I congratulate the Minister on this.  We all know that this has been left in abeyance for too long and people have suffered hardship.  This is certainly a very good move and I pay tribute to the Minister for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was an outlay of nearly £50 million a year on children's allowances. There are 423,000 families in receipt of children's allowances.  It is now time to talk seriously about introducing a means test for children's allowances. The main purpose of children's allowances is to make some attempt to provide extra benefit for children.  We should seriously consider introducing a means test in respect of this and those who do not need it would not seek it <Col N="585" /> and more money would be left for those who need it.</P>

      <P>I want to say something now about the discrimination against women in regard to social welfare entitlement. There is discrimination against girl school-leavers in regard to unemployment assistance.  There is discrimination against married women in relation to disability benefit and unemployment benefit in respect of the levels of benefit.  We all know that when a married woman who has a child applies for unemployment benefit she is automatically disqualified because it is stated that she is not available for work.  I have examined the 1952 Social Welfare Act and I find that the deciding officer's decision is too final and conclusive and there is no appeal against it.</P>

I can ask if the Minister is aware that married applicants for unemployment benefit who have a child are disqualified and ask what can be done. I am told that nothing can be done, that the deciding officer's decision is final and conclusive and there is no appeal.  I want to know, as a legislator in this House, what I can do to redress this terrible injustice against married women with children.  Those people have made arrangements for the care of their children while they are working.</P>
      <P>We live in a modern society where the right of women to work is accepted.  We are saying that women with children are entitled to go out to work.

When those people seek unemployment benefit when they are not working we are denying them the right to that benefit.  A deciding officer decides this and his decision is final and conclusive.

      <P>Can I ask that sympathetic consideration be given to the injustice to widows?  I know that some effort was made by telling them that they need not pay for the stamp any more.  This went some way towards redressing that injustice but did not go all the way.  There is also discrimination in relation to the split benefit.  The Minister has given a promise that he will have action taken in relation to this.</P>
      <P>There is the question of split benefit where husband and wife are separated and he is in receipt of social welfare allowance for himself and the children, even though the children are not staying with him, and the Minister is acting on that.  The barrier to the wife getting the benefit due to her in respect of that is another area of discrimination against women.  On the unmarried mother's allowance, we do not have to bring in legislation to call it the single parent family allowance.  Surely that can be done without bringing in legislation.</P>

      <P>All these anomalies are out of place in any modern system <Col N="589" /> of social benefits.  There must be equality in social welfare.  The Minister should assure us that action is going to be taken in each of the areas I have outlined.  He did promise that he would move on the split payments and that he would take action in respect of the unmarried mother's allowance. Whether we like it or not, in our society there is a stigma on that unmarried mother's allowance.</P>
      <P>The question of free fuel has been mentioned, and whilst this is not administered by the Department, it is paid for by the Department, and it is giving rise to a number of problems and a great deal of abuse of the system. Those in need are not obtaining the necessary vouchers which are being sold around the place to people who are exploiting the scheme.  I ask the Minister if his Department could have an inquiry into this with a view to introducing a more equitable system which would benefit those most in need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, at 24 per cent, the highest poverty rate in the western world, or at least in the EEC.  Of the OECD countries we devote the smallest proportion of GNP to supplementary benefits.  The Minister should review the question of the information services. He should see to it that there is proper publicity and enlightened information from the Department and that the officers coming in first contact with those applicants are fully informed on the various complex matters of this Department.  Those officers should treat the people as human beings and should not adopt a belligerent, aggressive or suspicious attitude towards them, regarding them rather as people with a need which prompted them to seek the benefit in the first place.  I believe there are men in that Department who want change.  I have heard that a lot of the changes in this Department have come from the officials in the Department who had initiative. This is a wonderful thing to hear.  I do not wish to knock this Department all the time.  This would be demoralising to the officials of the Department who work in very difficult conditions.  In many cases they deal with people who are ignorant of their rights and of the <Col N="590" /> fact that the system may not work their way.  Some of these people are frustrated and have frayed nerves. That is why the officials should be really calm, patient and tolerant and at the same time be able to say with authority, &ldquo;We cannot help you this way but we can help you that way&rdquo;. I have been amazed to see in British newspapers the very big advertisement saying, &ldquo;Do you know you may be entitled to....&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right, they were contributory pensions.  When I said that to him I was not being facetious.  He might be entitled to disability benefit, in which case I hope the information section of his Department would give him the necessary information.  It is not too much to ask him to examine that aspect of it.</P>
      <P>Another matter which I do not think would call for a change in legislation is where women are in receipt of the widow's pension and they transfer to the old age pension.  Would they have a right to continue receiving the widow's pension instead because there are various entitlements under it?  It comes under this because we are providing £4 million for widows' and orphans' pensions, and I might discuss it under that and ask questions about it, despite what officials of the House might think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice for the first time that there is serious constraint on Deputies talking and the rules of the House are perhaps being applied too rigidly at <Col N="592" /> present.  It was not intended when we laid down Standing Orders that we should be rigidly prevented from voicing our views on major injustices.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer to a matter in the Minister's speech, since I am so constrained.  He has decided to reduce as from January next the employee's share of the insurance contribution for persons earning less than £50 per week.  This decision is a good one, but I am wondering where the Minister, in making it, arrived at the figure of £50 per week.  With inflation at such a high level at the moment, is £50 a realistic figure? What proportion of our total work force earns less than £50 a week?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope that the £50 ceiling would not remain for long.</P>
      <P>The Minister's decision to introduce a scheme waiving telephone rental charges for pensioners living alone is an admirable one, is to be welcomed, and we should give credit where it is due when a Minister takes action like this.  It is important to those living alone of whom I know there are so many.  I can well understand that the Department could not pay for every telephone call.  I realise that that could lead to tremendous abuse of the scheme.  The whole concept behind it is a good one and will constitute a tremendous boon to those who are compelled to live alone, whether it be in city or rural areas.</P>
      <P>The other decision on which I should like to comment is that to compensate social welfare claimants in respect of the rise in the cost of living.  I am now forced to speak only on the matters raised in the Minister's introductory speech, which makes it very difficult for me.  That is not sufficient because, again we are perpetuating the whole poverty situation, keeping people down, by merely paying them increases in line with the rise in the cost of living.  Certainly it is not an imaginative approach on the part of the Department of Social Welfare.  I hope the Minister might break out of that straitjacket and have more imaginative thinking in this respect.  The whole aim should be to bring people above the level of poverty and the figures I quoted a while ago are ample evidence that there is considerable poverty in this country.  Merely linking them to the cost of living is not doing anything to relieve that poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister could at any convenient time give us some details of the Committee on Poverty set up within his Department.  It would be advantageous to hear about the progress being made on the projects they have undertaken and if they are succeeding in them.  I know they have had teething problems.  It is very relevant to the whole area of social welfare benefits and policy to know how that committee is progressing in its work.  Certainly it would not appear <Col N="594" /> to have done anything like that for which it was set up.  The Minister should seriously consider reviewing their work to ascertain whether or not they are justifying the purpose for which they were established; neither would he be remiss in seeking that information.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister has any plans in mind for the information offices of the Department of Social Welfare.  This does not call for legislation; it comes under this heading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Again, Deputy, it is a policy matter. Policy, administration and all such matters are for the general Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Even the operation of these social welfare centres that we shall call employment exchanges?  Has the Minister considered their rationalisation, their role, that perhaps they might be taken over by some other Department?  Might I ask the Minister even that?  He might consider giving us some such information because I know he has paid a visit to all these centres in Dublin.  I wondered if he has any changes in mind, or rationalisation plans. Perhaps he would answer me in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because I am so constrained I shall conclude by saying that the Minister's task as Minister for Social Welfare in the next year is enormous.  He will be looking for very large sums in his general Estimate after the budget.  I wish him well in his efforts to do so. It will not be money badly spent if he directs his energies towards ensuring that the money he aims at getting is directed into the right channels.  I wish him luck as well as success in obtaining the necessary moneys to expand the services.  I know he is a persuasive person and will do his very best in this direction.  His dual role as Minister for Health and Social Welfare, which he is taking so seriously, is an indication that social welfare of itself cannot be considered in isolation.  I would have thought that perhaps it might might even be considered in conjunction with another Government Department, that there would be an <Col N="595" /> effort made to link them together, because to consider one Department in isolation is wrong.  There is so much overlapping of Departments and their functions.  Health is only one aspect of it.  I would have thought that perhaps even education came within that sphere &mdash;health, education and welfare under one Department, as they have in the United States where they found that the functions overlapped so much.  The Minister must always remember that he is the Minister for Health and Social Welfare.  I wonder if it is his intention to merge these two Departments as in Britain.  He has given us no indication as to whether he intends so doing and I should like to hear his comments in this respect.</P>
    <P>There is a need to consider rationalising the policy of both Departments, merging them, when we could ensure that the services appropriate to the Department of Health, perhaps by linking them with those of the Department of Social Welfare, would be better utilised.</P>
    <P>I suggested earlier this morning on this debate that perhaps the health boards might operate some of the services of the Department of Social Welfare. I was told this could not be done because it is proper to the Department of Health, despite the fact that it is the one Minister who deals with both.  It is a rather incongruous situation that we do not know whether a particular function of the Department of Social Welfare, delegated to a health board, can be discussed here. It limits our role as legislators when we are told it is proper to one Department or another, but not to both.  It makes it very difficult for us to consider the whole question of the role of the Department of Social Welfare. It is regressive, and is detrimental to the functions of the Department.  We should be able to streamline our services, such as the supplementary welfare allowances, so that they might be operated by the Department of Social Welfare and not delegated to the health boards, because that only perpetuates the role of the poor law assistance and the charity associated with it.</P>

Parts (b) and (c) of the question do not admit of realistic estimation.

      <P>I want to emphasise again a point I emphasised here before.  Real projections are very difficult until we know the resources we have to fish, and what we have to fish in the way of resources is dependent on the outcome of the current negotiations with our partners in the EEC in seeking to evolve a common fisheries policy.  These talks will be resumed next Monday, will continue into Tuesday, and possibly longer, and so it is not proper to talk about real planning until we know the extent of the resources we have.</P>

      <P>The matters of main interest to Ireland discussed at last month's Fisheries Council were proposals put forward by the EEC Commission for technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources, quotas for 1978, arrangements for the supervision and control of fishing activities, aid measures for reorganisation of the fishing industry <Col N="601" /> and compensation for losses incurred by fishermen due to the closure of herring fisheries.</P>
      <P>Decisions were not reached on any of these items and discussions on them are to be resumed at a further council meeting starting next Monday, December 5th.  Meanwhile, the proposals are being examined in detail by council working groups.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister or the Department are aware of the seriousness of this.  It is not good enough to say we are about to do it. Would the Minister consider a review of the situation, taking into account that until a few weeks ago every pond along the coast was full of spawning lobster?  The spawning lobster is the biggest lobster on the seabed, and if this type of fishing continues a very valuable part of our fishing industry will be destroyed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take immediate unilateral action in this regard. One of the important things to remember is that in regard to salmon and shell fish we can do it ourselves because at the last Council meeting we got localised fishing, as it is called, excluded from Community conservation requirements.  I propose to take action along the lines suggested by the Deputy in regard to lobster fishing before the start of next season, before April.  I propose to introduce a number of restrictive measures such as the possibility of introducing a close season, the licensing of lobster fishing, the limiting of lobster pots per boat and the stricter enforcement of the existing statutory size of lobster that may be taken.</P>

There is a technical legal point here in that they have rights under the 1964 convention, but not being members of the Community they are excluded from the 200-mile zone from 1st January this year.  We take the view in conjunction with our EEC partners, that everybody outside the Community is excluded from the 200-mile zone.  Despite the fact that they have technical rights within a six to 12 mile zone, <Col N="610" /> we have successfully prosecuted them in respect of areas within that band.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries the maximum fine for foreign vessels convicted of fishing within this country's exclusive fishing limits; and how it compares with the maximum penalties for similar offences in Britain and in the Isle of Man.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, prescribes a maximum fine of £100 on summary conviction of a foreign sea-fishing boat for illegal entry within the exclusive fishery limits of the State.  Confiscation of the fish and fishing gear is mandatory where such a boat, having entered within the exclusive fishery limits whether lawfully or unlawfully, fishes or attempts to fish there.</P>
      <P>I understand that under the United Kingdom Fishery Limits Act, 1976, the maximum fine for unauthorised fishing by a foreign fishing boat is £50,000 on summary conviction with provision for an unlimited fine on conviction on indictment.  As well the court may order forfeiture of the fish and fishing gear.</P>
      <P>As to the Isle of Man, I understand that foreign fishing boats convicted of illegal fishing within that country's three mile limit are liable on summary conviction to a maximum fine of £500 and the court may order the forfeiture of any fish and fishing gear found on the vessel.  Where the illegal fishing occurs within three to 12 miles the prosecution is taken by the Isle of Man Government on behalf of the United Kingdom Government under the Fishery Limits Act, 1976, and the penalties prescribed by that Act apply. The prosecution of foreign fishing boats for illegal fishing outside 12 milts is taken by the United Kingdom authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Acts no mechanically propelled vessel may proceed to sea or on any voyage or excursion with more than twelve passengers on board, unless there is in force in respect of the vessel a valid passenger certificate issued by me in accordance with those Acts.</P>
      <P>This certificate must be displayed on the boat for all to see.  It sets out the maximum number of passengers permitted to be carried, the limits beyond which the vessel is not to ply, the life-saving and fire-fighting equipment which must be kept on board, the name of the vessel and its owner, the period of validity of the certificate and any special conditions applying to the operation of the vessel.  A passenger certificate is valid for a maximum of one year.</P>
      <P>Such passenger certificates are issued only after survey of the vessel by a marine surveyor of my Department and will not be issued unless the surveyor is satisfied as to the competency of those navigating the vessel. It is a condition of the certificate that my Department be notified if the man in charge of the boat is changed. The competency of the boatman is established by the surveyors by means of appropriate tests.  Passenger vessels proceeding to ports outside the State, or foreign passenger vessels going between places in the State, are required to carry officers certificated under the Merchant Shipping Acts. The relevant educational courses are provided by the Cork Regional Technical College and the certificates are awarded on the results of examinations held by my Department.</P>
      <P>These requirements apply to vessels engaged in carrying passengers, whether or not the passengers are carried for hire or reward.  Breaches of the requirements render the owner or master of the vessel liable to penalties under the Merchant Shipping Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enforcement of the law relating to passenger certificates is a matter for the Gardaí, who are notified of the issue of every certificate and of the plying limits, number of passengers <Col N="614" /> and the expiry date of the certificate. Apart from this, Garda authorities responsible for coastal areas are aware of the statutory provisions and of the necessity to keep the operations of passenger-carrying boats under observation. It is, of course, open to any member of the public to report to the Gardaí or to my Department, any suspected breach of the Acts in relation to passenger certificates.</P>
    <P>Boats plying for hire which do not come within the scope of the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Acts relating to passenger certificates may be made the subject of bye-laws or licensing by the appropriate local authority under the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, or the Public Health (Amendment) Act, 1907.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take questions Nos. 14, 15, 16 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>There are 1,198 merchandise licences extant at the moment including 841 general haulage licences issued in 1933 and 1945, and 357 issued subsequently, the latter being restricted to specialised haulage of one kind or another; some licensees hold more than one licence and the total number of licensees is 1,086.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that under the provisions of the 1944 Act I would be justified in granting licences for general haulage at the present time, but licences for specialised haulage are granted in cases where I am satisfied, as required by the Act, that they meet an inadequacy of transport.  Such licences are granted fairly frequently.</P>
      <P>The requirement to have a certificate of competence arises under a 1974 EEC directive and is designed to improve standards in road freight haulage.  It will apply only to hauliers who commenced business on or after the 1st January, 1975.</P>
      <P>As regards the other matters raised and in particular the question of the introduction of a Road Transport Bill, it is my intention to introduce such a Bill in the near future.  I am not in a position to give an indication of the content of the Bill at this stage.</P>

      <P>I am concerned to ensure that every effort is made to maintain and increase the volume of terminal and transit traffic at Shannon Airport.  Aer Rianta, who manage the airport on my behalf, Aer Lingus, Aerlínte and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company are continuing their work of promoting traffic to and through the airport with the utmost vigour.  In addition Bord Fáilte are intensifying their efforts to attract increased tourism to Ireland much of which would be through Shannon.</P>
      <P>The scheduled services to the airport will be increased next year but details of the expanded services have not yet been finalised.  A further increase in charter services is also expected.  In order to reap maximum benefit from these developments.  Bord Fáilte and Aerlínte have, with my encouragement, agreed on a concerted approach to the promotion of traffic.  I have also approved the introduction of special fares, that is, the Super-Apex fares, to boost off-season transatlantic traffic and I have encouraged Aerlínte to develop similar incentive fares for the 1978 season.</P>

With respect, it is not a local issue.  With your permission, Sir, I want to ask the Minister whether the Post Office Users' Council reckon in the figures they give the Minister only the complaints directly sent to them or whether they take account also, according as they run across them, of complaints which turn up in letters to the editor, in leading articles in newspapers, and so forth, and report on them to the Minister.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks on this Supplementary Estimate will be brief. It is a pity the Minister's officials are not here to take note of this and they might make a correction.  The Minister says he has made savings to the amount of £1,890,000 on old age non-contributory pensions, £500,000 on childrens' allowances, £305,000 on widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions and £206,000 on social assistance allowances, totalling £2,901,000. Is the Minister aware how these savings have been made?  There are social welfare officers at present in Kerry and, to say the least, they are the most inhuman beings that any Department ever had.  I should hope that when a social welfare officer would call to an applicant, he would be kind and courteous in seeking information.  There is a particular officer operating from the Tralee office&mdash;I shall not name him&mdash;who has terrorised old age pensioners, <Col N="641" /> people living alone.  I shall give a glaring example of a particular case in my own town.  I wrote to the Minister about it and his private secretary replied: perhaps the Minister never saw it.  This is a case where a social welfare officer called on an old lady whose means had changed.  She had been keeping boarders but, due to circumstances beyond her control&mdash; she was not up to it any longer&mdash;she had let them go.</P>

      <P>I prefaced my remarks by referring to where the Minister has made savings and I want to tell him how the savings were made.  They were made in a cruel and harsh fashion, if this case is typical.  I am certainly entitled to describe how these savings were made, with all due respect.</P>

      <P>I am attacking an individual who is extremely inhuman.  He called to this old lady who told him the facts of her case.  The next thing he said was: &ldquo;I will search the house to see if there are boarders here.  Let me look into the wardrobes&rdquo;.  In this day and age a search warrant is required before a person goes into a house.  The gardaí are required, not a social welfare officer.  That is only one of many cases.  The officers of the Minister who visit old age pensioners should at least be kind and courteous in seeking information which I am quite sure will be volunteered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have another case in South Kerry where a woman social officer called to an old age pensioner.  The pensioner had to threaten her with boiling water to get her out because she was so aggressive.  The Minister is a good Minister and I have no doubt that he is not aware that this is happening.  I would like him to send specific instructions to those social welfare officers reminding them that old people are <Col N="642" /> easily intimidated; they react in a way that a young person would not react. They only want their rights.  If the officer explains their rights to them I am sure everything will be all right. We always had a good situation in Kerry and I trust we shall have it in the future.  This is the total of my remarks which are made in a constructive spirit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this Estimate. The whole social welfare code should be of concern to all sides of the House, how it is framed and how it will develop in the future.  I am a bit concerned that for some months past and during the election campaign the Government did not seem to give social welfare any priority or have any policy on it or to have considered it in any depth.  I am concerned that we might get back to the pre-1973 era when social welfare benefits and attitudes to them were really those of the poor law days.  Any discussion on social welfare should be based on the idea of something that we must plan and which must be developed in a humane, Christian way.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that he intended to fix benefits at the cost of living index value.  That is right as far as it goes, but it means there is no immediate increase for social welfare recipients. That is not the type of policy we should have.  We must be forward-looking and innovative.  Every budget should bring out new ideas regarding the concept of social welfare.  In the area of non-contributory pensions, where assistance is involved, the income limit should be raised substantially.  This scheme was introduced in the past four years.  The idea was good but it should not be allowed to stagnate.  If we want to give people real increases we should, I think, increase the limit of the income that over the years they may have provided for themselves.  Otherwise, people will not be encouraged to provide themselves with some little income. Therefore, I ask that the income level be raised so as to encourage people to provide a little for themselves to supplement the non-contributory pension they may get.  I consider this important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="643" /> In the whole area of old age pensions and assistance for pensioners we have done a good deal.  I do not think any side of the House should claim credit for doing this type of thing.  I am concerned with one aspect.  I believe people should get some assistance by way of a supplementary housing grant, because if a person occupies local authority housing he has the benefit of subsidised housing and that is very good.</P>

Surely we are entitled to mention areas in which we believe such money should be spent.

      <P>I wholehearedly agree with providing money for assistance. I said that if the income limit for a non-contributory pension was raised that would improve the life of a non-contributory pensioner.  I cannot see how this impinges on this Supplementary Estimate.  I think you are being very restrictive on this.  I believe we should be given an opportunity to say something on it.  I spoke about assistance for housing.  A person who owns his own house has a waiver of rates, which is assistance.  A person who lives in a local authority apartment receives assistance by the subsidised rent.  An old person who has to rent private accommodation has to pay the market price.  Some type of housing assistance should be given to such people.  There are many old people living in such accommodation who will not complain and are possibly the worst off in our society.  We may be discussing policy but the Minister will be discussing this coming near to the budget.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a question yesterday about paying the wife's unemployment benefit to her and the Minister did not have any plans.  If the wife writes to the Secretary of the Department and requests that payment be made to her I believe it should be done.  There is a lot of hardship in Dublin in relation to this.  It might not be very costly to implement this.</P>
      <P>Free electricity and free fuel benefits have been referred to.  Assistance is provided here.  There should be a choice of cash payment or free electricity allowance or a cash payment in preference to free fuel.  This would be of great benefit to an old lady living in rented accommodation. A lot of this accommodation has slotmeters. Once the ESB find that the electricity account is not in her name she is not entitled to the 300 free units of electricity.  A cash payment should be made to that person because she is putting her 10p into the meter and is probably paying more money than if the meter was in her name.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider assistance for school meals and free milk.  I know he is concerned about the health of the people and has said that preventive medicine is the best form of medicine.  I believe we should use some of the money provided by Europe to provide such benefits for our children.  The Minister's Department should take over the free milk scheme.  I believe the cost would be very little.  Most schools have management boards so the best way to administer this would be to hand over the money to them and let them arrange it.  This would cut administrative costs.  A hot meal should be provided in the schools.  This could be provided by people on the spot so that administration would not be very high.  If a block grant was paid to school management boards they could look after the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to look at free travel in the case of an elderly person who is confined where he or <Col N="646" /> she lives in the centre of the city and that person's daughter lives 10 miles out in Clondalkin, Blanchardstown or one of the new housing areas.  That person is probably not very well-off but is the only person to look after her father or mother in the centre of the city.  The Minister might consider looking at free travel in such cases where it is proved that an elderly person is confined to his or her home.  It is a great hardship on that person's daughter having to come in every day to look after her father or mother.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very difficult to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that but I believe this matter should be looked at.  Money could be saved on home help if assistance was provided for the person living in the suburbs.  The elderly person who is confined at home by illness will not be using his or her free travel so the benefit could be transferred to the person living in the suburbs.  As I am not permitted to open up the debate on social welfare I ask the Minister to have a look at the matters I have mentioned.  I ask him not to revert back to the pre-1973 days when it was, live horse and you will get grass.  I hope we have gone away from that mentality for ever.  I am not accusing the Minister of trying to squeeze the less well-off in our society.  However, Government policy might determine something else.  The Minister should spell out a four-year phased programme on social welfare. When we came into office in 1973 we did this.  We made a start by reducing the age qualification for old age pensions over a number of years and we ensured that increases related to the cost of living.  That helped in a positive way to increase the living standards of people.  When we are talking about social welfare we must not consider only the economic aspect.  We must consider the matter having regard to human needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I previously raised the question of post offices being inadequate to deal with social welfare matters.  Social welfare is here to stay but I do not think that our arrangements for paying benefits are appropriate or can deal with <Col N="647" /> the situation.  The present system is not adequate.  On many occasions I have seen long queues of people waiting for their pensions and other benefits. We must try to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell referred to employment exchanges.  From my experience of the exchanges in Dublin the sooner they are dismantled the better.  We should invest money in ensuring that social welfare centres do not rob people of their dignity. Employment exchanges have always created a feeling of despair and this is an area which we have neglected for too long.  When we are building new towns we should incorporate in the plans social welfare centres to meet the needs of the areas in question.  A whole range of services could be centred in a place convenient for those availing of them rather than locating the points in the centre of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his office. I have no doubt he will administer in a humane way.  I would ask him to assert himself in Government to ensure that the moneys required for improvements in social welfare matters are obtained.  In this way the work started in 1973 will be continued.</P>

      <P>A number of points were raised during discussion of this Supplementary Estimate.  I shall try to deal with some of them but perhaps others might be left to another occasion, either when we are bringing in legislation or when the Estimate as a whole is being debated.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boland and Deputy O'Brien asked for a statement, policy or commitment in regard to the social welfare classes.  I have no hesitation in indicating my policy and that of the Government in this regard.  The thrust of the manifesto was, of course, primarily concerned with the economic situation and the need&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>To garner as many votes as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;to restore the economic situation as rapidly as possible.  The manifesto stated that it would be an aim and objective of the <Col N="648" /> Government to ensure that at least social welfare allowances kept pace with the cost of living but, of course, that is only a basic minimum objective.</P>
      <P>It is the firm policy of the Government and it is my policy to ensure that so far as possible the social welfare classes share as fully as possible in the increasing prosperity of our community.  I do not think anyone in this House would be prepared to accept a situation where certain sections could forge ahead, could win for themselves increased incomes and better conditions while at the same time other sections were allowed to lag behind.  It will be our aim to ensure so far as possible that the various sections who need assistance will get it as generously and as readily as circumstances permit.  It will be our aim to bring about positive improvements from time to time as circumstances permit.  Certainly we have as a basic minimum objective to increase social welfare allowances as the rate of inflation or the cost of living demands.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell referred to the need for a development plan with regard to social welfare.  I am sure that would be the objective of every Minister for Social Welfare: to try to get out of the treadmill of annual necessities and to look ahead and bring about long term, positive and comprehensive improvements.  Certainly that would be my approach.  There are a number of areas in the social welfare field where major steps forward can be taken.  As Deputies know, we have published a discussion document on a national pensions plan and very shortly I shall be bringing out another discussion document of the same kind on the question of insurance for the self-employed.  These are two very large areas to which our attention will be directed in the years ahead, as Deputies know, there are other areas that require attention.  As resources become available it is the intention of the Government to endeavour to perfect the overall welfare structure, to endeavour to have it as comprehensive as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell said that we should aim at the total elimination of <Col N="649" /> poverty.  We would all like to think that such a situation could be brought about.  It is our ultimate objective to eliminate the last vestige of poverty from our society, but whether that can be achieved in a modern community is a question to which different people will give different answers.  I do not know if it will ever be possible to so perfect the welfare machinery that there will be no pockets of poverty left anywhere.  Human frailty will always be with us.  There will always be those who, no matter how we perfect our machinery, will fail to achieve reasonably satisfactory standdards of living.  However, our objective is clear.  We are clear as to the state of affairs towards which we should work consistently.  The matter is not only one of elaborate comprehensive schemes but of trying to ensure that these schemes are directed towards the areas that are appropriate and that those who really are in need are in a position to avail of the different schemes.  This brings me to a matter that was raised by a number of Deputies, that is, the question of providing better information in an effort to make the general public more aware of what is available and of trying to ensure that all those who are entitled to benefits succeed in availing of them.</P>
    <P>My Department have that task in hand in a very active way.  It is a continuing process. Some Deputies discussed the supplementary welfare allowances in that connection and said that there is much confusion about this scheme.  Perhaps that is so but the scheme is not fully operational yet. However, I have here an excellent form published by my Department in pursuance of their policy of modernising and simplifying forms.  I think any Deputy would agree that this form is as near to perfection as one could find in this area.  It is a simple, clear-cut form which gives all the information necessary in regard to the scheme and it has attached to it a claim form.  If Deputies are not aware of the existence of this form I shall be glad to make copies of it available to them.  It is a sample of the sort of work we are trying to do in the Department.  We are trying to make steady progress in <Col N="650" /> simplifying all forms, in making them more comprehensible and in making it easier for people to fill them in.  I subscribe fully to the view as stated here that many of the people who need to avail of these schemes are lacking in the necessary degree of education or experience that would make it easy for them to complete the forms.  Very often they have to be assisted in this task. I assure Deputies that the policy in regard to simplifying all forms is a very positive activity of the Department and that it will be pushed ahead.</P>
    <P>Fairly recently I came across a form which horrified me somewhat.  This form is one that is sent to old people who lose their travel passes.  In order to be supplied with replacement passes they are required to fill in the form I am talking of.  To say the least the form is unnecessarily bureaucratic. I have fed it into our simplified machinery process and I trust that a much more simplified version of it will emerge for availability to the general public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that there is a need for a simplifying process in relation to the whole myriad of forms?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I am very conscious of that, but very good work has been done and is continuing to be done in this area.  The best I can do is to promise the House that the process will be pushed ahead as rapidly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Boland and other Deputies, too, mentioned the question of the new telephone subsidy scheme.  One of the problems in relation to the introduction of any scheme is that people fasten on to the ways in which it can be improved.  The very introduction of a scheme tends to highlight other needs.  However, what is important is that a start is made and we have made a start with this telephone subsidy scheme in respect of old persons living alone.  The scheme will be very restricted and will apply only to about 6,000 persons.  Nevertheless, it will be a useful scheme.  Its basic purpose is to ensure that people who are living <Col N="651" /> alone will be enabled to have access to assistance, medical or otherwise, when the need arises. Initially, we must take the view that in the case of two persons living alone one is available to seek assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister make it clear that only those old people living alone and who already have telephones will be eligible for participation in the scheme?  In other words, that if an old person living alone wished to have a telephone installed he would have to meet the capital cost of the installation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That would be £48.  What we would be paying would be the annual rental on the telephone.</P>
      <P>The question of school meals, too, was raised.  Because of the current development in regard to milk, the question of free milk was associated with the question of school meals.  As Deputies know this question of free milk is the subject of an adjournment debate later.  Therefore, I shall not say any more about it at this stage.</P>
      <P>I would reaffirm what I said the other day, that is, that the question of school meals is one that needs to be examined.  My information is that the scheme is not very satisfactory.  It is very limited and is not a very high quality scheme.  I am not sure what can be done about it. The difficulty is that because of the number of school-children involved anything that one would wish to do to improve the situation would prove very expensive.  It is something I propose to look into in some depth.  There are other Departments, agencies and bodies involved in this area and I propose to have discussions with them to see what should be done about it.  As Deputies know my Department only come into this at second hand.  It is the local authorities who are responsible for the scheme, for deciding whether to introduce the scheme and to a large extent our role is secondary.  We pick up the bill to the extent of 50 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would rest with the Government because Education and other Departments would be involved. If anything were to be done it would have to be undertaken at Government level.  However, the first thing to do is discuss the existing scheme with those involved in its administration, with social workers and people in the community generally to see what their views about the situation are.</P>
      <P>The comprehensive scheme which they have in Great Britain is not regarded as satisfactory.  It has very undesirable aspects.  I do not think we could accept that as a model.  I want to sound a warning note that anything that might be contemplated should be understood to be very expensive indeed.</P>
      <P>Reference was also made to the payment of part of unemployment or other benefits to a wife and her children. This is one of these very delicate and sensitive areas.  Officials administering these schemes have to be very circumspect in their approach.  Because we are dealing with human beings, there are so many variables that it is difficult to settle upon a single idea which will always be the right thing to do and which when it is universally applied will be satisfactory.  As Deputies know, every day we come across new cases. We think at any given time that we know all the possible difficulties, circumstances and complications that can arise, and then we come across another case which adds a new dimension of complications to these human problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not say that nothing should be done, but I want to make it clear that all these things have to be very carefully thought about.  The important thing is that when you do something or make a specific change you <Col N="653" /> must be absolutely sure you will not be doing more harm than good.  That is the test.  The difficult decision is to try to summon up enough experience of those who are involved in the practical administration of these schemes to ensure that whatever change is made or whatever improvements we try to bring about are improvements and not the reverse.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland also referred to the anomalies in the social welfare code particularly where a widow suffers a loss of pension on reaching pension age.  That is typical of the sort of thing I have been talking about.  Widows are favourably treated in respect of their capital.  When they come into the old age pension situation, a different set of circumstances applies and what Deputy Boland says can occur.  Wherein is the solution to lie? The cold logical thing to do would be to remove the favourable treatment the widow has before she reaches pension age but I do not think that would be acceptable to any of us.  This is typical of the complications that can arise in devising and in the administration of all social welfare schemes.  On that point we undertook in the manifesto to look at these anomalies and that work is well advanced.</P>

    <P>Deputy Boland was wondering about some change in regard to the unemployment assistance for small holders. I want to assure him that there has <Col N="654" /> been no change in that regard recently. He will recall that a change was made under the 1977 Act which removed the notional method of assessment for those with valuations of over £20.  That came into effect from 1st April, 1977. Perhaps it is the implication of that that the Deputy was referring to.</P>
    <P>On the free fuel scheme, I am meeting with Dublin Corporation as soon as possible to discuss the difficulties and anomalies associated with that scheme.  I want to make it clear that the fact I have not met them so far is not their fault; there were problems on my part in being able to find the time to meet a deputation from the corporation. I hope to do that fairly soon and to review with them the operation of this free fuel scheme which gives rise to a lot of frustration and annoyance on the part of a number of people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fergus O'Brien advocated a further easing of the means test for non-contributory old age pensions. That is something to which we would all be sympathetic but it is one of these things that has to await consideration in the context of the annual budget.</P>
    <P>Deputy John O'Connell referred to the very attractive concept of a minimum income.  That would be something very attractive indeed.  I suppose it would be idyllic if we could bring about a situation where every member of the community could be guaranteed a minimum income and if he was not able to earn that by his own efforts the State would intervene to make sure that he was brought up to the minimum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the sense I am talking about.  That brings up the question of the new concept of negative income tax.  As Deputies know the purpose of negative income tax is to try to treat each individual in the community as an entity.  All that he is entitled to pay to the State and all that he is entitled to get from the State would be added up and there would be a single payment made to him which either brings him up to the <Col N="655" /> minimum or a certain amount would be taken away from him.  That notion has been around for some time.  The British have been going into it fairly carefully and they have published a few papers about it.  On paper anyway it certainly appeals to my mathematical mind and I would love to think that we could have one big central computer doing all the calculations and making sure that there is just one single payment or demand.</P>

      <P>Touche.  Deputy Boland also referred to delays.  Unfortunately there are delays, but we will try to do better.  Delays arise because of the large volume of complaints and appeals and we will just have to try and perfect our machinery, improve our processes and deal with them as expeditiously as we can.  Delays can be very annoying and frustrating for the people concerned and can bring hardship in certain cases.  We will continue to use our best endeavours to eliminate delays to the greatest possible extent.  As I said originally, and in keeping with the rulings of the Chair, <Col N="656" /> this debate on this Estimate has served to bring forward matters which are of concern to Deputies and to which I will endeavour to direct attention.  I suppose that a more comprehensive debate must await the budget, or the Estimate for 1978, or perhaps legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>One was the suggestion that the electricity allowance might be paid in certain cases to people who are not living alone but who are living with somebody else in straitened circumstances.  The second point was in relation to the footwear scheme which is subsidised and is referred to in the Estimate, which I suggested was the cause of an amount of criticism and was in need of revision.  The third was the concept that after benefits came to an acceptable level, they should be index-linked rather than that there should be an annual sort of trumpet day at budget time when an increase in one area is announced but not in another.  There is also the difficulty where home help allowance is withdrawn in the case of a home help who stays overnight with an aged or infirm person, and the suggestion that the wife or husband of a travel permit holder should be entitled to free travel even if the permit holder is not accompanying them, especially in the case where the permit holder is hospitalised and the spouse is going to visit them.  The final and most important point, because the Minister managed not to answer this question last week as well, because the clock and other influences saved him, was the suggestion which has to be dealt with about abolishing the social welfare contribution in respect of people under 21 years of age and introducing a graduated rate of contribution in respect of people who do not work a full week, so as to stimulate employment.</P>

Basically it is an employment policy matter as distinct from a strictly social welfare matter.  I will consider all the other points mentioned by the Deputy. The question of index-linked social welfare benefits is not just a policy matter but a matter of major fundamental long-term policy.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Education was quite categoric that school meals were not a matter for him.  This view was confirmed to me by his Department.  However, I then contacted the Department of Social Welfare to see how they stood in relation to this matter.  Under the School Meals Acts, 1914 to 1975, they contribute 50 per cent of the cost of meals.  The implementation of the scheme is for the local authorities and the Department have no direct function there.  The EEC scheme involves milk only.  The Department prefer to see the school meals and school milk issues as being quite separate.  They consider that the implementation of such a scheme could be done administratively on foot of a Government decision and steps are apparently being taken to see that this is being done&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is yes.  Conversion to automatic working of both exchanges will for technical reasons be dependent on the prior installation of a group switching exchange at Enfield and it is unlikely that conversion will be practicable before the latter half of 1980.  Every effort will however be made to improve on this estimate.</P>
      <P>It is hoped within the next six months to provide additional circuits which will enable extended night service facilities to be given at the exchanges.</P>

RTE except that better reception will be available when the renewal work is completed towards the end of 1978. However, the extent of the improvement and the areas which will benefit cannot be determined with accuracy until the work has been completed.</P>

      <P>The Council of Ministers of the EEC adopted a directive introducing Community measures for the eradication of brucellosis, tuberculosis and leucosis in cattle.  Under the provisions of the directive, member states in which these disease exist shall draw up national plans for the acceleration of their eradication schemes.  If these plans are approved, Community funds to the extent of 60 units of account per cow and 30 units of account per bovine animal other than a cow will be paid to the member state for animals slaughtered under the plans. One of the conditions of payment proposed is that infected animals must be slaughtered within 30 days of identification.</P>
      <P>The criteria with which member states' plans must comply in order to qualify for Community aid are at present under consideration at EEC council level.  It is hoped that this consideration will be completed shortly so that our plans relating to bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis may be finalised for transmission to the EEC Commission.</P>

      <P>First of all, I would like to state as a matter of principle that I do not accept that a Minister for Justice is under any obligation to disclose whether or how often he has met with the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  However, on the present occasion, having regard to assertions which were made recently in the Dáil and which I have already denied, I wish to state that, apart from meetings with the Commissioner at official functions, I have met the Commissioner more than once in my own office and have had detailed discussions with him.  I have kept no record of those meetings nor is there any reason why I should do so.</P>

      <P>The future of the District Court office in Thurles is under review at present following the occurrence of a vacancy in the clerkship in the office.  I have <Col N="637" /> not yet taken any decision in the matter.</P>
      <P>The review arises under the terms of a productivity agreement which has concluded with the provincial District Court staff in 1973 as the basis for an improvement in their pay and grading structure.  An essential element of the agreement is that the overall number of District Court offices be gradually reduced from 59 to about 40, as opportunities occur.  The question that arises at the moment is whether Thurles might be amalgamated with a neighbouring office such as Nenagh.  The Deputy may be assured that before taking a decision I will give very careful consideration to all aspects of the matter including the convenience of the public in the area.</P>
