      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1: In page 3, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:  &ldquo;&lsquo;Aer Lingus&rsquo;, except in the Schedule to this Act, means Aer Lingus Teoranta;  <Col N="1524" />&lsquo;Aerlínte&rsquo; means Aerlínte Éireann Teoranta;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with a problem that we dealt with on the Committee Stage of bringing Aerlínte in.  The Deputy will recall that there is a close connection between Aer Lingus and Aerlínte.  All of these amendments were necessary in view of the requirements that Aerlínte employees should be able to participate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right that the Minister explain clearly to the House the necessity, for example, for amendment No. 1. Referring to page 3 of the Bill we are inserting here a new interpretation and we are saying according to the amendment, &ldquo;&lsquo;Aer Lingus', except in the Schedule to this Act, means Aer Lingus Teoranta;&rdquo;.  I merely want the matter clarified.  I have no objection to this if the people drafting the Bill feel it is necessary but it has to be explained clearly why &ldquo;&lsquo;Aer Lingus&rsquo;, except in the Schedule to this Act, means Aer Lingus Teoranta&rdquo;.  Obviously in the Schedule it means Aer Lingus Teoranta as being one of the companies chosen.  Why do we refer to the necessity for changing from Aer Lingus Teoranta to merely Aer Lingus in other parts of the Bill?  I take into consideration the inclusion of Aerlínte but I cannot understand why this necessity should arise.  I presume the Minister in his reply will explain why this drafting change is necessary.  It is certain that, if I were putting in amendments to this Bill and I did not give a clear and absolute explanation of the necessity for such amendments, then he would be very critical of my performance here and I would agree with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Going on to the second amendment and again to page 3 of the Bill at line 41 we add: <Col N="1525" />&ldquo;and for the purposes of sections 9 (4) (w) and 10 of this Act a person employed in such a capacity by Aerlínte under such a contract shall be regarded as being an employee of Aer Lingus;&rdquo; ...</P>
    <P>We are really adding there to the interpretation again and I understand why an employee of Aerlínte must get the opportunity of being involved in the worker participation being prepared under this Bill, but I cannot understand why the draftsman should have used this sort of interpretation of the Act.  I submit that it is not in accordance with fact and it could be regarded as being distortion of fact.</P>
    <P>I realise what they are trying to do but they have gone the wrong way about it.  It says that for the purposes of sections of this Act a person employed in such a capacity by Aerlínte &mdash;in other words an employee of Aerlínte&mdash;under such a contract shall be regarded as being an employee of Aer Lingus.  Surely that is a contradiction in terms.  I see what they are trying to achieve.  What they are trying to say of course is that these people in Aerlínte will have the opportunity of taking part in the selection process, the election process and the nominating process with regard to the Worker Participation Bill.  I would encourage the Minister before it goes to the Seanad to see if this is the correct interpretation. This sort of amendment is not the way to approach it.  I would suggest that he refer it back to his draftsmen for a more lucid and clear interpretation of how to involve Aerlínte personnel with Aer Lingus.  As regards the purpose I have no objection to it because all it does is give the opportunity to the people working in Aerlínte to become part and parcel of worker participation within Aer Lingus or Aer Lingus Teoranta, whichever title you may wish to use.  A simple interpretation such as that would appear to me to be more in accordance with the facts.  If this is read out of context it gives a completely different picture of the situation.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 is closely related to amendment No. 1.  I want a clear explanation of this amendment.  In the <Col N="1526" /> Schedule, Aerlínte Éireann Teoranta is mentioned.  Why are we deleting the word &ldquo;Teoranta&rdquo; in section 2?  We are talking about the appropriate Minister responsible for the designated company.  Paragraph (iv) of the section reads:</P>
    <P>...with regard to Aer Lingus Teoranta and the British and Irish Steam Packet Company Limited, the Minister for Transport and Power ...</P>
    <P>Why are we omitting the word &ldquo;Teoranta&rdquo; from section 2 and keeping it in the Schedule?  I want a clear and lucid explanation as to why this is necessary.  It may be necessary.  I have no objection to doing it.  Are we just playing around with words?  Are we trying to project the image that we are amending the Bill?  At least two of these amendments mean absolutely nothing at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We came to the conclusion that to include Aerlínte employees it would be necessary to make amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3. On Committee Stage we moved amendments to enable Aerlínte employees to vote in Aer Lingus elections as provided in the Bill.  At that time I drew the attention of the House to the need which would arise to draft some minor consequential amendments to sections 1 and 2 on Report Stage. I emphasise the fact that they are minor drafting amendments.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the apparent inconsistency of mentioning Aer Lingus Teoranta in the Schedule and Aer Lingus elsewhere.  In the Schedule we must refer to the designated bodies by their full formal titles.  There is no significance other than that.  We are forced to include the full rather heavier title of the designated bodies in the Schedule.</P>

      <P>In page 5, to insert &ldquo;both competent to perform the functions of returning officer and&rdquo; before &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; in line 40.</P>
      <P>This amendment is intended to meet one of the points made by Deputy Fitzgerald on Committee Stage.  We are providing that where a person is nominated by the company secretary to act as returning officer, in the secretary's opinion he should be fully capable of discharging the duties of the returning officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment goes a little way towards meeting my request on Committee Stage for what I thought would improve the section and make it fairer.  This is a step in the right direction and I welcome it because it removes any doubt which could have arisen with regard to the appointment of an officer.  Section 7 (b) provides: &ldquo;in lieu of such secretary or officer, any other person who in the opinion of such secretary or officer is acceptable to&rdquo; trade unions, nominating bodies, and so on.  His competency or suitability does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this amendment the Minister has gone part of the way in that regard. We are inserting the words &ldquo;both competent to perform the functions of returning officer and&rdquo;.  Under section 7 the person appointed in lieu of such secretary or officer must be competent to perform the functions of a returning officer and acceptable to a group of people.  I will have something to say on the next amendment about the group of people concerned.  I welcome this amendment.  I claim a certain amount of kudos for having pushed the Minister on the point.  I am sorry he did not go further and do what I suggest <Col N="1528" /> he should do in amendment No. 4a.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It may save time if I give my explanation and then the Deputy can comment on it.  The Deputy may recall that on Committee Stage there was the question of an alternative to the returning officer, a substitute returning officer who should be acceptable also to the majority of the employees.  We could not come up with any satisfactory procedure which would ensure acceptability to the majority of the employees without going through the cumbersome procedure of a ballot.  This would be a cumbersome arrangement in the rather rare circumstances in which this would be required.  We are providing that the substitute returning officer must be acceptable to the nominating bodies, that is, the negotiating bodies recognised for this purpose which either individually or collectively represent a majority of the employees in the company. This achieves what Deputy Fitzgerald has in mind without the delay and the extra cost which would be involved in going through a ballot procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is expressing the same concern about the section as I am.  I firmly believe worker participation must mean workers within the protected company.  The less interference from outside bodies the better.  I have always supported the idea that there should be trade union support for it. Trade union support is essential and vital to the success of worker democracy. It cannot survive without the assistance of the trade union movement. Here we are appointing a returning officer to handle the election, or a substitute for him.  In the case of the Dáil or local elections in our constituencies it is not a condition of appointment of a returning officer that he be acceptable to the political parties.  Perhaps that is just as well as it might result in wrangling.  If the <Col N="1529" /> secretary, who is regarded as a responsible officer, nominates somebody whom he belives is competent and suitable to perform the functions of returning officer and is acceptable to the workers that should be satisfactory.  I am still not content; the Minister quoted a figure of 5 per cent of the employees of the State bodies we are concerned with who are not trade union members or members of staff associations; I said it was higher, but even taking his 5 per cent, in effect under this legislation we are depriving that 5 per cent of ever having an opportunity of being nominated to these boards, in other words denying them their rights as citizens working in the State enterprises concerned.</P>
      <P>I do not want to have this worker participation held up or retarded by people quibbling over trivialities such as the colour of a man's eyes when he is appointed as returning officer or some other reason why some group of people in the nominating bodies will not accept him.  I see the Minister's problem&mdash;how to get a majority of the employees.  The union or a number of unions or a number of nominating bodies must be consulted and one or more may disagree with an appointment and say the candidate is not suitable and an alternative may be appointed.  Again, one or two more may object to him and, as I see it under the Bill, they are quite within their rights in doing so.  You may be dealing with people who, although essentially connected with the company are, in effect, working outside it.  I think worker participation must be kept under the aegis of the company as far as possible to ensure that it works as we want it to work.  The Bill has sufficient shortcomings without denying the workers a say here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will be going through the Seanad and I ask the Minister to consider inserting something to the effect that unless a certain number or percentage of the employees of the company object to such an appointment it shall be made.  I should prefer to see this as a decision of the employees rather than a decision of the nominating bodies or outside bodies because a returning officer is appointed <Col N="1530" /> not to look after the interests of the nominating bodies but the interests of the people voting, the electorate who are the workers in that company.  We must be mainly concerned with these people in this legislation and confine it to them as far as possible.  I do not believe the Minister is right in giving this power to nominating bodies or trade unions to disapprove of the appointment of a returning officer.  I believe the workers in the company should decide this and if a certain number or percentage of them do not agree with the appointment I think that is the only thing that should be considered by the Minister.  I want the Bill to work and to help the Minister to ensure that it works and I want as little interference as possible from outside in the introduction of worker democracy in the companies we are discussing. Therefore, I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 28 to 30 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;only after consultation with,</P>
      <P>(a)  the Minister of State or every Minister of State, as may be appropriate, who as regards a designated body to which the regulations are to apply is the appropriate Minister, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  the designated body or every designated body, as may be <Col N="1531" /> appropriate, to which the regulations are to apply&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On section 9, Deputy Fitzgerald suggested that it might be amended to enable designated bodies to make regulations after consulting the nominating bodies and having also taken into account the problem of the geographical spread of the enterprise and then have the regulations approved by me.  As I have already said, under the Act concerned with these regulations, the Statutory Instruments Act, 1947, regulations like these must be executed by the Government or somebody acting on behalf of the Government, Government Ministers, and in this case it will be the person holding the portfolio of Labour.  The precise procedures and arrangements about elections will in practice be determined on the basis of consultations with the social partners, management and union in the enterprise concerned and, while the Bill cannot specifically provide for this for reasons already mentioned, the Deputy may be assured that in practical terms this is in fact how the regulations will be drawn up, after effective consultation with the bodies, management and unions and staff associations representing workers.</P>
    <P>We share common ground on the need for prior consultation and to make the idea more explicit in the Bill I am putting forward an amendment to section 9 (2) which requires that in addition to consulting the appropriate Minister as originally provided for, consultations must also take place with the designated bodies.  In fact this would have happened but it is now more explicit.  This amendment should make the intention quite clear without having to incorporate elaborate provisions about the precise method of consulation which would add unnecessary complication to a Bill which is necessarily complicated enough as it stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>To add the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  the nominating groups:</P>
      <P>and when making regulations under this section the Minister shall take into consideration the geographical spread of a designated body to which the regulations are to apply.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have no objection to amendment No. 5 which does not go as far as I want. The Minister might charge me with inconsistency here because of the previous amendment but I am particularly concerned about some of these companies, especially those with a large geographical spread and probably an imbalance of workers.  CIE employ a large number of people in the Dublin area and they have many depots throughout rural Ireland.  Bord na Móna are spread over many counties.  The ESB have many different departments and geographical locations. We have not been told how many worker-directors will be on the boards.  We know there will be a third of a particular number but under the Bill the Ministers concerned will have power to alter the number of State directors on the boards of those companies. All these companies have seven directors but Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann have nine.  That is a good company to take as an example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assuming membership of that board stays at nine, three members will be elected by the workers of that company. There are four beet processing factories and a number of food plants. Understandably, the number of employees in all these plants varies.  My amendment adds &ldquo;(c) the nominating groups&rdquo;.  I inserted that because in the case of the Sugar Company there are four processing plants but only three directors, unless the Minister decides to increase the number of directors to 12.  I would not support that because, first, it would be an added charge on the company and, secondly, some of his colleagues in Government might be <Col N="1533" /> tempted to make appointments to the other two-thirds in appreciation for services rendered.  This is happening more openly and more regularly as days go by.</P>
    <P>Unless we organise the elections properly it could happen that all three directors could come from one area. This would be very undesirable.  The problems would be greater in the ESB and CIE because of the spread.  Of necessity we cannot give every major CIE or ESB geographical location representation on the boards.  It would be very desirable if this could be done but obviously it is not possible.  The two-tier system appears the more desirable.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a major problem ensuring the workers will be content that the persons concerned were elected to represent the different geographical locations.  It would be disastrous if the three appointments came from the same area, say, Dublin.  I have no objection to their being Dublin-based, but what worries me is that there would not be a proper spread.  It could equally be argued that all three should not be from the rail, road or freight sections, irrespective of geographical locations.  Therefore, not only the geographical spread should be taken into consideration but also the particular sections.</P>
    <P>We all want to see this Bill work properly and the more consultation there is the better.  Therefore, I strongly urge the Minister to accept my amendment. As I said, he could charge me that this is a contradiction with my previous amendment but there is a vast difference here.  I believe the first election will be very important.  We all want to see this work properly but to some extent we are all going into the unknown.  For this reason I believe the more consultation there is and the more information that is given to the employees the better, because the appointment of these worker-directors must be and must appear to be as democratic as possible.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why there should not be consultation.  The Minister has the final say, and rightly so.  Only by consultation <Col N="1534" /> can there be any hope that the workers will be satisfied with the final results.  This is very important and again I ask the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pledged himself to consult people.  Other members of his Government promised that too, but they broke their promises years ago.  I would regard this move as an innovation in conditions of employment.  This legislation must succeed; it cannot afford not to.  Any kind of failure will do harm to further extension.  I hope we are not too far away from the opportunity to extend meaningful worker democracy.  Any setback or failure, even in this limited Bill, can only mean that in the future people will be suspicious.  For that reason I urge the Minister that consultation is absolutely essential to it.  There may be drafting problems but they can be overcome.  A mistake in drafting will not hinder or help worker participation but lack of involvement of people can certainly harm it.  I strongly urge the Minister to accept at least the spirit of the amendment.  If he wants to change the wording of it I have no objection.  I believe it is essential that the Minister should not only consult but should be seen to consult.  It is the first step on the road to worker democracy but it must be a solid successful step with complete involvement of the people whose lives it will affect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already covered the general need for consultation. We are all agreed that the worker directors should represent as adequately as possible the interests of their constituents, the workers who elected them, and it would be best to see them elected in the fairest poll possible. In a company which is geographically dispersed the worker directors should understand and sympathise with the regional pattern of the employees.  That is the ideal situation.  It is difficult, however, to specify this in the Bill itself.  There is no disagreement in this objective and I am confident that there will be a happy blend between regional interests and the democratic poll.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Difficulties could arise if I were to accept this amendment.  A phrase like <Col N="1535" />&ldquo;taking into consideration the geographical spread of a designated body&rdquo; could possibly lead to a legal tangle. Let us take, for example, a company like Aer Lingus which at any one time might have over 100 workers in the United States.  It could be claimed that such workers would have to be represented on the board irrespective of how the 5,000 home-based employees are represented.  Could it mean that all overseas employees in the United Kingdom, Europe or elsewhere must be collectively represented and then on what basis?  This gives some indication of the possible interpretations of an amendment of this nature. It is open to a variety of interpretations and it could be held that it would represent a certain conflict with such major principles of the Bill as outlined in section 9 (3) which states that the poll must be taken according to the supreme principle of proportional representation.  The adoption of other criteria might possibly interfere with this principle.  In certain circumstances the necessity to base representation on geographical criteria could mean that the principle of the majority numbers in the selection of worker-directors would be set aside.  It could be claimed that small groups should be given greater weight in the election process. In the light of these practical difficulties which undoubtedly exist and which could be a potential source of friction, I hope the Deputy will agree that the Provisions in section 9 (2) as amended offer the most flexible and acceptable basis whereby consultations can take place with the nominating bodies without the risk of generating friction or endangering the principles of proportional representation, the most important requirement of elections.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 15, lines 10 and 11, to delete &ldquo;before making the appointment, have regard to that poll&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;appoint the first candidate in the poll who was not deemed to be elected&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is a glaring case for accepting the amendment as I have outlined it. I am trying to safeguard the Minister himself.  We are talking now about the powers of the Minister in replacing a person who may have died or resigned or departed from the board to which he was elected by the workers.  How is that worker to be replaced?  There is only one fair way in which this can be done.  Section 22 (2) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In appointing a person to fill a casual vacancy, the appropriate Minister shall, in case there was a <Col N="1537" /> poll at the last preceding election relating to the designated body concerned, before making the appointment, have regard to that poll.</P>
    <P>I do not think that this is strong enough.  I want to protect the Minister here and, indeed, protect him from his colleagues in the Government.  They may see the weakness there and try to get their hands on the loot.  One of the Minister's colleagues could look for the job for his right-hand man.  It could well be the Taoiseach.  We have seen it happen only last week or the week before. The first candidate in the poll who was not deemed to be elected should be appointed.  If three directors were elected the fourth person in the poll would be the obvious choice.</P>
    <P>I probably should have gone a little further in my amendment and said &ldquo;the first or next person&rdquo;.  The fourth person in the poll might be unavailable or at that stage could say that he or she is no longer interested in serving as a member of the board and is no longer interested in going forward. The Minister could then go on to the person who was second in the poll after the three members originally appointed.  It is important, for the Minister's sake and for the sake of any successor who may follow him, that he leave his options open in this case.</P>
    <P>There could be repercussions if the Minister does not do what I suggest. Those of us who have worked in industry and factories know the petty little differences that can arise, some of which may be imaginary.  Great discontent could be caused in a company if there is not a specific way of appointing the person next in line.  When one has regard to the poll it means that the Minister must take this into consideration but he need not necessarily appoint the person next in line.  We have a substitute in the wings, if my amendment is accepted, waiting to move in as a member of the board or a director of the company if by chance a vacancy arises.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to get rid of the terrible image the Coalition have created for themselves, the &ldquo;jobs for the boys&rdquo; situation, which has worsened in recent weeks as we <Col N="1538" /> approach a general election.  I urge him to seal the gap and prevent any of his pirating colleagues from ferreting out that position for one of their friends.  I believe the person who is next in the poll is entitled to have that place.  If that person is not available or decides not to take the position then the person next in line in that poll is the natural substitute.  I pressed the Minister hard about this on Committee Stage.  I did not want to divide the House then nor do I want to do it this morning if I can avoid it.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister sees that we are appointing one substitute after another and that once the elections have been held, provided the person next in line is still in the company and interested in taking the position that person should be appointed. There should be no loopholes whereby a Minister could get away from this.  If such a loophole is used in one of those companies it will sound the death-knell of any progress in worker participation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There are not any objections in relation to the principle of seeing that the person who enjoys most support, the one that common sense would suggest and whom the nominating bodies would support, is the person to fill the vacancy that will arise.  We are up against a familiar difficulty in legislation of this kind that if we try to spell out in detail points in this general principle we may end up in greater difficulty and we may not be serving the general interest of most effective representation in the circumstances which these sections deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a suggestion by Deputy Fitzgerald that the highest placed of the unsuccessful candidates must automatically be appointed to fill a casual vacancy.  That was my original intention but in the course of consultations with bodies concerned it was decided to omit that stipulation from the Bill.  If we were to agree that a rota system would operate it could be expected that the replacement in the event of a casual vacancy would expect to be drawn from a group or sector whose turn it was to be represented on <Col N="1539" /> the board.  Such a replacement might not in fact be the highest placed in the poll.  Nevertheless, if we were tied to the automatic selection of the highest placed, regardless of other considerations, it would upset the rota scheme which Deputy Fitzgerald, I thought quite rightly, earlier in this Bill, recommended as a suitable system in certain circumstances.  If the highest placed was automatically to fill casual vacancies we could see, from what we know already from discussions with them, the kind of rota system that will be operated in the B &amp; I between the seagoing and shore employees.  We could see practical difficulties impeding the successful implementation of this rota system if one had to be tied automatically to the principle that the highest placed had to fill casual vacancies.</P>
    <P>I feel&mdash;I hope the Deputy will agree with me&mdash;that unless a prescriptive formula is preferable, while adhering to the general ideas expressed by the Deputy, with which I am in agreement, we must be afforded here, for practical implementation, flexibility for the nominating bodies&mdash;the entire success of this Bill depends on their agreement&mdash;so that the rota system, where it operates, may not be upset by insisting that a particular process must be adhered to in every detail in the event of a casual vacancy.  There is a very important principle at work here.  All sides are anxious to ensure that even in the matter of casual vacancies the right thing is done and the most effective representation is maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point made by the Minister regarding the reference to the B &amp; I.  The same would apply.  I should like if the Minister could give me the official interpretation for what is meant by having regard to the poll.  If having regard to the poll means that the Minister may not go outside those people who contested that election I am reasonably happy.  I want to avoid someone being pushed in as a director who may not have in any way participated in the previous election.  If I can get an assurance of the official interpretation <Col N="1540" /> of what is intended in the language of this legislation by the words &ldquo;having regard to that poll&rdquo; I would be prepared to consider withdrawing the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I might intervene to assist the Deputy.  &ldquo;Having regard to that poll&rdquo; would mean that in an election situation with a vacancy arising I would, obviously, have to say in practical terms that the next highest person must fill any ensuing vacancy. However, where other systems might operate, such as the rota system, I would still have to have regard to the poll but it is possible that in consultation with the nominating bodies that something different might be done.  In my view it is tight enough but I have a flexibility.</P>

    <Title>Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Bill, 1976: Fifth Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset of the debate on this Bill I referred to the fact that there were many omissions from it.  I am disappointed with the small number of State companies involved and with the single-tier system.  I hope the Bill will make some positive contribution towards improving industrial relations within the State companies.  We all know that within the seven companies mentioned in the Bill our people have had awful experiences of industrial unrest. We are all aware that shortly before Christmas, when the weather was very <Col N="1541" /> bad, there was industrial unrest in CIE and in the ESB.  There are two sides to all disputes and difficulties and any steps that will contribute to improving industrial relations in those companies should be taken by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I have reservations as to how much assistance this Bill will be.  I support the placing of workers on boards but can anybody say how the appointment of three or four workers to the board of the ESB would in any way have prevented the Shannonbridge incident that disrupted industry and created so much inconvenience for many people, particularly the elderly, in the bitterly cold weather?  In my view it would not have made any difference.  I am disappointed that the Minister, when the opportunity was presented to him, did not give us a type of worker participation that would stand as a lasting memory to him.  We are all aware that the Minister's period in office is drawing to a close and the Minister is aware that the National Coalition will not be returned.  It is a pity that he did not avail of this opportunity to carve an indelible mark for himself in the progress of industrial democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have tried to analyse why the number of companies was so limited.  Many other companies should have been brought under that.  It should be remembered that this is more than a four year old commitment and it will be some time before the terms of this can be put into operation.  After it is passed by the Seanad and signed by the President the systems have to be worked out before industrial democracy is put into operation.  How long will we have to wait for that?  The end product after a four year wait is disappointing. I have also drawn attention to the fact that the boards are very remote.  Those of us who worked for a company over the years are aware that boards are always regarded as being remote.  With regard to the boards of State companies they are mainly concerned with forward planning, new policies and financial results. While I agree with the involvement of workers on these boards I do not think the proposals in the Bill go far enough because the decisions of management <Col N="1542" /> are not normally made by the board or, if they are, they are transmitted at a lower level of management. This was an ideal opportunity for the Minister to introduce a two-tier system to give involvement at board level and at management levels that matter.</P>
    <P>I can recall a man in my area who was advancing in years expressing a desire to a friend of his to get married, in spite of his age.  The weather was bad at the time and this man's friend asked him where he intended living. That man of advancing years said he was going to build a house but because the weather was bad he intended putting up the roof first.  Something similar has been done in this Bill; the roof has been erected but there are no foundations or walls.  Things would work better if the foundations and walls were erected.  I was also critical of the exclusion of a certain section of workers in these companies.  The numbers are not important, whether they represent 5 per cent or 10 per cent of the work force.</P>
    <P>All workers in State companies should have the opportunity to offer themselves as candidates.  That opportunity is not there unless they join a trade union or are already in a trade union.  I do not see how any person can be denied the right to stay outside trade unions and I submit that that voluntary decision should be maintained. Indeed one could go so far as to say that these people are being denied certain constitutional rights.</P>
    <P>Obviously this Bill will be taken as a sort of blueprint for the future and although there may be only 5 per cent of State company employees not now members of the unions, as we go along we may find that percentage growing because more State companies may become involved.  If such people are to enjoy their freedom as citizens to make individual decisions they should not be excluded in this fashion.  Workers' involvement in management of State companies must be attained with as little outside interference as possible. For too long there has been mistrust and lack of confidence between workers and management.  Our record has been bad in this respect at severe cost to the economy.  Nobody likes to <Col N="1543" /> be involved in strike situations because there is very little gained from them and everything to lose.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the more we can confine the operation of industrial democracy within individual companies the better for all concerned.  There must be trade union encouragement and assistance in this situation.  For a long time both management and trade unions were reluctant and even afraid of what worker participation might do for workers. Consequently, this legislation will be a big step but we should stop the dragging of feet that existed up to now in regard to worker participation and industrial democracy.  We must look forward to the extension of this sort of democracy to many other sectors.  It will take a long time but the efforts will be worth while.  We are still missing out on a number of State companies and we have not even looked at the private sector.  We hope that the enterprises covered by this Bill will be models for the future.  I believe that the Minister was determined that this legislation would be worth while but that he was stymied by his Cabinet colleagues. Small though this first step is, we support it.  We had a worth while Committee debate which improved the measure.  I am sure the Seanad will have much to say on it and that it will be returned to us with further improvements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald has summed up in a masterly way on the Final Stage.  He pointed out the support of this side of the House for the measure and our disappointment that its implications are not more widespread. He pointed to some lofty ideals to be aimed at if we are to have true universal industrial democracy.  That is why we have been pressing for information as to why certain things have not been done.  We in Fianna Fáil blazed the trail in this sphere.  I would recall when Fianna Fáil appointed a very worthy Member of the Oireachtas, the late Senator Jimmy Dunne, to the board of CIE.  He was an ideal choice, an outstanding individual of the highest integrity.  At that time people were not so enlightened in regard to <Col N="1544" /> industrial democracy and the late Senator was subjected to criticism from certain quarters.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see we have advanced from that stage to the point where this House can agree on the general principles of this Bill.  We have to ensure, however, that in the future legislation of this type will do more in the field of industrial democracy and there is an onus on the Government to strive towards much better relations between management and workers in the public sector than we have had so far.  Deputy Fitzgerald pointed to the Shannon-bridge incident and to CIE strikes. CIE strikes are serious because they hit workers who have not cars&mdash;of course many of them may get lifts from those who have&mdash;but the Shannonbridge dispute brought home to us a very serious situation.  I agree with Deputy Fitzgerald that there are two sides to every dispute but ESB disputes deprived many institutions of electric power.  Therefore we must strive with all our ability for much better industrial relations in the ESB.</P>
      <P>The hospitals must never again be subjected to a disruption of supplies. In these establishments and in old people's homes lives are actually dependent on continuity of electricity supply.  There are some hospitals which have auxiliary plants but there are many which do not have such plants. There are old people's homes which do not have auxiliary supplies.  I am not allocating blame.  I am simply appealing to those who may be involved in disputes to implement this legislation so that we will have a humane society in which the sick, the aged and the poor will not be deprived of some essential service just because the disputants cannot resolve some trivial difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share Deputy Fitzgerald's concern over the omissions in the Bill.  Perhaps many of the principles involved have been honoured more in the breach than in the observance.  I look forward like my colleagues, Deputy Fitzgerald and Deputy Dowling, to the return of a Government from this side of the House which will bring in a charter incorporating proper human relations, <Col N="1545" /> in which all will be involved and as a result of which it can be truly said that what is the concern of one is the concern of all.</P>
    <P>I do not think this Bill will do a great deal.  We will probably boast about it from election platforms and proclaim we have got worker participation. How much participation?  Will it be just a case of putting people on boards because that looks good?  If that is the result then it would be better not to attempt this just yet.  We are not satisfied with this Bill and as soon as we return to power in the next year or two we will examine the whole field of worker participation as the late Seán Lemass did when he brought in his Conditions of Employment Act in 1935.  That is still regarded as a milestone in social legislation.  However, despite the omissions, I hope this Bill will work.  I appeal to all concerned not to go on boards unless they are imbued with the highest ideals.  They should go with a sense of dedication and strive to improve human relations. They must realise in bodies like the ESB, which has a tremendous impact, that they have a tremendous responsibility. They must ensure that no old person and no hospital patient will suffer because the board cannot resolve some trivial difficulty.  I look forward to the time when we will be able to look at this legislation after it has been in operation and improve it in the way it should be improved.  That ought not to be difficult because we will have the benefit of hindsight, something the Minister has not got.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the views put forward so ably by Deputy Fitzgerald and Deputy Moore.  Deputy Fitzgerald has dealt in a very comprehensive way with this Bill.  My views differ from his somewhat.  Worker participation has been referred to in other documents as worker democracy.  This is worker participation in State enterprises. It is limited and so it represents a desertion of workers outside of State enterprises, workers who are promised industrial democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A comprehensive Bill should have been introduced.  Workers were promised participation or industrial <Col N="1546" /> democracy, or whatever term one likes to use.  Recently I was reading some of the policy statements made by people now in Government and this Bill is clearly a desertion of a great majority of our workers.  The entire field of employment should be covered by some type of participation.  If participation is necessary in State enterprises then it is necessary to an even greater degree in other employment. There are brakes within the public service and there are systems which give the workers some say on some occasions in decision-making.  Decision-making is all important from the point of view of worker participation.  This is patchwork legislation.  It should be comprehensive.  One section, a very large section, is being completely ignored while another section in privileged employment is given certain advantages. I look forward to the day when we can examine in depth the question of share capital for workers from reinvested profits and kindred matters.</P>
    <P>Some of the groups involved have been mentioned by Deputy Moore and Deputy Fitzgerald.  Deputy Moore mentioned CIE.  Fianna Fáil appointed to the board of CIE members of the trade union organisation. As has been mentioned, the late Jimmy Dunne, an excellent trade union official of wide vision, forward thinking and a man who was progressive in outlook, was appointed to that board.  However, he had to leave the board because of pressure from people within the trade union.  I hope that will not happen in the future.  When people are appointed to boards under this or any other legislation, I hope they will be able to participate for the benefit of those whom they represent.</P>
    <P>This Bill refers to some services, particularly CIE and the ESB.  I hope it will enable the boards to function more effectively than in the past. Recently we had the tragic situation when there was a disruption of the power services.  Last night in the Dublin Corporation I had a motion discussed in relation to part of the area I represent, St. Michael's Estate, Inchicore. The fact that the situation at <Col N="1547" /> Shannonbridge could put lives at risk in Inchicore must be taken into consideration. In that instance people were deprived of water and sewerage services.</P>
    <P>The Minister must examine the situation regarding essential services. The personnel appointed to boards which cater for such services should take a keen and active interest to ensure that there is better industrial understanding between the board and the workers.  We should never again have a situation where people's lives are put at risk because of power failures, as happened in the recent past.  The people in St. Michael's Estate, Inchicore, were deprived of a very basic service, a fresh water supply.  Last night at the Dublin Corporation meeting I had a motion accepted which instructed the city manager to install a stand-by generator to ensure that there will not be a disruption in essential services in the future.</P>
    <P>I hope the workers themselves will regard essential services as something quite different and apart from other services.  We should ensure that comprehensive discussions take place so that there will not be a breakdown which might put people's lives at risk. I hope the Bill will succeed in alleviating some of the stress that has existed in the past but I do not think it is comprehensive enough.  It does not measure up to the promises made.  The Minister has deserted the people who had hoped for some kind of comprehensive legislation that would allow worker participation outside State enterprises. I hope the Minister will give an indication of when he will introduce more comprehensive legislation to deal with other sectors of industry.</P>
    <P>I accept that this measure is a step forward and I hope the Bill is successful. If it will remedy some of the problems of misunderstanding that existed in the past between management and workers it will justify itself but I am afraid it has not gone far enough.  For that reason I hope the Minister will assure the thousands of workers to whom he promised legislation regarding worker democracy that <Col N="1548" /> they are not a forgotten people.  I hope he can tell them they will be remembered in forthcoming legislation, late as it may be and I hope we have comprehensive legislation to cover the entire area of industrial democracy or worker participation in the broadest sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my belief that on looking back at this Bill it will prove to be one of the more significant pieces of legislation passed by the 20th Dáil. This Bill will be a sign of the wider changes we shall see in the organisation of industry in the future.  The enactment of this legislation represents a significant advance in the board movement encompassed under the term &ldquo;worker democracy&rdquo;.  It will provide that 50,000 workers in seven State companies will take part in direct elections to the boards of those companies but it will not prevent the development of a two-tier consultative council operating below board level in any of these companies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dowling asked why we did not wait until a Bill could be prepared which would cover the entire Irish industry. That would need wide changes in our company law.  As Deputies opposite are aware, the question of company law is under discussion in the EEC.  The quest for a more uniform company legal structure is on the way but it would be very optimistic to think that those discussions would be completed within the next decade.  The choice we had was to proceed on a front, narrower than that covering the entire industry but a front on which some advances could be made.  I do not exaggerate what has been done now but I think it is a significant step when 50,000 workers will be participating for the first time in a worker participation operation.</P>
      <P>Some other EEC countries have some experience in this area but this is our first step.  Not all EEC countries have experience of worker participation in practice; Britain does not have any such experience so far.  The pre-legislative debate has just commenced in Britain with the publication of the Bullock report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1549" /> The two-tier system is not ruled out. If that development takes root in these companies the legislation will not inhabit its further development.  The passage of this legislation should contribute to improving industrial relations in the companies concerned. That was not the primary motivation of this legislation but it will be a beneficial side-effect, that industrial communications may be improved once the provisions of the legislation begin to take effect.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank Opposition Deputies for the constructive debate we have had during the course of this Bill.  Deputy Fitzgerald made many worthwhile contributions.  Deputy Dowling has also spoken as well as other Members of the House.  It is right that we should at all times be dissatisfied that legislation does not apply more widely, that it could not be further improved.  There is a great deal more ahead of us in this area. At the same time we must record some satisfaction that we have taken these first significant steps.  I should like to thank Deputies for the work they put into their contributions on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I should like to break with tradition by paying tribute to the officers of the worker participation section of the Department of Labour.  Mr. Aherne, who heads the section, and Miss Redmond were with us this morning. Civil servants who play a large part in the preparation and consultation that goes into any legislation are seldom in this House.  Without the commitment and dedication of these two officers it would not have been possible to have brought this legislation to this stage.  Deputies may make the point that this legislation has been a long time in preparation but it involved extensive consultations.  The worker participation section was set up only three years ago.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald raised other points on Committee Stage.  Any points not covered by amendments will be considered between now and the time the Bill goes to the Seanad.  I will consider these points further to see if the suggestions can be incorporated.</P>

      <P>As outlined in the explanatory memorandum, the purpose of the Bill is to afford greater protection to workers threatened by redundancy.  It provides for an early-warning system by compelling an employer contemplating redundancies to enter into prior consultation with the representatives of the employees concerned. It also provides that an employer must notify the Minister for Labour of proposed redundancies and then to delay their implementation until 30 days have elapsed.  The meaning of collective redundancies is the dismissal of at least five employees over any consecutive period of 30 days in an establishment employing more than 20 and fewer than 50 persons. The number of dismissals required to constitute collective redundancies rises progressively with the size of the establishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald indicated that we were anxious to assist the Minister in trying to control massive redundancies. He stated that redundancies disrupted homes and towns and anything that could be done to prevent redundancies would be work well done.  However, the Bill has many defects.  Like other legislation that has been brought before the House, it is patchwork legislation. As Deputy Moore pointed out in relation to a previous measure, this legislation should be more comprehensive. We should not depend on one Act to assist another.  This has been the situation in regard to a number of Bills.  We hoped to have a workers' charter but this Bill is far from it: <Col N="1551" /> indeed, the patchwork system does not lend itself to congratulations.</P>
    <P>This Bill is heavily European in so far as the dictates of the European Commission have been included in it. This Bill and the European measures relate to large industries.  We are a small country and we encourage the development of small industries.  We hear a lot of talk from the IDA and the Minister in relation to small industries.  Surely we are not going to desert the people in the small industries. The Bill refers to establishments employing more than 20 and fewer than 50 persons.  Many of our industries employ fewer than 20 workers. This Bill will not cover a great proportion of Irish workers.  Why should they be discriminated against?  I hope the Minister will have second thoughts on this aspect of the Bill as it proceeds through the House.  I hope he will give consideration to small industries and to the workers employed in them. They require more protection, because the trade unions take action in regard to pending redundancies in large industries. This Bill must be tailored to the requirements of Irish industry and to our development.</P>
    <P>We must not be influenced by measures that are applied in France, Germany or other industrialised countries. We are a separate entity with a different industrial structure.  It is sad to think that workers in small industries are not protected.  How does the problem of redundancy in a very small concern differ from that in a big concern? Surely the problem of redundancy affecting 10 or 15 people in a small industry is as important as that in a larger industry?  There is no answer to this problem except to appoint more inspectors.  Whatever protection is afforded to one worker should be afforded to all, irrespective of where they work and irrespective of how the system is operated in their sector.  This is a great defect in the Bill, and I hope that Deputy Gene Fitzgerald will, in relation to his amendment, deal with section 6 very exactingly and seek protection for the people in the type of industry I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>There are certain omissions from <Col N="1552" /> the Bill.  The public sector is not included. Shipping companies are not included.  The stewardesses and other women employed on the ferries that ply between this country and Le Havre and between this country and England also need protection.  This is the Protection of Employment Bill, which would indicate to people outside the House that it was all-embracing and that all workers were being protected. The employees in the public service and in the shipping companies should be protected.  Maybe there will be redundancies in the public service.  Who knows?  The way things are going there could be very few public servants here next year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald, in the course of his contribution expressed his alarm at several sections of the Bill, particularly sections 17 and 21.  Section 17 is a provision in relation to an authorised officer.  The Minister has written into this Bill, as he has written into other Bills, that the battering ram may be a process whereby he can break into a person's house.  Subsection (2) reads:</P>
    <P>The powers conferred on an authorised officer by subsection (1) (a) shall not be exercisable in respect of a private dwelling house unless the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Would the House take note of that, &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;(or an officer of the Minister appointed by the Minister for the purpose) certifies that he has reasonable grounds ...</P>
    <P>Then he can break into the private dwelling.  A person's private dwelling should not be at risk from the Minister or anyone else.  The Minister should heed Deputy Fitzgerald's remarks in relation to this section.  In other Acts that have gone through this House in recent times there is the same type of approach.  It was in the Banks Act, for example.  Does the Minister really believe that this power is necessary? Does he really believe that employers in large industrial concerns are going to retreat to their homes and conduct operations from there in relation to redundancy?  I do not think so.  This is an unreasonable provision and it should be deleted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1553" /> Apart from all the defects of the Bill that have been pointed out in the course of discussion, there is the question of collective redundancies.  That does not rule out progressive redundancies whereby an employer who does not want to become involved with the Department can, over a period, phase out many more people than the Minister purports to protect in the Bill.  The problem of progressive redundancies is a cause of concern in many firms, large and small.  While there is a limitation in this section in relation to the period, nevertheless, progressive redundancies are a problem.  Collective redundancies take place at a time when positive proof can be produced, some major factors, and very few employers will attempt to create massive redundancies because there are other factors in relation to payments they must take into account.  Therefore, this creeping paralysis type of redundancy that affects the workforce is more serious than the collective type.</P>
    <P>In regard to collective redundancy there is consultation, unless it is an overnight closure, unless the firm decide because of some sudden serious development that they cannot continue to operate.  No matter how the Minister tries to interpret this Bill and to apply its provisions, if a firm decides overnight to close because of loss of some important order or some serious defect that has become apparent, I do not think the Minister would be able to ensure the maintenance of employment for 30 days.  On many occasions firms endeavour to carry on and carry their staff until such time as they feel an absolute closedown at an early period is essential.  How does the Minister propose to remedy that situation?  Does he propose to make funds available for the continuance of the service for an additional 30 days or does he want a bankrupt concern to continue for that period in order to maintain employment?</P>
    <P>Any Bill that can protect the worker to any degree needs the support of this House, however defective the Bill may be in our opinion.  The Minister indicated quite rightly a few moments ago that there may be disagreement. We have expressed our <Col N="1554" /> views regarding the type of comprehensive legislation that is required and we have indicated the areas of defect in certain legislation.  On this occasion, too, we shall endeavour to be as helpful as possible in relation to the legislation before the House but we have a duty to point to the aspects of it that we consider to be defective.  It might be a worth-while exercise to ask ourselves how effective has been the whole range of legislation brought in by this Minister.  Has it made substantial changes in industrial life?  Has it led to harmony in industry or has it bestowed greater benefits on Irish workers?  We admit that some effort has been made in bringing about improvements in this whole area but, regrettably, there has been no worth-while breakthrough in respect of the protection of workers.  The type of protection required can be effected only by legislation that is based on the widest terms possible because the difficulty in relation to legislation of a piecemeal nature is that it tends, for the time being, to allow people lose sight of the problems that are likely to develop as a consequence of the problems already in existence.</P>
    <P>Anyone studying this legislation will realise the disservice that it will do to those whom we endeavour to assist because I fear that it will have the result, at least in some instances, of making it easy for employers to render workers redundant.  I am talking here in this context of employers who are unscrupulous or irresponsible but the majority of our employers do not fall into this category.  They are responsible people operating very often in conditions that are very difficult, conditions that are dictated by Government policy <i>vis-á-vis</i> financial matters, taxation measures and so on.  It would be only as a last resort that a responsible employer would allow his workers to become redundant.  There have been many cases in which industries continued to operate although they were becoming non-viable as a result of carrying staff for a considerable period in the hope that conditions would improve. There have been times when Government policy in respect of tax changes, for instance, has forced industrialists <Col N="1555" /> into bankruptcy.  However, this Bill is designed to ensure that any unscrupulous or would-be unscrupulous employer would take a responsible line in regard to his employees.  It is unlikely that serious defects of the type envisaged by the Minister would arise in industries that are highly organised.</P>
    <P>The whole area of conditions of employment is one that must be updated, just as the law in other areas must be brought up to date, but this is a continuing process.  The present Minister has done a good job in this area.  He has assisted Irish workers but, as Deputy Fitzgerald said, the Minister deserves some sympathy by reason of his having to tolerate some of the conservative elements in the Government of which he is a member.  Perhaps if he had a little more power and if there were a few others in Government who showed concern for our workers, we would get more progressive legislation. It may be, on the other hand, that the Minister is being used by the Government to project an image of a Government that produce an abundance of legislation.  Legislation in large quantities is of no use unless it is of a positive and progressive nature both to the community as a whole and to the particular sections it is designed specifically to protect.  In the case of legislation of this nature regard must be had also to the industries concerned.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately much of the legislation coming before us lacks these elements.  Basically what is required is not so much to provide for situations of redundancy but to make available more jobs and in this way also to stimulate industrial development.  In order to achieve this there must be a proper financial policy and a proper outlook on the part of the Government. We must aim at reducing the length of the dole queues.  In order to make redundancies less likely we must create and stimulate employment on the broadest spectrum possible.  In many instances people are doing jobs that do not require the type of higher educational qualifications those people sometimes have.  We must endeavour to remedy this situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald quoted some <Col N="1556" /> figures which show how unemployment has increased.  He recalled that in December, 1974, the total figure of unemployed was 81,000 while today the number out of work is 110,000.  This Bill contains nothing to improve that situation.</P>
    <P>Hopefully, the Minister will convey to his colleagues the necessity and the desirability of creating more employment in order, first, to give people the opportunity of working and, secondly, to relieve the pressures on industry.  If we create the proper environment we ensure that industry is maintained. Many instances of redundancies could have been averted by appropriate Government action.  They have failed in relation to the development of our own industries.  A number of Ministers responsible for purchases of certain goods for the public service have disregarded the situation of Irish workers by allowing the commodities concerned to be purchased abroad.  An example of this was the purchase by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, on behalf of the Department of Defence, of Saville Row shoes for the Irish Naval Service at a time when our own workers were being made redundant in the shoe industry.  That is why I say that the Government have been responsible for some of the redundancies that have occurred.  We know, too, that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has had printed abroad some of the labels used in his Department.  It is sad to think that Irish workers are becoming redundant while the Government are purchasing equipment from abroad.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs purchased sports boots for the Army from Eastern European countries while Irish workers in the Cork Shoe Company and elsewhere are being made redundant or are working on short time.</P>
    <P>The Government should look at the question of purchasing Irish made goods.  Although there are many impediments because of EEC regulations, we must be loyal to our own workers and we must endeavour to ensure that we do not create redundancies by purchasing foreign made products which can be produced in Ireland.  The <Col N="1557" /> purchase of foreign made furniture for Irish Life was raised in the House by Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick of Dublin. In recent years this type of purchasing is being sanctioned more and more although more and more people are becoming redundant.  I do not blame one Government more than another, but this tendency has been more prominent in recent years.  If Government Departments purchase equipment from abroad they are contributing to the redundancies taking place.  A lot of equipment has been purchased from abroad that should and could have been made here as efficiently as in foreign countries.  In my constituency recently I had a complaint from a concern in the Ballyfermot Industrial Estate that they had tendered for fish fryers to the Department of Defence, but the equipment had been purchased from an Italian firm, although the Ballyfermot firm were as competitive. This type of thing is a desertion of the Irish workers by Government Departments and can no longer be tolerated.</P>
    <P>If the Government take the lead in relation to buying Irish other people will follow.  We have a patriotic duty to maintain employment.  I hope there will be no further redundancies as a result of Government action.  I do not blame the Minister for Labour.  The Minister's colleagues in the purchasing sections of the Government have the responsibility.  When we debated this question here in the House we did not get much satisfaction from them.  A tender price is important, but jobs for Irish workers are more important.  A tender price may be somewhat lower from a person in Taiwan, but when people become redundant we must meet social welfare payments all along the line and in the end the financial loss to the nation is greater.  A climate of common sense should prevail in relation to the purchasing of equipment by Government Departments irrespective of the EEC regulations.  The Government must take some blame for the redundancies that have taken place, and I would ask them to look at this aspect.</P>
    <P>Will there be further redundancies in the future?  Is that the reason for this Bill?  Does the Minister see a run-down <Col N="1558" /> in the larger industries here? Will there be some change in Government policy whereby we will have wholesale redundancies in the larger industries, and is this Bill an effort to arrest a situation that is going to develop? If the system that has been applied to purchasing in the past continues to apply, we will have more redundancies. The Minister should recommend that we buy Irish so as to ensure that no Irish worker becomes redundant because of Government action.</P>
    <P>Many of the workers who have become redundant probably have a grudge because of this although they will often walk into a shop and purchase an item without regard to the country or origin, thereby helping to put their fellow workers out of work. This aspect has not been dealt with effectively enough.  Far too few people are concerned about the purchase of Irish goods.  The Government should make it quite clear that Irish goods must be purchased so as to maintain employment.  Trade unions should make their members aware of the developing situation and encourage them to buy Irish so as to maintain employment.</P>
    <P>I hope that this Bill will throw more light on the redundacy problem.  Legislation of this nature is developing legislation and updating is necessary. Sometimes we tend to treat legislation such as this as suspect because when a Bill is brought in we find out at a later stage that it was brought in for a less obvious purpose than was at first thought.  In many concerns trade unions have not been as effective as they might have been and they should examine their consciences in relation to redundancies.  Trade unions and their workers have caused redundancies in one way or another, by the lack of knowledge and lack of responsibility to their fellow-workers.  Basically speaking the workers are members of trade unions and a vast number of families of Irish trade unionists purchase foreign goods on a large scale. All trade unions should ensure that their own members are advised as to the best means of reducing redundancies, not by giving a man 30 days but <Col N="1559" /> by the simple act of purchasing Irish goods which will mean the elimination of redundancy by continuity of employment. Understanding of our problem by all sections is necessary.  There are long and short term assessments of the various situations that one would have expected to have been made by the trade unions in an organised way in the larger industries, and the same should apply in the smaller ones.  We would like to eliminate redundancy and put the people where they want to to be, back to work.  This is the kernel of the problem, to put them back to work so that we will not have redundancy.</P>
    <P>It is sad to think that this year in the building and construction allocation in the capital budget there was a reduction of £18 million.  This industry is a motivating force in Irish life.  In this reduction of £18 million no allowance was made for inflation which would have made reduction in real terms approximately £40 million.  When we see an industry being starved to the extent of £40 million we can see that there are going to be further redundancies outside the building trade. That trade is the second largest employer in the country with about 45,000 persons employed.  Indirectly in the other sectors there are approximately 85,000.  If there is a slow-down in building and construction there will be redundancies among the people who produce furniture, carpets and the other things that go to make up a home because the houses, the homes and the offices will not be there as a result of this substantial reduction in the capital budget.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself is weak in many respects. Deputy G. Fitzgerald has comprehensively dealt with the various sections of the Bill and has pointed out its defects.  From that the Minister must have a fair indication of the displeasures we have voiced in relation to all the measures.  I am sad to think that the smaller industries were disregarded and that the people in them are deserted.  In many cases these people are not organised, but at the same time we speak loudly and clearly about the development of small industries. <Col N="1560" /> I hope that the Minister will change his attitude in relation to section 6 and that the 15, 12 or ten people employed in small industries will be thought of with the same consideration as the people in larger industries. I hope that any legislation we will bring out when we get back to power will be all-embracing and that what is good for one worker will be good for all workers.  No section should be singled out, certainly not those less fortunate than the people in the larger industries who are sometimes unorganised.  Remember that these small industries are operating with State grants also and that they too have responsibility.  The Minister must ensure that he does not discard any section of the community as he has done in this Bill.  I hope that he will give consideration to the industries employing 15, 12, nine or eight as the case may be because every worker is important and none should be left outside the umbrella of protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I will not delay the House very long.  I join with the speakers on this side of the House in welcoming this legislation.  This protection of employment is fundamental and desirable. How far we can achieve it is the important point.  We all realise that anyone, man or woman, has one aim in getting a job and that is continuity.  In some walks of life this is not possible. In certain categories in our society it is possible to a certain degree to forecast that you will remain in that job even to retirement if you fulfil the regulations laid down.  That section of society are fortunate and this is the type of environment and protection we desire and we are trying to obtain.  I know that it is not always possible but that is what we should aim for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any young man who embarks on marriage and is settling down and buying a home naturally makes an assessment of his expenditure on the basis of the position he has at the time.  I know of many sad cases where men, married and with a few children, purchased homes in the conviction that the jobs they had would continue but some years later those jobs folded up. <Col N="1561" /> This has happened in the broad spectrum of the private sector.  Do not think for one moment that it affects only those on the lower rung of the ladder.  People in the private sector on the higher rungs have been affected over the past three or four years.  This problem of being made redundant is widespread over the whole private sector.  The proper aim would be to try to ensure that once a person started employment he could build up on the continuity of it.  I often said that security of position and recognition of work are two factors more important than increase in pay.  If I were putting the priorities of any employee I would say that security of employment must surely be the most important and after that the proper recognition for his work.  I would put wages on a third level.  Any employee today would undoubtedly say that continuity of work is certainly the most important matter.</P>
    <P>This question of high redundancy is comparatively new.  It has been with us to a small degree all the time but we have seen massive redundancy over the past four or five years, some of it probably outside the control of the Government but a lot of it brought about by misguided policies of the present Administration.  It is all very fine to bring a Bill into this House and say that we will legislate for protection of employment but that is going only part of the way.  You cannot legislate for protection of employment if the policies are wrong.  Side by side with that Bill is needed a policy to create employment and to protect the industries that are there.  This has not been done.  This is only one leg of the whole operation, the whole broad spectrum of industrial expansion, the creation of new jobs and the strengthening of existing jobs.  We failed to take the proper economic steps and the proper fiscal measures to ensure that people would retain their jobs and that industries could expand and take on more workers.  The Protection of Employment Bill cannot work on its own without the creation of the proper environment.  This is where we have had a big problem over the past three or four years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1562" /> We will have to look seriously at the type of industries we establish.  We will have to make labour attractive to industry.  That is very important.  How do you make labour attractive to industry? Why are so many industrialists capital intensive today?  If the Government look closely at that, they will find there is a reason.  By their imposition of taxation the Government have made labour unattractive. On several occasions we said something positive should be done about the social welfare contribution.  We said it was a tax on labour but Ministers only laughed at us.</P>
    <P>Last year there was a huge increase in social welfare contributions in the budget.  This year, when we thought something positive would be done to relieve the social welfare contribution in some small measure, the Government acted in the very opposite direction. They increased the social welfare contribution and put a further tax on labour.  That is a negative approach.  Until the Government realise they are taxing workers out of jobs, we will not have a proper climate. When a proper climate is created, this Bill will not be necessary.  The fact that the Government have failed to create that climate is the kernel of our problem today.</P>
    <P>Manufacturers are moving away from labour intensive industry and into capital intensive industry.  If we allow that to continue, we will have employment for nobody.  I have seen that danger developing.  I know one company in which plant and machinery have been updated and the work force will be reduced from 4,500 to 2,500 when the company are fully automated.  Why are we not making some positive move to make labour attractive?  We want to see our people working.  I would prefer to see people working than to see a plant working. We cannot afford to have our people walking around doing nothing.</P>
    <P>Some people argue that we cannot have labour intensive industry because the costings are too high.  It is our duty to ensure that incentives are given and that there is no tax on labour.  Labour has been taxed excessively in the social welfare sector over <Col N="1563" /> the past number of years.  These are facts which will have to be looked at if we are to expand our economic base and create the number of jobs necessary. We must also have fewer redundancies. Many of the redundancies in the past four of five years have been in the labour intensive industries.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, if we are to have any concern for our young people we will have to take positive steps.  The Government must look at how they have taxed labour.  I maintain you are taxing labour indirectly when you increase social welfare contributions.  I spoke to an industrialist after the budget.  He employs 250 people.  He had been working out what his increases in telephone charges and social welfare would be. The tax on labour worked out at exactly £1 a week.  The telephone bill of the company I am speaking about was £20,000 last year.  It is very easy to work out what the increase of 25 per cent imposed by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will be.  The Government do not appear to realise the consequences of their actions.  This man will have to pay an extra £14,000 because of those increases.  That is not the way to expand.  That is not the way to create jobs.</P>
    <P>I welcomed the employment premium scheme but it has not gone far enough.  What the Government gave to this man they took away in the increased social welfare contribution and the increased telephone and postage charges.  He is back to square one. That is juggling around with figures. There is no positive approach as to how we should tackle our unemployment problem, and that is what we are talking about here.  Unless we have a proper economic policy and a proper fiscal policy we are wasting our time. We have been waiting for four years, four years of inaction.  Our young people are frustrated.  They see no future for themselves.  Teachers are explaining to boys and girls leaving school the problems they will encounter. Young people are asking what economic plans we have in the service industry.</P>
    <P>If there is one thing this Government <Col N="1564" /> have done, it is that they have brought in unnecessary legislation.  We have seen unnecessary sections in Bills taking away the rights of private citizens.  We saw that in the Finance Bills and we see it here again.  Section 17 deals with provisions relating to authorised officers.  In various Finance Bills that authority was given.  I objected to it then and I object to it now in this Bill.  I can see no indication that people cannot go into private houses.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides that an authorised officer may enter at all reasonable times any premises or place where he has reasonable grounds for supposing that any employee is employed and there make any examination or inquiry necessary for ascertaining whether this Act has been or is being complied with.  Does that include the private sector?  If it does, it goes too far.  I do not know who the Minister would authorise to do this work.  If my memory serves me correctly, it is not the Minister who authorises in the Finance Bill.  I think it is the Revenue Commissioners.  This should not be a function of the Minister's.  That type of infringement on private rights is a fundamental issue.  We must always protect such rights in this House.  They have been eroded in all types of Bills. I hope that our spokesman, Deputy Fitzgerald, will have a serious look at this section so as to ensure that it is modified considerably.</P>
    <P>This is an important Bill but it will not solve our problems.  If they could be solved by a Protection of Employment Bill, they would be very small.  Far from it; we are now at the stage when many of our industries are very much run down.  We know that 80 per cent of them are not at full capacity.  Many of them, if they were ruthless, might have let more good people go.  I believe that when expansion comes there will not be a great increase in employment. Unless the new employment premium scheme is of some help, as I hope it will, it is difficult to see how the huge number of unemployed will be reduced.  We have lost four years.  When we entered Europe in 1973 we should have drawn up plans to meet the challenge of the <Col N="1565" /> expanding Community and the 300,000,000 people available to buy our products.  Instead, we did nothing and hence we have these consequences for our economy with thousands of school leavers with no hope of jobs. It will take many years to recover from that situation.  Unfortunately, the capital that should have been used to expand the economy at that time has been squandered recklessly and today we are servicing a national debt at a cost of practically £450 million.  If only £100 million of that was put into industry, it would go a long way towards solving our unemployment problems.</P>
    <P>These are the matters to which we should direct attention.  While I welcome the Bill, there is nothing so pathetic in my opinion as to see a man aged 35-45 with a wife and young children, owing a huge overdraft on a house, being told by his employer that he has become redundant.  That is a situation you can find in the country;  I have met a few of them in the past year or two.  Such a man will find that very few employers are anxious to take on people aged 40 or more.  The greatest culprits in this respect for years past are local authorities.  They expect the private sector to do its duty and quite often have regulations themselves prohibiting employment in that class.  This matter should be examined when people are made redundant at that age because they are finding it more difficult to get work.  Human nature being what it is, an employer will probably opt for a man 20 years younger.  Therefore, I think the people I have mentioned deserve special consideration. It is sad to think that there is no room in our employment schemes for a man of 45 years of age today.  I should like the Minister's Department and the Department of Social Welfare to give special attention to this category.</P>
    <P>In welcoming the Bill I hope it will contribute to the purposes for which it is introduced but I should like to see it complemented by another measure that would create far more jobs and there would not be so much need then for this Bill.</P>

      <P>I agree with much <Col N="1566" /> of the thoughtful contribution of Deputy Fitzpatrick on the need for a general improvement in the economic situation.  This legislation, ideally, would be most effective in an improving economic situation where job opportunities would be expanding. That is true.  That would be the best situation in which to have this legislation operating.  In answering some of the points made in the debate it is only fair to point out that we are seeing and we have seen an improvement in the economy.  There has been a very definite improving trend in employment in the past six months.</P>

      <P>The budget provisions lay a solid foundation in support of recovery tendencies already present. Returning to the Bill, I shall just refer to some of the major points made in the debate: I presume we will come back to them on Committee Stage.  I think Deputy Fitzgerald was concerned that small firms might not have the expertise necessary to cope generally with the impact of this legislation.  The Bill does not cover what would be the general run of small firms in the Irish situation.  The figures fixed in the section concerned mean that the Bill deals with the minimum of five dismissals in firms employing between 20 and 50 persons.  These figures which would operate when the Bill comes into effect will mean that a great number of smaller firms will not be affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to section 7 (3) it was stated that the Act would not apply to <Col N="1567" /> classes of employees specified in the order and from the commencement of the order the Act would not apply to that class.  An explanation was sought for the provision.  That provision is already in operation in section 4(4) of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967. It has never been availed of in relation to that Act and the only reason it is here is that if any question should arise in regard to the interpretation of Article 1.2 of the EEC Directive which exempts certain classes of employees from its provisions, it is necessary to have this section here.  It must not be forgotten in regard to this exemption section that under section 4 of the Bill any order proposed to be made must have the approval of both Houses.</P>
    <P>Section 17 was criticised just now by Deputy Dowling and by Deputy Fitzpatrick in relation to the powers of authorised officers.  We must have provision of this kind if we are to combat the kind of evasion which Deputies would be concerned to prevent.  We need to give to the officers the powers provided for here.  The Deputies have noted that similar provisions are made in other protective legislation, in the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1961 and again in 1973.  It is a routine section for legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to section 21 in relation to offences by directors of corporate bodies.  It should be pointed out, if I did not already mention it in my speech on Second Stage, that this relates solely to directors and other officers of such bodies.  That provision appears in the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967.  There is a similar provision contained in the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1961 and it would be appreciated that there is nothing novel or extraordinary sought here.  In fact, this provision merely places responsibility at what I would deem to be the proper and effective level in such organisations.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the 30 days' period of notice prescribed in the Bill and the question was raised as to the operative start of this 30 day period. This period of notice commences on the day when the employer notifies me under section 11 of his intention to create collective redundancies.  The <Col N="1568" /> redundancies must not be effected for at least 30 days in accordance with the provisions of section 14.  If any of the employees about to be made redundant have individual rights under other legislation, let us say under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, then those individual rights must be given in full to the person concerned.</P>

      <P>A question was raised about the explanation of the provision for the introduction of the Bill by ministerial order.

      <P>Not really, because the legislation is in process.  Of course, the Deputy is right in that we cannot delay interminably over this; we must proceed with some speed. There is no danger that we will find ourselves in breach of any EEC commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that Deputies opposite are anxious to ensure that this legislation goes into operation as quickly as possible.  Most good employers accept <Col N="1569" /> the advisability of consultation on impending redundancy.  It is simply a human and decent response to a situation which in some instances may be inevitable.  The obligation here simply puts into statute form what is already accepted in the majority of cases in industry.  It is necessary to have this period of consultation and it also gives the opportunity to the National Manpower Service to make preparations for alternative jobs where this is the only option.  It also creates the possibility of further revision of a management decision, the possibility of consultation with trade unions and, perhaps, the scaling down of the original number of people to be affected.  This is very difficult and we cannot say that this is the answer to the question.  I fully appreciate the necessity of explaining fully what the provisions of any new legislation amount to and this is a point which I know that Deputies have often referred to.  I would hope to have adequate explanatory material circularised among employers and trade unions letting them know the new statutory position.  It would be manifestly unfair to implement new legislation without such explanation.  I now conclude my remarks and we can discuss the Bill further on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office take great care to stick as closely as they can to the sense of the Deputy's question.  They will not depart from it if they can avoid it.  The Deputy did not ask how many belonging to those industries were registered.  He asked how many were unemployed who would be suitable for work in the construction and related industries.  He introduced the notion of suitability which is a different category.  I agree this might be called a quibble in ordinary speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann <Col N="1572" /> Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>The Government made an order on 22nd December, 1976, extending the exclusive fishery limits of the State to 200 miles.  In places where our limits meet similar British limits the limits have been fixed as a line being basically an equidistance line measured from the low water mark of the two coasts, account being taken only of larger islands within three miles of the mainland.</P>
      <P>In the same circumstances the British have set their limits at a line which is equidistant from the nearest points on the baselines of the two countries.  The recent British Act claims a 200-mile fishery zone around Rockall. This means an overlap of jurisdictions. To date there has been no communication with the British Government, but the British Government are well aware of the views of the Government on the question of Rockall and claims by the British Government to make or enforce any prohibition on fishing in the seas around Rockall have been rejected by the Government in the past.</P>
      <P>A protest is in preparation to the British Government at their action. which is not, in the Government's view, consistent with the applicable principles of international law.  It is hoped, nevertheless, that this matter will be resolved without undue delay and that a mutually acceptable dividing line will be determined either by agreement or by a settlement of disputes procedure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>My question has at least aroused the Government to issue a protest.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary accept that the designation to which I referred took place almost two months ago?  Can he confirm that the arbitration to which he referred yesterday will deal with all issues in relation to what one might call the Rockall question, first the Continental Shelf and, second, the economic zone which extends from Rockall and which will include fisheries and exploration, so that all outstanding issues between the two Governments, whether or not they are based on any title, national or otherwise, to Rockall will be resolved in this arbitration?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope they will.  I share the Deputy's concern about this.  However, I cannot give that undertaking because we have not yet seen the terms of the British consent, which will be received, I am told, before the end of the week.  It may be that the British may specifically wish to exclude certain matters from the terms of their consent.  If that is the case, I will immediately tell the House about it.  It may also be&mdash;and this is not excluded &mdash;that the matter will be settled in the course of arbitration without specific settlement of the issues of principle involved.  That is also possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may summarise, if Rockall can generate its own economic zone, then you are talking in terms of 200 miles fishery and exploration rights out of Rockall.  Then you have the Continental Shelf which derived from the Geneva Convention. That also is an issue between us, but they are both related issues.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary will recognise that we at least must insist that all these issues will be arbitrated on. Otherwise we will be only dealing with a fraction of the case, and whether Britain is agreeable or not, it would seem only logical that all the issues be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are well aware of the importance of both the fisheries and the Continental Shelf issues.  The arbitration I referred to yesterday refers only to the Continental Shelf.  It is true that, if it is pursued to the point where issues of legal principle have to be determined, the determination will equally govern the questions between us on fisheries.</P>
      <P>The Deputy must understand that we cannot insist on the arbitration being of this or that kind.  We have no compulsory arbitration machinery in force on this issue with the British.  We are dependent, if we are to have an arbitration, on their agreeing to submit the dispute to arbitration along with us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1574" /> The Deputy will also appreciate that there is a curious conflict between our interests in connection with fisheries on the one hand and the Continental Shelf on the other.  If we succeed in establishing that Rockall cannot generate an economic zone of its own, it will suit us so far as the Continental Shelf is concerned, but it will have the automatic concomitant result of depriving the whole community of fishing water which it would otherwise have because of its claims on being able to share British waters.  It will not prevent us making the best case we can on either front but I draw the Deputy's attention to that fact and also the attention of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary at least clarify that there are two separate but related issues?  He has told us that the arbitration relates only to Rockall.  Surely it is absolutely essential that the other issues be clarified at the same time? I want to ask the Government&mdash;apparently they have not made this formal request&mdash;formally to request that the fisheries and the exploration rights within the national 200-mile economic zone of Rockall be included.  If the Government do not ask they cannot complain that the British Government have not responded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The negotiations which have been going on with the British at official level through a long series of meetings culminating in our request, made last April, for arbitration, to which a reply is only now coming in, dealt with the Continental Shelf only.  The Continental Shelf division to the north-west in the Rockall area but also the division of the Continental Shelf to the south-east and issues in connection with islands&mdash;not quite such extreme issues&mdash;arise thereto.  We have not got an outstanding dispute specifically with the British except in so far as Rockall is relevant.  If the question of Rockall is settled by arbitration through an enunciation of a principle which deprives Rockall of status that will automatically clear the fishing issue as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>In reply to a question on 27th January, 1977 I gave details of the present position in relation to fishing by third countries and other EEC member States in the Irish 200-mile fishery zone.  The only third countries in respect of which a precise number of boats to be controlled by the issue of licences, as decided by the Council of Ministers of the European Communities are the Soviet Union, Poland and the German Democratic Republic.  Agreement on a Council regulation on the detailed conditions to apply to fishing vessels of these countries in the extended fishing waters of the Community member states in the interim period ending 31st March, 1977 was reached on 28th January, 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulation is concerned with the detailed application of the decision taken before the end of 1976 on the greatly reduced quotas which would apply to these countries.  In the case of Ireland's 200-mile zone these quotas are only for mackrel and horse mackrel and they can be fished only in certain sea areas, all of which are <Col N="1578" /> more than 50 miles from the Irish coast.</P>
    <P>The three countries concerned were notified by the country at present holding the presidency of the Council of Ministers, that is to say Britain, of the detailed conditions which will apply.  Only vessels in respect of which licences have been issued will be permitted to fish in Community waters.  They will be strictly limited in numbers.</P>
    <P>The number of licences which may be issued for fishing vessels of between 2,000 and 3,500 gross registered tons will be limited to five for Poland, six for the German Democratic Republic and 27 for the Soviet Union.  The maximum number of vessels of between 2,000 and 3,500 gross registered tons permitted to fish at the same time in Community waters is five for Poland, five for the German Democratic Republic and 17 for the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>Should vessels of a tonnage less than 2,000 GRT be used, the number of licences and the maximum number of vessels permitted to fish at the same time will be calculated according to the following conversion rates:</P>

      <P>The recent restructuring of the services of the Commission, in so far as it involved Irish citizens, was the subject of the usual contacts between the Commission and the Government.

      <P>However, I should point out that although there is no system of national quotas the first paragraph of article 27 of the staff regulations does provide that officials shall be &ldquo;recruited on the broadest possible geographical basis from among nationals of member states of the Communities&rdquo;.

      <P>I am generally informed about the position of Irish citizens serving sentences in British jails and am satisfied that in the vast majority of cases there are no significent problems. In the cases of some persons sentenced for terrorist offences in Britain in recent years, there have been allegations of maltreatment of which I am aware and which are being examined in detail.  Aspects of the treatment of 41 prisoners, including 11 in prisons in the Isle of Wight, have been discussed with the British authorities <Col N="1583" /> since August, 1974.

      <P>It is useful to know that the Minister has been in contact, but how long will this contact go on? Has there been any real bite in the investigation or in the knowledge that the Minister may have?  Is the Minister aware of what is more than an allegation&mdash;it is factual&mdash;that there are prisoners in the Isle of Wight now recovering in solitary confinement from broken limbs, multiple breaks, and that there is information, which is available to the Minister, that solitary confinement is being enforced in the Isle of Wight in the case of Irish citizens and that this means at least not only solitary confinement but prisoners being without clothes or bedding and living like half animals? Of course that always has been the attitude of the British.  I ask the Minister urgently to follow up the contracts he has and not allow himself to be led up the garden path or to be delayed so long that the ills and sores of these much abused prisoners will have been healed up beyond recognition before he can take action about this.

      <P>The Minister is aware of inconvenience caused to the travelling public at cross-Border <Col N="1584" /> security checkpoints generally and particularly at Aughnacloy. However, checkpoints are necessary for security purposes and as long as the present situation continues, some measure of inconvenience will be inevitable.  The Minister has received representations about delays at Aughnacloy and in discussions with the British authorities has sought to have these minimised to a degree consistent with the security consideration involved.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will proceed by way of supplementary questions, but when I get a ministerial reply saying that the Minister has no information, knowing that at least he has the information from me and that it is on the records of the House, surely it is in order to point out to him that such complaints exist.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the necessity for the Aughnacloy, Strabane and Culmore checkpoints is not obvious?  Why is it that they are not on the Belfast-Dublin road?  They do not exist on the Belfast-Dublin road as a permanent operation like the Berlin Wall, but we have that at Aughnacloy.  I asked the Minister whether these permanent checkpoints are on every approach in and out of the Six Counties.  If they were, then his information would have a logical base&mdash;it could be said they are needed from the security point of view&mdash;but is he not aware that they <Col N="1585" /> exist only at these particular points as a regular built-up feature&mdash;there has been an amazing building up&mdash;and since that is so is the Minister not satisfied that the attitude of the British authorities, with whom he has been in contact, to these delays at checkpoints is totally spurious?  If there is no need for them on the Belfast-Dublin road, why are they at Aughnacloy, Strabane and Culmore, other than to harass the people of Donegal, Derry and Tyrone who must, of necessity, go through them in both directions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, I am not in any way responsible nor can I speak for what the British do but I presume that the different arrangements about checkpoints, the way they have been set up and their operation, are dictated by security considerations which appear relevant to the British, but in so far as the evidence of harassment is concerned, on the last occasion when the Deputy asked about it, on 26th May last, the Minister replied as follows, in No. 2 of Volume 291 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>Frankly, I am not aware of the problems at Strabane and Culmore. Nothing about problems at these points has been drawn to my attention. I note what the Deputy says and I would be happy to have any concrete information from him about problems there so that I could take whatever action might be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He went on to admit that there was a serious problem at Aughnacloy but my information today is that no concreate information has been received since about these places either from the Deputy or anybody else.  Until we have something concrete to go on, documented and backed up by identifiable persons' statements, that we can send to the British in the form of a complaint, there is no sense in sending them a rhetorical letter stating that we think these checkpoints are not being conducted properly.  If the Deputy has information of his own or if he has friends with information they are willing to give us, and if they do not <Col N="1586" /> mind their names being identified, we will do what is appropriate.  I give the Deputy that definite undertaking.</P>

      <P>On this matter of selective harassment, or harassment generally, which it is, what does the Minister expect me to do?  I have bloody well more to do than to do the watchdog for the Minister.  I have brought it to his attention here.  Surely he has available to him within his Department and within the State services the opportunities and the personnel to check out what I have been saying?  I ask the Minister, and the Parliamentary Secretary who is substituting for him, to bear this in mind.</P>

      <P>I would have thought it was supremely something which the Deputy might have done for his constituents who were being inconvenienced, something that would not take second place to any of his other jobs. I have been trying to tell him that until the Government receive documented allegations, which I can assure him will be taken seriously and followed up, there is nothing we can do. I do not accept it is the Government's job to maintain a continuous surveillance of British arrangements, in case something may be wrong.  It is the Government's job to follow up complaints which reach us, properly documented.</P>

About other matters, yes, but we have not got complaints about these two checkpoints.  I can do no more than to give the Deputy and the House an undertaking that if we receive responsible identifiable complaints about the way the British are behaving at these checkpoints, we will follow them up.  Unless we get such complaints there is nothing we can do.</P>

The provision in the current year's Estimates will enable payment of the grant towards the operating costs of national schools to be made on the basis of the rates which applied in 1976.  The introduction of the new scheme of capitation grants in 1975 involved a trebling of the amount of State aid formerly available for this purpose and, accordingly, it is considered that the current rates of grant are reasonably adequate in the context of the prevailing financial circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware of the urgency of this matter in that the building of the new regional hospital in Cork is expected to be completed in 1978?  If that happens it will mean that the work force and the scaffolding will be withdrawn from the site and will have to be returned there when the regional hospital is in operation in order to build the new dental hospital.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary know that the old building presently used for a dental school and hospital is in a deplorable state and that it would cost £50,000 to put it in a suitable condition? Having regard to these facts will the Parliamentary Secretary state when the Government will make a decision about when the contract may be offered for tender as all the preliminary work has been done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the question of spending £50,000 on the existing building or any other figure which the Deputy may have in mind, arises in view of the decision which has been <Col N="1598" /> taken.  So far as the time scale for the other buildings is concerned I cannot comment on the termination date and its relevance to this situation. Obviously this is a major project involving a substantial expenditure of capital resources and, in view of the availability of such resources, I am not in a position to say when the work will commence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the Parliamentary Secretary is not aware of the urgency of the matter.  The old building cannot be inhabited for much longer as the rain is coming through the roof.  That will mean the closing down of the dental school.  If it is not the aim of the Government to close down the Cork dental school, a decision should be made on a matter that has been under consideration for at least four years.  All the preliminary work has been completed and it only remains for the contract to be offered for tender.  The money would not be expended in the first year.  Only a certain amount would be spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that the Minister is most anxious that this work should commence at the earliest possible date.  He is making every effort to ensure that this happens.  However, as I have pointed out, it must be considered in the light of the overall availability of capital resources for education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to impress on the Minister the urgency of coming to a decision before the work force is taken from the main site.  When the new regional hospital, which cost £8 million to £10 million, is in operation there will be a disruption of services when the new building is being erected on the adjoining site.  I would also ask the Parliamentary Secretary to impress on the Minister the tremendous urgency that exists for providing proper facilities for a dental school and hospital in Cork.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The preparation of athletes and teams for international competition is a matter for the national governing <Col N="1601" /> body of the sport concerned in association with the Olympic Council of Ireland, where appropriate.  It would not be my policy to interfere with their arrangement.</P>
    <P>My Department's scheme of grants to sporting organisations is intended to assist generally in the areas of coaching, equipment and administration. Subject to prior approval, some of the grant may be spent on international competition for top-class athletes or teams where the objective would be an improvement of standards.  In addition, substantial grants are paid to the Olympic Council of Ireland to help in the development of athletes and teams by special training and by participation in events held overseas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary stated that substantial grants were paid to the Olympic Council of Ireland.  Will he tell the House how substantial were those grants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The grant made available in 1976 to the Olympic Council of Ireland was £40,000.  This was four times the amount made available in 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary agree that the performance of our athletes in the last Olympic Games was, to say the least, not good? Further, will he tell the House the cause of this, arising out of his experience in dealing with youth and sporting organisations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first part of this question the Deputy asked me if I so agreed.  I do not agree with him that the performance of Irish athletes in the Olympics was not good.  We achieved better results in the last Olympics than had been the case in most previous Olympics since 1956.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been continuing discussion in relation to the policy to be adopted with regard to sport.  This has had some practical results already and a number of other matters are being considered.  Among the results already evident are the quadruling of the grant to the Irish Olympic Council and the fact that grants to sporting organisations have been increased by 150 per cent since 1973. In addition, provision is being made for the expenditure by the Department of £80,000, which is half the total cost of providing a tartan track for the first time in the Twenty-six Counties.  This is recognised as essential for international level competition in athletics. A number of other matters have been brought forward including much more extensive exchanges with other countries in the area of coaching, particularly with France.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if, in view of the reported robbery of files from the office of the Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty and the possibility that confidential information may be leaked, he will make a statement on the overall implications of the present dispute affecting the work of the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey) Frank Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the acting director of the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty, Mr. Hynes, that on Monday evening last he became aware that files were missing from the committee's offices. These files had been in the custody of and appertained to the work of Mr. Malcolm Bryan, whose employment as director was terminated last week by the committee in accordance with the terms of his contract.  The acting director immediately, by registered letter, wrote to Mr. Bryan, inquiring if he had any knowledge regarding the removal of the files from the premises, and later on the same evening, Monday, verbally inquired of Mr. Bryan if he had any knowledge of the whereabouts of the missing files.  Mr. Bryan denied that he knew the whereabouts of the files or that he had removed them from the office.  The matter of the missing files was again raised verbally by the acting director, Mr. Hynes, with Mr. Bryan on Tuesday morning and he again denied that he had taken the files or had any knowledge of their whereabouts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House may be aware, entry by unauthorised persons into the <Col N="1606" /> premises of the committee occurred sometime between the night of Monday, 14th February, and Tuesday morning, 15th February.  Acts of vandalism took place, resulting in considerable damage.  The acting director, Mr. Hynes, informed the Garda on Tuesday of the unauthorised entry, of the vandalism and of the fact that files were missing.  I am not aware whether in the course of this unauthorised entry other documents may have been removed from the premises but all the foregoing is the subject of continuing police investigations.</P>
    <P>In relation to the files which were discovered to be missing on Monday, I was informed at approximately 1.15 p.m. today by the acting director, Mr. Hynes, that he had received a phone call from Mr. Bryan at approximately 12.15 p.m. today to the effect that the files had been located and were being returned to the committee's offices.  At approximately 1 o'clock today the files were returned by another member of the staff who, on being asked by Mr. Hynes where they had been located, replied that he would sooner not say.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I am not in a position to give an assurance to the House that copies of these files, which were missing from sometime on Monday until 1 o'clock today, were not made.  Nor can I say to what use they may have been put, or if, in fact, all the files have been returned, but I expect that these matters will be part of the continuing police investigation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the overall implications of the present dispute affecting the work of the committee, as the House may be aware a ballot of members of the staff was conducted yesterday.  The committee have not as yet been officially informed by the trade union representing the staff as to the outcome or implications of any decisions that may have been made.</P>
    <P>I am keeping myself fully informed of developments and, while I have total and unreserved confidence in the committee and its chairperson, Rev. <Col N="1607" /> Sr. Stanislaus, I regret that it is not possible for me in this developing situation to give any assurance regarding the future of the pilot projects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for the extensive reply he has given the House and for the forthcoming manner in which he has met my question.  There are a number of matters which arise from the reply.  It has been suggested that, if the staff go on strike, the programme in its present form will be closed down. In relation to Mr. Bryan's dismissal, I understand that that decision was taken by the staff of the executive committee and the committee itself. Will the Parliamentary Secretary tell the House whether he approved the appointment of Mr. Bryan and whether he approved his dismissal?  I should like to have these matters clarified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I took no part in the employment of any member of the staff, including Mr. Bryan.  I set up the committee.  I had confidence in the committee.  The recruitment of staff was included in their terms of reference. I did not meet Mr. Bryan until his appointment had been made.  I was aware of the developing situation which led to the committee terminating Mr. Bryan's appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Parliamentary Secretary approve of the termination?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is implicit in the statement that I made, that I have full and total confidence in the committee and its chairperson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>By implication, the Parliamentary Secretary approves of his dismissal.  The Parliamentary Secretary recently stated that he did not intend interfering, or that he intended adopting a position of non-interference in this dispute.  If the present difficulties continue and if the poverty programme is in jeopardy, surely the Parliamentary Secretary would have an obligation in those circumstances to take some initiative?  I understand <Col N="1608" /> the sensitivity of the situation.  Nevertheless, the concern of this House would be for the continuation of the six pilot projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to correct the first part of the Deputy's statement.  I did not say that I did not intend interfering.  I stated that I did not intend intervening at that point. As the Deputy may be aware, and as I replied to the original question, the matter has been the subject of a ballot by the staff.  The staff are members of a union.  I would consider it appropriate that any dispute which may arise would be the subject of discussions between the committee or their representatives and the appropriate trade union.</P>
      <P>With regard to the future of the project and of the pilot schemes, I could not sufficiently express my admiration and appreciation of both the quality and amount of work done and the time that has been devoted to these schemes by the present committee and the chairperson.  I do not think Deputies would for one moment question either the individual or collective commitment of this committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may have overlooked a supplementary question I asked in relation to the staff going on strike.  As I say, it has been suggested that if the staff go on strike the programme in its present form will not be continued. That would be the first part of the question.  The second part is, if the Parliamentary Secretary considers it his function and duty to intervene&mdash;and I apologise for the use of the word &ldquo;interfere&rdquo;&mdash;then in those circumstances will the Parliamentary Secretary tell the House that he will ensure that the programme will continue in its present form?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my original reply, the matter has been the subject of a ballot.  We have had no official communication from the union and it is not possible for me to deal with what is, at the moment anyway, a hypothetical situation.  Naturally, as I also said, I will keep myself fully informed of the developing situation and will have to make any judgment in <Col N="1609" /> relation to the future of the scheme in the context of the situation at the time of decision-making.  It is not possible to project what the decision would be in the future because it is not possible at this stage to see precisely how the situation will develop.  I appreciate and share the Deputy's concern for the future development of the schemes. They are extremely important, and I would hope a situation would not arise that would make it impossible to continue with this project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>One appreciates that the Parliamentary Secretary would not concern himself with individuals to be selected for appointment to the staff for this project, but does he have any control over the total level of staff employed? I think he will agree it came as a surprise to many to learn there is a staff of 40 employed by this committee. Furthermore, in view of the apparent disagreement that has arisen as to the nature and the work of the project, would he consider at an early date making a statement to the House about the project in general, about the objectives and the progress achieved to date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the Deputy's question, recruitment, interviewing and appointment of staff were matters for the committee in which I played no part whatsoever. Naturally the committee, before appointing staff, had to get sanction through me from the Department of Finance as to the remunerations and also the number of staff that were employed. As regards the stated objectives of the committee I have not got them here with me, but they were very clearly set out by the committee before any recruitment of staff took place. I can forward to the Deputy a copy of that statement.  I am satisfied, although only a short period has elapsed since the projects went into the field, that there is no departure on behalf of the committee from their stated aims and objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is reasuring to know that a bureaucracy has not been created unnecessarily in this field and that the numbers of staff are controlled by the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="1610" /> and the Department of Finance ultimately.  I was not so much concerned in my supplementary with the objectives, but would the Parliamentary Secretary not avail of some early opportunity to make a statement to the House&mdash;I think there is widespread interest in this project&mdash;so that the House would be informed what progress is being made towards the objectives and would have the Parliamentary Secretary's opinion about such progress, and also, if there was a dispute about methodology and so on, the House would be aware of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

      <P>As I said earlier, the objectives are very clearly set out in the initial statement of the committee. When the Deputy asks for my opinion on what progress has been made, I think that also is implicit in my statement, that I have total and unreserved confidence in the committee, in their dedication towards their stated aims. A reasonable amount of progress has been made in this regard.  From the very outset it was clearly pointed out that this was not a short-term project, that it would be an on-going project, that certain information that would be helpful in formulating policy in regard to the elimination of poverty would come up during the course of the project, but that the overall assessment could only be made over an extended period.  That is the view taken not only here but by the Council of Ministers when they adopted the scheme on a community basis.</P>

    <Title>Bula Limited (Acquisition of Shares) Bill, 1977: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>SECTION 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 2, after line 28, to add a subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) The sum referred to in subsection (1) of this section shall not be paid until a motion to that effect shall have been passed by Dáil Éireann, which said motion shall not be moved until after the Agreement shall have been laid on the table of each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The agreement, of course, is defined in section 1 as being the agreement of 12th December, 1975, which is the written version of an agreement which was apparently verbally come to earlier by the Minister with the shareholders in Bula Ltd. who are to be paid in respect of this deal.</P>
      <P>The House last night declined to change the consideration figure of £9,540,000 which is to be paid to the vendors, not, I want to emphasise again, to be invested in the company but to be paid personally to the vendors without any reference to the company.  The Bill contains six references, in a very short space, a little over a page, to this agreement.  This section, in fact, contains two.  In subsection (1) it says:</P>
      <P>The Minister may acquire shares of the Company in accordance with the Agreement...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not simply the buying of shares and that is the end of it.  The Minister may only buy the shares in accordance with the terms of the agreement.  We in this House do not know&mdash;and I cannot repeat this often enough&mdash;what the terms of the agreement are.  We do not know what way he is buying them in accordance with the agreement.  We have established a couple of points. We have established, for example, the very important point&mdash;the Minister did <Col N="1612" /> not tell us; I told the House and the Minister afterwards confirmed it was right&mdash;that the shares do not rank <i>pari passú.</i>  It is highly damaging to the position of the State and of the taxpayers that this is what is meant by the phrase &ldquo;in accordance with the Agreement&rdquo;.  We are entitled to ask how many more such provisions are in the agreement that render unattractive from the point of view of the tax-payers, the purchase of shares from private shareholders.  The Minister, by reason of his incredible and unsustainable secrecy, is responsible for the public speculating in this way.  This secrecy is not for the purpose of any commercial consideration but in order to avoid the disclosure of matters that would be damaging from the Minister's point of view and to avoid the revelation that this deal which, on the face of it, is a bad one, is even worse than it appears.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to have the money held up, or not paid, notwithstanding the passage of the Bill, until a motion to release it is passed by the House.  What we are seeking is not an uncommon provision.  It is merely requesting the passing of a motion by Dáil Éireann for the purpose of allowing moneys to be paid.</P>
    <P>Apart from seeking to provide for a motion of this kind, another purpose of the amendment is to give the Minister an opportunity to mend his hand in this regard in that, if, as it appears, he is not prepared to produce the agreement now&mdash;I suggest that this is the right time to produce it&mdash;at least when the Bill is passed, if it ever becomes law, and there is some doubt in this regard, taking into account the provision of Article 13 of the Constitution, the agreement would be made available to the House.  Consequently, at that stage and for the first time, the House will have an opportunity of assessing whether the payment should be made.  The Minister suggested that in some way this company would be damaged commercially should the terms of the agreement be disclosed.  In view of his stance on this issue, I should like to make a fair analogy and to ask the House to assume that Bula Ltd were a public body, rather than a <Col N="1613" /> private body, offering 192,000 shares to the public for subscription.  In general terms, I wish to enumerate the sort of prospectus which, under the rules of the Stock Exchange, and the rules of our Stock Exchange are less strict in this regard than are those of many other Stock exchanges, the company would have to publish and make available to any member of the public who was interested or who, potentially, would take up shares in the company.</P>
    <P>There are a number of headings which normally would appear in a prospectus of that kind.  I shall not go through what would be the equivalent of a full prospectus but shall concentrate on a few basic provisions.  Normally, the first heading in a prospectus offering shares would be one which would read: offer for sale of shares. In this regard we would have to reword that in respect of the case we are talking of to make it read something on the lines of &ldquo;we demand that you buy 192,000 shares, being part of 1,000,000 shares issued to the vendors and issued for a consideration other than cash.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The second heading in a prospectus of this kind&mdash;I contend that the analogy is valid since the public are being asked to take up these shares&mdash;would be a statement by the directors of the company of their past trading profits and the dividends paid.  Normally, this would cover the last five years of the company's trading history and would have to be certified not only by their own auditors but also by independent accountants appointed by the bankers who were underwriting or supervising the offer.  Unless that could be done the rules of the Stock Exchange, in this or in any other civilised country, would not allow shares to be offered because the view would be taken that this was one of the issues on which prospective purchasers of shares would need to have information.</P>
    <P>Obviously, in the case in point there is no history of profit and there are no underwriters except, in effect, the taxpayers because the deal amounts to an issue of shares to each of 3.1 million people.  There are no independent accountants reporting to the <Col N="1614" /> public on the accounts and there is no dividend history.  Therefore, because these provisions, among others, have not been complied with, there could be no question, under the terms of the Stock Exchange, of an issue of shares to the public.</P>
    <P>The third heading that one would see normally in the prospectus of a company issuing shares to the public would be one on such lines as application of the proceeds of the issue or of the sale of shares.  Normally, this would indicate the use which a company whose shares were being offered, proposed for the moneys subscribed. In the case we are talking of the company receive no money because all the moneys are going to the shareholders. Consequently, even if they were in a position to do so, and I doubt that they are, they could not inform the public as to the use to which the money would be put.  They would be private shareholders who would be getting the money but even if this were not so the paucity of information we have in regard to the company's capitalisation plans or their production plans, all caused by the doubtful situation in relation to planning permission, would render it impossible for the company to comply with that provision.</P>
    <P>The fourth heading would be a director's statement as to the essential capital requirements of the company, both in the short term and in the long term.  This is the statement generally which certifies that the company have adequate resources for their foreseeable needs.  It is a requirement of the Stock Exchange that the directors would certify that statement.  In this case the directors say they will need about £25 million, perhaps more, but they do not say how, or on what terms they will raise the money.  Neither do they tell us what are to be the duration periods of the loans or on what security the capital is to be raised.</P>
    <P>The ordinary company trying to raise money from the public would immediately be knocked if they could not fulfil that condition or if the directors were not in a position to fulfil the condition as they are not in this case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1615" /> The Minister has been asked time and time again for this information and has refused to give it.  The Minister has refused because he cannot say and does not want to speculate in that regard.</P>
    <P>The fifth heading would be the details of the directors and their beneficial shareholders in a normal prospectus.  This would normally indicate the experience of the directors in the relevant business, in this case the mining business.  It would indicate the duration of that experience and their shareholding in the company.  In this case the position would be that the prospectus would have to say that the directors have no previous experience in the mining business.  So far as I know, that is the case and it has not been suggested by the Minister that they have previous experience.  I must emphasise that I am not trying to criticise Bula or its directors but in considering the company I must relate the facts.  If these are painful or hurtful to the company, I am sorry.  We have no information as to the beneficial interest in the company of the directors. On the face of it, this may appear to be surprising, but it is not, because apart from the Wright shareholding which we know of, all the other shares, apart from the Minister's proposed shares, are held by a private unlimited company called Bula Holdings.  The shareholders of Bula Holdings are not disclosed in the company's office file in relation to Bula Holdings.  I am not being critical of that fact.  There is no obligation under the Companies Act, 1963 to disclose the membership of a private unlimited company.  We are left in the position that 80 per cent of the holdings of Bula Ltd. as things stand now are in the name of a private unlimited company and we do not have the beneficial ownership of the shares in that.  Because of that, if this were a normal public issue subject to the normal rules, it would fall down.</P>
    <P>The next heading that one would expect to see in a prospectus for a normal public company would be on the lines of a profit and dividend forecast of the directors.  Normally, this is regarded as a test of the ability and <Col N="1616" /> credibility of the directors and the management of the company.  We have asked time and again for this in respect of this company and in respect of what the Minister proposes to do.  We have got no profit forecast, and no dividend forecast, either the amount or the likely time when it might be paid.  On the evidence it would appear that at least eight years will have to elapse from the date of the start-up of the company before any dividend on earnings that would be attributable to, or available for distribution to the ordinary shareholders would arise.  Even on the most optimistic basis, start-up production could not be earlier than about two years from now.  One must bear in mind that the planning application is in every sense back at square one.  It will take a very long time from after it has been relodged to process this difficult planning application.  Up to about two weeks ago the planning application had not been relodged. Inevitably there will be an appeal and almost certainly there will be an oral hearing on this appeal.  If the ordinary public company offering shares to the public were not able to give a profit and dividend forecast that would be the end of it.  Again, the Minister's proposed purchase falls down on that aspect.</P>
    <P>The seventh heading one would normally see in a prospectus of a company asking the public to subscribe would be roughly on the lines of details of assets and liabilities of the company.  These are normally based on accounts prepared by the company's auditors and examined and confirmed by independent accountants appointed for that purpose by the bankers who are handling the issue and who normally underwrite it as well.  It is normally presented in the form of a certified balance sheet which is usually endorsed by the directors and endorsed independently.  The balance sheet would list the issued capital, the reserves, the fixed assets and the liabilities.  Where these assets are in property, details are normally given of the tenure of the property and of the extent of the holdings, with a directors' certification for which the directors are personally liable.  As well <Col N="1617" /> as that, an auditor's certification would be given and an independent valuation of the property made by some well-known firm of valuers.  The bank balances, the value of work in progress, and the value of stocks would be given.  In this case we know some of these details but I suggest to the House that what little we know about them are known as a result of myself and my colleagues giving the details to the House so far as we could ascertain them.  It was not from anything the Minister told us.  For example, we gave details of the charges on the company's assets, we introduced the fact that the company had received no money in cash or cash subscriptions for the million shares they had issued. We have been told that there were valuations for the company's assets ranging from just marginally under £1 million to £106 million.  The actual price being demanded for the shares that the Minister is buying was fixed by a panel of arbitrators acting in a manner described by the Minister as horse trading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister corrects me for the record sometimes because that underlines the number of times he makes no attempt to deny what I say.  We are entitled to ask ourselves whether we, the Minister and this House, are engaged in a serious commercial assessment or whether we are having some sort of day out at a horse fair when we engage in this operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given seven headings of absolute importance under which disclosure is mandatory if an offer so serious is to be made to the public.  It <Col N="1618" /> is not the law of the land directly which makes disclosure of these matters mandatory.  It is the rules of the Stock Exchange.  Those rules are there for the protection of the public.  Here we have a situation where the public are being committed, in effect, to subscribing for shares at a substantial price and where all the rules that the Stock Exchange feel are necessary safeguards are not complied with.  Not one of those seven headings&mdash;and they would be seven of the basic, fundamental headings in a prospectus on the offer of shares for sale to the public&mdash; has been complied with here.  It would be bad enough if one was not complied with but all seven are not complied with, and they are only the basic ones.  Anybody who has seen a prospectus knows that it is a big document which goes on and on for pages in very small writing and covers an enormous amount of ground in order that the public might be safeguarded. I could go on and give probably another seven or 17 specific deficiencies which exist in this case.</P>
    <P>We do not even know in this case when the business is going to start and what the company is going to do about, for example, working capital.  The example I have cited should be sufficient for the Minister and the House as a whole to realise the shortcomings in investment terms of his approach. I doubt if the betting procedures engaged in by even the most unsophisticated newspaper in this or any other country would permit that newspaper to take an advertisement soliciting investment from the public when the deficiencies I have listed here in relation to this matter exist.  It is undisputed and is common case that this information is not available, and we are entitled to ask how can the Minister persist in this approach.  How can he be supported continuously by a majority of the Members of this House when all these patent deficiencies exist?  Do the Members of the House care?  Is the only function of this House now to rubber-stamp whatever the Minister of the day happens to bring in?</P>
    <P>I have shown in detail that the minimum measure of disclosure required in any appeal for or solicitation <Col N="1619" /> of investment funds by companies who are in competition with other companies has not been complied with here.  For those companies&mdash;companies who offer shares to the public from time to time&mdash;this information is publicly quoted on the stock exchange.</P>
    <P>Commercial privacy is just as necessary as it is in the case of Bula. Nonetheless they give all this information. This is the private information we are asking from the Minister and we are not getting it.  Some of this information at least&mdash;not by any means all of it&mdash;is contained in this agreement we are asking for and the Minister will not give it on grounds of commercial secrecy.  How is it therefore that any and every public company in this country give it in a prospectus every time they invite the public to subscribe for shares?  How is it that they are able to give that information without damaging themselves commercially?  Even if they are not inviting the public at a particular time to subscribe they have to file in the Companies Office in Dublin Castle a very detailed annual return, much more detailed than in the case, for example, of a private company like Bula Ltd.  They are able to do this without damaging their commercial viability.</P>
    <P>If large public companies who are in direct competition with others can do it why cannot a private company such as this who are hardly in a competitive situation, because the sale of lead and zinc is not really on the open market?  A cartel situation exists in relation to it and the only alternative frequently to the prices fixed by the cartel would be for the company to try to sell their concentrates either to a new Irish smelter, if and when there is one, or alternatively to some Eastern European smelter which is not part of the cartel.</P>
    <P>This is not an instance of commercial viability or commercial interest being protected by secrecy. This is a case of accountability to the public which is not being observed. It is only by the release to the public, and in particular to this House here and now, of the same level of information <Col N="1620" /> as is normal in relation to any public trading company that the Minister can fulfil his responsibility, not just to the Oireachtas but to the public and, I might add, to the courts, who may well have to make decisions about the validity or otherwise of this proposed legislation.  I hope that it will come to that, whether as the result of a reference by the President or of an action by some individual citizen, because it is a matter the courts should concern themselves about and it will give the courts a great deal to think about and to chew upon.</P>
    <P>I asked a barrister whom I know if he would go through, on my behalf, the Acts of the Oireachtas since the 1920s onwards to try to find a precedent for a Bill of this kind.  He has failed to find any.  We have been asking the Minister here, several of us for several weeks, for a precedent and he has never come up with one, so it is fair enough to assume that there is not one.  The man whom I asked to go through as many Acts as he could to find if there was a precedent told me he could not find a precedent, but he did come up with two Acts fairly similar to this in that they both refer to and purport to ratify agreements made by the Minister of the day with companies or organisations for the takeover either partly or wholly of them.  He came up with two such Acts.  By saying he found two, I am not suggesting there are only two, and that exhausts the list.  It does not by any means.  There were two which seemed to be very apposite to this.</P>
    <P>One is the Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952, where the State made an arrangement with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in Northern Ireland and the Foyle Fisheries Commission to take over the old Foyle fisheries and to administer them jointly as between the North and South with a new type of commission which would have responsibility jointly to the Six County authorities and to the Government here in Dublin.  That agreement is scheduled in the Act.  Another one is the Great Northern Railway Act of 1953 where the State, acting through CIE, I think. <Col N="1621" /> agreed to take over the old Great Northern Railway.  Needless to say they made an agreement.  You would have to reduce a complicated transaction like that to writing and it was reduced to writing.  That agreement is referred to constantly throughout the Act and the agreement is scheduled, he tells me, in the Act.  He believes there are many more.</P>
    <P>I know that in very many cases where the agreement was lengthy&mdash;and it may well be lengthy for all I know in this case&mdash;it was often the practice not to schedule the agreement in the actual Bill for the sake of space, to save printing costs and so on.  It has been the practice to lay the agreement on the Table of the House so that, well in advance, Deputies would have the opportunity to examine it fully.  I was looking at the Order Paper last week and there are three motions down to ratify three agreements which the State entered into.  Each of the motions ends up with the words &ldquo;which agreement has been laid on the Table of each House of the Oireachtas&rdquo; or &ldquo;has been laid on the Table of the Dáil&rdquo;, as the case may be.  They relate to agreements about coffee and cocoa and tin as far as I remember.  They are still on the Order Paper.  It was not contemplated by whatever Minister is responsible for cocoa and coffee and tin&mdash;I presume it is the Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash;that the House would be asked to ratify those agreements and bind the State to them, or by them, without letting the House know what those agreements were and what was in them.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are asked to ratify something which is a great deal more important for everyone in the country than an international agreement about cocoa and we are not allowed to see the agreement concerned.  The reason given is that it would be commercially damaging.  I have shown that the type of things which would be in this agreement would be in a prospectus issued by a public company.  That company would be in trading competition with many other companies and would be much more likely to suffer than a company engaged in the rather specialised business of mining which simply has to <Col N="1622" /> make an agreement with a smelter to take its concentrates.  Those companies are not damaged commercially by giving the kind of information we have been seeking.  How can Bula Ltd. be damaged?  Are we not entitled to be suspicious when the agreement and the information are not given to us?  Can the Minister complain if suspicion is widely felt throughout the country in these circumstances?</P>

      <P>I rise to deal briefly with one matter which was adverted to by Deputy O'Malley in passing today but which he raised last week, that is, the interaction between the provisions of the Constitution relating to the promulgating of laws, the present Bill and the agreement referred to in section 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill which the House is considering provides for the acquisition of shares by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the company referred to in section 1 and authorises him to expend sums up to a specified maximum amount in such acquisition.  It makes provision for matters connected with and consequential upon such acquisition and expenditure.  The Bill, when enacted, will not in any way <Col N="1623" /> make the agreement referred to in section 1 law.  It is not correct to suggest the Bill proposes to make the agreement the law of the land, or that the Bill ratifies the agreement, or that the President is required to promulgate the agreement when exercising his functions under Articles 13 and 25 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It is by no means unusual for Ministers to enter into contractual arrangements with outside parties.  When they do so, the legal rights and obligations of the parties arise from the agreements and not from any statutory source. Exactly the same situation will exist in relation to the agreement referred to in the section we are now considering. This Bill, when enacted, will confer authorisation to carry out the terms of the agreement, but it gives no statutory force to them.  Any legal rights and obligations of the parties will continue to arise from the agreement and not from the statute.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, by passing this Bill, the two Houses of the Oireachtas will not require the President to promulgate the agreement.  He will be required to promulgate a law authorising the Minister to do certain things specified in it. This is a normal function, of course, and a proper one for him to perform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Attorney General not agree that the Minister is authorised by this Bill to do certain things and I quote from section 2 (1) of the Bill, &ldquo;in accordance with the agreement&rdquo;?  Assuming the Bill is passed, and assuming it is signed by the President, the Minister will be empowered by the Oireachtas to do X in accordance with the agreement.  If it were to happen that, after the Bill is passed and enacted into law on the signature of the President, a copy of the agreement, which we cannot now find, were to come into the hands of a private citizen, and if that citizen were to read the terms of the agreement and say: &ldquo;My goodness, the Minister did X all right but he did not do it &lsquo;in accordance with the agreement&rsquo;&rdquo;, could that citizen not then go to the courts for a declaration that the Minister acted <i>ultra vires</i> in doing X?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1624" /> Could that citizen not produce to the court the agreement and say: &ldquo;Under section 2 (1) of this Bill the Minister was entitled to do X but only &lsquo;in accordance with the terms of the Agreement&rsquo; and here is the agreement and clause 7 (g)&rdquo;&mdash;or some such clause&mdash;&ldquo;is not complied with.  Therefore the Minister did not do X &lsquo;in accordance with the terms of the agreement&rsquo;.  Therefore what he did was unlawful.&rdquo;  Would that not be the situation, that the terms of the agreement are what determine the validity or legality of the Minister's action?  In the circumstances, would the court not have to look for the agreement?  On the other hand&mdash;naturally, I would like to have time to prepare a reply to the Attorney General&mdash;would there not also be the provision that a citizen could go to the court after the Minister did X that he is allowed to do under the terms of the Bill and say: &ldquo;The Minister is allowed to do that but only &lsquo;in accordance with the terms of the Agreement&rsquo;.  I have not seen the terms of the agreement; the court have not seen it.  How does the court know or I know or any citizen know that he has done it in accordance with the terms of the agreement?  How therefore do you or I know that he has done it in accordance with the law of the land?&rdquo; Thereupon he would request the court to request the Minister to produce the agreement so that it could be scrutinised by the court and the citizen concerned to see if the action of the Minister was &ldquo;in accordance with the terms of the Agreement&rdquo;. If it was not, the court would have no option but to say that the Minister acted <i>ultra vires</i>, beyond his powers, that he did not act lawfully in this matter because he had not complied with the terms of the section which in section 2 (1) are &ldquo;in accordance with the terms of the Agreement&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are many other references&mdash; in subsection (3) it says &ldquo;any right or power referred to in the Agreement&rdquo; being exercisable by the Minister: in section 3 (2) there is &ldquo;right or power referred to in subsection (1) of this section or referred to in the Agreement as being vested in the Minister...&rdquo; Does the Attorney General <Col N="1625" /> see in section 3 (2) the two kinds of power that are conferred on the Minister and that may be exercised by him?  There is first, the right or power referred to in subsection (1) of this section and secondly, there is a right or power referred to in the Agreement and this subsection seems to give equal validity, equal legality to each type of right or power.  The right or power contained in the section or conferred by the section is no greater than the right or power &ldquo;referred to in the Agreement&rdquo;&mdash; and I am quoting the words &ldquo;referred to in the Agreement&rdquo;.  That is section 3 alone.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (3) provides that the Minister for Finance may after consultation with the Minister and subject to the Agreement sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of the company held by him under this Act.  If the Minister for Finance does purport to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares held by him in the company under the Act, a citizen who disapproves of the sale and says, for example, that the Minister should have held on to the shares or not sold them so cheaply, may say to a court that the Minister did not comply with the phrase or words in section 4 (3), &ldquo;subject to the Agreement&rdquo;.  The court would say: &ldquo;We have not seen the agreement.  The agreement is part of the law of the land because the Minister has to act in accordance with it and it is referred to continuously in an Act of the Oireachtas but we have not seen it.  Therefore, until we see it we cannot know whether the Minister complied with it&rdquo;.  The court would thereupon make an order, as I suggest they are entitled to do, calling for production of the Agreement to the court for consideration of its terms by the court and by the parties.</P>
    <P>Section 5 says that all moneys required from time to time for the acquisition under this Act and pursuant to the Agreement, of shares of the company shall be advanced out of the Central Fund.  It is not just the acquisition under this Act; if the proposition were as the Attorney <Col N="1626" /> General says, it would stop there; it would be the acquisition under this Act.  But it does not stop there.  It says &ldquo;acquisition under this Act and pursuant to the Agreement&rdquo;.  There are two conditions with which the Minister must comply.  First, he must get the power given him by the passage of this Bill into an Act of the Oireachtas.  Secondly, he must also act pursuant to the Agreement.  I respectfully suggest to the Attorney General that failure to fulfil the terms of the section, on his own argument here, failure to do so, to buy the shares or get the money from the Central Fund pursuant to the Agreement means that he would be acting unlawfully if he did not do it pursuant to the Agreement.  The words are here and the words &ldquo;pursuant to the Agreement&rdquo; are part of the law of the land.  He cannot be seen to act either in accordance or not in accordance with that law unless the Agreement is actually produced.</P>
    <P>If, as seems obvious, the agreement will have to be produced to a court after this measure is enacted, why not produce it now so that the Oireachtas will know where it is going?  We may be legislating absolute lunacy for all we know.  Why not let us know in advance so that we shall not legislate in the dark?  These continuous references such as &ldquo;subject to the Agreement&rdquo;, &ldquo;pursuant to the Agreement&rdquo; and so on make it clear that in practice the agreement becomes the law of the land and the Minister is bound by the agreement.  It is not enough for him to spend money and buy shares; he must do it subject to the agreement, in accordance with the agreement, and pursuant to the agreement. How can a court say whether he did or did not act subject to the agreement, in accordance with it, having regard to it, and so on, unless it sees the agreement?  If the court has to send for the agreement and have it produced in order to adjudicate on the validity or legality of the Minister's exercise of these powers, any citizen is entitled to see it because any citizen is entitled to go to the High Court and ask the court to make an order in the particular circumstances <Col N="1627" /> of this rather unusual legislation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I repeat what I said last week that the President will have to consider deeply the implications of signing or purporting to sign into law a Bill of the Oireachtas which on the face of it he himself will be unable to promulgate as it is his duty to do and which, on the face of it, binds citizens and in particular binds the Minister in a way that the citizens at large cannot be aware of or cannot ascertain.</P>
    <P>Apart from the taxing provision of which I spoke last week&mdash;the fact that 3.1 million people have to provide £9.54 million&mdash;there is also the aspect that the Minister is empowered to do certain things in accordance with the agreement, subject to the agreement or referred to in the agreement or pursuant to the Agreement.  Any citizen is entitled to examine the actions of a Minister to see if he acts in accordance with the law.  How can a citizen do this when he does not know what the provisions of the agreement are.  He does not know if the Minister acted &ldquo;in accordance with the terms of the Agreement&rdquo; because he has not the agreement.  Is he not entitled to go to the High Court and ask for it so that the Minister's actions may, in a democracy, be adjudicated on for the public to whom he is accountable in the long run and in particular so that his actions may be adjudicated on by the people to whom he is accountable in the short term, the elected representatives of the people in this House?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter on which we differ relates to the suggestion made by the Deputy that in some way the President would be acting wrongly in promulgating the law.  The point I wished to make&mdash;one which, with respect, I do not think the Deputy has answered&mdash;is that this legislation is not ratifying the agreements; it is not requiring the President to promulgate the agreement; it will merely authorise the Minister to do certain things and will have certain consequential provisions in it relating to the authorisation given in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1628" /> I rose merely to point out to the House that the legislation we are being asked to enact was not something which would place the President in any particular difficulties.  He will be able to do what the Constitution clearly allows him to do, namely, to sign and promulgate this Bill if passed by both Houses.</P>
    <P>In relation to the other area the Deputy's main remarks adverted to, I do not wish to speculate on the kind of actions that may be taken by the private citizen if and when this Bill becomes law.  I have considerable faith in the common sense of our judges.  I do not think the sort of outcome the Deputy envisages is likely to occur.</P>

      <P>Not before giving the Minister an opportunity of denying any one or more of the points I made. If he wished to avail of this opportunity it would be quite unfair and improper of me to withdraw the amendment before he had done so.</P>
      <P>From the long silence we can assume that the Minister does not wish to demur on any of the points I have made.  We are now having legislation by silence.  Sixty-five of 67 Deputies will walk through the lobby and say Yes or No as the case may be, and that will be it.  We have a silent Minister.  This is a situation without precedent, where he is clearly unable to deny the truth of anything I have said.  He lets it all go by default; but his contempt for public opinion and for this House is such that it does not matter a damn.  It is boots going through the lobbies that will count in the long run.  The people will have an opportunity in the not too distant future to express their opinion of the Minister's opinion of the elected representatives of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I set out at length why the non-provision of this information is untenable. <Col N="1629" /> The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Justin Keating, agrees with me, by his eloquent and prolonged silence, that there is no <Col N="1630" /> justification for his refusal to publish this agreement.  If that is the way he wants it, let it be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 2, after line 28, to add a further subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) At the same time as the laying of the Agreement on the table of each House of the Oireachtas there shall be laid on the table of each such House all documents submitted to the Arbitrators appointed under the Agreement by each of the parties to the Agreement.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I believe much the same arguments which applied to the last amendment apply to the principle in this amendment. There is, of course, a difference. The last one related to the moving of a motion for the payment of money in the House. It also related to the laying of the agreement on the Table of the House.  This amendment seeks, as well as having the agreement laid on the Table of the House, to have the various other documents referred to continuously throughout the debate, when the Minister spoke, which is not today, laid on the Table of each House.  It seems to me that my task in this matter must be a simple one.</P>
      <P>There was no reply to what I had to say the last time.  There was a very minor interjection by the Minister in the middle of my speech saying that he was always very keen to keep the record right and he wanted to correct some words I used which I attributed to him.  The Minister corrected my attribution to him of the use of the words &ldquo;horse trading&rdquo;.  Since he was so keen to get the record right so far as the use of those words was concerned, one is perfectly entitled to draw the conclusion that because he said nothing else, even though we waited, perhaps, 30 seconds for him to reply and specifically invited him to do so, everything else I said was right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot have it both ways.  I believe the procedure we are going through now is described in the Standing Orders of the House as debate.  Would you, in your capacity as chairman of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, bring for consideration before that committee at its next meeting the question of finding a more appropriate word for the word &ldquo;debate&rdquo; to describe the proceedings on this Committee Stage?  It does not seem to me to be debate whatever else it is.  It is a constant reiteration of the proof of the badness of this deal, the incompetence of the Minister in relation to it and in relation to the post he holds generally.  The Minister's inability to defend himself and/or unwillingness to answer questions is in my approximately nine years in the House the most revealing performance by any Minister I have ever heard.  I suppose everyone of us, who held the post of Minister at some time, was in a difficulty answering questions but at least we made a reasonable attempt if it was only for the sake of trying to defend our position or trying to extend courtesy to the House.  Neither of those considerations appears to apply to this Minister who by his own actions and his own silence underlines his obvious incompetence and the mess he has made, in the opinion of a great many people in the country, of this whole affair.</P>
      <P>The superior genius we were led to believe that existed in the Department of Industry and Commerce for the past four years has now been shown, in the course of this debate, in his true colours.  For the sake of the country the sooner he departs from that office he holds the better.  He has now demonstrated by his own actions&mdash;it gives me no great pleasure to say it&mdash; his patent unfitness for the office he holds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could go through all the arguments I went through on the last amendment. They all basically apply in principle to this amendment.  I can add as many <Col N="1633" /> arguments again if that is necessary but I fail to see why I should cause my voice to deteriorate further.  There is no point in making the arguments if they are accepted.  The Minister has now accepted them.  I am entitled to allow my colleagues, if they wish to contribute, to do so or to allow the Minister, who apparently at long last has been provoked into talking&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's reasoning is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that right?  It must be a great consolation to the Minister in those circumstances that in respect of whatever course the debate takes he will still get 60 or 65 people to put it through.  I wish that instead of ten or 20 people, there were a few hundred or a few thousand people to watch this performance.  I wish there were more than just a handful of people in the Press Gallery to report this because one gets reports written in some of the daily newspapers by people who are never present in the House during the debate.  If more people were there they could see what is happening.  They could report what they see.  Unfortunately, when they are not here they cannot report what they see.  If they were here during the past hour they would have found it interesting. They would have witnessed something of which I know of no precedent in the history of the debates in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I will start by pointing out that we are on amendment No. 6 which relates to the discovery of documents.  It would be hard to gather that from the tirade we have just heard.  Every time Deputy O'Malley purports to quote me it is done with distortion, imprecision and not with the objective of conveying in an unbiased way what I said.  It is done with the idea of putting a distorted gloss on what I say in an effort to validate some sort of lawyer's argument, not by the process of finding out what is true but by making an argument.  I, now, not specifically about any recent statement of his or about the last amendment but in general, want to indicate to the House that if I do not repudiate him time <Col N="1634" /> after time it cannot be assumed that I agree with him.  If I occasionally set the record right, it cannot be assumed that in other cases I do not simply ensure the continuing distortion and put up with it because in the end we are judged by the people at large and we are judged by those reading all the Parliamentary record in an unbiased way.  That sort of trick impresses nobody.</P>
      <P>We have been repeating ourselves. We were told last night by the Deputy that this Bill could take one, two or three months&mdash;he was not sure.  Of course, he has been repeating himself. You asked the House to take amendments Nos.  1 and 5 together because they are very like each other.  We had a lengthy argument on amendment No. 1 and I decline to go around the horsepond again on something practically identical.  Ordinary procedure of the House would have indicated that they be taken together.  It was sheer obstruction and a desire to waste time on the part of Deputy O'Malley&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If that is what he is saying, I suggest it is clearly critical of the Chair and the ruling of the Chair in dealing with these two amendments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am about to say is not something new but I will say it again.  The proceedings of the <Col N="1635" /> board of consultants were confined to the parties concerned as is the case with arbitration proceedings of this kind generally, as is the norm in such circumstances.  The documents prepared by the two parties were submitted on the understanding that they would be confidential to the board and to the two parties.  I would be in serious breach of that confidentiality, that norm, if I were to make the documents available now.  The principle raised, in a special partisan way, in a special instance, goes far beyond this case.  Where an agreement between private interests or between the State and a private interest of any kind provides for arbitration, it must be understood beyond doubt that these proceedings will be confidential.  Information of the most confidential nature, the release of which could have serious implications for a commercial company, may be submitted in such proceedings. It is unthinkable that the publication of such proceedings should be required.  If we were to make an exception in this case, as we are continuously asked to do, no commercial interest could engage in arbitration or comparable process with a Government Department or an agency of a Government Department in a meaningful way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreements which I concluded last year with eleven offshore exploration consortia provide for arbitration. Those proceedings could involve the submission of information of a highly confidential and sensitive nature.  In the circumstances, therefore, it is clear, as it was always clear, that I cannot accept the amendment.  The objective effect of this sort of precedent we ought to ponder and on the special attitudes and treatment required in this instance by the efforts of Deputy O'Malley in amending the Bill.  This sort of precedent, were it to be introduced, would have an effect because one cannot make particular decisions in one instance and not have them generalised; one has to treat categories of things in a way that is seen to be consistent.  What, in effect, this demand that arbitration has its documentation published <i>in toto</i> would do when private companies can carry on their business with normal <Col N="1636" /> confidentiality is to hamstring the State in relation to its dealings with private industry and, most especially in dealing with multi-nationals.  I am not in a position to judge the internal workings of Deputy O'Malley's consciousness so I do not know whether that is a result he intends or not but that is the result this action would produce if it were acceded to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has talked about a precedent being sought to be created in this amendment.  In the light of that observation it is necessary that I again point out to the Minister that the precedent being created in this Bill is being created by the Minister. The Minister is bringing in a Bill providing for the Oireachtas to agree to certain actions by him being subjected to an agreement the terms of which the Oireachtas is not aware of.  There is no precedent for that.  The unprecedented nature of this matter before the House is a direct consequence of the Minister's decision and nothing else.  I noted that the Minister made a number of generalised assertions&mdash;something that is not uncommon&mdash;and he said, more specifically, that the documentation submitted by both parties in this case to the arbitration was submitted on the basis of confidentiality. He implied, although he did not say, that the basis on which it was submitted was that it would be confidential and remain so, even after the arbitration was finished.  I should like to ask the Minister whether that specific requirement was laid down either in the agreement or whether it was a specific submission to arbitration or what.  Is the Minister referring to a specific matter that was spelt out in relation to this arbitration or is he merely making a general observation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no such specific consideration or specific commitment; it was regarded as the norm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather suspected there was not because of the way the Minister put it.  Of course, he was making his usual generalised statements without backing them up.  He attempted to suggest that here he was being specific in relation to this case. It now transpires that he was not. <Col N="1637" /> Therefore, the Minister cannot fall back on what he alleges is the norm. I suggest he has to justify to the House for refusing this amendment some reasonably concrete evidence&mdash;I am not too demanding in this regard&mdash; that disclosure of the documents involved in this amendment would be damaging.  I concede straight away that I can conceive that some of the documents which might be involved in this could be damaging, particularly if they contained projections of how the mine might be worked and so on.</P>

      <P>I can conceive of the possibility that some of these documents, if produced, might be damaging. I do not know if they would or not but it is a possibility.  However, there is an obligation on the Minister in regard to any such documents specifically to put it on the record that that is so and not merely to rely on a general assertion, as he tried to. There is a further obligation on the Minister to say in relation to those documents submitted which would not be damaging that he will agree to produce them as demanded in this amendment or, alternatively, give a good reason, not a generalised vaporisation, for not producing those documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the documents submitted, the amendment envisages laying on the Table of the House the agreement referred to in section 1.  If there are clauses in that agreement which would be damaging if disclosed, there is an obligation on the Minister to indicate that they would be damaging and to <Col N="1638" /> give a general indication as to why that would be so.  There is an obligation on him to agree that portions of the agreement which would not be damaging should be laid on the Table of the House, and in particular to justify his stance that this House is not entitled to know the terms of the initial State investment in this company.  The Minister may say certain items would be damaging but it is not enough for him to say that.  He has got to give some indication of the way in which they would be damaging.  If the Minister cannot show that the revealing of the precise terms of the State investment would be damaging he has a clear obligation to the House and the public to produce at least that part of the agreement which would not be damaging.</P>
    <P>If he fails to do that, one is left with the situation where, for reasons which he fails to put forward, he wants to conceal all the terms of the agreement, including the State's initial investment, and one can only speculate why he would want to conceal that information.  I, for one, cannot conceive why such information could be damaging. Throughout the debate no one on the other side made any attempt to illustrate how it could be damaging, beyond an effort to roll the whole thing up with the day to day business of the company.  No effort was made to deal precisely with the question of how disclosure of the terms of the initial State investment could damage the company. I invite the Minister now to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not, first, because of the length of the debate; second, because of the length of my interventions on this subject; third, because of the number of times on which this issue has been raised, in my view out of order; and fourth, the fact that the amendment relates to all the documents submitted to the arbitrator.  No matter how much the other side may want to prolong the debate, I refuse to cover again matters that have been debated and voted on extensively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the matter of arbitration, opinions and advice have been given involving detailed information.  It seems to me that what the Deputy is asking is without precedent in this country.  It must be of very deep concern that two lawyers on the Opposition benches make the case that there should be disclosure of documents placed in arbitration that is not a court of public arbitrators.  It would be a very dangerous practice that a client's personal affairs would be disclosed in arbitration.  There is arbitration from day to day on all sorts of contracts in regard to which there is no disclosure&mdash;personal private matters between the parties.</P>
      <P>This is a private matter in the sense that the State is to be a purchaser of shares in a private company and the arbitration was for the purpose of reaching an agreement in relation to the value that should be paid.  According to the amendment, the value placed by either side or by their personal advisers should be put on the Table of the House for all the curiosity-killed-the-cat merchants to see.  I cannot see the reason behind it. We must look at it in the light of any two parties who seek arbitration to deal with an agreement into which they have entered, to assess the value of what one person is selling and another buying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My mind boggles at the reasoning, if there is any, that could be applied to the Opposition case.  Deputy O'Malley said he had been through all the reasons for this and he referred to the case of the Foyle fisheries.  I challenge anybody in the House to point to any part of the agreement in the Foyle Fisheries Act that gives any information of the day-to-day or any other working of the Foyle fisheries.  My reading of it is <Col N="1640" /> that the price is the only thing mentioned, nothing else.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>That is public.  I made the distinction.  This is not a public arbitration.  The Deputy is talking about a public arbitration before a public arbitrator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt Deputy Esmonde.  Where local authorities <Col N="1641" /> are concerned there are two sides to an arbitration.  The local authority is using public money to purchase property on foot of an agreement the owner of the property has been compelled to enter into because of a CPO. Deputy Esmonde knows full well that such arbitration hearings are wide open to the public and to the press.  Here we have a situation in which the State is entering into an agreement and going to arbitration to determine the price. The price incidentally is £9.54 million. I see no reason whatever why the documents should not be made available to this House and to the public as they are in any arbitration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no reason in Deputy Esmonde's argument on that particular score.  The public are entitled to information since it is public money that is being paid over to private individuals, not into a company.  They are entitled to know when this mine will start production.  Surely that information will not damage the company. They are entitled to know when jobs will be available and how soon.  Surely the Minister could give us that information. Surely he could give it to the public even if he does not want to give it to this party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are also entitled to know what arrangements are envisaged to provide the capital necessary for this company to go into production.  A sum of £25 million has been mentioned.  We have got no information as to how this money will be provided.  Will it be provided by the taxpayers?  We assume arrangements have been made with regard to the proper management of this mine when it goes into production. We are entitled to know what the arrangements are.  The management should have experience and knowledge of mining.  That is something the public could be told without damaging operations or future plans.  We are entitled to be told about marketing arrangements. Where will the concentrates be sold?  Remember, the company will not form part of the cartel.  Surely there is some alternative market available.  If it is not available then the Minister should not have committed £9.54 million <Col N="1642" /> of public money without giving the taxpayers the answers to these simple questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde very helpfully got the Minister off the hook. For Deputy Esmonde's benefit, though he is not here at the moment, he knows better than most people in the House that many matters relating to the affairs of both public and private companies and private individuals are dealt with every day in detail in the courts, with full access by the public to knowledge not only of the documents filed but of the arguments put forward on both sides.  He also knows that there are many arbitrations where, at their conclusion all the documentation available is published.  As Deputy Barrett has pointed out, many arbitrations are carried out in public and so it is quite unreal to suggest there is a norm being followed here and that it is ridiculous to suggest there ought to be any disclosure.  I repeat I can concede, and I am certain Deputy O'Malley will concede, that if the Minister were to make even an outline case for excluding certain of the documents or certain portions of them because of damage that might be caused Deputy O'Malley would certainly not try to insist on publication of the full terms of the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, of course, did not make that case at all.  This is a blanket concealment.  No aspect is to be disclosed, according to the Minister. Irrespective of whether or not it would be damaging, it is not to be disclosed.  I have invited the Minister to answer a precise question.  His response was that he had already answered it.  I asked him to say where and at what point in the debate he answered it.  He did not respond to that invitation.</P>
      <P>I would like to give the Minister a precise example of the kind of thing I mean.  It has been argued, and to an extent that virtually convinces me it is true, that the agreement contains a provision the effect of which is to have a built-in veto or to give a majority voting right to a minority shareholding other than that held by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1643" /> Whether or not the Minister wants to acknowledge that, let us assume for the purpose of argument that that is in the agreement.  If it is in the agreement will the Minister indicate where or how the disclosure of that fact could be or would be damaging to the company and in what way?</P>

      <P>I am sure if the Minister wants to answer he will choose his own time to do so.  It is well to remember that every amendment to a Bill is concentrated around the principle on which the Bill is based.  In this case the Opposition oppose the principle of the Bill and every one of the amendments seeks in some way to have that expressed in law.  I do not think I am being unfair when I say that they are against State equity participation in the development of our natural resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read Deputy O'Malley's Second Reading speech many times since it was delivered.  It was described as the best speech in the 20th Dáil and I thought perhaps the best speech in the 20th Century, but I was misreading it.  Deputy O'Malley put forward the proposition that State participation should be by way of production level.  Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 must be taken together because they seek to extract information which the Minister argues would be against the very purpose of the Bill&mdash;that is, State participation by way of purchasing equity in this particular company. Both Deputy Colley and Deputy O'Malley have argued today and earlier that the commercial interests would not be in any way damaged or need not be damaged.  Originally the assertion was that their interests would <Col N="1644" /> not be damaged.  Today Deputy O'Malley began to concede that there could be areas which could be damaged and there was some ground, therefore, for the suppression of some information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to hear the argument for suppression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument I made previously was that in this case commercial secrecy was a strength so far as the State was concerned and not a weakness.  That was the principle the Minister put forward on Second Stage. The commercial interests that are being protected by this element of confidentiality are the Government's interests, the public's interests.  That is what is being protected.  This amendment, as the previous one which was defeated, would put the State at a disadvantage in the development of our natural resources <i>vis-à-vis</i> private business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the position that it could be a political interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation then would be that where a contract was arrived at between the State and a private company the terms of that contract would remain public but a similar contract between private companies would be kept confidential. That would be the commercial difference and if Deputy Colley cannot see the weight of that argument, since suspicion has been thrown around this House pretty freely I must suspect there are other reasons why the Opposition want to make the information public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State cannot possibly be put at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> private interests. The Minister has indicated in respect of other arrangements arrived at with regard to exploration of off-shore oil and gas that he must keep an element of confidentiality to preserve the State's bargaining power.  I do not want to enter into hypotheses or to give specific cases of how disclosure of confidential terms might be damaging for the reason that the Opposition might then say it was the reason why it was not being disclosed.  Deputy <Col N="1645" /> Colley has just offered a certain hypothetical circumstance.  Of course if the Opposition were sufficiently inventive they could put forward all such hypothetical cases before the House and have the Minister deny them. Then, by a process of elimination they could arrive at what was in the agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking the Minister to deny it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason behind a number of questions that were put to the Minister.  Then, the Opposition would be in the glorious situation of saying that what they asserted was true because the Minister had not denied it.  Alternatively, they might say he had something to hide and that was why he was staying silent.  On the last occasion I said the descent into innuendo was lowering the tone of what should be a very important debate.  I regret to say that so far the tone of this debate has reached depths which I do not believe will be beaten in any future debate.  Given the important national issues at stake it is highly regrettable.</P>
      <P>Is it not obvious that every speculator on the stock exchange would love to have the documents which the Opposition seek to have made public? What an orgy of speculation would result on the publication of those documents which of course, must have information in relation to the entire orebody or information which could be applied to it.  It appears that speculation on the stock exchange is rather more widespread than I thought and it is obvious that every speculator would give his right arm to have this information.  I do not think the disclosure of the information would be prudent or in accordance with normal arbitration proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder what is the real reason behind these attempts to extract from the Minister the terms of this agreement? There has been a relentless pursuit by every means possible to extract information in whole or in part. The State engages in many contracts, not just through Ministers or through governments but through its various <Col N="1646" /> agencies.  Having been involved in one such company I have no doubt that on occasion the best interests of the public are served by information being regarded as confidential and remaining free from public scrutiny.  The State must have its own way of protecting itself in commercial life.</P>
    <P>Commercial life is tough and ruthless and it is not peopled by saints. Deputy O'Malley spoke earlier about the provisions laid down by the stock exchange with regard to the disclosure of information in respect of public companies and one would think it was second only in terms of probity to a Trappist monastery.  There was not a hint of Jin Slater or any such people like that around the place, nothing but the most honest, straightforward people dealing in business.  We are not in that world.  The world we are dealing with now is the world of the multi-nationals in the development of our natural resources and, as I said on a previous occasion, the State must arm itself with every weapon at its command.  We are dealing with companies some of whose turnover is greater than our national income, some of whom employ more people than the entire labour force in Irish manufacturing industry.  We cannot give away one of the few weapons at our disposal.  That is why we must maintain a certain reserve power and I think the maintenance of confidentiality in respect of an agreement such as has been concluded in this case is one such weapon.  Any documents which impinge on the terms of that agreement, as quite clearly the documents sought in this amendment do, must be kept confidential.</P>
    <P>The disclosure of the documents is simply the avenue by which one would travel right to the heart of the agreement. That is the purpose of this amendment.  It adds the two points together. Having laid the agreement on the table then we must also lay the documents which were placed before the arbitrators and which play a pivotal part in determining the price which is at the centre of the agreement.</P>
    <P>I do not know the real motivation here.  I hope it is in respect of the public <Col N="1647" /> interest but in so far as it would be in the private interests of certain people to have the information disclosed. I think one is entitled to be suspicious on this side of the House also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is not offering perhaps it would be as well if I spoke again to refresh his memory. First, I wish to comment briefly on what was said by Deputy Halligan.  He seemed to say almost precisely what he said when this point was discussed before, namely, the usual generalisation about the necessity for confidentiality of State companies in general while avoiding the precise point that was made.  The only new point he made was that State companies or the State in its commercial dealings should have exactly the same privacy as a private company.  Of course he is overlooking the essential difference, namely, that the taxpayers' money is involved when the State is involved and the degree of accountability to the taxpayers is what makes an enormous difference.  He may not like it but it is a fact we must live with.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy would forget all the innuendo he might begin to recognise the primary cause of concern on this side of the House where we are faced with a Bill for which there is no precedent in the history of the State.  It provides for the expenditure of £9.54 million in connection with an agreement whose terms are being concealed from us.  However, I do not want to go back over all that ground.  Once more I want to give the Minister an opportunity to deal with the precise point being put forward.  If he would deal with the matter adequately from his point of view it would help his case and it would help us.  If he can put forward a reasonable answer he would help to reduce our difficulty.  On the other hand, if he does not put it forward, there is no point in complaining afterwards that the debate took an inordinate length of time or that we persisted in this point because it goes to the root of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Halligan misunderstood the question I put to the Minister.  Perhaps he pretended to misunderstand it.  One <Col N="1648" /> way or the other, he did not get it right.  I did not ask the Minister to acknowledge whether or not the agreement contains a provision that the 41 per cent block shares have a built-in veto or majority power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I said that you put that hypothesis forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said that the Minister would have to say yes or no and that, by a process of elimination, we would come to what was in the agreement.  Without any admission on his part as to what is in the agreement, assuming that such a provision were in the agreement, would the Minister explain in what way the disclosure of such a provision would damage the interests of this company? I have endeavoured to give a concrete example that has been referred to in the debate instead of a new one out of thin air without asking the Minister to commit himself in any way in regard to the contents of the agreement. How can the disclosure of the terms of the State's investment damage this company? This assertion has been made time after time without any evidence to support it.</P>
      <P>I am inviting the Minister to give some clarification on this vital point. If he does not like that example, perhaps he would choose another example that would relate to the terms of the State's initial investment and show how it could damage the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley has reached the stage of conceding, which reflects his practical experience, that there would be many of what one could call the working documents of a company which, in the jungle of mining, could be extremely damaging if they were revealed.  If Deputy Colley will consider my speech, the case that I made against revealing the agreement was on the basis of categories of agreements, of the work of the State, of the proper function of the IDA, of my oncoming relationship with the oil companies and so on.  The argument about economic well-being related to the documents on the current practice of the company.  They were <Col N="1649" /> separate arguments.  The effort to confuse them reveals a lack of knowledge of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand the Minister correctly, he is just shifting his feet again.  Leaving aside the documents submitted to arbitration, let us return to the precise point I have been putting to the Minister.  The agreement referred to in the amendment is the agreement that this House is faced with, although it does not know what is in it.  The Minister is now making an argument, which he made before, that he is not revealing the terms of this agreement because it would create a precedent for future agreements. Am I misrepresenting the Minister when I say that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not misrepresenting me in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that there is no justification for that argument.  If we assume from that argument that the agreement, if disclosed, would not be damaging to the company, then the Minister is afraid of the precedent.  The Minister is not afraid of a precedent when he introduces a Bill such as this, for which there is no precedent.  If any future agreements made by the State with any company contain items which would be damaging, it is open to the Minister dealing with it to ensure that those parts of the agreements which would be damaging are concealed. The case for disclosing those parts which would not be damaging is incontestable. We are dealing with public money and there is an obligation on the Minister to disclose every possible item of information that would not be damaging.  When pressed, the Minister said that concealing the agreement has nothing to do with this particular company, that he is afraid of creating a precedent for future agreements.</P>

      <P>The Minister did say it before, but when it was pointed out to him that he was on thin ice and that he shifted his ground, he then said it would be damaging to this company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1650" /> The Minister will recall my asking repeatedly in what way the disclosure of the terms of the State's initial investment in this company could be damaging.  We have not had an answer to that question.  It is clear that the Minister does not have an answer.  His only answer is the possibility that he might create a precedent.  The implication is that this agreement, which provides for the expenditure of at least £9.54 million, is to be rammed through with this legislation; although it is possible but there is not one word in it which, if disclosed, would damage the interests of the company.  We do not know whether that is so, but it is a distinct possibility on the basis of the Minister's argument.  Because of the danger that at some time in the future there might be an agreement, parts of which, if disclosed, would be commercially damaging and the Minister dealing with it would find himself unable to conceal that potentially damaging information, this agreement is not to be disclosed.  That is not good enough.  The Minister ought to be reminded that he is dealing with almost £10 million of public money and that he has accountability to this House. Either this agreement, if disclosed, would be commercially damaging or it would not, or part of it would be damaging and the rest would not.  It is open to the Minister to say that part of it would be damaging and to give a general outline as to why it is so and then to disclose the rest.  If the whole agreement would not be damaging, the Minister is not entitled to talk about a possible future risk as justification for concealing the terms of the agreement.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Colley knows, I am not talking about a possible future risk.  The 1969 IDA Act spawns agreement month after month with existing companies and none of them is ever revealed.  It is not a hypothetical future position; it is a practical position year after year.  We have been over this ground in detail.  It is a waste of time to go around the horse pond again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may not like it, but one of the prices that has to be paid for democracy is that Ministers <Col N="1651" /> are accountable and have to be reminded of their accountability.  As to that nonsense we have just heard from the Minister. the facts are that there are agreements being entered into all the time by the IDA on foot of the 1969 Act, and I want to put it to the Minister&mdash;and I challenge him to deny it&mdash; that never has there been a refusal to disclose the details of such agreements if they were sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision in the 1969 Act for revealing such contents. Everybody has known month after month since then that those agreements were being produced in large numbers, and everybody with the faintest idea of the working of the IDA, which Deputy Colley ought to have, knows that many of those agreements would be completely unnegotiable if they were to be revealed or if any demand for their being revealed were to be acceded to.  He knows that as well as I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to my knowledge there was never any agreement entered into in my time which needed to be concealed from the public or which would have been concealed if anybody had sought the details.  Maybe there is a new form of agreement being entered into now that I am not aware of.  I certainly have not been aware up to now that there was any form of agreement entered into by the IDA the disclosure of which would create any problem or be in any way damaging.  The Minister has not denied what I have put to him, that is, that never has there been a refusal to disclose the details of any of the agreements that he is now relying on.  He <Col N="1652" /> said he was not talking about anything in the future; he was talking about something that is going on now, but he had to admit when challenged that in relation to what is going on now there has never been a refusal to disclose any information relating to any of these agreements.</P>

      <P>The relentless pursuit for information continues and obviously it is going to do so for quite some time.  I want to go back to Deputy Colley's favourite trick of misrepresenting you and then demolishing you on the basis of the misrepresentation. I want to go back to the point at which he started, where he conceded there was a possibility that some information might be so damaging that it should remain confidential.  In that let me say he reflects the good sense which normally characterises his contributions here and which separates him from most of the contributions made from that side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>None of us has ever denied that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to see he has conceded this point in principle. He then makes the point that, perhaps, we should proceed by a different principle, that we should conceal that which is damaging and reveal that which is not.  He put forward by way of hypothesis a certain point that might be contained in the agreement and that the Minister could say whether this was something which should or should not be revealed.  Of course, if the answer to that question is yes, the assumption could then legitimately be made&mdash;and Deputy Colley is great at making assumptions &mdash;that it is in the agreement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that was not the Deputy's argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and if you put forward sufficient hypotheses you can get at everything which is in the agreement. You could put forward hypottheses from one to infinity and have sufficient of them there that by the end of the time you could put together on a jig-saw basis what was in the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1653" /> I was involved in the publication of information in a public company, and I cannot say that we ever pursued the policy that all of the information should be divulged; it certainly was, of course, to the Ministers responsible. The Ministers responsible did not take great exception to the fact that information which might be judged prejudicial remained confidential.  The important issue is that the State must retain unto itself whatever strength it has in dealing with these companies. The principle should be laid down that if the Minister of the day believes that a document should remain confidential in toto in the public interest, that is the situation which should be upheld.  We cannot put the State in the position where it is weakened in comparison with its competitors in the private enterprise world.  It is wrong that the State in reaching a contract with a private company must divulge all the details of the agreement while the agreements of private companies remain totally confidential, despite the fact that there could be a clash between the two.  That is the important principle which is at stake here.  No series of hypotheses should be permitted by the Minister to undermine that principle and no amount of assertions that because he is silent on a particular point such a situation exists should persuade him to deviate from this principle.</P>
    <P>Certainly there is an element of precedence in this, and it would be unwise of us all to ignore that fact.  If I recall, the first speaker from the Opposition benches to make this point was Deputy Lalor.  Perhaps that is not unreasonable as he was the Minister responsible for this area of policy in the last Government.  We should have such respect for precedent that we create it whenever it is necessary.  We have not had policies in the past in the development of our natural resources because we had none to develop. Now we have got them, and the duty of the Government of the day is to judge for themselves what is in the public interest in terms of the development of those resources, not on the basis of giving the maximum away but of giving the minimum away and <Col N="1654" /> of retaining the maximum for the State.</P>
    <P>That is the principle which animates this Bill and animates the total policy of this Government of which this Bill is, perhaps, the first legislative example but just one specific aspect of it.  For that reason it is important that what is laid down here should reflect the totality of that philosophy, the philosophy, whether the Opposition like it or not, that the State will have the maximum amount of participation in the development of those resources, the maximum amount that is compatible with the system under which we live.</P>

      <P>In so far as I understood the Opposition when this debate began, they did not even want a minority shareholding.  Deputy O'Malley used the phrase that we were &ldquo;locked into&rdquo; the situation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Deputy wants.  Yesterday on Committee Stage there were 21 Fianna Fáil Deputies at one point behind Deputy O'Malley.  I am not too long here, but I have been around this House for quite some time and have viewed the proceedings from the Gallery.  I would lay a bet that it is a long time since 21 Deputies, of all parties, never mind from one Party, were together here on Committee Stage for any Bill.  I wonder why that should be so.  I think the Deputies opposite have got a message, that they were given a job to come in here this week and clean this up before their Ard-Fheis next week-end.  They have tried valiantly, but the point that remains at issue is this, that this side of the House want maximum State participation in the development of our resources, and the provisions of this <Col N="1655" /> Bill are a means of securing that.  That side of the House are opposed to it, and this amendment here which we are now debating seeks to weaken the application of that principle, in fact, to render it absolutely meaningless.  That is the real reason behind the amendment. Perhaps there are other reasons, too, which are not of a political nature but that is an area into which I need not go now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed but scarcely surprised to hear the Minister revert to his old argument of a week or two ago regarding the question of trying to make comparisons with the IDA.  I thought we had disposed of that argument but the fact that the Minister finds it necessary to use it again is indicative of the situation in which he finds himself.</P>
      <P>When the State gives money to a company through the IDA, whether by way of grant or by way of equity participation, the State invests money in the company.  The IDA invest in this way only when they are satisfied that the company concerned is a viable undertaking and that the risk involved, so far as public money is concerned, is kept to an absolute minimum.  There was discussion in this House a year or so ago regarding the failure rate of IDA investments and we were told then by the Minister that the failure rate was 14 per cent.  At the time I expressed the view, and I repeat it now, that that was a very creditable performance from one point of view, that is, that the IDA are so extremely careful in their investment of public money. But I thought that they might be justified in taking more risks particularly in relation to Irish industrialists, Irish entrepreneurs or small Irish firms who did not have what the IDA refer to as proven track records.  The attitude of the IDA is that extreme prudence must be exercised in respect of every penny invested, that each investment must show a return in terms of jobs and national output and if there is any doubt, the investment is not made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1656" /> Let us contrast that attitude with the view of the Minister and, in particular, contrast the fact that the IDA are investing in the companies concerned.  The Minister is not investing in the case we are talking about.  On the contrary, he is handling over, tax free, £9.54 million to four individuals. It will be seen, therefore, that there is a total and fundamental difference between this situation and the situation that prevails in regard to the IDA.  To my knowledge the IDA have never handed as much as a pound tax free to an individual or individuals.  Every penny of the large sums that the IDA have invested in industry down through the years has been actual investment. They have never given money to a private individual who was not forming a company or who was not doing something to create employment or to maintain it or who would not use the money to modernise or make a company more efficient in some way.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister think that Members of this House or members of the public are so silly that they cannot appreciate the fundamental difference in this instance compared with the situation in regard to the IDA?  However, we had disposed of that argument but the Minister has found it necessary to repeat his hopeless and discredited statement in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to talk about oil agreements.  He should look at the situation in regard to oil, the guidelines in respect of which were set out by him in a lengthy document, a document of more than 100 pages and which was published, so far as I recall, about 18 months ago.  This document set out all the guidelines under which oil exploration could be carried out.  No doubt individual agreements are reached with individual consortia or companies in relation to particular blocks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly.  That is the point Deputy Colley has been making on and off during the past half hour. Should there be small areas of this agreement which, should they be published, might be damaging commercially, we would be happy to have laid on the table of the House an agreement from which, say, one or two paragraphs had been deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there a situation in relation to the oil agreements in which a handout is being given to any shareholder or group of shareholders in an oil consortia? I should hope not.  Therefore, the comparison which the Minister seeks to make is invalid.  What is involved here is a handout to four individuals. Not a penny has gone into this cash-starved company.  Yet, the Minister relies on what he calls a precedent, invalid as that argument is, to justify the secretiveness with which he is approaching this whole matter.  This secretiveness is not due to the possibility of commercial damage being caused.  Rather, it is due to a combination of two factors, one of which is ignorance.  The Minister does not know the answers to many of the questions he is asked and the other factor is that there are certain provisions in this agreement, one of which has been discussed by us in detail.  It refers to the voting rights situation which, if published, would result in the Minister <Col N="1658" /> being hounded in every newspaper for his foolishness in putting himself and the taxpayer into this situation.  He has bought himself into and locked himself into a minority situation but he is still adamant that he is paying more than £9,500,000 of public money to get into this situation, out of which he can never get.</P>
    <P>In that connection perhaps I could have the Chair's indulgence to refer briefly to a statement made by the Minister during his reply to the Second Stage debate and when he went into a lot of small detail in an effort to point out what he referred to as the inaccuracies of what I had said. He said that in my contribution there were a number of small inaccuracies but that there were big ones, too.  An example he picked of what he described as one of the small inaccuracies on my part was that I said that the Minister would be entitled under this agreement to appoint two directors out of a potential board of ten. The Minister stood up and smiled as only he can and said &ldquo;This is another of Deputy O'Malley's little inaccuracies, it is not two out of ten; there can only be seven directors of the company.&rdquo; I have since got a complete copy of the memorandum and articles of the company, Bula Ltd. Article 6 says that the number of directors shall not be more than ten. It also says that two is the minimum, and the quorum is two.  I make no great point of that, I just point it out as an example of these so-called corrections made for the pettiest of reasons, not having a great deal to commend them.  The Minister is now reduced in respect of his argument on the point of the publication of this agreement, to the argument we had a fortnight ago about the IDA and oil companies.  It has been clearly shown how invalid and inappropriate that argument is.  If the Minister wants to justify himself he should seek to do so in a more convincing way.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section as amended I would like to say that it is the key section in this Bill.  It is the one which authorises the purchase of these shares and the payment by the Minister to the small group of individuals concerned of this very large sum of public money which it is proposed to give them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1661" /> I would like to emphasise again, because I am afraid there are a lot of people who do not appreciate the fact yet, that not one single penny is being invested under this section in the company. This section, although it refers to the acquisition of shares and the payment of £9.54 million, still does not put one penny into the company and it retains the position that the State is in a permanent minority situation in a private limited company and has therefore no rights and no control at any level in respect of any matter.  In particular it should be borne in mind that if the directors and general membership of this company were to decide that, because of difficulties they were encountering or likely to encounter, they were not really interested in going into production and they were prepared to live, as it were, on their £9½ million now being proposed to be paid to them, there is nothing the Minister could do about that because of the nature of the shareholding and the lack of control which he has in this situation. He has made the case, apparently, that if he did not do what he is doing and take a minority interest, at a very high cost indeed to the taxpayer, in this company he would have even less say.  What he has failed to do is the obvious thing, to make a further order under the Minerals Development Act, 1940.  He says that he thinks that this would be unconstitutional and the order would be upset if he did.</P>
    <P>It seems to be forgotten by the Minister and a lot of people that much of the minerals in the mine which has been operating for quite a number of years at Tynagh in County Galway were privately owned but orders were made back in 1960, or whenever it was, that that mine was discovered, under the 1940 Act acquiring the rights for the State and enabling a mining lease to be made.  An effort was made by Deputy Lalor to do the same in respect of these minerals which are now owned by Bula Ltd.  As the House knows, Deputy Lalor's effort failed because there was some technical deficiency in the wording of the order he made but the courts spelled out what the deficiency was.  It seems to me and to all of us, not least to Deputy Lalor, that, <Col N="1662" /> the courts having found a technical defect and saying precisely what it was, the obvious move the following morning was to go and make another order.  However, the Minister chose not to do that.  If he had done so the State would control these minerals and could do what it liked with them and would not find itself in the rather appalling situation in which it is today, that it is a permanent minority bloc in a private limited company.</P>
    <P>Deputy Halligan spoke on the last amendment as if this were something commendable.  It is obvious, of course, in fairness to him, that Deputy Halligan does not realise the legal and commercial consequences of being a permanent minority in a private limited company.</P>
    <P>Whether or not he realises it today, certainly the Minister did not realise in legal and commercial terms the significance of what he was doing when he made this agreement originally. This is one of the reasons why it has been accurately and truthfully said about him that he was out-manoeuvred and out-negotiated in the negotiations which led to the agreement. From the point of view of those who are now getting £9.5 million they are in an incredibly good situation. They have this huge amount of money and they are still in control of the whole operation.  The like of it I do not think has ever been done.  It certainly was never done by any Government here and I doubt if any Government in any country would have been foolish enough to walk themselves into this position.</P>
    <P>That is what this Government and this Minister in particular have done and that is what this House is now asked to ratify and give the seal of approval to.  It is regrettable that the House shows every inclination, in a somewhat mindless fashion, to walk the provisions of this Bill through section by section, line by line, even though reason does not appear to arise.  Every financial commentator on these matters seems to regard this whole operation as rather extraordinary.</P>
    <P>The principal question that comes <Col N="1663" /> up on this section, as now amended, is the valuation.  While we touched on aspects of this in the course of the debate on various amendments, it is no harm to consider the valuation again and the circumstances in which it was arrived at.  If we have not the advantage of the agreement on which the whole thing is based, at least we have the advantage of the report of the chief of the Minister's various advisers which has been made available to us by courtesy of several newspapers who have published all or parts of it from time to time over the past three or four weeks.</P>
    <P>The first thing which should be borne in mind in connection with the valuation and the preparation of the valuation&mdash;and the one I am referring to, of course, is the Lazard Brothers one&mdash;is that the whole operation by Lazard Brothers had to be carried out in a period of six weeks which, to put it mildly, must have been extremely difficult for them, considering that this agreement was originally arrived at in principle as far back as June, 1974, and was signed formally and finally on 12th December, 1975.  The 20th October, 1976, was fixed as the closing date for submission to the arbitrators. Apparently Lazard Brothers were not instructed in the matter until early in September, 1976.</P>
    <P>The director who was involved, Mr. Fraser, indicated that the time period was about six weeks, which would indicate instructions some time early in September.  They submitted their report to the Department on 18th October, 1976, which means they had six weeks in all to consider a matter which was complicated, to say the very least of it, which was riddled with imponderables and which would require infinitely longer if they were to be able to do the kind of thorough investigations which they themselves would like to do.</P>
    <P>It appears that they did not have the opportunity to obtain independent, in-depth, technical reports.  They were able to get one short report only from one mining expert who did not carry out his own survey but based his remarks on the survey and production <Col N="1664" /> plan of Bechtel who had been commissioned by the company concerned. Lazard's drew attention to the reservations expressed by the technical consultants about the technical data available. They also drew attention to the various reservations expressed concerning environmental and planning matters generally and the failure of the submitted plan to deal at all with the very crucial question of the diversion of the River Blackwater.</P>
    <P>Lazards are quoted in relation to the technical aspect of the matter in the newspapers as saying that the technical data available now&mdash;that is, when they wrote in October, 1976&mdash;are insufficiently detailed to enable a purchaser to have complete confidence in the mine development plan and hence in the projected capital and operating cost.  They said that substantial changes in the method of one extractions may prove necessary in the light of more detailed investigations.  The diversion of the River Blackwater over a two mile length through undulating country with complex geology is a major engineering undertaking in its own right.  All the indications are, they said, that much more study of this aspect of the project will be necessary before its final cost can be estimated reliably.  The attention of the Assistant Secretary of the Department, presumably, to whom it was addressed was drawn to the Kilborn Report dated June, 1976, which indicates in outline that the total cost of river diversion may be as high as 17.2 million United States dollars.  For our cash flows, they said, we have, however, used the much lower cost estimate of B.E.M.R.A. which totalled £2.6 million.  The obvious and substantial risk of escalation from this lower figure has been taken into account in our discount rate. That is the end of the quotation on the technical aspect of it.</P>
    <P>It is certainly damning from the valuation point of view that the Minister's own principal financial advisers, one of the leading banks or advisory companies of this nature in the world, had to express caution and reservations in those terms.  It is almost without precedent that that should be so.  The degree of caution urged is exceptionally <Col N="1665" /> high for advice of this kind from a company of this kind.</P>
    <P>The newspaper accounts of the Lazard Brothers report go on to show that Lazards attempted to describe, for the benefit of the Minister, the likely planning permission problems in their valuation and the many enormous imponderables which exist in relation to it.  They are quoted as saying:</P>
    <P>planning consent for the initial development of the mine has not yet been granted.  We are advised to expect that it will be granted but not before October, 1977.</P>
    <P>This was written in October, 1976.  In the light of planning application history since then one ventures to think how essential it would be for planning consultants and for Lazards to revise that estimate.  They go on to say:</P>
    <P>We have included the consequent delay in the ore production schedules for our cash flows.  The Bechtel Report takes some account of the operational restrictions being applied to Bula by the planning authority but we have been advised that more onerous restrictions may be imposed. For instance, the scale of the open pit permitted by the planning authority may well be smaller than that assumed by Bechtel.  This casts fundamental doubts on the implementation of Bechtel's plan.</P>
    <P>I will stop the quotation there to draw the attention of the House to the significance of that sentence written by the Minister's chief advisers.  &ldquo;This casts fundamental doubts on the implementation of Bechtel's plan.&rdquo;  I wonder would any prudent, knowledgeable businessman who got advice which contained a sentence like that go ahead with a proposal to pay out more than £9.5 million.  Bechtel's plan is based on the maximum possible open-cast mining being allowed.  The whole thing would have to be revised very radically if maximum open-cast mining were not allowed or if, as is quite conceivable, open-cast mining were not allowed at all in this instance.</P>
    <P>The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1666" /> Furthermore, operating costs may be higher than anticipated in order to meet environmental standards.</P>
    <P>If there is no permission for river diversion where does the Minister stand in regard to this which is clearly one of the things essential and basic to the whole operation?  I think this indicates the speculative nature of the share purchase by the Minister.  Lazard Brothers are quoted in the newspapers as summarising their report in the following terms to which I think the House should pay particular attention. They say:</P>
    <P>We have therefore concluded that a knowledgeable potential purchaser would view an investment in the equity of Bula with considerable caution.  He would recognise that the mine will come into production as it has a sizeable reserve of ore and is important to Ireland.  He would however recognise that the mere ownership of ore by no means itself generates a return.  He would regard Bula as having very real problems facing it.  He would be worried by the proximity of the ore-body to the town of Navan and the difficulty of moving the river and indeed being allowed to do so at all.  He would be concerned at delays in bringing the mine into profitable production and increases in the cost of so doing might exceed those he has allowed for.  He would see considerable interference from the authorities on his freedom to mine the ore in the most economical way. The depressed state of the world economy would not enable him to make predictions about margins with assurance.  Even if all went well and these problems were overcome he would take into account the possibility that the Government of the day would take a larger share of the rewards.  Taking all these uncertainties into account we consider that the appropriate discount rate to apply for cash flows is 14.  Thus we advise you that our valuation of Bula's mining venture at 12th December, 1975, in accordance with the terms of reference is £7.75 million.</P>
    <P>That is the end of the report and I want to emphasise that the valuation <Col N="1667" /> of Bula's mining enterprise in accordance with the terms of reference is for the entirety of it £7.75 million and not for 24 per cent minority interest.  It is evident that Lazard Brothers were never asked to value a 24 per cent minority interest.  It seems quite likely &mdash;in fact it must be inevitable in the circumstances&mdash;that it was already a term of the agreement signed on 12th December, 1975, between the Bula shareholders and the Minister that they had agreed in advance that all that would be asked for was a 100 per cent valuation by the arbitrators and that the 24 per cent purchase would then be worked out on the mathematical basis.  There is no other explanation for the wording which Lazard Brothers used in their report as quoted in the newspapers as it would be entirely illogical for them to have reported in this fashion and stopped there without going on to say: &ldquo;We value 100 per cent of this undertaking at £7.75 million and we will now go on for a page or two to explain why we will value 24 per cent of it at perhaps £5 million or £1 million or whatever it might be.&rdquo;  They would go on to explain in some detail, although it is not necessary for anybody who knows anything about these matters, that 24 per cent of a private limited company is not worth 24 per cent of what the company is worth and could in certain circumstances be practically valueless because of the total inability of the holders of a very small minority holding like that to exercise any influence within the company.</P>
    <P>I think the percentage of 24 is significant because it is the maximum minority holding which gives absolutely no rights to the holders of it.  If you had 25 per cent you would have some little right; you could stop a special resolution being passed.  That is not a great deal of good but you have some very minor control over the situation.  It stops the majority doing some limited number of things they might otherwise do.  But with 24 per cent you have no say whatever and, therefore, 24 per cent is worth very much less for example, than 25 per cent.  It is not just a 1 per cent <Col N="1668" /> difference.  There is a huge and fundamental difference between the two. Even 49 per cent or any minority holding is not worth the mathematical proportion which it bears to the value of the entirely or anything approaching that.  One is entitled to feel that if Lazard Brothers had been asked to advise the Minister as to what 24 per cent in these circumstances was worth their advice would have been to the effect that it was worth, perhaps, less than £1 million.  It would be an interesting exercise for the Minister now to write and ask them what do they consider 24 per cent worth in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>What we know and need not speculate about is that Lazard Brothers, possibly one of the outstanding companies in this field in the world, valued the entirely at £7.75 million and the Minister ends up paying £9.54 million for 24 per cent of that.  If that is not damning a man out of the mouths of his advisers I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>The Minister is constantly talking about what he describes as the necessity for secrecy on the capital plans of this or any other company and it is worth considering what the law is in this regard.  The Companies Act, 1963, requires the details of the authorised issue share capital be notified to the Companies Registration Office at the time the company is registered.  Any changes from the amount notified must be notified for inclusion on the company's file.  This must be done by completing form No. 45 and all of this information at all times is freely available to any member of the public.  Any changes which are made in the company's capital structure or in the issuing or holding of shares by members of the company must be notified on this form and it must be done within one month of the change being made.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Dowling on 15th February, 1977:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1669" /> That Dáil Éireann takes note of the recently published survey of the Educational Sub-Committee of the Ballyfermot Community Association and requests the Government to initiate as a matter of urgency special programmes to provide employment and educational opportunities in Ballyfermot and in other areas of Dublin City where a similar need exists.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Association&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and notes the Government measures in the recent Budget, including employment premiums, the premium scheme for school-leavers and youth-training and employment schemes, all of which will be of particular benefit in areas in Dublin such as those covered by the Association's survey.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I had the opportunity of paying a tribute to the people who produced the report which gave rise to this motion.  It is well to give praise where praise is due.  This motion is an example of how democracy works at local community level. Whether you agree with the report or not, it contains a great deal of wisdom. The people who produced this report asked Deputy Dowling to consider the possibility of tabling a motion in Dáil Éireann in Private Members' time.  For that reason alone, apart altogether from what the motion seeks, the idea is a good one and is an example to other communities who have thought out their problems as well as the Ballyfermot Community Association did that the Dáil Chamber is not the preserve of Deputies only.  If a local community request their Deputy to raise a matter in the Dáil which is considered reasonable&mdash;in the final analysis Deputies have to make their own decisions&mdash;there is no reason why he should not articulate a point of view on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1670" /> Deputy Dowling put down this motion in a non-political fashion.  It should have been met by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education in the spirit in which it was moved, but it was not.  It was treated with an attempt at high political manifestation. Last night we were treated to what could only be described as an extension of the budget debate.  As I said, this motion was put down in a non-political fashion.  I am not making any apologies for being a politician. I am very proud of the profession, as is everybody else in this House.  In no way am I underrating the profession of politics.</P>
    <P>This motion was put down in a community non-political spirit.  That is the way Deputy Dowling sought to have it debated but, unfortunately, it was treated in a very high political fashion by the Parliamentary Secretary who told us that there are some plans some where for the college which the community association are seeking. We were told that the Harp site where the community association are seeking to build their community monument is available and that the Parliamentary Secretary is willing to build the community college there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson and I asked the Parliamentary Secretary at what stage was the building of the community school.  We were told, not directly, that there was not even a brick upon a brick, not even the foundations have been dug.  However, it is all down on paper in the Department.  We hope and pray that the reality to which this motion will give effect will lead to the building of a community centre and the provision of other desirable amenities in a built-up area.</P>
    <P>My views are that planning in the past, present and future in any built-up area must include a number of very important items.  It should be mandatory on local authorities and consequently on the builder&mdash;I do not want to interfere with the concept of private enterprise&mdash;to include in their plans for a built-up area, whether it be a private or local authority estate, a community centre and adequate open space surrounding that centre.  If we are sincere about integrating our old people <Col N="1671" /> into the community&mdash;in some areas we have a high aged population, not necessarily in newly built-up areas&mdash;we should have a special care centre for them.  Equally important, we should have creches for those women who want to go out to work, as is their constitutional entitlement, in which to leave their children during the day.</P>
    <P>These are some of the ingredients which should be included in the planning of a housing estate.  One does not build a housing estate and say &ldquo;We have built 150 or 200 houses and so say all of us&rdquo; and go on to the next project.  That is not what a housing estate should be about.  It should be a thriving community with these additional features.  One hears very often in suburban and city areas that people do not know their next-door neighbours. One hears of people who have been living beside one another for months, or possibly years, and they never get to know their neighbours. The reason for that is a lack of community awareness and community facilities.</P>
    <P>We are discussing now the published report of the educational sub-committee of the Ballyfermot Community Association. Among other things, the report requests the Government to initiate as a matter of urgency, a special programme to provide employment and educational opportunities in Ballyfermot and in other areas of Dublin city where a similar need exists.  As I said yesterday, as a Dublin man I am concerned with any part of the city or county of Dublin.  As a representative of a constituency, elected and sent to this House, one's first duty lies in one's constituency.  I know from experience that throughout the city and county of Dublin similar problems exist but that is no consolation to the people of Ballyfermot.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary suggested, again as an extension of the budget, that there will be a number of youth employment programmes, employment premium schemes and so on.  We wish him and his Government in the national interest the best of luck so far as the success of those programmes is concerned.  Like the <Col N="1672" /> phantom community centre on the Harp site, we suspect that this time next year we will be talking about a considerably worse unemployment situation. The real problem is that while the youth unemployment is a national malaise, it is, nevertheless, a city and county disease in the sense that there is a greater burden on the youth in the Dublin city and county areas than in any other part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is not in any way to under-rate the problems which relate to other areas but the greater burden of youth unemployment is in the Dublin city and county area.  This is a very worthwhile report and is a document of high sociological value.  It indicates that the youth unemployment situation in the Ballyfermot area is extremely serious and it has one of the highest elements of unemployed school leavers in the city and county of Dublin.  This is an indictment of something or somebody and one has only to look around to see who is responsible.  In the final analysis the buck stops with the Government.  This is what motivated the Fianna Fáil Party in tabling this Private Members' motion.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up the time of the House but I want to remind the Parliamentary Secretary once more that we need, first of all, adequate facilities.  We need good facilities in which to educate our children.  The psychologists will tell us the kind of accommodation we need.  I am not an expert in that field although I know what my own children need in the context of educational facilities and I certainly believe they have such facilities at the national school which the two youngest children attend.  Having provided proper facilities, the proper number of class rooms and proper utensils for the pursuit of learning then there must be an appropriate number of children in each class.  I understand from an expert that the appropriate number for the correct teaching of children is 25, at the maximum.  The Parliamentary Secretary might remember that in quite a number of cases in Dublin city and county there are classes where there are 35, 40 or 45 children being taught by one teacher. This is a problem for a young teacher who may be just out of a teacher training <Col N="1673" /> college.  He or she must establish authority, though it must be very difficult in a class of 45.  The reality of such a situation is that the teacher spends most of the time attempting to control the class to the detriment of the learning process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In such a class of 45 children there may be a number of slow learners.  They go through the murder machine, as Pearse would have it, due to the fact that they are overlooked in the context of such a large number of children.  It is the system which is at fault and only the Government can cure those faults.  We on this side of the House would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take the view that the resolution was motivated in a sincere fashion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to commence my contribution this evening by commending the Ballyfermot Community Association on the social awareness and concern which is so evident in their 1976 survey of education and employment opportunities for school leavers.  The on-going involvement of this association in social issues affecting the Ballyfermot area is very well known and is a fine example of what community self-help can and should be all about.  They are to be congratulated particularly on the comprehensive scope of the 1976 survey, which not only sets out the basic facts on the massive problems of education and unemployment we face in this area but which seeks to place these problems in the overall context of the economy where the real decisions are made as to who gets what, when and where in our society.  They have shown that they are interested in the causes as well as the effects of the problems facing the people of Ballyfermot and the nation as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The survey is most interesting in tracing the educational and employment opportunities and experiences of a random sample of school leavers. These school leavers were in the system in 1969.  What is significant is <Col N="1674" /> the fact that the report reveals the existence of what I would call a massive education gap, a gap between the education opportunity in Ballyfermot and that in the wealthier communities and also a gap between the course content of education and the demands of the working world. According to the survey, 69 per cent of the school leavers had left the education system before reaching the age of 16 and only 5.6 per cent had obtained the leaving certificate.  These statistics are corroborated in the 1972 study of educational opportunity in Dublin by Father Michael McGreil which showed that only 14.5 per cent of the people in Ballyfermot had been able to continue their education beyond primary school, while in another housing area&mdash;geographically not ten miles away but socially over 1,000&mdash; we find that 75.6 per cent of the people have been able to avail of post primary education.  To me this gap of 60 per cent in the margin of educational opportunity in our society is a damning indictment of our system. The Ballyfermot Community Association survey showed that the intermediate certificate had little relevance, if any, to employment opportunities, particularly in the case of girl school leavers, most of whom were found to be working in unskilled or semi-skilled employment.  The survey also showed that those with vocational education had wider opportunities.</P>
    <P>Even more revealing was the fact that 75 per cent of these people had no career guidance whatsoever and a large majority of those in the sample felt that their present employment bore no relationship to what they had done at school.  These are the signs of the growing gap between the world of education and the world of work which is making it even more difficult even for those who are able to obtain a general or intermediate certificate to find gainful or useful employment.</P>
    <P>Besides the other problems which were highlighted by the survey it also showed that 42 per cent lived in houses with ten people or more, again showing the terrible disadvantage of people in this area.  The conclusions are that the education gap should be <Col N="1675" /> bridged by the following measures and it is very important to put them on the record of this House.  First, there must be a new emphasis on vocational education through the building of this community college on the Harp site and the establishment of a voluntary local education authority.  Ballyfermot must be made an educational priority area and a comprehensive grants system must be introduced covering all third level education and unemployment among school leavers, which the survey places at 23 per cent, must be tackled.</P>
    <P>The problem of providing the young people of Ballyfermot with relevant education and suitable employment is hardly new.  Indeed, the Ballyfermot Community Association published the first report of their education sub-committee in January, 1972 and they followed that with a second report in July, 1972.  These reports covered the same problems highlighted in their 1976 survey.  They were lack of vocational education for girls, a huge drop out rate in primary and post-primary level and the need for a new revised community orientated curriculum. One of the major recommendations in these reports was a community college with genuine community involvement. The project is only now under way.  At that time I did not notice a flurry of activity in the Fianna Fáil camp aimed at solving these problems.  We must remember that they were highlighted in 1969 and 1972.  Nobody can convince me that these were not pressing problems in 1972 just as nobody can convince me that they are not pressing problems in 1977.</P>
    <P>The problems which school-leavers are presently facing are a direct consequence of the economic and social policies of past as well as present governments.  To attempt to cloud this in a shower of party political propaganda is an insult to the intelligence of the people of Ballyfermot.  I feel it is rank opportunism.  It makes the problem of youth, youth education and youth unemployment a political football to be kicked back and forth between Government and Opposition <Col N="1676" /> benches.  The trouble is that politicians become distracted by petty, political point-scoring while the youth of the country are left simmering in discontent in the face of the continued disinterest and neglect on the part of the establishment.</P>
    <P>My concern is with what is presently being done to alleviate the problems of youth, which are so clearly placed before us by this survey and how I can bring my weight to bear so that more and more is done to rectify what to me seems a scandalous situation where over the years, in good times as well as bad, the young people of Ballyfermot have been denied the educational and employment opportunities which should be theirs as of right.  I am not breaking a confidence in saying that in July last year, in common with Members of the Parliamentary Labour Party, I was asked to submit proposals for initiatives on the problems facing the country.  Each Member did so.  I put forward the following proposals:</P>
    <P>(1)  The Employment Premium Scheme should be targeted more directly on our most pressing problem, the unemployed school-leavers.</P>
    <P>(2)  Employers should be given an added incentive to hire school-leavers by raising the age level at which social insurance has to be paid, that is from 16 to 21 years, as an incentive to employers to employ school leavers.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Government should encourage a programme of phased early retirement at no loss of pay to open up places for youth in the job market.</P>
    <P>(4)  We should institute an emergency public works programme on the basis of Local Authority (Improvement) Schemes where direct labour could be employed in community projects.</P>
    <P>(5)  As an immediate emergency measure certain educationally disadvantaged urban districts, including my area, where a recent study showed that only 14.5 per cent of the people had advanced beyond the primary school level, should be declared educational priority areas <Col N="1677" /> and educational funds should be diverted to their relief on a preferential basis.</P>
    <P>What is being done at the moment? I am not here to talk party political propaganda about the recent budget. I will say what is being done and what should be done.  The £50 million job creation programme had included in it £4.1 million for new premium employment schemes, including a premium employment scheme for school-leavers whereby an employer in most industries who hires a school-leaver is paid a subsidy of £10 a week. A total of £1½ million is also being allocated for an expansion of the community youth training programme and the introduction of other schemes directed at increasing job opportunity for school-leavers.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on education is to increase by £21 million in addition to this and a special allocation of £1.8 million is being made to cover the cost of recruiting 1,100 new teachers for posts in first and second level schools, mainly in the Dublin area.  These special budget allocations show that the Dublin area is finally being recognised as an emergency priority in terms of education and employment for young people.</P>
    <P>The student teacher ratios in Dublin have long been at variance with those of the rest of the country.  They constitute a disincentive for children in urban areas at a most crucial stage in their educational programme.  It is time that measures were taken to bring the student-teacher ratio into some kind of balance.  The community youth training programme and the school-leaver employment schemes should concentrate on the Dublin area and bring some relief to school-leavers suffering through an endemic situation of urban unemployment.</P>
    <P>The trend in these allocations is correct, directed as they are to school-leavers and also to the Dublin area. In turn, the implications of these measures will have to be monitored to ensure that the greatest assistance goes to the areas of greatest need. The educational and employment incentive measures must concentrate on <Col N="1678" /> areas such as Ballyfermot, where a survey like the one conducted by the BCA has so clearly shown statistics of social need.  I feel very pleased that the budget measures have incorporated two specific proposals of mine but I believe, however, that much more remains to be done.</P>
    <P>The proposal of mine for early retirement merits further consideration by the Government and also the trade unions.  I have been talking about this early retirement to make way for school-leavers for nearly three years. Britain have decided to introduce it and I do not see why we should not consider it as a matter of priority.  The Government should consider an emergency allocation for a community works programme, giving the local character to such an initiative.  In this would be small local industries with AnCO involvement and special grants from the IDA.  This would have an immediate effect on the morale of the unemployed school-leavers.  The discrimination against female school-leavers should be eliminated by amending the 52 stamp requirement for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education must reassess the relative importance of vocational versus secondary education particularly in areas where educational opportunities have been limited and unemployment has been prominent. The Department of Education, in conjunction with the Economic and Social Research Institute, should undertake a through study of the manpower needs of Irish industry and relate the distribution of scarce educational resources to the areas which offer the greatest employment potential for young people.  The educational bureaucracy must give way to a reasonable degree of community control through parent and teacher imput.  The suggestion in the BCA survey of a local voluntary educational authority merits our full support since the teachers and the parents have a right and also an obligation to ensure that course content is relative to the real needs of young people in society.  I would like to see this as a co-ordinating body within the area so that there could be a sharing of the facilities. One member of the BCA said that <Col N="1679" /> up there they have all links but no chain.</P>
    <P>The access of young women to vocational education must be expanded if women are ever to shake off the shackles of second-class citizenship in the world at large.  The construction of the community college on the Harp site in Ballyfermot represents real progress on the vocational school front and it must be met with a reciprocal commitment at junior school level so that vocational education for girls can be provided at the junior cycle.  The establishment of the academic council, as suggested by the BCA, should provide an excellent means to this end.</P>
    <P>In addition to these measures and proposals I have also been directing my efforts in support of the publication of the Government's youth policy and increased financial support for voluntary youth organisations.  Our youth clubs have a major role to play in providing access to informal second-chance education, a crucial social service given the fantastically high dropout level in the formal education system.  The failure of the Department of Education to increase the grant-in-aid to youth and sporting organisations was shortsighted and should be rectified at the earliest possible moment.  I have always maintained that youth should have the highest priority and I reiterate my proposal that the Government appoint a Minister for Youth Affairs who would operate as a youth advocate at the highest Government level.  This would bring the youth lobby into the Cabinet room.</P>
    <P>The problem of youth is not solely the problem of the Department.  The provision of relevant education and suitable employment is a key task but so also is the expansion of access which youth has to society.  I believe that trade union officials, churchmen and educators must all learn to make way for more participation of young people in the affairs of their organisations. This is an important matter and we must recognise it.  It is about time that we had student representatives on the boards of our secondary schools; youth councils sitting with the Hierarchy; young people appointed as trade <Col N="1680" /> union executives and youth members sitting on the administrative councils of our political parties.  We must understand that we cannot demand responsibility without allocating power.  The youth of Ireland will feel responsible for their society in direct proportion to the amount of power they share in it. We all have an obligation to open up Ireland to our youth.  We have the largest youth population in Western Europe and for that reason we should start soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter and Deputy Dowling is to be congratulated on highlighting the problems which confront the people of Ballyfermot and similar areas in Dublin.  I should like to congratulate the community in Ballyfermot who carried out this survey because it reveals startling information which might prove useful to the Government.  It outlines the real problems in the area.  These problems were not highlighted up to now to the proper extent and other communities should carry out a similar survey in their areas.  The figures ascertained in such surveys are very helpful.  When I read this report I found it hard to believe that such a situation exists in Dublin.</P>
      <P>We are all aware that education gives equal opportunity and without education people are deprived of a fundamental factor.  The survey carried out in that area indicates that certain sections in the community are victimised because of lack of these facilities.  It is the duty of everybody, particularly the Government, to ensure that this imbalance is rectified as soon as possible.  The constituency I represent has similar problems to those that exist in Ballyfermot.  There are many overcrowded schools and the pupil-teacher ratio has not been rectified to date.  I am sure that the Minister told us, when introducing the budget, that he was allocating additional money for this purpose but my information is that a sufficient number of qualified primary school teachers will not be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as the drawbacks in the educational field the report also highlights <Col N="1681" /> difficulties in the employment sector.  We should be ashamed of the figures highlighted in that report. These figures reflect the incompetence of the Government to create a proper climate for employment.  Plans should have been formulated to cater for Dublin.  I welcome the changes made by the IDA but without proper planning and the introduction of a scheme for the establishment of small industries I do not know how this problem can be rectified.  The centre of the city is being depopulated and only a few minor rehousing schemes have been carried out.  There are many facilities which could be utilised in a better way.  Many old schools are in urgent need of repair.  We need to bring life back to the city and the only way that can be done is for the Government to build more acceptable houses.  It is also necessary that small industries be established in the centre of the city because it is not suitable for large industry.</P>
    <P>On the question of employment we must also consider the transport system.  I have always maintained that people should live as near as possible to the place where they work but we find that the majority of our industries are on the perimeter of the city.  That is desirable where large industries are concerned.  The great industrial expansion in the Ballyfermot area took place under a Fianna Fáil Government and had that impetus been kept up the unemployment figures highlighted in the report would have been a great deal less.</P>
    <P>We have gone through four years of stagnation during which thousands of young and middle-aged people were made redundant.  It is terrible to see a married man of about 45 years of age with four or five children being told that he is being made redundant. The Government should direct their attention to this problem because such men find it very difficult to get alternative employment.  There is plenty of work for those in the 20 to 30 age group but the man over 40 encounters greater obstacles.  In this regard I have often criticised local authorities who stipulate that people over 45 years of age are not eligible to start work with <Col N="1682" /> them.  Local authorities should make an effort to employ such people.  Such bodies should be highlighting this situation and encouraging others to employ middle-aged married men who are made redundant.</P>
    <P>I accept that many of the redundancies which have taken place were inevitable but many could have been avoided if there was a proper Government fiscal policy.  Many people were made redundant because inflation was allowed to get out of hand.  Thousands would still be in employment if our economic policies had been handled in a proper way by the Government.  I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the budget estimate in 1976 for the construction industry was £119.47 million but only £105.15 million of that amount was spent.  That £14 million could have been used to create employment in the construction industry.  The Government failed to encourage builders to take up this money which would serve two purposes, make homes available to those living in appalling conditions and create new jobs.  The same position exists in relation to the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce. In 1976, £119 million was voted for that Department but only £95 million was spent.  That surplus should have been used to generate employment.  The Minister for Finance in his budget speech told us that expenditure on the capital programme in 1976 was £554 million, 9 per cent, or £52 million less than the budget estimate.  He told us that the difference between the budget estimate and the actual expenditure did not in any way result in a financial cutback.  The money was there but the demand was not for it and he told us there was a saving of £29 million.  How could anybody call that a &ldquo;saving&rdquo;.  It is not a saving; it is a reflection on the ability of the present Administration if people are not prepared to take up that money. It is a reflection on the policies pursued by the Government which have discouraged the private sector and capital investment.</P>
    <P>Thousands of young people are-walking around the city unemployed because of the mishandling of our economic policies by the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1683" /> Many of those who left school last year are still seeking employment.  It is a disastrous situation.  It is the duty of a Government to provide employment for school-leavers.  The thousands who will complete their schooling this year have a right to employment here but I doubt if they will succeed because the Government have not tried to rectify the disastrous situation in relation to employment.  I do not wish to make a political football out of this, I just want to put the facts before the House.  Until the Government direct their attention to the real problems facing us we will not achieve success. The greatest issue facing us is the unemployment of our young people.</P>
    <P>Young people unemployed for three or four years after leaving school become demoralised.  Another problem is that there are no proper amenities for the young people who have not employment.  The Minister for Labour should make use of AnCO in this regard. Those young boys and girls could be taken into training centres and kept occupied.  While the money made available by the Minister for Finance in January will help it will not solve the problem mentioned in the report.  We must encourage employers to take on more employees.  There is a concept building up in manufacturing industry towards capital intensive industries.</P>
    <P>If that kind of situation continues what hope is there for our young people?  We will have to encourage labour intensive industries and in doing so we must ensure the creation of the right environment.  Time and again we have warned Ministers against taxing labour because that discourages employers taking on more workers.  Yet with every budget social welfare contributions are increased. They are a tax on labour but the Minister for Finance continues to pursue the negative policy of increasing social welfare contributions.  That sort of policy will never solve the problem of rising unemployment.  It has not done so any year in the past four years.</P>
    <P>The FUE, industrialists and economists advised the Minister to do everything he could to lower the costs <Col N="1684" /> of manufacture.  Social welfare contributions, increased postal and telephone charges and so on all add to the costs of manufacture and militate against the creation of more jobs.  The benefit of a reduction in corporation profits tax will be eaten away and manufacturers will be back to square one.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary will have a difficult task in providing for our young people the education to which they are entitled. He should not pinpoint any particular area and above all we must do all in our power to ensure we do not end up with first class and second class citizens. That would be a negation of democracy.</P>
    <P>I realise the difficulties but the difficulties are not insurmountable.  Where there is overcrowding in the home surely it should be possible to accommodate students in schools where they could study.  I know the overcrowding that exists.  Opening the schools again in the evening would cost something but that expenditure would ultimately pay a handsome dividend in a better educated community.  Young people would study in an environment in which they could concentrate.  They cannot do the impossible in overcrowded conditions.  If steps are not taken to solve the problem the present unsatisfactory trend will continue.</P>
    <P>Planning and the creation of jobs are by and large the responsibility of the Government.  So is the creation of the right environment.  The Government have failed in this respect over the last four years.  There is a road problem and concommitant with that there is a transport problem in our capital city. Traffic is almost stagnant.  That will not encourage industry into the city. I blame the Minister for Local Government for doing nothing to improve the situation.  Amenities cannot be provided unless there is a proper foundation. Evidently the Minister for Local Government thinks that in doing nothing he is doing his duty.  I would like to see the centre city area properly developed.  At the moment it is desolate. Unless there is a properly planned development of roads, industries, schools, community centres and so on there can be no proper progress. We have failed miserably in this <Col N="1685" /> respect for a number of years past.  The Government have failed to tackle the problems and their greatest failure has been their inability to provide employment for young people.  It is no use educating children if when they are educated there are no job opportunities for them.  Today thousands of our young people are without the employment to which they are entitled. Naturally they feel frustrated and they frequent longer bars and pool halls.  They were not educated to do that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling has done the House and the people a service by highlighting this problem.  All of us are concerned about the welfare of our youth because in years to come they will be the people who will be directing the affairs of this country.  Unless we make provision for them what hope is there for this country in eight or ten years' time?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>First I should like to offer my congratulations to the Ballyfermot Community Association not just on the publication of this report but on the previous reports.  In particular I should like to express my regard for the Chairman of the educational committee, Tommy Phelan, whose introduction prefaces this report.</P>
      <P>The report is a serious and scientific study of the problems of one of the major Dublin communities and it demonstrates on the part of the people of Ballyfermot an unusual social and community consciousness.  The report correctly puts the problem of education, with which it specifically deals, within the general economic context. In this country we have always had high unemployment.  It is not something that has happened in the last three years.  The report indicates that one quarter of the sample surveyed were unemployed.  We have always had overcrowding in houses.  The people who live in Ballyfermot now came from the worst housing conditions in Europe.  This report indicates that 42 per cent live in houses in which there are ten or more people, a damning indictment of every housing policy which has been carried on by every Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1686" /> There has always been discrimination in opportunities; there has always been inequality of opportunity.  It has not just occurred in the last three years.  This report indicates that 69 per cent of those surveyed left school at 15 years and that only one person out of the entire survey went to university. There have always been serious income differentials which lead to the kind of injustice and inequality highlighted in the report.  Until quite recently there has always been emigration. In the past it went to solve the kind of problems with which we are now confronted.  I reckon that out of the people who emigrated in the last 16 years of Fianna Fáil rule approximately 2,700 emigrated from the Ballyfermot area.  That is the way the unemployment problem was solved.</P>
    <P>The report spells out the evils which have always characterised our system. In particular it highlights the discrimination against women; 41 per cent were engaged in unskilled work, 69 per cent left school at 15 years compared with 41 per cent of the boys, 20 per cent of the mothers were at work and 89 per cent of those working wives were in unskilled work.  Many of them were doing this work against their wishes but were doing so because of economic necessity.</P>
    <P>Important to the Department, whose primary concern this report is, is the fact that on page 10 it contains a damning indictment of the educational system particularly in respect of the courses.  The report states:</P>
    <P>For many parents and probably teachers education is still geared essentially for future academic achievement in universities or other third level institutions and the orientation of many courses indicates that teachers do not look closely at the relationship between what they teach and the social reality for pupils of their later job opportunities in life.</P>
    <P>The social reality was that one child in the survey went on to university.  Add to that the discrimination against the children of this area to gain access to third-level education and we have a pretty damning indictment of what happens at second-level education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1687" /> The report does more than that.  It points out that even if the barriers of limited access to third-level education, particularly university education, for working people were broken down there is no clear evidence to suggest that many working-class people would take the opportunity if presented.  This is for a number of reasons, varying from the economic need for extra income, parental attitudes and the needs of young people themselves.  It also spells out the indisputable fact that the major orientation of education in teaching people to make the step to university is in many ways not applicable to the desires and possibilities of young people in working-class areas such as Ballyfermot.  For that reason the BCA Report puts forward positive proposals not only in regard to the type of education needed for the area but also in regard to the structures that would help to facilitate its advent.</P>
    <P>In his introduction on page 1 of the report the chairman of the educational committee spells out what he regards as fundamental.  He states:</P>
    <P>Another major recommendation of our July, 1972 report was that an Educational Authority be set up for Ballyfermot; however the silence on this topic to date has been deafening. An educational Authority would bring all people involved in education, from pre-school to post-primary, together to pursue and implement new relevant education programmes for Ballyfermot.</P>
    <P>I believe this proposal is not only relevant but is absolutely necessary and should be implemented with the least possible delay.  As I understand the concept it is based on a voluntary principle. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider supporting proposals of this sort in a positive way. We know that money is short and resources are scarce but perhaps there could be even the minimum secretarial assistance offered to such authority which would bring together all the school facilities in the area, ensure co-ordination and the best use of scarce resources.  At the moment there is too much fragmentation and waste.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1688" /> The BCA Report also suggests the use of community work projects centered around small industries, involving the people of the community, using their skills and talents rather than waiting for work to appear through some outside agency acting in a benevolent fashion.  The people in this area are quite convinced that they have all the necessary skills and talents within their community. What they want is the same help and assistance which is given to private <i>entrepreneurs</i> and they also require that special grants should be made for community work projects using the IDA and AnCO in conjunction with local community organisations.  That proposal is another indication of the community consciousness which permeates this report. If that aspect is not seen the later proposal has very little meaning in conventional terms.  The report is not conventional because it was written by ordinary people.  It was not written by business consultants, solely motivated by the profit motive.  It was written by people who want to see their children put to work.</P>
    <P>There is also a piea in the report for the promotion of continuing education. It is very encouraging to note that the survey indicates that 54 per cent of those surveyed said that if given the opportunity they would do part-time courses.  Of course we are not going to solve the kind of problems highlighted here, the problems of discrimination because of economic inequalities unless we can help to redress those inequalities by increasing the scope for continuing education, by helping those who had to leave the system at 15 years, often because of economic necessity, to get back into the educational system and to avail of opportunities.</P>
    <P>It is highly encouraging to note that 54 per cent of the people surveyed said they would attend part-time courses if given the opportunity.  That statistic is the most powerful argument that could be put forward in favour of a voluntary education authority. The investment in education is already there but it is underutilised, particularly during holiday periods. Many of those children if given the <Col N="1689" /> opportunity have the capacity for third-level education and to be equal to if not better than other classes. It is most damning that access to third-level education relates to income instead of to intelligence.  The report points out that if children of their class want third-level education they must have a higher number of leaving certificate honours than children of parents who can afford third-level education.  We should not tolerate that kind of discrimination.</P>
    <P>The Government's budget proposals, to which the amendment refers, are a start in dealing with the problems highlighted in the survey.  I would not go so far as to say they are the answer to the problems but they are a start. The employment premium scheme for school leavers of £4.1 million is a welcome innovation and will be a real help.  So too will the extra money devoted to increasing the number of teachers.  As Deputy O'Connell pointed out, the root of much of the discrimination against children in working-class areas is that there is a higher pupil/teacher ratio than in other areas.  These are the areas for extra teachers at primary level because that is where discrimination begins; that is where difficulties arise where reading and writing difficulties emerge which last through a person's lifetime and which often prevent him from taking opportunities to which his intelligence would normally entitle him.  We must pour money into this type of area to reduce the pupil/teacher ratio at primary level and to overcome the problems generated by children of large families being unable to study through lack of space.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy O'Connell said with regard to appointing a Minister for youth problems.  As Bishop Birch said last weekend, we are sitting on a time bomb in regard to our young population.  It is a fact that 48 per cent of the population is under 25 years of age.  The report of NESC on population projections, which was prepared by Professor Brendan Walsh, contains frightening statistics.  It is in areas such as Ballyfermot that the worst impact of the population explosion will be felt.  The BCA Report <Col N="1690" /> makes the point that in the current crisis Dublin has suffered the worst effects and must now be regarded as a priority area.  The whole country is experiencing the same problems but they are accentuated in the Dublin area.  That is why we should have priority programmes for such areas. In addition Governments must recognise that unless we devise special programmes for youth, not only in economic and social areas but in many other areas as well, we shall be beset by political and social problems which may be beyond our capacity to solve, particularly when the traditional safety valve of emigration has been closed. The BCA Report highlights the fact that applications received by AnCO were three times greater than the number of places available in 1975. These applicants must also pass the GATB test which discriminates against those with reading and writing difficulties.  In other words, the injustice and discrimination that starts at primary level is continued when the child tries to enter a profession.  He then winds up in an unskilled job which is underpaid.  His children follow the same route and the vicious spiral is continued.  That is not a product of the past three years.  It is a product of the system that has been permitted to continue for 50 years.</P>
    <P>The great value of this report is that the people who produced it have scientifically analysed the type of society in which they live.  New approaches are needed to these problems and the BCA Report points the way.  Its existence proves that new approaches are possible.  We should permit the greatest possible degree of decentralisation in our various services. One of our curses has been over-centralisation of services and the belief that everything can be decided by a centralised bureaucracy.  My belief is that local people know local problems best.  Government services should be brought to people in a decentralised fashion.  Local people should be given the opportunity to solve their problems in a supporting role rather than a paternalistic one.  Perhaps we should consider dividing Dublin into community areas with their own elected councils.  For example, the Dublin <Col N="1691" /> Corporation is too big an entity to deal with the problems confronting the people of Ballyfermot.</P>
    <P>The BCA Report proves that local people have the intelligence to identify and analyse their problems and to propose solutions.  The people who produced this report are worthy of the congratulations of this House for its thoroughness, scientific nature and the seriousness of its proposals.  It should be highlighted as a new approach to democracy.  I hope we will assist by elevating this debate above party politics.  We are dealing with a community whose only desire is to see many of their problems solved as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am greatly pleased by the amount of discussion that has taken place.  I believe that the Ballyfermot survey is a best-seller.  A large number of people have asked me for copies of the survey within the last two days.  This document has been photocopied 20 times in two days.  I am disappointed that the Government put forward an amendment that does not meet the situation.  The motion reads:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the recently published survey of the Educational Sub-Committee of the Ballyfermot Community Association and requests the Government to initiate as a matter of urgency a special programme to provide employment and educational opportunities in Ballyfermot and in other areas of Dublin city where a similar need exists.</P>
      <P>That is what we want instead of being told that all is well because of the recent budget.  Deputies O'Connell and Halligan have said that much of the blame lies elsewhere.  Action is required on this important matter.  I want to make a distinction between the availability of educational opportunities and the standard of education achieved by young people in Ballyfermot who have distinguished themselves in this field and have obtained positions of trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with the point made by Deputy Halligan with regard to third level education.  Recently, in a debate in this House Deputy Tunney and Deputy Wilson, our spokesman <Col N="1692" /> on Education raised this matter. Giving statistics Deputy Tunney said only 75 students in Dublin had got third level education grants; the VEC give another 100 or so.  Therefore the total number of grants in Dublin was 175.  The Minister stated in the course of the discussion the other day that the total number for the whole country was 6,000.  Dublin is being discriminated against, receiving 175 grants out of 6,000 in an area that contains one-third of the population.  The figure of 75 mentioned by Deputy Tunney was not repudiated, and I can well understand the statistics here that indicate that only one from the sample went to university, because of the discrimination against them at income level and otherwise.  We know that a man with a medical card or on the dole would not qualify for the full grant.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned last night, there is absolute neglect in regard to the provision of educational facilities in Ballyfermot, notwithstanding the fact that over the years the previous Minister, Mr. Burke, indicated that certain remedial measures would be taken to deal with this situation.  I gave a classic example last night of art students now housed in a prefab who have to carry buckets of water across to the art class.  In what other country in Europe or in the world would art students have to do that?  It is high time to fulfil the promises that have been made in regard to providing the necessary facilities.</P>
    <P>The teachers need great sympathy in this situation.  The pupil-teacher ratio has been mentioned on many occasions. It is about time special attention was given to certain areas where there are problems and where the problems have been pointed out time and time again to the Minister and his Department. When we write to the Department about Ballyfermot we get comprehensive replies as to what the Department intend to do, but children must suffer in the meantime and children have suffered by the neglect of the Department of Education.  I put down a question in relation to this report no later than last December, when I asked the Minister for Education the plans he had on hand to <Col N="1693" /> solve the serious problems indicated in the survey of the Ballyfermot Association.</P>
    <P>In the course of supplementary questions I pressed him to give an undertaking that he would regard Ballyfermot as a priority area.  The Minister replied that it did not appear to him that it would be desirable to interrupt the flow of fruitful co-operation and to make a declaration of an educational priority area by providing a special local education authority as recommended in the survey.  That is the policy of the Minister.  The situation that is indicated by this report is all too serious to be cast aside by a pronouncement of this nature.  Now that the matter has been aired fully and effectively in the House by all shades of political opinion, I hope the Minister will come to his senses and ensure that this area, together with other areas in Dublin city, will get the opportunities they deserve and that where there are defects in the system due to neglect these defects will be remedied at the earliest possible <Col N="1694" /> moment.  Promises are no use.  Urgent action is required.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to go out to Ballyfermot to see for themselves and then make up their own minds rather than reject this motion by a vote.  He should go out to the area, interview the school managers, the school-teachers, the pupils and the parents and find out their reactions.  Let him find out if the facts as stated in the survey are correct.  I assure the Minister he will get the utmost co-operation from the politicians and from the other people concerned, including the Ballyfermot Community Association.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government again to set up, as a matter of urgency, an independent committee to examine the content of the survey with special attention to education, employment, and housing and to make the necessary financial assistance available to meet the needs of the community in solving distress in conjunction with the Ballyfermot Community Association.  That is what I want and what they want.</P>

      <P>It is impossible to define with precision what is meant by the phrase in the Deputy's question &ldquo;construction-type proposals now on hand and at advanced planning stages&rdquo;.  Moreover, the prospective availability of resources would normally have a major influence on the pace at which the planning of projects is progressed towards completion. It can, however, be said in general that in so far as public works are concerned the proposals which are at an advanced planning stage are those which are provided for in the expenditure allocations for 1977.</P>
      <P>When account is taken of the conditional job-creation package which I announced in my budget statement, the total provision in the 1977 capital programme affecting the building and construction industry is expected to show an increase of about £55 million or 19 per cent compared to 1976.  Much of the work of the industry is commissioned and funded from private sources. Taking more money from these sources by taxation, borrowing or otherwise to fund public works will not in the longer term necessarily raise the total output of the industry or increase the amount of self-sustaining employment which it can provide.</P>
      <P>In view of the answer to the first part of the question, the second part does not arise.</P>

        <i>Cavan):</i> I am informed by the Electricity Supply <Col N="1605" /> Board that 15 to 20 householders in the Ballingeary area were connected to the electricity supply before Christmas.  It was necessary to suspend work after Christmas because of the severe weather conditions; it is expected, however, that the work will recommence next week and will be completed by April next.</P>
