      <P>In the Minister's absence yesterday I requested a copy <Col N="144" /> of the agreement which is referred to five or six times in this otherwise rather short and innocuous Bill and without which the Bill is entirely meaningless.  It would be impossible to debate the Bill or what lies under it without this agreement.  Not alone should one get the agreement, which is the first necessity, but one should get all the submissions which were made to the arbitrators, in order that a full and meaningful debate on this very important issue could be held in the House.  I am sure the Minister has been made aware of my frequent requests for the agreement in this House yesterday and on the telephone to his private secretary on two or three occasions over the past few days.  I would have expected that this morning the Minister would have made the position regarding the agreement and its availability clear.  I would ask him, in view of his failure to do that already, to do so now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Opposition spokesman is requesting is a complete breach with all the accepted traditions, practice and the legal position that have obtained in this House in regard to agreements between the Government and private commercial companies.  Deputy O'Malley was never left in any doubt that we did not intend to provide this agreement. I do not propose to treat an Irish company differently from a large range of international companies, some in mining, some in other areas of national resources, some in industry. I do not propose to breach a practice which was very largely, in regard to the legislation and the operation of it, established by the Opposition, and which I think is a reasonable practice and one I propose to continue.  I was not, under existing legislation, obliged to bring this matter to the Dáil.  I did so because I want a full debate.  I will introduce the Second Stage very fully, and I will reply to the Second Stage as fully as it is in the interest of the Irish mining industry and the Irish people to do.  However, I am not prepared to breach what has been the accepted practice down the years, and I am not prepared to differentiate against one particular <Col N="145" /> company.  It would be disadvantageous to the development not just of mining but of the whole of our commercial and industrial practice.</P>

      <P>This is an incredible situation, which is without precedent in the history of this House.  The Minister has purported on the 11th December, 1975, to enter into an agreement to purchase shares from a private limited company in this country in circumstances that we can only guess at, even though we are asked in this House by legislation to ratify that agreement.  No Parliament should be put in this degrading position.  We have to approve, on behalf of the people and on behalf of the Exchequer, of something we have never seen.  The Members of this House have never been asked to approve of something they never saw, and I suggest that no Parliament in any civilised country has ever been asked to approve of something it never saw. It should be remembered that this is not just a refusal as of this morning by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to publish this agreement to the Members of the House.  This refusal this morning should be seen in the context of a threat by the Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce last month, on the instructions of the Minister, to a newspaper&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, the Minister is responsible.  A threat, on the instructions of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to a newspaper in this city that if it published certain facts or information about the arrangements between the Minister and the company concerned, the Official Secrets Act would be invoked to prevent any further publication and to prosecute the newspaper concerned.</P>

      <P>I am not debating the merits of the Bill now, nor can I or anyone else in this House debate the merits of the Bill next week, if it is ordered for next week, unless we have the agreement, which is referred to in six places in what is otherwise a short and innocuous Bill.  It is pointless ordering this Bill for next Tuesday or, indeed, for next year unless the agreement is forthcoming in order that some reasonable and worthwhile debate can take place in relation to it.  An agreement between the Minister and the company for the purchase of shares in the company could be a huge, complex, technical document which could contain dozens of covenants and conditions on the part of the Minister which would be very onerous and which might well cause this House to reject the agreement and not give it its approval.  As things stand, we do not know what is in the agreement, and it is monstrous that we are placed in this position by the Minister, that he has the incredible cheek to ask us as representatives of the Irish people to approve of something that he himself is ashamed to publish.  In the circumstances, one is entitled to ask what he is hiding.</P>

Bills and Estimates could be discussed <Col N="148" /> year after year without the publication of agreements.

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), to delete lines 39 to 50 and substitute the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  in lieu of such secretary or officer, any person who in the opinion of such secretary or officer is capable of carrying out the functions of returning officer and is acceptable to a majority of the employees of the body.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an interpretation of who I believe should be the returning officer, the officer responsible in section 7, which deals with the appointment of a returning officer.  Subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>As regards a designated body, the returning officer for the purposes of this Act shall be&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the secretary of the body, or in case there is no such secretary, the officer of the body who performs the functions of secretary of the body, or</P>
      <P>(b) in lieu of such secretary or officer, any other person who in the opinion of such secretary or officer is acceptable to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) a trade union or other body of persons which the returning officer is satisfied is both recognised by the designated body for the purposes of collective bargaining and representative of a majority of the employees of the body, or</P>
      <P>(ii) two or more trade unions or other bodies of persons which the returning officer is satisfied between them collectively represent the majority of such employees and as regards each of which the returning officer is satisfied that the body is so recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (b) is somewhat unwieldy, passing away the appointment from the two people who may or may not agree.  This in my opinion would mean that in a general election or local election situation or, indeed, in a presidential <Col N="151" /> election situation the returning officer would be appointed on the basis that he was acceptable to the Coalition parties or Fianna Fáil.  I do not think that would be right and this is why I move my amendment, which reads:</P>
    <P>In page 5, subsection (1), to delete lines 39 to 50 and substitute the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b)  in lieu of such secretary or officer, any person who in the opinion of such secretary or officer is capable of carrying out the functions of returning officer and is acceptable to a majority of the employees of the body.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will ask how one can judge whether such a person would be acceptable to the majority of employees.  If one is prepared to shop around and get the opinions of the designated persons, surely it is simple to ascertain whether there are any specific objections.</P>
    <P>I am sure that in any election all the candidates and parties may like to select their own returning officer but I do not think that would be a desirable practice.  Paragraph (a) does not lay down any conditions whatsoever for the officer who performs the function of returning officer.  If that is to be the case, surely the appointment that would be made, in other words &ldquo;any person who in his opinion is qualified and capable of performing the function of returning officer,&rdquo; would then be acceptable.</P>
    <P>On the Second Stage I said that much of this Bill is taken up with election details.  Those of us who are in this House are quite familiar with election details from practice and experience. The fundamental part of the Bill, limited though it is, is worker participation on the boards of certain State bodies, and we should ensure that this is streamlined as much as possible.  The operation of this mechanism must be as clear and simple as possible.  There are procedures and patterns to be followed. The returning officer will have a very important role to play.  The secretary of the company or the officer who <Col N="152" /> performs his duties will nominate a person whom he believes capable of performing that function and the person should then be acceptable.  In the amendment I go further and say:</P>
    <P>... and is acceptable to a majority of the employees of the body.</P>
    <P>How is that to be decided without another election, something which I should not like to see happening?  I urge the Minister to accept the principle of the amendment on the basis that it would be undesirable to have a tug-of-war.  Mr. A may be regarded as acceptable.  He then consults with groups of workers to whom he may not be acceptable.  Neither Mr. B or Mr. C may be acceptable to one or other of these groups.  I suggest that the provision in the Bill overdoes the procedure for the setting up of the structure.</P>
    <P>The secretary should nominate a person who is capable and competent. Above all he must have integrity, which all election officers must have. At the moment we are talking about seven State bodies.  In the next general election we will be talking about 40 returning officers.  They will be acceptable even though in many cases their political involvement may have been well-known prior to their reaching that position, but their integrity has never been questioned.  The position created by this Bill is an important one and the person appointed must not only be capable of carrying out the duties efficiently and honestly but he must be seen to be doing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the practical arrangements that must be gone into in legislation of this kind which deals with the election of workers in seven State bodies to the boards of directors.  Here we are dealing with the duties of the returning officers and Deputy Fitzgerald understandably feels the procedure could be rendered simpler and clearer, that there is not the need for these subsections.  In his amendment he suggests the inclusion of the following paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) in lieu of such secretary or officer, any person who in the <Col N="153" /> opinion of such secretary or officer is capable of carrying out the functions of returning officer and is acceptable to a majority of the employees of the body.</P>
    <P>I stress the virtues of the section as drafted because it is a practical necessity that if the secretary is not available for the onerous duties placed on the shoulders of a returning officer he should be in a position to nominate somebody else in his stead.  It is possible the operation of the election procedure could be a formidable task from the geographical point of view, particularly in bodies such as Bord na Móna and CIE.  It could be difficult for the company secretary to take part in the arrangements necessary for the election.  In the Bill, no substitute can relieve the returning officer of this most important task and I would stress the provisions in sections 8, 11 and 12. We discovered this practical requirement when we discussed this with the companies and the trade unions involved and we agreed this was the solution.  Every section has been the subject of deep discussion between unions and management and no section was put into the Bill as a result of talks merely between me and my officials and the parliamentary draftsman. That explains the practical necessity of this requirement of substitution for the secretary when he cannot carry out all the duties of his office.</P>
    <P>The second matter I would like to bring to the attention of the House is that one of my worries about Deputy Fitzgerald's amendment is that it makes no specific reference to trade unions in the employment.  The section refers to:</P>
    <P>(a) the secretary of the body, or in case there is no such secretary, the officer of the body who performs the functions of secretary of the body, or</P>
    <P>(b)  in lieu of such secretary or officer, any other person who in the opinion of such secretary or officer is acceptable to &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) a trade union or other body of persons which the returning officer is satisfied is both recognised <Col N="154" /> by the designated body for the purposes of collective bargaining and representative of a majority of the employees of the body, or</P>
    <P>(ii) two or more trade unions or other bodies of persons which the returning officer is satisfied between them collectively represent a majority of such employees and as regards each of which the returning officer is satisfied that the body is so recognised.</P>
    <P>There is specific reference here to trade unions and this is very important. I have explained that this legislation is the product of consultation with the two sides of industry and one of the beneficial side-effects of this legislation would be that we could see more co-operation grow up between unions in a particular place of employment. Where in a company there are many unions organising the same category of workers we would see elections held on one day and people returned by the majority of the separate trade unions, but we would see worker-directors returned representing the entire body of the workers in such companies.  I want to see that tendency strengthened throughout the State sector.  I hope one of the beneficial effects of the passage of this legislation will be a lessening of the tensions that undoubtedly exist at times between unions in the one employment.</P>
    <P>I return to the point that we refer to trade unions in the section.  It is important that we should for the success of this legislation.  Their support is essential for its implementation. Deputy Fitzgerald's amendment does not refer specifically to the practical position that we need the co-operation of trade unions and that they must be specified and we cannot permit a position whereby it would be up to the secretary of the company to decide, as the amendment would seem to suggest:</P>
    <P>(b)  in lieu of such secretary or officer, any person who in the opinion of such secretary or officer is capable of carrying out the functions of returning officer and is <Col N="155" /> acceptable to a majority of the employees of the body.</P>
    <P>It would be placing a great deal of discretion, if that be the correct word, certainly a great deal of responsibility on the shoulders of the unfortunate secretary.  It would be up to him to decide what constituted a majority of employees in a job but all of these jobs are organised by trade unions and and it is to absolve him from this rather onerous task that we refer specifically to trade unions in the section. In these circumstances I ask Deputy Fitzgerald to look again at his amendment and at the section.  I have explained as best I can the thinking behind the section.  It is a practical section which in the interests of getting this legislation through we must include.  I do not believe that it is an unnecessary addition to the legislation. Our discussions suggest that there is a practical necessity to have these provisions included and to have the specific reference that where there must be a substitute for the secretary as returning officer he should co-operate closely with the trade union or trade unions in the employment and only when they are satisfied about the competence of a substitute should a substitute be appointed.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the position is exactly analagous to the situation referred to by Deputy Fitzgerald when he talked about the returning officer in Dáil election terms.  In a Dáil election we are dealing with citizens who are taking part in the normal parliamentary election.  Here we are dealing with a new form of democracy on which we are setting it down in legislation that one's membership of a trade union is part of the exercise of democracy in this situation.  All we wish to ensure in this section is that we keep the returning officer free from any controversy in his post.  The simplest way of ensuring that the returning officer cannot be accused by union A or union Y or X of being biased in his duties&mdash;this is a rather exceptional case&mdash;is to ensure that we spell out in the legislation what steps we should take in the event of his not being able to carry out his duties so <Col N="156" /> that the effectiveness of his office is not imperilled by his having to make choices that could conceivably be on the wrong side of a particular organised group of workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not yet convinced me that paragraph (b) should be included at all in section 7.  I agree entirely with the consultation and discussion with trade unions. I believe that trade unions can, will and must play a terribly important part in seeing that worker democracy and worker participation operate effectively.  I would like to share the optimism of the Minister but, regarding industrial relations, the narrow measure of the appointment of workers to the State boards, the boards of those seven companies, will not make a very worthwhile contribution. An extension of it would and in the future this is where we may see the real benefits, when we see it extended to lower, meaningful management levels.  At the moment, at State board level I have reservations about its contribution to improved industrial relations.</P>
      <P>After our recent experiences, especially during the Christmas period, we all agree how necessary it is that every effort be made by all responsible people towards improvement of industrial relations that do exist in order to avoid hardship to people.  I appreciate and recognise the necessity for trade union discussions, but the important people here really are the workers in State body A.  These are the people whom we must really consider and whom we must as far as possible see democratically elected to the positions that this Bill allows them be elected to.  What we are discussing here we will be discussing in greater detail on other sections.  I am not entirely happy with my amendment simply because there is an addendum to it that would be difficult to figure out.  Section 7 (1) (a) says:</P>
      <P>the secretary of the body, or in case there is no such secretary, the officer of the body who performs the functions of secretary of the body,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, there is no consultation with anybody.  That person is <Col N="157" /> automatically appointed as returning officer.  If so much confidence can be placed in him&mdash;and I agree with the idea of placing confidence in him&mdash; surely then a responsible person nominated by him may be accepted as returning officer without consultation.</P>
    <P>I may have misunderstood the Minister when he mentioned the geographical spread of Bord na Móna and, of course, that means the geographical spread of CIE, ESB and others.  I fully appreciate that this would be a considerable problem at election time.  On Second Stage I said I was afraid of the imbalance that might be created by the workers in the areas of greater population who are elected to the State boards.  That will have to be overcome.  I got the impression from the Minister that he felt that the returning officer would have staff in the various locations or some person acting for him there.  That might be fine in itself.</P>
    <P>In this section we are talking about the returning officer, whoever he shall be.  That returning officer should be in accordance with paragraph (a) or alternatively somebody nominated by him.  I do not agree with the Minister that it is very much different from Dáil elections because we are talking about a democracy.  We are all human and we will all say that a returning officer in a particular area may have been appointed by a particular Government. I do not believe there has ever been an objection by any political party to a returning officer.  There may have been complaints about the manner in which an election was run but there have been very few complaints about returning officers considering the number who act each time an election or a referendum is held.</P>
    <P>I do not want to push my amendment beyond the limits.  I want to co-operate with the Minister but I believe the returning officer will be absolutely responsible for the election. We must remember that a worker is every person from the youngest and newest apprentice right up to top management, some of whom are not represented by trade unions.  Those people have no say in who will be appointed as a returning officer.  While <Col N="158" /> I fully agree with the involvement of trade unions and the discussions which are vital to the success of this I do not believe that if the returning officer is somebody about whom we can argue it will help the situation at all.  It is the secretary of the company, the officer corresponding to him or alternatively somebody of responsibility who is capable of doing the job appointed by him that we should have.  If we, at election time, had a choice of returning officers I am sure it would probably take six months to get returning officers in some constituencies accepted.</P>
    <P>I can see that there is a weakness in my amendment in regard to how one finds out whether or not the returning officer is acceptable to the majority of the advising bodies.  If the Minister has confidence in the secretary or the officer corresponding to him he should have equal confidence in that person to nominate a responsible person to act as returning officer.  I ask him to re-examine paragraph (b), which seems to be out of line with paragraph (a) between now and the next Stage.  He has referred to the importance of having trade unions mentioned there. I am not so sure that that is important to anybody.  I cannot see it helping a trade union in any way.  I am amazed at the powers given to a returning officer in some sections of the Bill where his decision is final.  I would prefer to see, rather than that those powers be given to him so completely, that this section be amended and that in the event of there being a genuine complaint there would be some machinery so that the complaint could be examined by an independent body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), line 21, to delete &ldquo;made by the Minister&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;made by the designated bodies for their particular election, after consultation with the nominating groups and having taken into consideration the geographical spread of the body, and approved by the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> I am asking here for a change of subsection (1) of this section.  The subsection, as it stands, reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  Subject to the provisions of this Act, elections shall be held in accordance with regulations made by the Minister and regulations under this section may apply ...</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that instead of saying &ldquo;regulations made by the Minister&rdquo; we say &ldquo;made by the designated bodies for their particular election&rdquo; because I think there will be certain circumstances that will suit one body and perhaps not another.  My amendment continues: &ldquo;after consultation with the nominating groups&rdquo;&mdash;this is where we should be involving the nominating groups&mdash;&ldquo;and having taken into consideration the geographical spread of the body, and approved by the Minister&rdquo;.  Naturally nobody knows the workings of these State bodies as intimately as the people concerned.  For example, if regulations are being made regarding CIE it is more than likely that those regulations would in no way suit those being made in a manufacturing industry such as NET, just to take two entirely different industries, one a service and the other a manufacturing one, one with a huge geographical spread, with tremendous movement of transport, with drivers overseas and at both ends of the country.  Therefore, the regulations there would be entirely different.</P>
    <P>I am making life easier for the Minister and his Department in suggesting that the regulations be made by the designated bodies for their particular election.  Of course I entirely agree with consultation with the nominating groups and also taking into consideration the geographical spread of the bodies.  Then those regulations must be approved by the Minister.  It may cause additional problems to have the Minister or his Department making regulations for seven different bodies whereas if each designated body designed their own scheme for election, in consultation with the nominating bodies and, having reached agreement, they submitted them to the Minister for approval it would streamline <Col N="162" /> the procedure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point.  What he is suggesting is what I hope I would be doing in practice.  As the Deputy sees it his amendment sets out procedures in terms of the actual conduct of the election and thereby avoids the difficulty of very complicated consultations between the Minister of the day and the companies concerned.  My difficulty here is that it is not so much that I wish to interpose the Minister for Labour at each point but it is important, in terms of the law, that the regulations come back to the Minister. That is why it is spelled out here in this fashion.  The heart of the matter is this, that these regulations will be drawn up by both sides in the companies concerned.  In practice, I will not be drawing up the regulations.  I might tell the Deputy and the House that in regard to this section, which we discussed with the unions and management, it was agreed that though technically the form of the regulations are made by the Minister, it would be suggested to me by both sides what the form of the regulations should be in each particular undertaking. Then full consultations will take place on the draft regulations with management and the trade unions of the seven State companies.  In addition, while I envisage that technically I may be the person making the regulations about the conduct of election, which has general application in the seven companies, in practice it may be necessary to make special regulations which, whilst in agreement with the main provisions of the Bill, would take into account specific conditions or circumstances in any particular designated body.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald will see that his amendment will be embodied in practice. The reason it is not spelled out here in the form he suggests is that we are forced to insert the Minister involved in this fashion&mdash;that he must make regulations&mdash;but the practice will be that both management and unions will be the authors of regulations as they are the people who will have to carry them out.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 43 and 44, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) the determination of the number of employees in each designated body who may independently nominate a candidate, and be considered a qualified body for the purpose of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is where the Minister and I differ on this legislation.  I am asking that this paragraph be added to section 9. I have called it paragraph (e).  Here I see a basic difference in thinking between the Minister and myself in an effort to make industrial democracy work in these seven State bodies. Those seven have been selected.  I would not agree entirely with the selection of those seven.  There are reasons why I would have added others.  However, I shall not go back over that ground.  I do not believe that the way this will operate will be beneficial or will constitute absolute democracy where these workers are concerned. At present, for example, in each of those bodies there are quite a number of unions involved.  As far as I am aware we do not yet know how many directors or members will be elected to each of the boards.  Some of those bodies have quite a number of trade unions involved, naturally some carrying a far greater number of members than others.  For example, if we take the ITGWU or the WUI, one can argue two ways as to whether or not they are receiving fair representation on one of those bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of these bodies have more than 12,000 employees and because of that the ITGWU or the WUI may have more than 80 per cent of those as members.  Yet, as I see it, they are entitled to nominate only one member each, where as a much smaller unit <Col N="165" /> has the same right.  There are also workers who are not union members and as far as this legislation is concerned they do not appear to be able to seek nomination.  I submit they are not given the opportunity of participating in a proper democratisation of the workplace.  Even in our Dáil elections the independent has a chance of standing if he decides that he has no allegiance to or sympathy with any of the major political parties but this facility is not available to the workers. I think the Minister must reconsider this even at this stage.</P>
    <P>A number of trade unions are involved. I mentioned the two stronger unions, probably the unions having most members, and they would be entitled to say that this is unfair to them because, as far as I can see, despite the number of members they might have, they are entitled to nominate only one person.  The Minister may correct me but I think I am right.  Yet a union with only 10 per cent of that membership would appear to have the same right to nominate one person.  I accept that probably the member of the larger union would have a much better chance of being elected but that is a matter for the campaign afterwards and how successful a nominated candidate may be in projecting his image and promoting his interests within the company.  This is why I have moved this amendment:</P>
    <P>(e) the determination of the number of employees in each designated body who may independently nominate a candidate, and be considered a qualified body for the purpose of this Act.</P>
    <P>I do not mean that every ten people should have that right particularly in bodies where over 10,000 people are employed but, first, people who are not union members are entitled to be considered in this legislation and also&mdash; referring to the bigger unions&mdash;if a group of a number decided on by the Minister, 50, 60, 100 or 200, from within a union or even across the unions, decide that they wish to nominate somebody, I think they should be entitled to do so.</P>
    <P>If we take bodies like CIE or the <Col N="166" /> ESB with a wide geographical spread, am I right in assuming that, for example, the ITGWU which would probably represent many workers in these bodies, would have the right to nominate only one member to the State board?</P>

      <P>If I may intervene, the nominating bodies, those who can put forward candidates for election to the board must be bodies recognised by the companies concerned for negotiating purposes and can be either trade unions or staff associations, anybody recognised by the management as representing workers, with whom they can negotiate on their conditions.  These are the people who may nominate.  Those who may take part in elections are any persons over the age of 18 who have been in the board's employment for a year. There is no ceiling on the number of candidates who may be nominated by these bodies for these positions.  I do not propose that our regulations should deal with the matter which would be a question for the nominating bodies themselves.  It would be a matter for the transport union itself, for instance, to decide whether it wanted to support the Sligo candidate as against some other candidate.  We cannot tell the nominating bodies which person or region they should support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The weakness I see in what the Deputy is proposing is that by suggesting that there could be groups or bodies outside those I have mentioned &mdash;the unions, the people recognised for negotiating purposes by the management&mdash;which would have the right to nominate candidates in a situation where our State sector suffers somewhat <Col N="167" /> from too many unions, we would be fuelling extra division in these employments. I know that is not the Deputy's intention but I believe that one of the beneficial side effects of this legislation would be to get employees of the same firm to thinking together more than they have been doing considering the problems of their firm as a totality and working together as a team.  A year or two ago we passed legislation to make it easier for unions to amalgamate in the organisational sense and this is why I do not think I could honestly indicate to the Deputy that I would be willing to look at this aspect of the legislation again. The Deputy rightly perceives that there may be a difference of opinion between us and it is a rather serious one from my viewpoint.  In any legislation for which I am responsible I could not encourage further splits and divisions of employees.  We have too much of that already and what we need is less.  I do not charge the Deputy with wishing to do that; he is concerned with how smaller units of workers can be heard in the elections. All of the seven companies involved are organised almost 90 per cent by trade unions.  There are some house associations and such associations will not be prevented from putting forward candidates but I do not think it would be in anybody's interest in the normal way to encourage in our legislation further fragmentation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be inclined to argue another way on the point the Minister makes in regard to creating further division.  I look at it like this: if a group of workers, say, in Sligo, composed of members of a number of unions and, perhaps, some non-union workers, decide to nominate a Sligoman, it might have the opposite effect of helping to weld some unions together and assist the legislation enacted in 1974-75.  I think the geographical spread of these companies will create a problem but not an insurmountable one.  My main concern here is that we are confining too much workers' democracy or the opportunity of workers from seeking what we now hope will be their democratic right. <Col N="168" /> First, there is the person who is not a member of a union or a staff association. Under the Constitution he is entitled to his right not to be a member. In my view this legislation will deprive him of the opportunity, if he so wishes, of being nominated for election to State boards.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, it could be argued that with the strength of the city against the provinces or <i>vice versa</i>&mdash;the provinces against the cities in the case of Bord na Móna would be very strong, although it may be otherwise in other companies&mdash;there might not be a fair spread on the present nominating body structure.  Even at this late stage I would appeal to the Minister to reserve to himself rights by which a worthwhile group of workers in any depot, whether it be in the city or elsewhere, will have the opportunity, even across union lines, of nominating a particular person to represent them on that State board.</P>
      <P>I agree with union involvement.  I agree that the unions must throw their full weight behind this if it is to be successful but primarily it must be a workers' democracy.  Each worker in the ESB, CIE or any other State body must have equal rights in his company, factory or depot, whether he be on the floor of the garage or one of the higher office workers.</P>
      <P>I do not want to deny the nominating bodies suggested by the Minister the opportunity to nominate people.  I want an opportunity for the people who may wish under any circumstances &mdash;and I am giving the Minister latitude to nominate the number and conditions&mdash;to nominate any person who is not a member of a union or staff association.  Naturally the chances of that person being elected are poor but the right should be there for his name to be put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an independent or a community association wish to put forward a candidate in Dáil or local elections that right is available to them.  One could look on the independent as not being attached to any union.  In my opinion, legislation should not deny him the opportunity of putting his name forward for nomination.  Again I appeal <Col N="169" /> to the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 relates to the conduct of elections.  I have no objection to the section, except that I would like to reserve an opportunity of introducing amendments on Report Stage in relation to amendment No. 10 and I would ask the Minister to look at subsection (1) of section 9.  It must appear that the designated bodies within their own structures are making the regulations.  We are introducing a new package of legislation and the terminology is a little difficult. I would encourage the Minister and his Department when introducing legislation for workers to ensure that the terminology and language used is simple so that the vast majority of people can interpret the exact meaning of the Bill.  If worker democracy is to work properly the elections will probably be interesting and they will create a certain excitement in the work place with the knowledge that the workers have the opportunity of representation on the boards of their companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation should go further, but it is a start and I support it.  I sincerely believe that every worker in every one of these bodies must not only have the opportunity but must appear to have the opportunity of being nominated.  By excluding perhaps only 1 per cent from this legislation we could deny a person a right that he or she already has under the <Col N="172" /> Constitution.  The chances of their being elected would probably be small, but that is not the question.  I would ask the Minister to try by consultation between now and Report Stage to get acceptance.</P>
    <P>I would have been a bit more choosey in relation to some of the bodies which were selected as being the first seven bodies, because the geographical spread of some of these will cause difficulties.  It would be hard for people in some parts of the country to understand that somebody from the capital is representing them on a State board.  There is also a spread of skills and functions.  In CIE rail freight, road freight and bus services are geographically spread throughout the country.  There are separate divisions also in the ESB, maintenance distribution and so on, spread all over the country.  No doubt the Minister will have more amendments by the time we reach Report Stage, but officials should keep looking for flaws or faults which may be found when this legislation begins to operate because the machinery provided for elections will never be 100 per cent perfect.  I have no objection to section 9 provided I can reserve the right to introduce some amendments on Report Stage if necessary. The reason I did not force the issue to a vote today was to help speed up the passage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>This is giving the person the right to vote.  An opportunity is being given to persons over 18 years on the day concerned and who have had one year's continuous employment in the company.  I am concerned about subsection (3):</P>
      <P>Where an election is held, a person shall not be entitled to make an application pursuant to subsection (2) of this section to the returning officer at any time on the day which as regards the election is the nomination day,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume that means that once the nomination day comes if that man's <Col N="173" /> name is not already on the list of electors it cannot be put on.  If I am right in that assumption, I suggest to the Minister that this section could do with a tidying up.  Simpler language should be used to explain this to the ordinary worker who will be voting.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with that subsection. It would be better to rewrite it completely, putting it in clear and simple terms.  I am saying this in a totally non-political way; I am merely trying to be helpful.  I intend no disrespect to the people who draft legislation. Perhaps they see no difficulty in it for the ordinary person but the terminology used can be difficult to comprehend.  There are times when I must read a section a number of times before realising fully what it entails. In the subsection I am talking of here, one or two simple sentences would suffice to make clear that there is a day beyond which a person cannot claim a vote.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The section deals with the question of the nomination and support of candidates and brings us back to the question of certain decisions being taken by a returning officer.  This is novel legislation.  We are putting forward a formula by which an alternative person can be suggested.  Yet we are extending to that person the right not to have to consult with anybody else <Col N="174" /> in certain circumstances.  Regarding nominations I would suggest that such person would have the right to adjudge a case as being either valid or invalid; but there is always the danger, particularly within a company, of there being a returning officer who may not be the ideal person to hold this office. For instance, he may have a grievance of long standing with some nominated member and, consequently, he may endeavour to find a loophole to invalidate that other person's application. In such circumstances there would be no opportunity for redress.  Would it not be advisable to provide for redress in such cases?  Presumably within the Minister's Department there will be an officer acting as a co-ordinator in regard to elections in the various bodies.  I took the Minister earlier to indicate that all the elections would be held simultaneously.  Perhaps the Minister would think again about the question of redress.  We all know that elections produce grievances, but it is the practice to accept the decision of a returning officer.  In view especially of this legislation being novel and complex, it might be advisable to provide for redress in cases of grievance.</P>

      <P>We have covered this point already but I would point out that, in accordance with section 9, I shall be making regulations whereby the candidates for election and a representative from their nominating bodies would be entitled to be present when the returning officer is ruling on the validity of each nomination. In other words, I am meeting the possible difficulty envisaged by the Deputy in matters of this kind.  It is regrettable that from time to time disputes of this nature arise but the arrangement that I would provide for in the regulations, and which incidentally has been agreed already with both sides as being a practical way of meeting the type of difficulty envisaged in the amendment, will ensure that there can be no argument as to the impartiality of the returning officer.  There will be an <i>ad hoc</i> appeal at the time in question.</P>

      <P>I have a comment in the margin here and that comment is &ldquo;Rubbish&rdquo;.  I see no reason for the introduction of this subsection.  A qualified body may decide not to nominate and may support the candidature of another nominee.  That can be done.  Why write it into legislation?

      <P>It is a small point but the matter came up for discussion between my officials and the unions. The nominating body alone will put forward a candidate or candidates and, if we did not have this clause, a supporting body which did not have a <Col N="176" /> candidate or candidates would not be entitled to have any reference to this candidate or these candidates unless they voted in this particular fashion. A side effect would be to lessen identity between different organisations and workers.  It is not a very big point.  It has been written in on advice to show that a candidate is endorsed by a small qualified body which is not putting forward a candidate of its own.  It is a healthy tendency to have more of this cross-union support.  No great principle is involved. I do not think this is really opposition on the part of Deputy Fitzgerald.

      <P>(a) a trade union or other body of persons which the returning officer is satisfied,</P>
      <P>(i)  in case the election relates to Aer Lingus, is both recognised for the purposes of collective bargaining either by that company or by Aerlínte and represents not less than fifteen per cent of the employees of those companies, being employees entitled to vote at the election, when the numbers of employees employed by them and being so entitled are each added together,</P>
      <P>(ii) in case the election relates to any other designated body, is both recognised for such purposes by that designated body and represents not less than fifteen per cent of the employees of that body who are entitled to vote at the election, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) each of two or more trade unions or other bodies of persons which the returning officer is satisfied between them collectively represent not less than fifteen per <Col N="179" /> cent of such employees and as regards each of which the returning officer is satisfied that the body is so recognised,</P>
    <P>an application in writing requesting him not to proceed with the election, for the purposes of ascertaining whether or not a majority of those entitled to vote at the election is in favour of proceeding further with the election he shall arrange forthwith for the taking of a poll under this section (which poll is in this Act referred to as a `preliminary poll') and appoint either a day, or a period of more than one but not more than five days, which shall be the earliest day or period of days, as the case may be, for the taking of the poll.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is mainly concerned with the necessity of bringing Aerlínte within the scope of the Bill.  That is why this cumbersome amendment is necessary. On Second Stage I received strong representations from interests concerned about the position of employees of Aerlínte in the context of the designation of Aer Lingus.  There was no reference to Aerlínte.  As Deputies are aware, Aer Lingus is named as a designated body in section 5 but Aerlínte is not.  The two companies for very good reasons operate as one.  There is what they call a board interlock between Aer Lingus and Aerlínte and the members of the boards in each case are the same. They have the same chairman.  They meet as one body and operate as one company.  The appointment of employee directors to the Aer Lingus board alone, as provided for under this Bill, could upset this arrangement since employees elected to the Aer Lingus board would not be entitled to sit on the Aerlínte board and the converse position would obtain in relation to Aerlínte.  There are about 5,000 people employed in Aer Lingus while about 200 are employed by Aerlínte. The basis of the representations made to me were that some formula should be devised so that we could incorporate in the Bill a provision whereby Aerlínte employees could vote in elections in Aer Lingus in view of the <Col N="180" /> exceptional interlocking arrangements between the two companies.

      <P>My query on this section relates to subsection (3). I thought the Minister would have encouraged rotation.  We are working a little in the dark in relation to this Bill and with the exception of one of these State bodies which has nine members, they all have seven members. I am not sure what the Minister's intentions are regarding the ultimate composition of these bodies or boards with the result that I do not know how many members will be elected by the <Col N="183" /> workers.  It is desirable that we have a rotation system.  In one of our leading private Irish companies where worker participation has worked for many years the time came when a breakdown appeared inevitable between the worker representatives and the younger members of the staff.  It was then decided to introduce rotation.  It would break the system in the course of time if there was not a way by which a new person could be elected to the board.</P>
      <P>I am not quite sure how the rotation could be started for the first time without being a little unfair to somebody. However it is important that there should be this rotation, not entirely, there must be continuity as well. Assuming there are three members elected and one of them cannot seek re-election, maybe it could be on the basis that the man who gets the least number of votes should retire.  That would then give the opportunity of introducing one new face.  From there on one of the other representatives could be phased out and so on; in; other words one would retire each three-year period.  I see merit in that and certainly it would be attractive to younger members of the staff because it would give them an opportunity of being representatives at some stage. The Minister may have considered this already and had consultations about it.  I do not think it would be desirable to have a system of representation that would go on endlessly because this would defeat the purpose of worker participation at board level.</P>

      <P>I would be loath to say that representation must take place as a matter of law.  I agree it would be desirable, and I can tell the Deputy that the nominating bodies have already discussed how this can best be arranged.  I would prefer, however, not to include it in the legislation at this point.  The Deputy may be assured that the question of rotation is occupying the minds of the nominating bodies.</P>

      <P>This concerns the resignation and removal from office of members or directors appointed under the Bill.  Subsection (2) reads:</P>
      <P>Where a Minister of State has power to remove an ordinary member or an ordinary director of a designated body from office, he shall have like power to remove a member or director of the body appointed by him under this Act from office, and in case such power to remove is exercisable only with the consent or approval of another Minister of State, the power conferred on the Minister of State by this section shall be exercisable subject to such consent or approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This subsection likens the position of the member or director of the State company appointed by the Minister to that of the member or director elected to the board by his workmates and then appointed by the Minister as a result of that election.  I would seriously question whether it is desirable or advisable for the Minister to include <Col N="185" /> both of these here under the same conditions.  I see the need for safeguard in the case where there is a cogent reason why a person should be removed from his position as member or director.  The director other than the worker director is appointed by the Minister, probably with the consent of the Government, and one can rest assured that nowadays the appointee is a supporter of one or other of the two parties in Government. Times have changed from the days when Fianna Fáil appointed the best and most suitable people to such positions.  Nowadays the main consideration is political attachment.  I believe there should be some difference. The nominating body or the returning officer should be consulted if for no other reason than to let it be seen by the workers that the Minister was justified in removing a board member as not being suitable.  I think there is a distinction to be made between the person whom the Minister of the day selects and the person who is elected by the workers and appointed by the Minister as a result of that election.</P>

Is this section really necessary at all and under what circumstances would the Minister see a necessity for it arising?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 15, subsection (2), lines 10 and 11, to delete &ldquo;before making the appointment, have regard to the poll&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;appoint the first candidate in the poll who was not deemed to be elected&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In appointing a person to fill a casual vacancy, the appropriate Minister shall, in case there was a poll at the last preceding election relating to the designated body concerned, <Col N="188" /> before making the appointment, have regard to that poll.</P>
    <P>The words &ldquo;have regard to that poll&rdquo; are not strong enough and could allow the Minister to have an outlet I do not think he should have.  He may have regard to the poll but, under the section, he is not obliged or committed to appoint any person having had regard to the poll.  As I said earlier, I would be reluctant to give that type of power to a Minister.  Any Minister may not have the regard to the poll which I think he should have.  I would expect that the person next qualified with votes would be appointed to fill a casual vacancy.  I suggest in my amendment that the first candidate in the poll who was not deemed to be elected should be appointed.  This would continue the democratic progress of worker representative appointments and would eliminate any possibility of any interference with the voting system in the election.</P>
    <P>The Minister may well say the first person who was not deemed to be elected in that poll may not be available for some reason.  The obvious solution to that would be to go further down the line to the next person who was available.  This would strengthen the section and guarantee the system of worker representation continuing in that capacity for three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald is concerned as to whether the Minister would be guided totally by the poll results in filling a casual vacancy.  I am sure he would be in almost all cases, but practical difficulties can arise.  The casual vacancy may occur near the end of a period of office and the person next in line in the poll may not be willing to take on the job.  The person who vacated the office for one reason or another may be a member of a particular union and they might not be agreeable to a member of another union filling the post.  It is not ruled out that the Minister would have regard to the poll in the section.  I undertake to look at this between now and Report Stage and see if I can satisfy the Deputy further that the poll would have a very close bearing on what the Minister would do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in agreement with the Deputy's <Col N="189" /> sentiments but I am informed that practical difficulties could arise if it was written into the section that the Minister had to have regard to the poll results.  The vacancy could occur near the end of a period of office or the person who vacated the office could be a member of a union who were not agreeable to a member of union X filling the post.  These are possibilities which could arise.  As drafted, the section gives us a possibility of flexibility with the agreement of all concerned.  I must stress that, since it was a direct election, no vacancy of this sort could be filled without the agreement of the nominating bodies and all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reasonably satisfied now the Minister has said he will look at the matter between now and Report Stage.  I am still not happy that the words &ldquo;have regard to that poll&rdquo; are strong enough.  The only practical difficulty I can see in my amendment is that there might not be a big number of candidates and a good deal of time might elapse between the resignation or death of a member and the time when the election took place and there might be one or two people who were not then available or were not prepared to accept the appointment. I take the Minister's point that he will examine the subsection with a view to improving it between now and Report Stage.  In the meantime I reserve my right to submit another amendment if I think that is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) provides that the vacancy may be filled by the appropriate Minister.  If I remember the definition section correctly, the appropriate Minister is not the Minister for Labour.  It is the Minister concerned with the company or body.  That is why I encourage the Minister to keep my amendment in mind and to be specific as to how we will fill the vacancy.  Unless there was absolute agreement with the nominating bodies friction could be caused.  None of us wants to see any <Col N="190" /> friction created in introducing workers' democracy.</P>
      <P>This is not as big a step as I should like to see the Minister taking but it is a step in the right direction, I hope, towards improved industrial relations in our State bodies.  It is imperative that we should know the procedure and that there should be no allegations that any Minister of any Government appointed a particular worker over and above another worker.  That is why it would be desirable to have the poll followed as closely as possible. There are different political persuasions among the workers in the different State bodies.  If it was believed by one section that preference was expressed towards one group or one person rather than another, that would be harmful to the idea of workers democracy.  I urge the Minister very strongly to be more specific. The practical problems can easily be eliminated.  Only as a last resort should the Minister have to go back to consult with anybody.</P>

      <P>I expected more information from the Minister.  We should have some idea of the Minister's intentions.  He has had consultations, and rightly so, but this House and an Opposition that has been so helpful and so sincerely committed to the proper working of industrial democracy should be informed of the Minister's intentions.  I see difficulties for the Minister.  For example, with the exception of Comhlacht Siúicre Éireann, all the other bodies have seven members on their boards.  If we hold it at seven for those six companies and divide seven by three we find that the number according to the Bill would be three directors out of seven.  On the other hand, the Minister may decide to increase the number of directors.  With a board of seven directors, the seventh being the chairman, is there a danger that six might be divided by three?  Is the chairman classed as a director or is he regarded as a chairman?  If that were the case, six of the companies would only have two.  The Minister may also be considering the possibility of increasing them by two each and preserving the people appointed by his Government in their positions.  Are some of the existing seven to be removed, or the existing nine as in the case of the Comhlacht Siúicre Éireann?  These questions should be answered and I should like the Minister to comment on his intentions.</P>

      <P>The position is that one-third of the board will be worker directors.  The seven companies have varying numbers.  If one-third must be worker directors we would increase the number of directors on the board where there was an insufficiency of numbers at present to make it one-third worker directors.  In other words, <Col N="192" /> where the total number is nine, three would be worker directors.  Where the number was eleven, we would increase it to twelve and four of those would be worker directors.  There is no final decision on these matters other than that one-third of the directors on each board will be worker directors.  The figures decided upon will have to make allowance for that provision. Where the present number of directors is not a convenient multiple the proportion must be in the next whole number above whatever number would have been one-third of that figure.  As the Deputy can see, there would be difficulties on each board.  The position will have to be discussed with each Minister and the figure increased where necessary.  In relation to each of the companies we would be coming back to the House by way of an affirmative order and it would be open to the House to make their observations in each particular instance.</P>

      <P>I accept that.  It is confusing for this side of the House for the reason that it is a third, or if the figure is not evenly divided by a third it is the next number.  In the case of six companies there are seven directors including the chairman. Therefore it seems that the Minister's intention must be to increase the number in these bodies to nine.  In view of the fact that the Government intends to hold an election this year there must be some indication of the decision regarding the directors.  I cannot see any member of the Government pushing out directors in this alleged election year.  I should like the Minister to give us more details on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Section 24 reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may make regulations requiring a designated body to which the regulations apply to bring to the notice, in a prescribed manner, <Col N="193" /> of their employees either or both of the following, namely:</P>
    <P>(a)  such provisions of this Act as are specified in the regulations,</P>
    <P>(b)  such provisions of regulations made under this Act (apart from this section) as are so specified, ...</P>
    <P>This is a very important section.  I have marked it as being the communications section.  I have already said that the Bill itself should be phrased as simply as possible.  I am sure the intention of this section is that the regulations governing nomination day, election day and so on be spelled out very simply. It should be clear in specifying procedures governing the elections, who is qualified to vote and who is qualified to be a candidate.  These regulations should be clearly displayed in every possible place.  Now that we have decided to go ahead with worker democracy, let it go right from the beginning.  Let the oldest member in a company and the youngest member be fully aware of what this means within his company, the means being used to achieve it and his own entitlements. The importance of this must be emphasised. I would regard the communication of this piece of legislation from the Department through the trade unions and management to the workers as being of the utmost importance.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that these seven companies have been selected and that from the experience gained there the number will be expanded. My own belief is that it is a pity more State bodies were not included at this stage because I am afraid it will take a considerable time before another group of State bodies or all the State bodies are included.  The scheme must be seen to work perfectly from the start.  The most remote bog of Bord na Móna and the most remote depot of CIE must be supplied with the regulations explaining all that is involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister may like to comment on this section.  I want to emphasise to him and to his Department how necessary it is that it be used to the full to communicate with the workers.</P>

      <P>This is the cost section.  The designated body bears the cost of the election, with the exception of the expenses incurred by the candidates.  This is quite understandable. In the case of some of those bodies I would hope that the election will be run on hairshirt lines and that <Col N="195" /> no elaborate arrangements will be made.  The election should be run as cheaply as possible.  I feel optimistic that the costs incurred will repay themselves in time and will, in fact, be reimbursed by a better working relationship and team spirit within those companies where we have seen so much unrest in recent times.</P>

      <P>I welcome the inclusion of Bord na Móna and other companies but I must express disappointment that many other companies have not been included.  On earlier amendments I said I could not see why some of the other companies, compact in their nature and with a reasonably small number of workers, were not included.  Many of these workers had expectations of participation. I fully understand that the wand could not be waved overnight but this measure has come very late in the life of the Government who, in their election manifesto, promised so many things.

Recently I read 1969 literature of the Labour Party on worker participation and worker democracy but this Bill is far removed from the intentions expressed in that document of eight years ago.  I am not saying that all that was suggested in it would have been my gospel or that of my party in regard to the welfare of the workers but this Bill could have gone much further.</P>
      <P>I assure the Minister of our support in any further moves in this direction. The Committee Stage of the Bill has been advantageous from the point of view of worker democracy in State companies and I repeat that our cooperation will be forthcoming when steps are taken further to investigate methods of improving this legislation, and I hope this morning's Committee Stage debate has contributed to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of the threat to the future of the Tuam sugar factory following the announcement that CIE are to discontinue the carriage of sugar beet at Tuam railway station without providing any alternative transport; and the steps he proposes to take to safeguard this factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by CSET that it is not the practice to handle sugar beet at Tuam railway station.  Consignments of sugar beet for Tuam sugar factory are unloaded at the Sugar Company's own sidings at the factory.  The announced closure of Tuam railway station for the handling of beet will not interfere with this arrangement and is intended merely to formalise a situation that has existed for many years.  Consignments for the factory from outlying districts will continue to go through the railway station to the Sugar Company's sidings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the assurance given by the Parliamentary Secretary but might I point out that the fears expressed about the Limerick/Claremorris passenger service, which was discontinued last April, are now being realised?  May I also point out that this action by CIE seems to be a further step in the downgrading of Tuam station and indeed Tuam factory?  I would like to ask why this downgrading has taken place when we have an unsuitable road network in the west.  Is he aware that the lack of a suitable network was given as the reason for reprieving the Rosslare/Waterford line?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out that as regards Tuam the announced closure will not interfere in any way with the unloading of beet.  I give that reassurance to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that the decision of CIE not to take certain stations, particularly in the midlands, that have been serving Tuam over a long number of years is going to be a serious setback to the Tuam <Col N="204" /> factory?  Does he not further agree that the road network in Tuam is such that it does not lend itself to the type of articulated traffic that will be necessary if CIE go ahead with their plans announced recently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">

      <P>I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary about alternative transport to which I referred in my question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out to the Deputy, the announced closure is not going to interfere in any way with the unloading of beet.  Comhlucht Síuicre Éireann have their own sidings which are located two or three miles from the railway station and beet wagons go straight to them.  Accordingly beet is neither loaded nor unloaded at Tuam railway station and beet trains will continue to go through the station direct to the company's sidings at the sugar factory as heretofore. Approximately 60 per cent of Tuam factory sugar beet intake comes by rail.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will consider the use of the Rotunda as a site for a concert hall; and if he will make a general policy statement on the matter of the proposed concert hall.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consideration has been given to the possibility of using the cinema in question as a concert hall.  As a cinema, the Rotunda building seats 1,100 but as a concert hall it could not accommodate more than about 600 and that could only be done by means of considerable <Col N="206" /> adaptation.  It would not provide anything like the amount of ancillary space that would be needed for the orchestra and for patrons.  It is, therefore not proposed to acquire it for use as a concert hall.</P>
    <P>The design for the provision of a concert hall at Earlsfort Terrace is well advanced and tenders for the building work will be invited towards the end of this year.  The Great Hall which is being redesigned as an auditorium contains all the basic characteristics for first-class acoustic conditions for orchestral music.  This great potential is being fully exploited in the design.  The auditorium will provide seating for more than 1,200 people and there will be adequate facilities for the public and for the orchestra.</P>

      <P>In May, 1974 I announced the Government's decision to develop the Great Hall and ancillary buildings in Earlsfort Terrace for use as a public concert hall and that the Government were considering an alternative memorial to the late President Kennedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The design of the public concert hall project is well advanced and tenders for the building work will be invited this year.  The Great Hall which is being redesigned as an auditorium contains all the basic characteristics <Col N="208" /> for first class acoustic conditions for orchestral music.  This great potential is being fully exploited in the design. The auditorium will provide seating for more than 1,200 people and there will be adequate facilities for the public and for the orchestra.</P>
    <P>The Government have not finally decided on the form which the alternative memorial to the late President Kennedy will take.</P>

      <P>I will give the Deputy the information I have.  On the 6th May, 1975, the Department of Education sanctioned a grant for another 16-classroom school at Rivermount, St. Helena's, that is the one the Deputy is speaking about.  The Commissioners of Public Works authorised the chairman and the board of management to accept a tender for this school on the 13th January, 1976.  Work began in February, 1976, and is now well advanced.  Work was delayed for about ten weeks during the course of the contract due to the non-availability of some materials and also due to the reduced cash flow during the bank strike.  It is expected that the school will be completed by the end of April, 1977.  A grant for a further 16-classroom school to be erected at St. Helena's was sanctioned on the 9th November, 1976.  The commissioners authorised the chairman of the management board on 11th November, 1976, to have his architect prepare working drawngs.  It is expected that the drawings will be completed in a few weeks.  Then it will be necessary for the commissioners to obtain the permission of the Department of Education to authorise the invitation to tender.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The areas in question are, of course, included in the disadvantaged areas but were not included in the additional areas designated as most severely handicapped following the recent review carried out by my Department in conjunction with the services of the EEC Commission.  The relevant EEC directive requires that aid must be varied in accordance with the degree of handicap and cattle headage payments are made only in those areas which are most severely handicapped.  In the course of the recent review, detailed studies were made of the available economic data coupled with on-thespot inspection and consultation with local interests.  I am satisfied that this review identified all the district electoral divisions that warrant designation as most severely handicapped and that it would not be possible to persuade the Commission that any further addition should be made to either the disadvantaged areas or the severely handicapped areas at the present time.</P>
      <P>However, farmers in the district electoral divisions named do qualify for special assistance by way of higher payments on beef cows and sheep together with higher grants under the farm modernisation scheme and aids for hill pasture improvement, crafts and tourism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that they are within the disadvantaged areas scheme but are not classified as severely handicapped. The Kilnanare area is completely mountainous&mdash;there is no workable land there at all&mdash;and there are quite a number of farmers there. Two-thirds of the area known as Kiltallagh is comprised of Tralee mountain.  Here they are, by and large, sheep and mountain farmers.  Surely that must indicate that it is one of the most handicapped areas.  I know it to be so.  Would the Minister take it up from there again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a further note here that might be helpful to the Deputy.  It was found that while some parts of these areas are comparable physically and otherwise with adjoining scheduled areas, on the whole they are more productive, in fact being mainly dairying areas and their inincomes, apart from dole, are quite high.  It may be argued that some parts of these district electoral divisions are worse than areas already classed as severely handicapped.  That is inevitable. If we included these district electoral divisions there would still be new border areas about which the same could be said.  The directive speaks in terms of local authority areas and areas being homogeneous.  It is the position of the areas as a whole that counts and not parts of them. Therefore the Deputy could be quite right in saying that parts of it are severely handicapped but all the other things have to be taken into consideration at the same time.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that this area, along with others, came within the disadvantaged areas scheme. Then he went on to quote the advantages of being within the disadvantaged areas scheme.  But, as he knows, unless one is designated as a development farmer or in the machinery groups. which have come in recently, it does not make the slightest difference whether one is inside or outside the supposedly disadvantaged areas there always, which were the 12 western countries.  Would the Minister seriously consider blanket coverage for the 12 western counties always recognised as disadvantaged?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of diseases which give rise to nervous symptoms in sheep and which are often loosely described as &ldquo;brain diseases&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>One such disease known as &ldquo;louping ill&rdquo; is caused by a virus carried by ticks which are picked up by sheep grazing on old pastures.  There was only one case of this in rams allocated by my Department last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that it is now owned by Golden Vale Co-operative Society but it was set up by the Dairy Disposal Company under the Department of Agriculture.

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <P>The latest rounds of testing under the bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication schemes commenced in mid-October, 1976. Between then and 31st December, 1976 about 20 per cent of the herds in County Clare were TB tested and 13 per cent brucellosis tested.  These percentages are a little below the average for other counties but I am satisfied that as the rounds progress the rate of testing for this county will keep pace with the national average.  It is far too early in the rounds of testing to form any conclusions as to the incidence of these diseases in the county as a whole.</P>

      <P>My honest answer is that there is no legislative action open to me that will guarantee that strikes of the kind which broke out in the ESB or CIE would not occur again. In the industrial legislation at present before the House, certain Bills will undoubtedly assist in lessening the number of disputes.  I refer particularly to the Bill we discussed yesterday, the Unfair Dismissals Bill and the Bill we were discussing this morning, Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Bill, which should assist the State industries in ensuring that there will be a lessening of friction between workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>That implication was not made by me.  The legislation before the House will assist in eliminating unnecessary disputes both in the ESB and in industry generally. I referred as an illustration of that <Col N="228" /> to the legislation we had yesterday evening, which was the unfair dismissals legislation and to the legislation we have today, the worker participation legislation.  Managements in the semi-State companies concerned are convinced that the worker participation legislation will have as one of its valuable by-products the improvement of industrial relations in those companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Plans for the development of Dublin Airport provide for a new east/west runway to the north of the terminal area as well as a second parallel runway to the south of this area when traffic growth requires it.  The acquisition of the necessary land for the proposed runways is in train.  It is not possible at this stage to state when construction work on the first of the new runways will commence but present indications are that the runway will not be required before the 1980s.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there will be a need for this runway well in advance of the 1980s?  The Minister's predecessor implied that it would be built before the end of the 1970s.  Apparently now it will be in the 1980s and if there are many more changes in personnel in that office it will go into the 1990s.  Is there any possibility of having it built before then?  There is a major noise problem in the town of Swords which would be alleviated if the runway was changed.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Deputy's fears are not justified.  Since myself and my predecessor took office we took steps towards clearing 700 acres of land necessary for the construction of the runway in question. 400 acres have been acquired since 1974 and another 100 acres are being adjudicated on as to price by the arbitrator at the moment, and the remaining 250 acres are under active consideration.</P>

      <i>The economy in 1976</i>
    </P>
    <P>The economic state of the nation at the end of 1976 was rather more favourable than anybody thought possible at the beginning of the year.  Two comments may be made about this. First, the hazardous nature of economic forecasting is once again made clear.  The problems of accurate forecasting are shared by all economic commentators and I mean no disrespect to other practitioners of the art when I say that the Department of Finance has had a better than average track record over the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>Second, events last year had served to emphasise once again how dependent we are on world influences over which we have for practical purposes no control.  Much of our export success in 1976 was due to world trade being more buoyant than anticipated and to the sharp fall in the value of the pound sterling.  Great credit is due to those of our exporters who exploited the opportunities open to them.</P>
    <P>We made real progress in tackling our problems last year.  The growth rate of 3½ per cent was a very creditable achievement in a year when agricultural output was bound to decline because of inevitable supply contraints arising mainly from the big run-down of cattle stocks in 1975.  Industrial production rose by about 10 per cent in volume and in so doing surpassed the previous peak level of early 1974. In consequence, employment began to rise.  Our industrial exports expanded even more rapidly than production so that, for the second year running, we increased our share of world trade in industrial goods.  As the recovery in economic activity also entailed a sharp rise in the volume of imports, the balance of payments deficit widened from the abnormally low figure of £15 million recorded in 1975 to about £165 million last year.</P>
    <P>Our employment problems have eased to some extent although they are still a cause of grave concern. The increase in numbers out of work in recent months is less than one would expect as a result of normal seasonal influences and there are indications that the underlying trend in <Col N="237" /> unemployment is downward.  Less satisfactory, however, has been our progress in curbing inflation.  The decline of sterling and the associated adjustments to the Green pound have, of course, added to our problems.  But these were compounded by failure last year to secure a more moderate rate of growth in incomes.  The fall in the value of sterling has helped to cushion the effects of exorbitant income increases on our competitive position in recent years but it would, of course, be utter folly to rely on fortuitous&mdash;and unlikely to recur&mdash; circumstances such as this unearned windfall to hold our competitiveness in future.</P>
    <P>While we have some distance to go in winding down inflation, we should not, of course, belittle our achievement so far.  One can judge the improvement by looking at the trend of prices measured by the constant-tax price index, to which I referred in last year's budget.  This index discounts the impact of rises in indirect taxation and, therefore, gives a more realistic picture of the underlying rate of price increases.  It shows a rise of 13 per cent in 1976, a much lower figure than the 20 per cent or more experienced during the peak of our difficulties in the first half of 1975.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Economic prospects for 1977</i>
    </P>
    <P>Developments in the international economy will continue to be a dominant influence on our growth in 1977. Last year has shown us how unpredictable these developments can be and how difficult it is to make accurate forecasts of likely trends in our own economy.  It will be necessary for us to monitor external trends closely in the coming months to ensure that an appropriate domestic policy is being followed.</P>
    <P>Because of the pause in economic growth in the major industrial countries during the late summer, there are still doubts about the pace at which world trade will grow this year.  In more recent months, however, there have been signs of a revival in economic activity, particularly in the United <Col N="238" /> States, Germany and Japan.  Present indications are that this will continue through 1977 and should be reinforced by a more expansionary economic policy in the United States.  However, in Britain, our main export market, demand is likely to remain sluggish throughout the year.</P>
    <P>Overall, the external demand prospects are reasonably good although not quite as favourable as in 1976.  In view of the competitive edge in nonsterling markets we have gained from the depreciation of sterling over the past year, we have a unique opportunity for substantially increasing our share of the export market and laying a sound basis for sustained export-led growth and increased employment. Whether we take advantage of this opportunity depends on the will and ability of our industrialists to exploit it and on the discipline of the social partners in ensuring that we do not fritter away our margin of competitiveness.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Economic strategy 1977</i>
    </P>
    <P>In my Financial Statement last year, I referred to three vital requirements of economic policy, namely, to cut the rate of inflation, to safeguard employment and to limit the growth of public expenditure.  We have made progress in fulfilling these requirements although not to the extent that we would have wished.  Our objective this year must be to consolidate the ground gained and build upon it in 1977.  The main aims of economic policy for 1977 will consequently be to expand economic growth closer to existing capacity so as to facilitate the transition to the higher growth rates outlined in the recent Green Paper, to cut our inflation rate further and to reduce unemployment to the maximum extent possible.  Public expenditure will continue to be subjected therefore to stringent control.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Incomes policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government regard moderation in income increases as the pivot on which the future of our economy hinges.  This has been stated time and time again.  It cannot be said too often. <Col N="239" /> Failure to control the growth of incomes effectively would lead to a loss of competitiveness which, in turn, would result in a loss of export markets and greater penetration of our home market by imports.  This would not only prevent our economy from achieving its growth potential and deprive our expanding work-force of any chance of employment but would also increase unemployment among existing workers and add to our already severe problems in this area.  No action by the Government alone could counteract those developments.</P>
    <P>The Government's concern about incomes is supported by the full weight of reputable independent domestic and international opinion.  I quote from the most recently published OECD Survey on Ireland for example.</P>
    <P>In summary, by far the most urgent task confronting the (Irish) authorities is the need to reduce substantially the increase in nominal incomes. This is a pre-requisite for improving competitiveness, setting the conditions for exported growth in the medium term, and bringing about a significant reduction in unemployment.</P>
    <P>It is evident from our words and actions that the Government's commitment to moderation in the growth of incomes is total.</P>
    <P>In terms of negotiations and discussions both between employers and trade unions and between the Government and the social partners 1976 was a busy year.</P>
    <P>The interim agreement marked an important new departure in that it provided for a series of discussions between employers, trade unions and members of the Government on economic and social strategy for the years 1977-78 covering the availability of resources, employment, welfare, prices, public revenue and expenditure and all forms of income.</P>
    <P>The tripartite conference had available for consideration the Government's Green Paper on Economic and Social Development 1976-1980.  The Green Paper noted that much of our inflation stems from forces outside <Col N="240" /> domestic control.  That is no reason, however, for failing to act in those areas where we have responsibility, especially when we know that domestic actions have added to rather than reduced the effects of imported inflation.</P>
    <P>Increased competitiveness is the key to greater home and export markets for Irish goods but by insistence on large nominal increases in incomes we were threatening this competitiveness and we were choosing consciously or otherwise to give preference to greater short-term increases in living standards for those at work rather than more jobs for others.</P>
    <P>It was against this background that the Government at the tripartite discussions made their offer of tax concessions of £50 million and proposals for expenditure of £50 million extra on employment-giving projects in return for income moderation.</P>
    <P>The Government have informed the parties to the Employer-Labour Conference that they are disposed to maintain the tax concessions and expenditure offer if the reasonable national agreement now in prospect is eventually ratified.  Indeed, I am glad to say that the Government have now decided to boost the allocation for the employment projects to almost £56 million.  This revised figure represents a substantial increase on the original offer.  I shall give details of these measures later but I must make it quite clear here and now that their implementation is contingent upon ratification of the proposals for a new national pay agreement.  In the event of non-ratification of the agreement it would unfortunately not be possible to maintain the revenue-losing tax reliefs and to spend £56 million on new jobs if even more money had to be expended in paying those who are at present working.  It is, therefore, to be hoped that between now and the Finance Bill developments on the incomes front will enable me to include in the Bill the tax reliefs which are universally desired.</P>
    <P>The combination of tax concessions, expenditure on employment-giving projects and reasonable standard pay increases is possible only because the <Col N="241" /> new provisions put limits on costly special claims.  Such claims have in the past added greatly to costs in both the public and private sectors.  It is the total increase in labour costs which is important and which affects both the competitiveness of industry and the burden that the taxpayer and consumer have to meet.</P>
    <P>Despite the rise in earnings which will result from the new agreement, we can still manage to improve our competitiveness in 1977 provided we secure an adequate increase in productivity. This is essential if we are to achieve the expansion in exports necessary to shift the economy on to a higher growth path.  It is, moreover, of vital importance for cutting significantly our high rate of inflation.  In 1977, the economic and monetary situation abroad should be more stable than in 1976, a factor which will assist our own efforts to reduce the rate of price increase.</P>
    <P>Increased exports would not of themselves achieve a sufficient acceleration in the growth of output and employment this year.  For this reason, the Government have decided to impart a significant stimulus to the economy through to-day's measures. Even on a pre-budget basis we have substantially increased the public capital programme and in selecting items for additional current expenditure the prospect of increasing employment was also given top priority.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public sector pay</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>General considerations</i>
    </P>
    <P>The public sector is of its nature labour-intensive.  It is not surprising, therefore, that public service pay at £582 million is the largest single element in current public expenditure. The term public service pay covers the cost of the civil service, national and secondary teachers, the Defence Forces and Garda together with the Exchequer contribution, which is substantial, to the pay of nurses, doctors and other health board employees and vocational teachers.  In addition the Exchequer bears another £106 million of the pay of the staffs of certain <Col N="242" /> State-sponsored bodies, universities and voluntary hospitals and about £55 million on public service pensions.</P>
    <P>This total of £743 million for pay and pensions falling on the Exchequer compares with an estimated 1976 outturn of £679 million and represents an increase of 9.5 per cent.  Large as this total is, it does not include any provision for the various increases arising under a further national pay agreement in 1977.</P>
    <P>
      <i>New developments</i>
    </P>
    <P>In last year's budget I was reluctantly forced by the financial situation to announce that consideration of claims for increases additional to standard national agreement increases should, apart from a few minor exceptions, be deferred.  In line with this constraint the State as employer had to invoke those provisions of the national agreement covering employers faced with serious economic and financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>Despite some improvement since the last budget, our present circumstances leave little money available for such cases in 1977.  The Government are anxious however, as I am sure public servants will accept, that what money is available should be devoted to those cases where the most serious inequity arises.  We are confident that public servants will show the responsibility which is required to keep the cost to the Exchequer within modest limits and thus enable the Government to avoid the need to invoke those provisions of the national agreement to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>On that basis and on the assumption that the proposals for a national agreement are ratified, I am providing a total sum of £46 million to cover all increases in public service pay in 1977. The terms of the proposed national agreement will, of course, be applied to all increases.</P>
    <P>I must stress that the large sum I am providing for public service pay and pensions represents the limit of expenditure on these items in 1977. Any further increase here would necessitate the imposition of extra taxation which would be harmful to <Col N="243" /> the interests of the nation and, indeed, to the real interests of the recipients themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Pensions</i>
    </P>
    <P>Pension increases for public service pensioners, including the full year cost of the 10.6 per cent average increase last July and another increase as from 1st July next, together with a rising number of pensioners, account, in the main, for the increased cost to the Exchequer of public service pensions. The cost for 1977, exclusive of increases that may follow from any new national agreement, is estimated at £55.3 million, an increase of almost 10 per cent or about £5 million on the provisions for 1976.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public service numbers</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Civil service</i>
    </P>
    <P>Since the beginning of 1975 the Government have taken steps to restrict increases in the number of civil servants as far as reasonably possible.  In the civil service there has been a rigid control on staff numbers and increases have been allowed only where there was a clear and immediate need for more staff to avoid serious disruption of work.  The effect of this has been that the increase in the number of civil servants has been 2 per cent in 1975 and less than 1 per cent in 1976, whereas the average annual increase in serving numbers in the preceding 5 years was nearly 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public service</i>
    </P>
    <P>Outside the civil service, tight control on numbers has as far as possible also been maintained but it has not been possible to limit, to the same extent, increases in the teaching and security services.  Because of the continuing increase in the number of pupils, teacher numbers have had to be expanded to maintain teacher-pupil ratios and rose by more than 5 per cent in 1975 and by approximately 4 per cent in 1976.  The continuing difficult security situation has also necessitated significant expansion in the Garda and Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="244" /> Budgetary realities leave the Government with no option but to continue a restriction on public service numbers. This will create problems in some areas where the volume of work is continually expanding.  Such problems can be and indeed have been offset by improvements in efficiency and better deployment of staff.  Considerable progress has been made in these respects over the last two years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Outturn of current budget 1976</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year I referred to the disturbing rate of growth in public expenditure&mdash; particularly in non-capital expenditure &mdash;over the previous decade and I said that, while high spending policies were justified during a period of depression such as we had been experiencing in common with other countries, nevertheless as soon as economic recovery returned the Government would have to be extremely vigilant to ensure that public expenditure did not pre-empt resources needed by the private sector. I emphasised that the Government's budgetary aim for 1976 would be to use public expenditure, within the real constraints on resources, to stimulate economic activity and that in order to achieve this current expenditure would be pruned where it did not contribute significantly to increased economic activity in order to free resources for growth and job creation.</P>
    <P>I allowed in my 1976 budget for total current spending of £1,683 million.  An indication of the success of the Government's policy of keeping a tight rein on current expenditure is that not alone was this figure not exceeded, despite a continued high level of inflation, but it was possible to accommodate an additional £5 million for social welfare and £11 million for the health services as well as meeting the 1976 cost, £13 million, of the interim pay agreement for the public service within a reduced total expenditure figure of £1,672 million, that is, £11 million less.  This is a unique and most heartening achievement.  Never before in the past 20 years has it been possible to contain public expenditure during the course of a year within the original budget estimate.</P>
    <P>The current budget deficit for 1976 <Col N="245" /> was £201.4 million, about £126 million less than the amount originally estimated in the 1976 budget.  This reduction combined with a lower than anticipated level of capital spending to bring the overall Exchequer borrowing requirement down from £679 million to £506 million.</P>
    <P>Another important factor in reducing the current budget deficit for 1976 was tax revenue buoyancy.  Tax revenue exceeded budget estimates by £115 million, of which about £35 million is attributable to increased incomes and personal consumption arising from the increases under the subsequent interim pay agreement, which could not of course have been taken into account at budget time.  As well, revenue buoyancy rose in step with the faster than expected improvement in the general rate of economic growth during the year.  VAT receipts were particularly buoyant, bringing in £41 million more than the budget estimate, while customs and excise receipts exceeded the budget estimate by £24 million: a considerable portion of the extra customs receipts, for instance, was directly attributable to the rising level of imports as industrial activity picked up.  An important influence on the performance of revenue under those heads was the spurt in motor vehicle sales during the course of the year and an increase in petrol sales to almost 4 per cent above pre oil-crisis levels.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of illinformed and misleading comment on the significance for 1977 budgetary policy of this relative improvement in the state of the public finances, particularly on current account.  The fact is conveniently overlooked that the increased revenue buoyancy and the strict control on public expenditure during 1976 simply enabled the amount of borrowing required to meet the current budget deficit to be reduced by some £126 million below the all-time high level anticipated at the beginning of the year.  Despite that reduction, it was still necessary to borrow £201 million or about 4.6 per cent of GNP to finance the current budget deficit alone.  This relative improvement clearly cannot be regarded as a <Col N="246" /> windfall available to finance concessions or as a signal that the way is now clear for a spending spree in 1977.  There is in fact no room for complacency based on the expectation of a continuation of this pattern in 1977.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Budgetary policy 1976 and 1977</i>
    </P>
    <P>The sharp reduction in the current deficit and borrowing requirement that emerged during the course of 1976 marked the beginning of a transition from recession to economic recovery. In 1974 and 1975 successive injections of public expenditure had been necessary to stimulate economic activity and support living standards and employment at a time when little could be expected from the private sector.  It is undeniable that the heavy borrowing to finance growing current deficits as well as capital spending was the correct response to the economic situation then facing us.  With the movement into the recovery phase, however, continuation of the pattern of a growing volume of public expenditure, increasing deficits and heavy borrowing would progressively hinder rather than sustain economic activity and the burden of debt service would quickly become insupportable.  At the present time growing debt service charges related to earlier borrowings are beginning to eat into available revenue at an undesirable rate.  In 1977 debt service charges will absorb one-quarter of all tax revenue; they will rise even more steeply in the next few years. Further borrowings during a period of economic recovery run the risk of crowding out the growing demands from the private sector for funds to finance expansion.  It was for this reason that the 1976 budget was designed to provide for substantially slower volume growth of Government consumption than in 1975 and for the imposition of higher indirect taxes.  A further significant development in policy was that within the overall total of Government expenditure a start was made in changing the emphasis from current to capital expenditure, notably to manufacturing investment. Thus the groundwork was laid for the acceleration of manufacturing investment which is necessary if growth <Col N="247" /> potential is to be realised and further employment created.</P>
    <P>The Government will pursue this realignment again in 1977.  A tight rein will continue to be maintained on current expenditure which, apart from Central Fund Services related to service of debt, is estimated to grow by no more than about 10½ per cent in cash terms on a pre-budget basis.  This is well below the growth forecast for GNP in money terms.  Capital expenditure on the other hand will be maintained in volume terms, even before account is taken of the capital element of the special employment-giving addition of almost £56 million which is related to ratification of the terms of the proposed national agreement.</P>
    <P>In setting ceilings for the current budget deficit and for the borrowing requirement in 1977 we must carefully watch the danger of undermining the recovery of the economy particularly at a time such as the present when growth and consumption are extremely sensitive to budgetary action. An over-sharp reduction in the deficit and borrowing requirement would require cuts in public expenditure programmes or tax increases so severe that their deflationary effects would seriously affect the performance of the economy in 1977 and reduce rather than increase employment.  Higher unemployment itself results in additional Government expenditure in the form of social welfare benefits and also reduces tax yields.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Revenue buoyancy</i>
    </P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, revenue buoyancy improved dramatically in 1976 as the recovery got under way. However, with a lower level of inflation and a more modest increase in incomes, a somewhat lower rate of increase in revenue yields is to be expected in 1977.  My estimate of total receipts for 1977 from tax revenue, including motor vehicle duties and non-tax revenue, as shown in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure, is £1,755 million.  This shows an increase of £284 million or over 19 per cent on the 1976 outturn.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="248" />
      <i>1977 non-capital allocations</i>
    </P>
    <P>In stressing the need for a sharp reduction in the rate of growth of public expenditure, the Government have pointed out that such a reduction is particularly necessary at a time when demands from the private sector for funds for development will increase in step with the return to a higher level of economic growth.  This concern has also, of course, been expressed in many other quarters.</P>
    <P>It is much easier to introduce new public services to meet needs as they emerge than it is to terminate programmes introduced in earlier years whose life-span may have begun to outlast their real relevance.  As a result, the aggregate cost and coverage of public expenditure tends to snowball as the burden of past decisions remains with us.  If the rate of growth of public expenditure is to be brought under control it is essential that steps be taken to reappraise all existing expenditures in the light of present and future&mdash;not just past&mdash;needs.</P>
    <P>The Government are determined to act in the national interest, though any moves in this direction, I need hardly say, are sometimes far from popular. Temporary political capital can easily be made about the result of attempts to tailor public expenditures more closely to present and future needs and within existing resources, but I have no doubt that thinking people will welcome expenditure control.  Steps are being taken to ensure that the examination of public expenditures from the point of view of effectiveness and relevance will continue throughout the year rather than being compressed into the crowded few months in which departmental spending allocations are decided.  I intend to ensure that this continuous review of existing public expenditure programmes will become a growing feature of the work of all Departments of State and believe that this will make a substantial contribution towards achieving the Government's objectives of getting the best possible value for money in order to free resources for productive capital investment.</P>
    <P>The opening total for current <Col N="249" /> expenditure in 1977 is £1,917 million. Of this, by far the largest component is the non-capital supply services which, as published last week in the Estimates Volume, at £1,496 million, show an increase of £138 million, or 10 per cent, over the 1976 level of expenditure on these services.  As indicated earlier, this figure makes no provision for any pay increases which may arise in the public service in 1977 nor does it include the cost of any additional social welfare measures or employment-creating schemes.  It does, however, allow for additional expenditure of £34 million on the health services, including the final instalment of the transfer of the health charges from the rates to the Exchequer.  An additional £20 million is being allocated for education, while security-related expenditure on the Army and Garda is up by £14 million.  Expenditure on local government services shows an increase of £9 million of which £5 million is for housing subsidy.  The Estimates Volume provisions will, in general, enable existing services to be continued at their present levels.</P>
    <P>
      <i>1976 Public Capital Programme outturn</i>
    </P>
    <P>Expenditure on the public capital programme in 1976 was £544 million, that is some 9 per cent, or £52 million, less than the budget estimate. The difference between the budget estimate and actual expenditure did not in any way result from a financial cut-back.  The money was there but the demand for it was not.  There was a saving of £29.5 million on industrial investment and on loan finance for industry attributable to a slower rate of maturing payments, non-completion of development plans for some projects and, in the case of Fóir Teoranta, a drop in the number of firms in financial difficulty looking for assistance&mdash;always a healthy sign. There was a sharp drop in demand for Exchequer-financed local authority house purchase loans due to greater availability of funds from the building societies.  Incidentally, about half of this saving was used to increase the allocations for sanitary and environmental <Col N="250" /> services.  Withdrawal of services by veterinary surgeons resulted in net underspending of £11 million on animal disease eradication but again about half of this saving was diverted to the farm modernisation, farm buildings and land project schemes.  Finally, the provision of £3 million in last year's programme for investment in mining concerns was not spent because of the lateness of the arbitrator's decision on the value of mining shares.</P>
    <P>
      <i>1977 Public Capital Programme</i>
    </P>
    <P>The 1977 public capital programme recently published amounts to £627 million, that is, 15 per cent over the 1976 outturn.  This level of expenditure will more than maintain the impetus of the expanded capital programme of recent years.  The Government, in determining the composition of the programme, have emphasised productive and infrastructural investment, which together amount to 75 per cent of the programme, compared to 71 per cent in 1976, and have given priority to items of major economic importance. For example, the allocation for energy investment, including the development of resources of natural gas and peat, is £28 million, or 56 per cent up on the 1976 level of expenditure.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Employment-creating public expenditure package</i>
    </P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, acceptance of reasonable income increases in 1977 will make possible extra expenditure on highly desirable employment-creating projects.  Because of limitation on resources this expenditure is dependent on ratification of the proposals for a new national agreement.  I am, therefore, in hopeful anticipation, allocating £55.5 million in order to improve job prospects.  £36.6 million of this extra spending will take place under the public capital programme.  Among the major increases are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;£12¼ million to increase the provision for industrial investment</P>
    <P>&mdash;£12 million to be spent on increased building and construction investment in schools, hospitals, office buildings and training centres</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="251" />&mdash;£2½ million on harbour development works including provision for a start to work on the Cork Harbour Development scheme</P>
    <P>&mdash;£2½ million for telephone development</P>
    <P>&mdash;£2½ million for the farm modernisation scheme</P>
    <P>&mdash;£2 million for loan finance for industry.</P>
    <P>I should, of course, mention that in addition to the extra direct investment of £12 million in the building and construction activities I have listed, the increased allocations for industry, harbours, farm modernisation and telecommunications will also directly generate increased building and construction activity.</P>
    <P>Current expenditure allocations directly related to improving job prospects are being increased by £18.9 million. Some £11.8 million will be spent to increase job opportunities in the health&mdash;£10 million&mdash;and teaching&mdash; £1.8 million&mdash;services.  The additional expenditure on teaching will be particularly helpful in increasing the number of teachers for first and secondlevel schools in urban areas to reduce the size of classes.  £4.1 million will be expended on a new premium scheme for extra workers.  There will be a special scheme to encourage employers to engage school leavers.  Provision will also be made for employment of young people on desirable community works that would not be undertaken in the normal course.  There will be increased spending&mdash;£2 million&mdash;on road improvement works.  The contents of the job creation programme are described in greater detail in the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo; statement which will be circulated on the conclusion of my statement.</P>
    <P>The additional direct employment to which these expenditures will give rise should be of the order of 7,000 new jobs mainly in 1977.  The indirect consequences for employment creation should be even more far-reaching when account is taken of the effects throughout the economy of the additional activity to which these increased allocations will give rise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="252" /> I cannot too strongly stress the importance of not relying unduly on public expenditure to generate jobs. Between 1971-72 and 1976, with the objective of increasing employment, public capital expenditure rose by 154 per cent.  At the end of that period the number of persons in employment had not increased.  That is why, as I will indicate later on, special incentives are being given to the private sector to increase employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Higher education grants</i>
    </P>
    <P>The employment-creating package of special measures to assist school leavers and the additional education building programme lead me to mention a related matter in the area of services for youth.</P>
    <P>With effect from the 1977-78 academic year the maximum maintenance grants will be increased from £300 to £350 for university students whose normal family residence is outside a university town and from £120 to £140 in the case of other students.  Corresponding increases will be paid in the case of scholarships provided by the vocational education committees.  These increases are, of course, over and above the improvements in fee grants which have kept pace with rises in fees generally.  The cost of these improvements will amount to £300,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Extension of fishery limits</i>
    </P>
    <P>The extension of our fishery limits to 200 miles necessitates the strengthening of our national fishery protection capacity.  Our EEC partners have, of course, agreed to share equitably the expenditure involved in patrolling and controlling the extended zone off the Irish coast.  In anticipation of the Community meeting not less than 75 per cent of the cost, I propose to make an additional allocation of £1.2 million for fishery protection over and above what is already provided in the Estimate for Defence for 1977.  Some £440,000 of the supplementary expenditure will be in respect of the down-payment on a third allweather fishery protection vessel to be constructed in Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" />
      <i>Monetary policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>Monetary policy in 1976 was designed to contribute towards economic recovery, in particular by ensuring that the reasonable credit needs of the private sector would be met.  There has been a substantial and welcome increase in lending to the private sector.  The fact that much of this increase was to manufacturing industry and agriculture is a further reflection of the improvement in the economy during the past year.  It is important that during the coming year available credit should be used to support and sustain national development. The productive sectors of the economy and the promotion of exports must continue to have priority.  The continued participation of the associated banks in the provision of credit on competitive terms for exports of capital goods and housing finance will be most helpful and I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for their co-operation.  In 1975 the banks agreed to invest £40 million in house-purchase loans over a two-year period.  This amount has been fully committed and has financed the purchase of approximately 3,600 houses. The banks have intimated to me that, depending on the rate of growth in their resources and the overall demand for credit, they plan to allocate at least a further £20 million for house-purchase loans this year.</P>
    <P>As recently announced the banks have also decided to introduce a scheme tailored to the long-term development needs of agriculture. This is further welcome evidence of the continued readiness of the banking system to support worthwhile national developments.  Coupled with the development loan scheme operated by the Agricultural Credit Corporation, it means that a substantial pool of long-term capital on attractive terms is now at the disposal of farmers anxious to undertake the planned improvement of their holdings.</P>
    <P>On the subject of housing, it is fitting to acknowledge the major contribution of the building societies in this field.  Final figures are not yet to hand but all the pointers are that the societies in 1976 paid out loans of the <Col N="254" /> order of £95 million in respect of 12,000 houses, almost half as much again as in 1975, which was itself a record year.  This massive investment was made possible because of a very high level of savings.  It is well to underline the lesson, obvious though it should be, that all investment depends in the final analysis on saving. We shall not achieve our aims in housing, industry or agriculture unless we are prepared to transfer resources from present consumption to capital formation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Interest rates</i>
    </P>
    <P>After a fall in the early part of 1976 bank rates are again at very high levels.  Developments internationally and particularly in Britain made increases in Irish interest rates unavoidable&mdash;unsuitable as are high interest rates in our state of development. The increases in bank interest rates here were, however, moderated to the greatest extent practicable in order to minimise their effect on the country's economic growth.  Interest rate trends are currently drifting downwards again and offer hope of a return to rates more suited to Ireland's long-term needs.</P>
    <P>The course of interest rates in 1977 is closely bound up with the likely pace of recovery in the major trading economies and the fortunes of the sterling exchange rate.  The situation will be kept under close scrutiny in coming months and our interest rates will be brought back to a level more in keeping with our needs, at the first opportune moment.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Exchequer borrowing</i>
    </P>
    <P>The reduction in the 1976 current budget deficit from £327 million to £201 million and the savings on the capital budget reduced the Exchequer's borrowing requirement from an estimated £679 million to £506 million last year.</P>
    <P>The volume of sales of securities to the non-bank public, at £138 million, was satisfactory and indicated investors' confidence in the soundness of <Col N="255" /> the economy.  Receipts from this source prior to 1975 were generally of the order of only £20 million to £30 million.  Sales of securities to the banks in 1976, at £46 million, were below expectations.  Investment by the banks in Government securities in 1975 had, however, been substantially higher than was necessary to comply with the Central Bank's liquidity ratios so that they entered 1976 with part of their commitment already met.  This, combined with the effect on their resources of the regrettable bank strike, accounts for the disappointing outcome.</P>
    <P>The Government's overall borrowing requirement in 1976, at £506 million, represented 11.5 per cent of GNP.  While this is still very high by reference to the past and by international standards it represents a substantial improvement over the 1975 figure of 16.9 per cent.  As I have repeatedly stated, such a high reliance on borrowed funds, correct at the time of recession, cannot continue indefinitely. The worst effects of the depression are now, hopefully, over and significant progress has already been made towards restoring greater equilibrium in the national finances.  This must be a gradual process and nobody could sensibly argue for drastic sudden changes.  I shall discuss the borrowing requirement for 1977 later in my statement.</P>
    <P>
      <i>National loan</i>
    </P>
    <P>No national loan was issued last year.  The immediate reason for this was the unsettled state of interest rates and the consequent difficulty of setting a price which, because of the time needed for printing, distribution and subscription, must be fixed about a month in advance of the final subscription date.  In any event in recent years national loans have played a diminishing role in State financing. The market in Government securities is now sufficiently developed to ensure that the vast bulk of funds available for investment is catered for by the issue from time to time of tranches of existing securities.  New stock issues will continue to be necessary but procedures better suited to developments <Col N="256" /> in the market will be followed.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Debt service cost</i>
    </P>
    <P>Exchequer borrowing results in a heavy burden of debt service charges. From £337 million last year, the cost of servicing the public debt will rise to £448 million in the current year. If Exchequer borrowing were to continue at the rate of recent years, an ever-increasing share of future revenues would be pre-empted by debt service costs.  The fact that so much of our borrowing has been in foreign currencies compounds the problem.  In 1976 the equivalent in foreign currencies of £324 million was raised abroad.  Foreign loans have to be repaid in foreign currencies so that a depreciation of the Irish £ against such currencies increases the cost of servicing the debts.  Interest payments on foreign loans must also be paid in foreign currencies and unlike such payments in respect of domestic borrowings no tax is recoverable. These avoidable realities ought to dispel any illusion that borrowing is a soft painless alternative to taxing.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Small savings</i>
    </P>
    <P>Small savings in 1976, at £53 million, showed a big improvement over 1975 when the figure was £39 million.  Very considerable use was made of the facilities provided by the Post Office and Trustee Savings Banks during the bank strike and no doubt this experience brought home to many the advantages of saving with these institutions.  I have already expressed in public my appreciation of the contribution by these institutions to the easing of the difficulties caused by the closure of the associated banks last year and I am happy to take this opportunity to do so again.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Increases in post office charges</i>
    </P>
    <P>Post office services, which should be self-financing, are running at a substantial loss on their commercial accounts.  The telephone service lost £8.8 million in 1976 and now is losing almost half a million pounds a week. The loss in prospect on the postal service <Col N="257" /> is £3.7 million this year.  These losses have to be made good by taxpayers through general taxation.</P>
    <P>The Post Office's financial difficulties can be attributed to sharply increasing costs which were not matched by corresponding increases in traffic and charges.  Between 1971 and 1976 while increases in expenditure on the postal and telephone services, respectively, amounted to 144 per cent and 273 per cent, the charges increased in the same period by only 115 per cent and 88 per cent respectively.  Those increases were in fact less than the general increase in the cost of living in the period.  Inevitably, therefore, heavy losses arose on these services.</P>
    <P>The major factor in the increased costs has been pay increases.  In addition, in the case of the telephone service a significant but necessary growth in the number of staff employed reflected the very substantial development of that service.</P>
    <P>The second important factor has been the increasingly heavy capital cost of telephone development: the cost of interest and depreciation has increased from £7.6 million in 1971 to an estimated £26.4 million in 1977, an increase of 247 per cent and now represents 38 per cent of expenditure on the telephone service.  The country is now obliged to pay the cost of culpable underinvestment in the sixties and early seventies when the potential for growth in traffic to service the investment was considerably greater and when capital costs were much lower.  Notwithstanding the enormous capital cost of improving the telephone service at present, the truth is that any further delay would be not merely an inconvenience but an intolerable handicap to business and industry. Unfortunately the growth in telephone traffic has fallen steeply since 1974 because of the general economic situation, despite an annual increase in the number of subscribers.</P>
    <P>While every effort is being made to improve the efficiency of the postal and telephone services, resultant savings will have but marginal effects on costs.  Unfortunately there is no solution to the problems of the Post <Col N="258" /> Office other than to increase charges to cover costs.  The alternative would be to require taxpayers generally to subsidise telephone losses in full.  It is only reasonable that users of Post Office services should pay for the services they avail of.  Increases in charges will take effect on 1st April next and will average 13 per cent on postal services and 25 per cent on telephone, telegram and telex services.  My respected friend, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, will announce details of the increases.</P>
    <P>I am looking to these increases to generate, in cash terms, an additional £17 million in non-tax revenue.  The effects on the Post Office commercial accounts of the increases will be to eliminative the prospective deficit on the postal service in 1977 and to reduce substantially, but not to eliminate, the deficit on the telephone service.  Consideration was given to bridging the gap in full between income and expenditure on the telephone service by way of increased charges alone but it was felt that such action could depress telephone usage and therefore be counter-productive.  The actual reduction in the telephone service deficit will depend, apart from increased income from higher charges, on the extent of the improvement in the economic situation this year, a factor to which telephone traffic growth normally responds.  Traffic should also be boosted when major works on which capital was spent in recent years become fully operational. New facilities such as a more extensive automatic dialling capacity and improvements in the quality of the telephone service almost invariably give rise to greater telephone use.  It is encouraging to note that already there are signs of a reversal of the trend of slow telephone traffic growth experienced during the recession.  There are indications that telephone traffic in the last half of 1976 showed a marked increase on the level of traffic experienced previously.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Indirect Taxes</i>
    </P>
    <P>While an increase in post office charges is absolutely unavoidable for the reasons I have given, I am glad <Col N="259" /> to be able to say that there will be no increase at all in excise duties in this budget.  The Government have decided on this course even though excise duties and VAT on a number of commodities already constitute a lower proportion of the retail price than was the case four years ago. Indeed, at no time in the past eight years has the tax content of spirits as a percentage of the retail price been as low as it is now.  I am confident that the standstill on rates of excise duties will, therefore, make a considerable contribution to keeping down living costs in 1977.  It should also provide a considerable stimulus to the Irish manufacturers concerned by allowing a faster expansion of their home sales base than might otherwise have been the case.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Farm incomes/Green £ effects</i>
    </P>
    <P>Developments in agriculture have been very favourable for our farmers in the past two years during which farm incomes have increased by about two-thirds.  Substantial price increases for all our agricultural products have been secured as a result of the annual EEC review of prices, the aligning of our prices to the higher EEC levels as part of our transitional entry arrangements and the substantial green £ changes negotiated by my esteemed friend the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  With favourable market conditions, the prospects for agriculture in 1977 are very good and further substantial rises in farm incomes can be expected.</P>
    <P>The two major changes in the green £ secured recently&mdash;7.6 per cent, effective from 11th October, 1976, and 8 per cent, effective from 17th January &mdash;will give a significant increase to farm incomes in 1977 on top of whatever price increases may otherwise arise during the year.  These two green £ changes on their own should increase farm incomes by about £125 million a year.  Of this increase, foreign earnings will account for about £85 million and home consumption for the balance.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to press vigorously to have the burden of the remaining MCAs removed in order <Col N="260" /> that agriculture can make the maximum contribution to the growth of our economy.</P>
    <P>To give liquid milk producers price increases in line with the creamery milk prices improvements which have followed from recent green £ adjustments, the Government have decided to allow an average increase of 7p per gallon for liquid milk.  The details of this increase will be the subject of a separate announcement shortly by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Food subsidies</i>
    </P>
    <P>In order to offset the consumer effects of increases in the retail prices of milk, butter and cheese as a result of recent green £ changes, the Government are providing an additional £9.5 million for food subsidies to avoid a substantial addition to the consumer price index of the order of ½ per cent which would otherwise occur.  Taking account of the provisions already made for the existing subsidies on milk, butter, bread and flour the Government will, therefore, be spending a total of £48 million this year to keep down food prices.  If these subsidies were removed the cost of living would immediately rise by almost 2½ per cent. This is very real evidence of the Government's efforts not only to ease the strain on the weekly family budget but also to curb the rate of inflation and provide more favourable conditions for payment restraint.  Another financial easement to which I will later refer will make a further Government contribution to keeping down the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Taxation of farming profits</i>
    </P>
    <P>Expressed as a proportion of GNP the total revenue estimated for 1977 amounts to about one-third.  While the proportion of GNP taken as tax has, as in most developed countries, risen, over time, it is not particularly high compared with other countries.  For instance, in 1974, the most recent year for which comparisons are readily available, Ireland is shown as having the lowest ratio of tax receipts&mdash;including social security contributions&mdash; to GDP of all EEC member states with the single exception of Italy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="261" /> Despite the steeply progressive structure and high marginal rates of Irish personal taxation, the yield is relatively low.  This striking disparity underlines a serious imbalance which requires correction.  The main reasons for the low yield are, of course, the considerable size of our self-employed sector, particularly those engaged in agriculture as compared with the employee sector, and the fact that only about one-half of the 1 per cent of agricultural incomes finds its way into the direct tax system compared with about 20 per cent of employee incomes.</P>
    <P>The measures introduced in 1974 for the taxation of farmers have so far yielded only £6 million in all.  The Government have been concerned to adjust this imbalance while making proper allowance for the investment needs of farmers but the problem is how best to collect a fair share of tax from rising farm incomes without inhibiting the development of farming.</P>
    <P>At the request of the Government, the National Economic and Social Council produced a report on farmer taxation last year.  Since then farm incomes have increased, and are continuing to increase, at a rate much faster than was expected at the time the report was being prepared.  Recent EEC price adjustments have given rise to substantial increases in farmers' incomes generally, the benefits of which will be fully reflected in 1977 and future years.  The Government have, therefore, decided that, in all equity, a substantial contribution to the national finances in 1977 must be sought by way of income taxation from the farming sector.  The threshold for liability to income tax will be reduced from the present rateable valuation of £100 to £75 for the year of assessment 1977-78.  This will mean that, out of a total of some 170,000 farmers, about 6,500 will now become liable in addition to the 9,000 or so already liable.</P>
    <P>The notional system of assessment will be retained for 1977-78.  This provides an incentive to progressive farmers in that income in excess of the notional income is retained free of tax and is, therefore, available in full <Col N="262" /> for reinvestment.  The notional system is also warranted by the inadequacy of the accounts kept by farmers in general at present.  It is, therefore, capable of providing a surer and faster return to the Exchequer than the accounts system.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, the multiplier is the figure by which the rateable valuation of the land is multiplied to arrive at notional income.  The multiplier is now being raised from 40 to 65, although a full-value multiplier on a national basis arising from farm incomes in 1976 would be around 80. Deductions will be allowed only in respect of the normal personal reliefs, including that on interest paid on borrowing up to the limit of £2,000, and in respect of local authority rates on land.  The proposed multiplier of 65 takes account of the fact that, so as to simplify and expedite assessment, wages, contractors' fees and depreciation will not be allowed as deductions. A system of marginal relief will operate for farms with rateable valuations from £75 up to £84.  Under this system, a farmer with land of a rateable valuation of £75 will be liable only for one-tenth of his full income tax, a farmer with land of £76 valuation for two tenths, and so on until, at a valuation of £84 or above, he will be liable in full.</P>
    <P>The extension of the income tax system, in the Government's view, is the fastest way of bringing farmers closer into line with the rest of the community as regards their contribution to the national finances.  Very considerable delays have been experienced in collecting tax from farmers under the present system.  Because farmers' incomes have risen rapidly&mdash; and will continue to rise&mdash;and in the light of the advantages which the notional system will offer to expanding farmers, the Government have decided to introduce new arrangements to speed up collection.  All farmers liable for income tax will be assessed on the notional basis and the tax will be payable on 1st September, 1977.  Delay or default will be subject to the usual interest charge.  A farmer may appeal against his assessment to his tax inspector on the basis of <Col N="263" /> accounts produced by him.  If the inspector is satisfied that he has been over-taxed, the excess will be promptly refunded together with interest at the rate applicable to delays in payment of tax.  To facilitate those who may not have previously been keeping accounts, appeals may, at the taxpayer's option, be based on current year's accounts instead of on accounts relating to the preceding year.</P>
    <P>Holders of farm land who, or whose spouses, are also engaged in another trade or profession are at present liable to income tax on their farming profits if the rateable valuation of their land is over £50.  Moreover, they are assessed on the basis of submitted accounts only; they are not given the option of the notional system.  The Finance Bill will contain a provision to abolish the £50 threshold and to make such persons liable on their farming profits regardless of the valuation of the land.  Assessment will be on the same notional basis and tax will be payable on the same day as in the case of farmers occupying land with a rateable valuation of £75 or more.</P>
    <P>I propose to implement at this stage two of the NESC recommendations relevant to the accounts system of assessment.  Free depreciation will be allowed in respect of the capital cost of fences, roadways, holding yards, drainage and land reclamation to farmers who lodge appeals, by reference to accounts submitted, against tax paid on the notional basis.  The NESC recommendation that, in valuing breeding livestock for tax purposes, farmers should be given the option of an alternative to the present arrangements, is being accepted also.  Consultations are taking place with farming interests with a view to the introduction of an appropriate scheme.</P>
    <P>This completes the package of measures relating to the taxation of farming profits.  It is designed to yield some £35 million revenue in 1977 which represents about 5 per cent of farming incomes, as compared with 20 per cent in the case of employee incomes. Its effects will be monitored closely, both in terms of revenue receipts and of investment and expansion <Col N="264" /> in agriculture.  On the results achieved will be decided what further measures are desirable in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Changes in personal income tax code</i>
    </P>
    <P>As the Government's Green Paper on Economic and Social Development has pointed out, over the past 15 years our community had in effect given preference to greater nominal increases in incomes for those at work rather than to the provision of jobs for more people.  The decision to maintain or increase the living standards of those at work at the cost of more unemployment was, of course, an implicit one but the effects were no less real for that.  Higher rates of taxation are unavoidable when, in a situation of declining economic activity, a growing number of unemployed must be maintained by a reduced workforce.  Living standards of all those who are still at work and those who are out of work inevitably suffer.</P>
    <P>The increased output, which results from restraint in nominal income increases, in turn allows employment to be expanded and reduces the burden of public expenditure, while the increased economic activity stimulates revenue buoyancy so that the burden of taxes on the individual worker can be relieved and his living standard preserved even though nominal wages are increasing more slowly than before.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises the need for a favourable tax environment to stimulate economic growth. In preparing the 1977 budget, therefore, I have been anxious to improve the personal tax code in order to reduce the disincentive effects of existing marginal tax rates.</P>
    <P>A basic objective of the Government, which we spelt out at the Tripartite Conference, is to generate appreciation of the need, both on general economic grounds and in the interests of preserving living standards, for incomes settlements which would combine income restraint with reductions in personal tax rates to give worth-while improvements in takehome pay.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the developments at the Tripartite Conference <Col N="265" /> and at the Employer-Labour Conference in recent months.  We now have the position that a wage settlement has been negotiated which the Government are prepared to endorse and support with reductions in personal income tax rates which will cost £50 million in 1977 and £72 million in a full year.  I might usefully comment here that tax reliefs on this scale are unprecedented.  Their value is highlighted also by the fact that they are being granted at a time of continuing budgetary difficulties.</P>
    <P>In considering how best the concessions could be applied, the Government examined a number of different options in regard to changes in the code.  They have settled on the following scheme as being the best and fairest.  It is designed to secure worthwhile reductions in the tax burden at all levels of income and at the same time to minimise the disincentive effect inseparable from any system of taxation of incomes.</P>
    <P>The following will be the rates applicable to bands of taxable income. By &ldquo;taxable income&rdquo; is meant the part of gross income which remains after personal and other allowances have been deducted: A rate of 20 per cent will apply to the first £500; a rate of 25 per cent will apply to the next £1,000; a rate of 35 per cent will apply to the next £3,000; a rate of 45 per cent will apply to the next £1,500; a rate of 50 per cent will apply to the next £1,000; a rate of 60 per cent will apply to the balance of taxable income.  The reductions in rates and changes in bands, amounting to a complete restructuring of the system, will of themselves give substantial relief to taxpayers, but in addition I am increasing allowances as follows: The single allowance will be increased by £45 to £665; the married allowance will be increased by £90 to £1,100; the widowed allowance will be increased by £50 to £735.</P>
    <P>Every taxpayer in the country will benefit from this new structure.  The introduction of a new band at 20 per cent will be of considerable benefit to the lower-income taxpayer while the reduction in the top marginal rate from 77 per cent to 60 per cent provides <Col N="266" /> a major incentive to enterprise.  A married person earning £60 a week will save about £1.67 a week, which amounts to a reduction of about 14 per cent on his existing tax bill.</P>
    <P>A few examples will also help to underline the advantage for workers of combining tax reliefs and wage increases rather than simply opting for higher nominal wage increases.  The proposed agreement would give a person earning £80 a week at present an increase of £6.08 in his wages.  If he were married, the wage increase and tax concessions together would give him an increase in weekly after-tax income of £6.30.  In the absence of the tax concessions it would require an increase of £10.25 a week in his gross wages to give an equivalent increase in after-tax income.  A more detailed analysis of the effects of the changes and of their effect on disposable incomes when combined with the wage increases now proposed will be found in the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo; statement which will be circulated shortly.</P>
    <P>I am also taking steps to ensure that nobody whose income consists entirely of a social welfare pension will be subject to income tax.  In the difficult circumstances of the present time the ability to offer tax concessions on this scale represents a remarkable achievement in itself.  However, as I have said already and must again emphasise, the implementation of these concessions will be possible only if the draft national pay agreement is ratified by the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Advancement of Schedule D payment dates</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Finance Act, 1976 provided for the advancement by six months of the due dates for payment of Schedule D tax.  This advancement was to be achieved in two stages and would mean that, in the tax year 1977-78, and in subsequent years, the payment dates for the first and second moieties of Schedule D tax would be 1st July and 1st January, respectively.  In deference to representations made to me that the full advancement envisaged would have undesirable effects on <Col N="267" /> liquidity in some cases this year and also in order to give more time early in the tax year for settlement of assessments, I now propose that the date for payment of the first moiety of Schedule D tax be set at 1st September instead of 1st July as previously envisaged.  This concession will affect 1977-78 and subsequent tax years.  The date for payment of second moieties from 1977-78 onwards will be 1st January as provided for last year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Retirement benefit schemes</i>
    </P>
    <P>One other area in which I propose to give some relief is that of premiums paid by self-employed persons in order to secure a life annuity for themselves after retirement.  Tax relief is given at present in respect of these premiums up to 15 per cent of net relevant earnings subject to a maximum premium of £1,500.  I propose to increase the £1,500 cash limit to £2,000.  The 15 per cent limitation will, of course, remain.</P>
    <P>Ex gratia <i>public service widows' pensions</i></P>
    <P>This is perhaps an appropriate place for me to mention another concession I propose in the pensions field.  While inflation bears hard on many sectors, its effects are particularly severe on widows and their children.  The State, as an employer, already provides <i>ex gratia</i> pensions for the widows and children of established civil servants who died or retired prior to July, 1968, and who cannot, therefore, benefit from the contributory scheme introduced from that date.  These <i>ex gratia</i> pensions are at one-half the rate payable under the contributory scheme.  Similar arrangements apply, as appropriate, to other branches of the public service.  These pensioners have, of course, had their pensions increased annually each July in line with public service pensions generally.</P>
    <P>The Government have given sympathetic consideration to the position of these widows in the light of numerous representations on their behalf. They have now decided to raise the level of the <i>ex gratia</i> pensions from <Col N="268" /> one-half to two-thirds of the rate payable under the contributory widows' and children's pension scheme, with effect from 1st July, 1977.  The Exchequer cost is approximately £460,000 in 1977, rising to £1,100,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Company taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Inflation accounting</i>
    </P>
    <P>As my financial statement last January noted, there has been considerable controversy in recent years as to whether present accounting practices are defective in that they may overstate the real profits of a trading concern in an inflationary environment.  A major recent development has been the publication by the accountancy profession of draft discussion proposals in this matter and it is hoped that agreement will result as to what changes in accounting practice may be necessary. Such changes could, of course, have far-reaching implications not only for the business community but also in the taxation field.  I would like to reassure all concerned that the Government will consider carefully whatever proposals may be made by the accountancy profession in the matter. Discussions will be held as necessary with the profession and other interested parties in regard to their implications for taxation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Stock relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>In the 1975 budget I introduced a special <i>ad hoc</i> tax relief for firms in certain sectors in consideration of the impact of inflation on the cost of replacing stocks.  The firms benefiting were those engaged wholly or mainly in manufacturing, construction or farming or in the sale of plant, machinery or material to those sectors.  The relief was given in 1975 for two years as an outright deduction so as to have immediate effect on the liquidity of the firms concerned.  In the 1976 budget I extended the relief for a third year as well as bringing un-incorporated traders within the concession with retrospective effect. Although there is reason to think that the problems of business liquidity have eased somewhat, I have decided <Col N="269" /> that, as inflation has continued at a high though diminishing rate, I should continue the relief for another year.</P>
    <P>I also feel that it would not be appropriate that the relief given last year should be recovered over the next year or so except in certain limited circumstances.  There is a need to remove, as far as possible, uncertainty as to whether the relief is to be regarded as an outright deduction or a temporary relief to be surrendered at a later stage.  However, since the scheme is, of necessity, of a simple nature, it would be open to exploitation in the absence of safeguards. I have, therefore, decided that the relief provided last year and this year will not be recoverable except where, and to the extent that, stock values decrease in an accounting period or when a trade ceases altogether or, at any rate, ceases to be within the charge to Irish tax.  These provisions and other more detailed safeguards will be set out in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital allowances</i>
    </P>
    <P>The existing tax provisions for the giving of accelerated capital allowances outside the designated areas are due to expire on 31st March next.  Also due to expire then is the special 20 per cent investment allowance in respect of new plant and machinery for use in the designated areas.  If these provisions are not renewed, the allowances for investment in plant and machinery and industrial buildings will revert to levels which, although realistic, might not be regarded as offering a sufficiently attractive inducement for investment in present circumstances.  Bearing in mind the absolute necessity for investment at present, the Government have decided to extend for a further period of two years the existing arrangements in respect of capital allowances.  As an example of the effect, I might mention that this will enable the entire cost of investment in plant and machinery outside the designated areas to be deducted straight away for tax purposes, while 120 per cent of such cost can be deducted for investment in the designated areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" />
      <i>Reduction in rates of corporation tax and increase in thresholds</i>
    </P>
    <P>Adequate profit for invested capital is as necessary as a just wage for labour.  To meet the employment targets, which must be met if Ireland is to provide enough jobs for her fastgrowing population, investment on a massive scale will be required in the years immediately ahead of us.  We must, therefore, make it more attractive than ever to invest in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>In furtherance of the objective of increasing incentives for industry, the Government propose to provide the following new corporation tax reliefs which will apply in respect of profits made from 1st January, 1977.  The 50 per cent corporation tax rate will fall to 45 per cent and the 40 per cent rate will fall to 35 per cent for all businesses.</P>
    <P>The present corporation tax thresholds for small firms of £5,000 and £10,000 will rise to £10,000 and £15,000, respectively.  These thresholds will be for the purpose of application of the 35 per cent to 45 per cent range of rates and of the 45 per cent rate, respectively.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Output employment incentive relief for manufacturing companies</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government feel that, notwithstanding the fact that the various existing reliefs, most of which are related to investment, reduce the overall company tax yield by over one-third, a further special incentive should be provided in present circumstances in order to encourage investment and thereby stimulate employment in manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>A scheme will, therefore, be introduced to provide a special reduced corporation tax rate of 25 per cent for three years on taxable profits made from 1st January, 1977, by manufacturers who can show certain increases in output and employment in that period.  This scheme will be especially helpful to manufacturers catering for the home market for whom it should provide an incentive to investment and expansion, and thus to increased employment.  The conditions to govern the relief will be discussed with representatives of manufacturing <Col N="271" /> industry and the detailed scheme will be set out in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Even apart from the special scheme just mentioned, the package of corporation tax reliefs will, I am sure, be welcome news to business generally because of the reductions proposed in the main rates of the tax.  The additional relief for small businesses is designed to encourage them to develop and expand.  We are confident that the overall package will give the necessary fillip to getting output and employment rising satisfactorily and will thus help to broaden significantly our industrial and commercial base and increase worthwhile employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Stamp duty on office buildings</i>
    </P>
    <P>Contracts for the construction of office buildings outside certain designated areas, as defined in the Industrial Development Act, 1969, are at present liable to stamp duty.  The rate of duty is 10 per cent except in the case of projects in Dublin city and county, including Dún Laoghaire, where the rate is 15 per cent.  In order to provide an immediate stimulus to employment and output in the construction industry, the Government have decided, in the case of all chargeable contracts for office-building entered into as from to-day, that stamp duty paid will be refunded in full provided that the office building is completed by 31st December, 1978.  Where such an office building is not completed by that date, a refund of duty will be made proportionate to the extent to which work on the contract will have been completed by that date.  In the case of contracts that were entered into before to-day, a refund of duty will be made on a similar basis but proportionate to the extent to which work was carried out in the interval between to-day and 31st December, 1978.  Provision accordingly will be made in the forthcoming Finance Bill.  The cost of this relief is estimated at £200,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>These taxation concessions have been specially designed to induce developers to complete current office-building schemes with the minimum of delay and to bring forward other <Col N="272" /> schemes originally scheduled for later years, thereby providing an immediate and rapid boost to employment and output in the construction industry. The measures will be of considerable assistance to the office-building sector of the construction industry, which sector has been operating recently well below capacity because of the economic recession.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social welfare</i>
    </P>
    <P>Turning to social welfare, the past four years have seen an unprecedented expansion and development of services, notwithstanding the exceptional economic difficulties of the period.  As a consequence, the pre-budget Exchequer provision of £258 million for social welfare in 1977 is nearly three times that spent in 1972-73.</P>
    <P>The Government remain firmly resolved that pensioners and other social welfare recipients should not lose the ground which has been gained in the last few years and indeed should receive their share from the general growth of the economy envisaged for 1977, in the form of some further extensions and improvements.</P>
    <P>I am happy, therefore, to announce that all weekly rates of social welfare payments and health allowances will be raised from April next by amounts which will ensure that, taking account of the increases last October, all rates will have been increased by 15 per cent since April, 1976&mdash;which should more than compensate all beneficiaries for rising prices up to next April.  This will mean an increase, over the level reached in October last, of £2.05 a week in the maximum contributory old age pension for a married couple both of whom are of pension age and under 80.  Their new rate of pension will be £24.40 a week.  In the case of a married man with two children receiving unemployment benefit, the increase will be £3.45 giving a total of £27.65 a week.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the expected reduction in the pace of inflation in 1977, the Government are anxious that welfare recipients should not be left to absorb price rises over a full-year period following on the April increase in payments.  Provision is, therefore, <Col N="273" /> being made for a further 5 per cent increase in rates from October next to provide against such price increases.</P>
    <P>Children's allowances will also be increased, from July next by 50 pence per month in respect of all children other than the first child in each family.</P>
    <P>On three occasions in the last four years the Government have made a one-year reduction in the qualifying age for old age contributory and non-contributory pensions and, consequently, for the associated benefits of the free travel, electricity allowance and television licence schemes.  I am happy to say that a further one-year reduction will be made this year, with effect from October, so that the qualifying age will stand at 66.  As a result of this measure, an extra 15,000 persons will benefit from pensions and the associated fringe benefits.</P>
    <P>The position of old age pensioners living alone is a matter of special concern. In many such cases there is still an element of hardship which does not exist where a pensioner lives with relatives, notwithstanding the substantial increases granted to pensioners in recent years, the easing of means tests where these apply and special benefits such as the free electricity and television licence schemes, or differential rents.  There will, therefore, be a special additional increase of £1 per week from April next for all social welfare pensioners over old age pension age and living alone.</P>
    <P>The Government have also found it possible to meet some particular needs of two groups who are specially dependent on the social welfare services. Invalidity pensioners will have the schemes of free travel, electricity allowances and free television licences extended to them, while there will be a substantial increase in the amount of earnings disregarded specially in assessing the means of blind persons for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Unemployment assistance for smallholders</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year certain restrictions were announced on the unemployment assistance scheme for smallholders. <Col N="274" /> The vast bulk of smallholders in what are known as the specified areas have their means assessed on a notional basis.  For this purpose multipliers related to their rateable land valuations are used which are highly concessionary by reference to present levels of farm income.  A factual basis of assessment of means applies to all other assistance recipients&mdash;including smallholders outside the specified areas.  The Government have reviewed the position and consider that, at present levels of farm income, there is no justification for notional assessment in the case of smallholders with land valuation exceeding £20.  These smallholders will, of course, continue to be eligible for unemployment assistance on the basis of factual assessment of means.  The Government have also decided that, with the improvement in farm income, existing rates of unemployment assistance will remain unchanged for smallholders with land valuation exceeding £10 but not exceeding £20 and whose means are assessed notionally.</P>
    <P>The net cost of all the social welfare and health changes I have announced is estimated at £44.5 million in 1977 of which the Exchequer will bear £34.8 million.</P>
    <P>As regards the financing of social welfare, it will be recalled that a first step was taken in 1976 in pursuance of the policy adopted by the Government of progressively reducing the Exchequer contribution to the social insurance fund to bring the Exchequer contribution in Ireland into line with EEC levels and in order to free resources for productive investment.  The taxpayer's share of these costs remains unduly high but the balance of economic considerations at this juncture&mdash; in particular, the need to restrict the growth in labour costs&mdash;indicates that in 1977 the increase in the social insurance contribution should be kept to a minimum.  Accordingly, the Government have decided to defer further action in 1977 on their policy of reducing the Exchequer contribution. The 1977 social insurance contribution increases will be further reduced because we are removing in April an element which was introduced for one <Col N="275" /> year in 1976 to recoup a shortfall in contribution income.  Accordingly, the stamp increase, including an additional 6p for health costs, will be about 69p; 42p from the employer and 27p from the employee&mdash;that is much less than in 1976.</P>
    <P>Abuses of the social welfare code have attracted a growing volume of comment in recent times and tend to bring the social welfare code into disrepute. The criticism is probably attributable in part to the substantial improvements in the level of payments in recent years.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the public of the Government's anxiety to combat actively and forestall abuse wherever it may arise.  It will be recalled that this time last year a limit of 85 per cent of pre-unemployment post-tax income was put on the benefits payable to unemployed persons.  Legislation was passed last year also, increasing the statutory penalties for persons who abuse the welfare system.  The Government are increasing the staffing strength wherever necessary to combat fraud effectively.</P>
    <P>People who abuse the social welfare system, like tax evaders, are simply putting their hands in the pockets of the ordinary taxpayer who has to pay for their dishonesty.</P>
    <P>In addition to the sum of £34.8 million, which represents the cost of the improvements I have outlined, I have to provide a further £1.5 million for the cost to the Exchequer as employer of the increase in the social insurance contribution.  The additional expenditure involved in the improved employment premium scheme will, of course, be offset by an estimated reduction of £2.9 million in social welfare costs.  Thus, the net additional charge which falls on the Exchequer for social welfare is £33.4 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Rates relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have been giving sympathetic consideration to the problem of rates on domestic property. The rates bill is a significant part of the average family budget and indeed there have been demands from some <Col N="276" /> quarters for their complete abolition. Complete abolition would cost over £60 million in 1977.  If this burden were to be transferred to excise duties it would, for example, put up the duty content of a gallon of petrol by 10p, a pint of stout by 5p, a glass of spirits by 5p and 20 cigarettes by 5p.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that a White Paper published by our predecessors two months before they left office forecast that rates could not be replaced without increasing income tax by 14p. At that time the total rates bill was only £70 million of which £36 million was on private dwellings.  This Government do not accept the idea of imposing new taxes to replace rates.  Such a policy is less than honest, socially regressive and economically indefensible.</P>
    <P>At the time of entering into office in 1973, this Government committed themselves to transferring housing subsidies and health charges from the rates.  This commitment has now been honoured in full without imposing new taxes to replace rates.  The relief involved for ratepayers in 1977 amounts to about £90 million in total.  If we had not relieved ratepayers of this burden the rates would now be higher by well over £6 in the £ on average.  Unfortunately for ratepayers the effect of this relief has been frustrated to a considerable extent because of the enormous increases in services and related expenditures in the areas remaining within the financial responsibility of local authorities.  Between 1972-73 and the current year rates-financed expenditure on services not subject to the rates transfer increased by a massive 211 per cent from £39.2 million to £122 million.</P>
    <P>The Government consider that the right course is to give whatever measure of extra rates relief that can be accommodated without increasing taxation and within the limits of a tolerable deficit on the current budget and the borrowing requirement in 1977.  We have decided, therefore, that, for 1977, the Exchequer will pay 25 per cent of rates on domestic dwellings. For this purpose I am providing £15.5 million in 1977.  Domestic rates bills due in respect of the first half of the <Col N="277" /> year will fall to be paid as usual, but the bills for the second moiety will be reduced by half.</P>
    <P>Each domestic ratepayer will get the full benefit of the appropriate reduction in the course of the second half of the year.  Apart from the immediate and worthwhile relief which the reduction of the rates bill will give to every household, it will have the added benefit of reducing the consumer price index by 0.4 per cent.  The detailed implementation of this rates relief will be notified to the local authorities by my good friend, the Minister for Local Government, in due course.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Rates waiver</i>
    </P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the generous help which these and previous years' measures by the Government have meant for ratepayers, there still remain cases of special hardship which merit further relief.  Some local authorities have been operating a rates waiver scheme for some years directed to helping non-contributory old age pensioners and other persons of small means.  Existing schemes will cost £2 million in 1977.  The Government have decided to double this expenditure by providing a further £2 million from the Exchequer for the relief of rates in deserving cases.  This extra money will be used to improve and extend the system operated by the local authorities and will also enable those local authorities who do not operate schemes to introduce them now.  The flexibility of the existing scheme will be retained and assistance will be available to additional persons on reduced incomes for whom the impact of rates must be a grave source of concern.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Future rates policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government intend that the Exchequer will in future assume still greater liability for the financing of local services, thereby relieving individual ratepayers.  Because of this Government's policies, domestic ratepayers will pay only 12 per cent of the cost of local services in 1977 instead of the 28 per cent which they would have had to pay if there had been no rates relief since 1972-73.  There is but <Col N="278" /> a small part of the road left now to travel to give full relief on domestic dwellings.  The Government are determined to complete their work on rates relief for private dwellings at the earliest possible date without relying on alternative taxes or resorting to fanciful theory to achieve that goal.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Medium-term planning</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Green Paper on Economic and Social Development published last September set out clearly the problems and issues facing this country over the next four years.  It proposed a wide range of measures for discussion with the social partners as part of the process for formulating a plan for recovery in the years to 1980.</P>
    <P>Many constructive suggestions for action have been submitted and are being examined.  The National Economic and Social Council have been asked to advise on a number of the policy proposals which were outlined in the Green Paper, including measures to improve business confidence, to intensify agricultural production and to minimise the tax burden by eliminating circular transfers.  I have also asked the council to advise on how best to promote co-operation between the public and private sectors so as to maximise growth, and to consider ways to achieve a proper balance between economic advancement and social progress.</P>
    <P>Concurrent with this process of consultation, work is under way on the more technical aspects of the plan and the resolution of issues within the Government's direct and immediate area of concern.  The Government hope to receive the contributions of the social partners and other interests at an early date.  These will be drawn together with the work proceeding in Departments and the final provisions of the plan settled.  It is the Government's intention that after publication the plan should be reviewed annually and extended for a further year in the light of progress achieved.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Effect of the budget on the economy</i>
    </P>
    <P>The main economic purpose of the budget is to maintain and improve the growth to which we returned last <Col N="279" /> year and to create a momentum for faster growth in future years.  I have aimed at ensuring that the general advance of the economy will be on a broad front so as to spread the benefits of growth throughout the community.</P>
    <P>If the new pay settlement is ratified, the outlook will be encouraging.  The competitiveness of our economy will be enhanced, to the benefit, on both home and foreign markets, of our producers and the tax concessions, taken with the other measures I have announced, will provide a boost for consumer demand which in turn will elicit greater domestic growth.  In the normal course of events, given the degree of spare capacity still existing in the economy, employment might not respond all that quickly to rising output. It was for that reason that I have provided the special measures I have already described, specifically aimed at encouraging employment creation.</P>
    <P>Reduced profits in industry generally in recent years, combined with the recession, have affected investment which is so essential to economic development. In the light of the growth achieved last year and the favourable outlook for this year, the concessions provided to-day for industry should provide a strong stimulus to investment. Moreover, the continuing restraint on public expenditure will ensure that the demands of the public sector will not further encroach on national resources this year.</P>
    <P>All the measures I have announced will have the combined effect of raising the growth rate this year to over 4 per cent.  This means that, following last year's achievement of a growth rate of 3½ per cent, the economy will be expanding at a pace nearer its potential and in a way that will make the medium-term growth targets set out in the Green Paper on Economic and Social Development easier of achievement.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Deficit</i>
    </P>
    <P>I opened with a deficit of £162.6 million.  On the revenue side I am adding a total of £112 million made up of <Col N="280" /> three items, two of which I have already described.  The third is the largest item, £60 million, and is an estimate of the additional revenue buoyancy that to-day's package of fiscal measures will generate through its stimulatory effect on the economy.</P>
    <P>When speaking earlier of the revenue provision in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure, I said that the more modest rates of increase in incomes and inflation in prospect for the coming year are likely to result in a corresponding slower overall rate of growth in tax revenue, as compared with 1976.  However, the combined effect of the tax concessions and increased Government spending announced today will, as I have just mentioned, be to raise the growth rate to more than 4 per cent.  The increased personal consumer spending and employee remuneration which will ensue, as the budgetary injection circulates throughout the economy, should, in turn, result in this increased yield from both income and expenditure taxes.</P>
    <P>When against this total additional revenue of £112 million is offset the cost of the major income tax and other tax reliefs I am providing for today the net addition to the revenue side becomes £56.8 million.</P>
    <P>Turning to the expenditure side, there falls to be added a sum of £127 million for the various items of additional outlay I have mentioned in the course of my statement.  This year I am allowing £15 million in respect of unspent balances in the hands of Departments at the close of 1976 which, when taken into account, leaves the net additional provision necessary on the expenditure side at £112 million. When this is offset by the £56.8 million extra receipts on the revenue side, the net addition to the opening deficit is £55.2 million and I am left at the end of the day with a prospective deficit of £217.8 million on the 1977 budget, which is about 4 per cent of estimated GNP compared with the 1976 budget deficit which was more than 4.5 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>This deficit, which is a reduction of one-third on that envisaged when last year's budget was introduced, represents <Col N="281" /> very considerable progress towards fulfilling the Government's declared aim to phase out the current budget deficit as announced in last year's budget statement.</P>
    <P>A reduction in our borrowing requirement was specifically included as one of the conditions attaching to the recent EEC loan and the need to reduce our borrowing was repeated in the budgetary guidelines for 1977 adopted by the Council of Ministers. The current budget deficit plus the Exchequer borrowing requirement for capital purposes will result in a total Exchequer borrowing requirement of £573 million in 1977.  This figure will represent 11 per cent of GNP.  It compares with a figure of £679 million when last year's budget was introduced and £506 million in the outturn, that is, 15.8 per cent and 11.5 per cent, respectively, of GNP.  In relation to GNP, therefore, our borrowing requirement will continue to decline during 1977.</P>
    <P>The policy adopted in recent budgets of stimulating the economy by deficit budgeting was a success in that the difficulties of the economy would now otherwise be much more serious.  But it was success for which a price has to be paid.  This policy has had unwanted side effects involving increased public expenditure and has resulted in a diversion of an increasing share of national resources away from the private sector.  It has brought with it a dramatic increase in the tax burden and in the State's borrowing requirement. Now that the economy is on the way to being restored to health the need for the continuation of such a policy is clearly reduced.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Conclusion</i>
    </P>
    <P>An appropriate description of to-day's budget is an &ldquo;incentive budget&rdquo;. Its distinctive character is to be found in the number and nature of the incentives it provides.  Incentive is the purpose of the measures to relieve the burden of personal income taxation so often now felt in our society to be a serious discouragement to effort and enterprise.  Incentive is the motif of the package of measures proposed for <Col N="282" /> companies, that is, the special scheme of tax relief designed to encourage output and employment, the reductions in the rate of corporation tax, the continuation of stock relief and the raising of the thresholds for the payment of tax by small companies.  There are incentives also to provide thousands of extra jobs this year on works financed by the Exchequer and, of course, special incentives to employers to engage school leavers.  The incentive theme is also apparent in the Government's determination to ensure that the public sector does not crowd out the demands of the private sector for investment funds for growth.</P>
    <P>I believe in creating a climate in our society in which enterprise will be positively encouraged and supported by the State.  The work ethos should have the central position among an energetic and resourceful people.  To-day's measures represent a very definite move in this direction.  A strong subsidiary aim of today's budget is to spread out the benefits of the growing economic prosperity that are accruing to the agricultural sector as a result of the favourable developments in agriculture since our entry to the EEC.  In the past, prior to our entry to the European Community, the fruits of economic growth in the rest of the community were redistributed by the State towards the agricultural sector by means of subsidies and subventions which for many years bore heavily on taxpayers.  Now the wheel has come full circle and it is only fair that the rest of the community should share in the increasing prosperity of the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>We have encountered and weathered the most serious world-wide recession for half a century.  The worst is now behind us.  While EEC membership will undoubtedly continue to be of incalculable assistance to us, in the last analysis we cannot expect the Community to carry us and we shall have to rely on ourselves in future for progress and prosperity.</P>
    <P>Ireland will be as prosperous as her citizens are prepared to make her.  This is why we have put the emphasis in this budget on the promotion of personal initiative.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" /> Arthur Griffith recalled in an essay on the <i>Economic Oppression of Ireland</i> that&mdash;</P>
    <P>Ancient Ireland traded extensively with the Roman Empire, Gaul, Spain and Greece.  In the Middle Ages Ireland carried on extensive commerce with France, Flanders, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Germany, and independent Scotland, Wales and England.  The Guild merchants of the great Continental trade centres mostly included Irishmen&mdash; Bordeaux, Rouen, Bruges, and other cities contain memorials of <Col N="284" /> the Irish merchants.  A Flemish sixteenth-century writer records that in his time the Irish merchants held two fairs yearly in Bruges, where they sold friezes, serges, furs, skins, etc.  An Italian poet of the Middle Ages sings the praise of Ireland for the &ldquo;noble woollen stuffs&rdquo; she sent to Italy, and Irish robes were used by the Queen of Hungary.</P>
    <P>If our forbears, against immeasurably greater odds, could succeed in selling their merchandise and wares to the ends of the then-known world surely we can, indeed must, emulate their example.  This budget gives the green light to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for Finance, and his colleagues, for the very fine tribute they have paid to the Fianna Fáil Party by using a number of the ideas which we have been consistently being putting forward, without acknowledgment of course.  For instance, although there were scathing comments by some members of the Government on the recent economic proposals we issued, I note that today's budget attempts to steal some of the ideas for job opportunities in the field of health, teaching and special schemes for school leavers.  This is welcome but, unfortunately, as in the case of most things done by the National Coalition, half-hearted and not nearly as effective as it could be.  However, it is a move in the right direction and it will not be too long before we get a chance to put it into operation full steam ahead and not in the half-hearted way announced today.</P>
      <P>I note also that the food subsidies are being increased, but the House will remember that for a long time the Government said it was not possible to do this.  We have been urging them to do so for nine months but they dithered and the country lost a great deal of money, particularly the farming community, and the consumer had to absorb very substantial increases in the cost of living.  Eventually, they brought in food subsidies.  The Government are bringing them up today to compensate for further changes in the Green Pound and I congratulate them in seeing the light although belatedly and half-heartedly.  Perhaps the best example of the approach of the National Coalition is in the proposal we heard today in regard to rates.  We all know how the Government waxed so eloquent and indignant at the idea of abolishing rates.  There has been somebody travelling the road to Damascus because suddenly we have this lightning conversion and the Government aim to abolish rates eventually.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This year it is a poor effort, but it is an effort.  However, I should like to draw attention to one important aspect of it.  We were asked how we proposed to pay for the abolition of rates in full and we spelt out how we would do so.  The Minister for Finance has told us how he proposes to pay for abolishing one quarter of the rates, to borrow the money.  He cannot increase taxes for it and he was honest enough to say he was going to borrow the money.  I hope that will be noted.</P>
      <P>The continuation of the stock relief on capital allowances was to be expected in present economic circumstances. I am not in a position at the moment to calculate but I wonder very much whether the relief on corporation tax will be sufficient to offset the increased cost of social welfare stamps to employers and the increased postal charges.  I would think it is extremely doubtful and far from being an incentive to employers and in particular to manufacturers I rather suspect, without being in a position at the moment to work out the exact figures, that a further burden is being laid on those on whom we must depend if we are to get any improvement in our economy and particularly in our massive unemployment figures.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has made a move towards redressing the grievances of the <i>ex gratia</i> public service widows.  He has not, of course, gone the whole way as he and a number of his colleagues promised before the last general election.  Very belatedly he has gone some of the way, but it is welcome.  I note also that the cost of doing so seems to be very much lower than the figures he was quoting when he was consistently refusing to do anything about it here in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to social welfare the Minister says that he is aiming at keeping in line with inflation.  This of course is belated because last October he had no hesitation in saying that approximately half the social welfare recipients could not be brought up to keep in line with inflation.  He aims at a figure of 15 per cent to keep in <Col N="305" /> line with inflation.  That is extremely doubtful as being realistic.  The latest figure we have is 20.6 per cent for the 12 months to mid-November.  If one takes it on a moving average basis it is 18 per cent.  We must consider what happened yesterday with the increase in the price of coal.  Deputy Dowling pointed out in this House that it represents for many people, and particularly people on social welfare, an increased cost of £1.20p per week.  When one takes account of that one can judge pretty accurately just how inadequate are the Minister's proposals in regard to social welfare.</P>
    <P>But perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the budget for individuals and how it affects them is in relation to income tax.  It would appear that the position is something like this.  Let us take the position of a married man with two children who was in 1972, under Fianna Fáil under the last budget Fianna Fáil brought in, earning £20 a week at that time.  If you adjust that for inflation&mdash;not for actual increases in wages, which have tended to exceed inflation, but just for inflation&mdash;you find that such a man under the Minister's proposals in today's budget is getting a reduction of £45 per annum in income tax.  But he would need in addition £145 simply to restore his position in real terms under Fianna Fáil.  Similarly, if you take a man who was then earning £50 per week he would need another £250 tax relief on what he is promised today simply to restore his position as it was under Fianna Fáil.  Of course, the position is true of any other kind of example you care to take.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell unduly on that but it is disappointing, particularly so in the light of all the talk there was before the budget about the substantial tax reliefs which would be given. They are anything but substantial and they are no way commensurate with inflation.  Indeed they are not tax cuts; they are simply a step on the road to restoring the position in real terms as it was even in this past year.  In the example the Minister gave, he said that it would represent a 14 per cent decrease in tax.  But, as I said, inflation has been running at over 20 per cent, <Col N="306" /> so even in the past year the Minister is not keeping in line with inflation.</P>
    <P>There is a very interesting reference by the Minister to the NESC and the study of elimination of circular transfers. I trust that the Tánaiste and his Parliamentary Secretary and others in the Government who waxed indignant on this subject some time ago noted that reference.  They did of course&mdash;at least the Tánaiste and his colleagues&mdash; approve of the Green Paper when it was prepared.  Nevertheless it should be clear, although it was very near the end of the Minister's statement, that he has not retracted one iota from his proposal that there should be an examination of what he calls circular transfers. What he is referring to includes such things as the possibility of abolishing children's allowances and school transport. We heard about it before and we are obviously going to hear more about it because the Minister is repeating his observations in the budget.</P>
    <P>One of the problems one is faced with is the extent to which one can rely on the figures produced by this Minister and by this Government.  Even allowing for the efforts being made by the Government to bring in an election budget, the past performance of this Government is not very encouraging in trying to assess the accuracy of their projections.  In 1975 they under-estimated the current deficit by over 100 per cent and in 1976 they over-estimated the current deficit by 61 per cent.  On their track record alone and leaving out other considerations it is very difficult to rely on any of the figures the Minister has given us today.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was reported last night to have made a speech which I am sure made most people who heard any report of it stop short.  He made a further slight reference in the same vein here today. He is reported to have said that the economic recession is over.  How can one have any faith whatever in the Minister for Finance who says that in the face of all the facts?  Either he is totally irresponsible for purely electoral purposes or he is totally ignorant of what has happened to our economy in 1976.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="307" /> Almost to the day one year ago, on the 28th January, 1976, the Minister introduced his last budget and he set out then his aims for economic policy in 1976 and I quote from the report of the debates of this House on that day, column 622.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Economic policy for 1976, if it is to be soundly based, must meet three vital requirements.  First, it must reduce our excessive rate of price inflation.  Second, it must, within the taxation and borrowing resources available and the limited opportunities for growth, give a high priority to safeguarding employment. It must, finally, limit the growth of public expenditure, the expansion of which has been such a feature of recent years.</P>
    <P>At that time inflation was 21 per cent per annum.  Today on the latest figures available it is 20.6 per cent.  At that time registered unemployment was over 117,000.  Today it is over 117,000, and that of course is not counting all the additional school leavers and others unregistered who have since come on.  At that time the current deficit was £258.8 million. Now on the year just finished it was £201.4 million, a slight improvement but an improvement in the wrong area of our economy and for the wrong reasons, as I will demonstrate later.</P>
    <P>In face of these facts how can anyone say the economic recession is over?  There has been some improvement in the growth of the economy, but I would commend to the House a comment made in a report of the NESC a couple of years ago on the subject.  They said:</P>
    <P>Growth is only superficial about things.  In reality it is about people and their welfare.</P>
    <P>That is true and we should never overlook the truth of that statement.  The fact is that the growth achieved in 1976 was of virtually no benefit to our people.  There was an increase in industrial production but that increase was on the low base of 1975, the first year since this country started on industrialisation <Col N="308" /> when there was a fall in industrial production.  So it was on that low base that we measure the increase in industrial production.  That increase was due mainly to the falling value of the £ and to the fact that some new foreign firms came on stream.  But that produced very little increased employment and no reduction in unemployment.  Is that evidence &mdash;and that is what the Minister was relying on last night&mdash;that the recession is over and on a long-term basis, too, he said?</P>
    <P>Industrial exports increased for similar reasons but the great dependence that the Minister and his colleagues are placing now is on what happened as a result of the falling value of the £.  If anybody has any doubt about this in regard to industrial exports, he can appreciate it if he looks at what happened in 1976 when industrial exports to non-sterling areas increased by 18 per cent but industrial exports to the UK, where the falling £ made no difference, decreased by 6 per cent.  Nobody need to have any doubt about what was the real cause of the increased growth in industrial exports.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister for Foreign Affairs recently spoke on this matter and he gave it a new twist when he said that the collapse of sterling in 1976 had been a major destabilising force in a period when in other respects the performance of the Irish economy had been, by any standards, remarkable.  Of course, a new kind of situation in which Ministers are relying on the collapse of our currency as the main indicator of any economic improvement is a bad situation.  But a situation that is even worse is one in which apparently they do not know or understand what happened to our economy in 1976 and do not understand the serious implications for us, in the longer term, of the fall in value of the £.</P>
    <P>Hopefully, the £ has been stabilised. We cannot be sure of that but the indications now are far better than at any time in a number of years that the £ is fairly well stabilised.  If it is, what does the Minister say we should rely on next year, or in 1977, to <Col N="309" /> achieve the kind of growth we have to achieve, the kind of industrial exports we have to achieve?  If the froth of the collapse of sterling had been taken away in 1976, what would have happened to our economy?  Let us face the reality of what is happening and not be painting a picture of something that does not exist and leading our people into a totally false position for the coming year.</P>
    <P>No impact whatever has been made on unemployment by any improvement that took place in our economy in the past year, but there has been an effect from the falling value of sterling in relation to prices.  We have already suffered substantial price increases as a result of the collapse of sterling and the trouble is we will suffer more in the next few months. Therefore, none of this in the longer term is of any help to us.  Indeed, it is a hindrance and we ought to recognise it as such.</P>
    <P>The slight improvement in the chaotic condition of the State's finances was achieved at a cost of about 5 percentage points in our inflation in 1976, that is, five percentage points out of 20, and it was also achieved at a cost of making Schedule D income taxpayers pay an extra half year's tax during 1976 as well as by bringing civil servants and others into the PAYE system.  Clearly this cannot be repeated and it is no basis for optimism in the long term to rely on the increased tax receipts in 1976.</P>
    <P>However, the cause of this chaos in the State's finances is quite clear.  It is that in the past few years current State expenditure has been let to rip and we have had huge borrowings, especially foreign borrowings, for non-productive purposes.  It is too easy for the Minister for Finance or any of his colleagues to say when we complain: &ldquo;What would you cut back on?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to something I stated as reported in the Official Report on 10th May, 1976, at columns 1722 and 1723.  I was referring to the fact that we had been consistently urging on the Minister the necessity for curbing Government expenditure, and I went on:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="310" /> The key is not to allow expenditure to grow at too fast a rate.  Every Minister for Finance is tempted to allow expenditure to grow more than he knows it should grow and more than the economy can bear at a particular time.  He is tempted because there are some very worth-while things he can do, and he is tempted for purely political advancement.  If he lets spending grow without regard to the capacity of the economy to pay, he can have short-term political advantages, but as sure as night follows day he reaches the situation we are in today.  It is no answer for a Minister for Finance who has allowed that to happen and who has not exercised the discipline he should on himself and his colleagues in successive budgets to say now: &ldquo;But what would you cut: what are the consequences of cutting?&rdquo;  His failure began with the first budget he introduced in 1973 and it has continued since.</P>
    <P>The trouble is that the position is now so bad in regard to the State's finances that any worth-while cuts would be massively deflationary, and there is every appearance that it is on that course the Coalition have embarked. Having allowed the expenditure to rip instead of controlling it on a regular basis, they are now approaching it on a basis that suggests very substantial cut-backs, which are not the answer when you reach the level we have reached, where any substantial cutbacks will do enormous damage.  Apart from what the Minister announced today, the Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure for 1977, published by the Government recently, show an 8 per cent increase in current expenditure against a projected inflation increase of at least 15 per cent and on the capital side a projected increase of only 15 per cent&mdash;in other words, no real increase.</P>
    <P>One of the major constraints on the Government's room to manoeuvre is the enormous cost of the foreign borrowing in which they have engaged and there is a serious question to be answered about this that has never been answered.  I refer the House to Table 6 of the Statistical Appendix <Col N="311" /> of the Central Bank of Ireland's Report of Winter, 1976.  We see from that that at the end of 1976 the amount outstanding in external Government debt was £781.6 million at face value, but allowing for exchange rate changes the real amount outstanding was £1,028 million, and over half of that is repayable in less than five years.  We find in Table 7 of the same appendix that the external debt of Statesponsored bodies was £229 million at face value at the end of 1976, but the real value of that debt was £323 million, and again more than half of it is repayable in less than five years.  The question that has not yet been answered, and should be answered, is why was so much foreign borrowing necessary?  As the Minister pointed out today, it is far more expensive than borrowing at home because of the exchange rate problem and because of the fact that the Exchequer gets no tax from it.  It is also far more inflationary, and the Government sooner or later will have to explain why they have saddled this country with this enormous debt for which we have nothing to show.</P>
    <P>Given the present position in which we find ourselves, the Fianna Fáil priority is to tackle unemployment and inflation and thereby to get well on the way to getting the State's finances into order.  There seems to be a fundamental difference between us and the Coalition in this regard.  I am glad that there is that fundamental difference and that it is quite clear, because the only progress that has been made by the Coalition in regard to the three major problems facing the economy&mdash; unemployment, inflation and the State's finances&mdash;illusory progress though it is as I have pointed out, is in regard to the State's finances.  There has been no progress in regard to unemployment or inflation.  As far as we are concerned, this is the wrong approach. Unemployment is the first priority, and this is no new preoccupation with Fianna Fáil.  I refer to this stage of the discussion in the debate of the 28th January last year as reported in volume 287 of the Official Report, column 692 when I said, referring to last year's budget:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="312" /> The major issue arising in connection with this budget and the Government's performance is the question of unemployment and what is being done about that unemployment.</P>
    <P>We know the answer now at the end of the year&mdash;nothing.</P>
    <P>But the appalling record of the Coalition in regard to unemployment does not relate only to the numbers unemployed.  It is worse than that, because if one examines the record one finds a consistent failure to tackle the problem of unemployment.  The major weapon of any Government in tackling unemployment is the public capital programme.  The Government themselves in a press release with the public capital programme for 1977 say that it is one of the main instruments of Government policy in the areas of economic and social development.  Any Government serious about tackling unemployment will utilise the public capital programme to the maximum possible extent.  What do we find?  The Government brought in a special budget in June, 1975, and with a great flourish the Minister for Finance announced that he was providing £28 million for capital development in order to stimulate employment.  Six months later on the out-turn it transpired that £22½ million of that £28 million was not spent.  In 1976 we find that over £50 million of the public capital programme was not spent.  In 1976 capital spending as a percentage of total Government spending was at its lowest level for the last five years and the public capital programme as published for 1977 is even lower. Ominously enough, one finds proposed in the public capital programme an allocation of £183 million in 1977 for building construction against £181 million in 1976, and this with inflation at 15 per cent.  There is an addition announced in the budget today, but even that will not mean any real increase in that area, the key area for any Government who want to tackle unemployment.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the record of this Government when examined in this way shows that they do not want to <Col N="313" /> do anything about unemployment.  We find that the unemployment premium scheme which they introduced a few years ago was not terribly effective but was about the only thing they were doing.  That has been dropped.  There is no provision in the Estimates for it, but there is the vague scheme, which the Minister referred to today and carefully did not spell out in any detail, in regard to some kind of employment premium.  Since I have stood up the Minister has circulated a document which suggests that it is a substitution for the one the Government have abolished.  As far as I recollect on the figures, it is not going to be any real contribution to tackling unemployment and is really a cosmetic exercise of the kind that this Coalition are so fond of indulging in.  The real test of their attitude is to look at their performance over the last three years and at the real provisions they have made for the capital programme and tackling unemployment; to look not even at the projections but at what was actually spent.  The Minister can give figures as he has done in previous years, and it has turned out afterwards that he did not spend the money on job creation, which is the crucial problem we are facing.</P>
    <P>Inflation is the other major problem in the economy.  I wonder how many people realise that we are getting close to the situation where prices have nearly doubled under the Coalition in less than four years, something that took about 50 years to happen previously. Of course the Government say that it is due to world conditions and it is the same all round, but that argument is wearing a bit thin.  The Government on some occasion should take a look at the Central Bank Report for Winter, 1976, and examine Table 1 on page 32 where there is set out a comparison of inflation in the 12 months ending October, 1976, in respect of the USA, Canada, Japan, Germany, France, UK, Ireland, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands and Denmark. What we find is that in all except three cases inflation was in single figures and of those three cases we are the worst at 20.6 per cent.  It is not an accident that that is so.  In almost every budget <Col N="314" /> that this Government have introduced over the past few years they have directly and deliberately increased the cost of living by four or five percentage points, a deliberate fuelling of inflation by the Government that I have never been able to understand.  We have pointed out time after time what the consequences were, not only directly on inflation but on all costs; on the cost to the Government of pay increases, on the cost to industry trying to sell goods in competition with some of these other countries listed there with such lower rates of inflation. It has not registered, apparently, except once, in June, 1975, when the Government did take measures to reduce the cost of living.  They were measures we had urged on them in the previous autumn and they were very effective, but all they achieved was to cancel out what had been done by the Government six months previously and they were too late to affect the level of the national pay agreement that had already been entered into.</P>
    <P>Last year, as I indicated, we could have had a deficit less than that which was projected by the Minister in his budget and we could have had a rate of inflation reduced by a quarter if the Government had not imposed the savage taxes they then imposed and which, to comply with the Minister's projected deficit, were not needed. When one thinks about those huge and unnecessary price increases created by the Government it is very difficult not to think also of the 14 points, halting the price rise, stabilising prices.  The performance of the Government is very far removed from the promises they put before the people.</P>
    <P>The truth is that our economy needs an integrated plan to provide a kind of approach that will get it into some kind of order, just turn it around. Targets must be set and leadership must be given if we are to get out of the economic morass in which we find ourselves.  Last year I appealed to the Government, even at that late stage, to do something about it.  In the debate on last year's budget on 28th January, as reported in the Official Report, Volume 287, column 703, I spoke about the need for a plan of this kind. <Col N="315" /> After having detailed the Minister's contortions on the subject of a plan, first he did not want it, then he could not have it, then he might have it and various promises as to when he would produce it, I said:</P>
    <P>This country needs that plan or that programme.  How can you expect to get the various sectors of our society to work together to see where we, as a community, are going and how we are to get there?  How can we expect them to do that in the confused situation we are in today, if they have no targets or no programme and are just operating from day to day as the Government have been doing up to now?  The economic plan is long overdue.  It is not a matter to be left until it goes through one sub-committee and another, the reports are co-ordinated and they finally reach the Minister, and then they are circulated to all Departments, and so on.</P>
    <P>The country cannot afford that kind of delay in relation to a medium term economic plan.  I urge the Taoiseach and the Minister to put their boot down on the accelerator in regard to that plan and get it out fast.  Even if it is defective, let us get something to work to.  At the moment the country is going around in circles and in a fog of confusion largely contributed to by the Government. Let us try to get some kind of order into our economic efforts.  That is a most important step.</P>
    <P>We all know the response of the Government to that was nil until they produced the Green Paper.  This was supposed to be a substitute for some kind of plan.  It was a poor one but, nevertheless, it was produced.  I noticed that belatedly the Government seemed to have accepted the proposition I was putting forward because at page 36 of the Green Paper under the heading: &ldquo;Outline of proposals to stimulate economic growth&rdquo; we find the following stated:</P>
    <P>1.  Measures to create new confidence and to stimulate enterprise and expansion in the private sector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> First, the preparation of a clearly defined plan for economic growth, setting out agreed priorities, and offering a sound basis for investment in the private sector.</P>
    <P>Where is that plan?  The Minister should have been able to tell us at least at this stage what were the targets and what was the plan that would be used to achieve those targets. Even still, having set this out as one of the major requirements of the economy, we still have not got it.  We will never get it because this Coalition cannot agree and they will never produce an economic plan.  The need for such a plan is so obvious and so great that although it is not the duty of an Opposition to do so we produced a plan.  To this day the Government are running around in circles unable to come up with anything that even remotely resembles a plan.  We will, without it, drift further and further, aimlessly from one crisis to another.</P>
    <P>We have at least a plan produced by the Opposition.  The basic strategy of that plan has not been disagreed with by any reputable economist or economic commentator.  That basic strategy involves getting people back to work, reducing inflation as part of that process and thereby reducing the demands on the Exchequer in respect of social welfare and increasing the revenue of the Exchequer as a consequence of both direct and indirect taxes coming from those who get to work and get paid and so starting on the necessary process of getting the finances of the State into order.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental difference of priority between Fianna Fáil and the Coalition in regard to the way our present economic crisis and emergency should be tackled.  The Minister gave some details about proposed social welfare increases which I have dealt with.  When listening to the Minister, particularly when he is saying things like: &ldquo;The economic recession is over and things are looking up,&rdquo; it is very difficult&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One has to think back, not very far, in fact back to last <Col N="317" /> October.  Remember what was happening to the social welfare people at that time.  Remember what the Minister for Finance was saying that if any person in receipt of social welfare was to get the increase promised by the Tánaiste and his Parliamentary Secretary, he would have to bring in an ICTU budget and even after his arm had been twisted and approximately half of the social welfare recipients got an increase, merely to keep them in line with the cost of living&mdash;there was no increase in their real standard of living&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Cluskey, issued a statement, reported in <i>The Irish Press</i> of Wednesday, 13th October, 1976, in the course of which he said:</P>
      <P>There was, however, the question of priorities in the present grave financial and economic difficulties.</P>
      <P>Later on in that statement he said:</P>
      <P>The Government's decision must be seen against the background of the general economic situation and of severe budgetary constraints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Did the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste at that time know that revenue was running at a rate in excess of £100 million over and above that projected?  If the Minister for Finance knew that, why were those people deprived even of an increase just to keep in line with the cost of living?  Why were those people subjected to a real fall in their standard of living?  Those are the people on the lowest level of the income scale in the country.  Did the Minister for Finance know it and conceal it from his colleagues to enable him to give greater largesse here today?  Did all the members of the Government know it and join in the conspiracy?  What reason can be given, with revenue running as it was, with the projected deficit being reduced substantially, as it was, for the refusal, despite pressure from this party, from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and from some of the bishops, at first, to give any increase to social welfare recipients and, in the end, to about half of them only at a time when revenue was running well over £100 million ahead of that projected?  If <Col N="318" /> there was a grave financial and economic situation, as stated by the Parliamentary Secretary on the 13th October last, how is it that approximately four months later the recession is over? What happened in those four months? Did we discover some oil and gas that nobody has told us anything about yet?  What happened?  Did the Minister get a magic wand?</P>

      <P>It is a question the Minister will be asked on a few occasions and I shall be interested to hear his reply as to what brought about this magnificent transformation. What this country needs in 1977 is what it needed in 1976 and what it did not get, that is a real improvement in the employment situation and a real improvement in the inflation situation also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we look at the budget presented today can we say that there is any real improvement in prospects? There is tinkering here and there.  But, if one regards unemployment as the major crisis facing the country, surely one would say what is needed is an emergency crash programme, not tinkering here and there as we have had today, not a cosmetic exercise or one concerned solely with creating an <Col N="319" /> impression for electoral purposes but rather one that means something in real economic terms, in terms of alleviating human misery, getting people back to work and the country moving again.</P>
    <P>What is there in this budget to reduce inflation?  In the light of recent budgets of the Coalition I suppose we are to be grateful that they have not imposed the enormous and savage taxes on so many items that they did before, producing a four or five percentage point increase in the cost of living.  We are supposed to be grateful for that.  Of course there are factors in this budget today that will increase inflation. But what is there in it that will reduce inflation?  Very little; there is a little in regard to consumer subsidies, but very little.  The real effort needed to tackle the country's economic problems of today has not been made, was not made last year despite all the high-sounding noises in the budget statement then, and it will not be made this year by this Government.  But I believe it will be made this year a little later by another Government who know what they are at, know how to get the country moving again and will do so as soon as the people give them an opportunity.</P>

      <P>When we closed on this Bill yesterday, I had made the point on the contract now required by an employer, but I expressed concern about subsection (4) which deals with notice to employees of procedure for and grounds of dismissal.  Subsection (4) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an employee is dismissed, the <Col N="323" /> employer shall, if so requested, furnish to the employee within 14 days of the request, particulars in writing of the grounds for the dismissal,...</P>
    <P>Who is entitled to make the request? Is it the employee or can somebody on his behalf make it?  I ask this question because of other points we will be coming to in later sections. The Minister agreed to amend this Bill on Report Stage to cover the employee who dies within that period and whose dependants may become entitled to benefit from the unfair dismissal.</P>

      <P>Where an employee is dismissed, the employer shall, if so requested, furnish to the employee within 14 days of the request, particulars in writing of the grounds for the dismissal, but in determining for the purposes of this Act whether the dismissal was unfair there may be taken into account any other grounds which are substantial grounds and which would have justified the dismissal.</P>
      <P>Section 14 (1) gives the structure of the agreed dismissal procedure.  Subsections (2) and (3) give further details on that, and subsection (4) gives the option which a dismissed individual employee can exercise, that is, he can seek a written statement of the reasons for his dismissal.  This is additional to the other provisions of this section.  Does the Deputy want to know who, on his behalf, can make the request?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This section outlines the alternative remedies available to the employee.  I am not opposing the section but I am a little concerned about the apparent closing of the door for the employee.  Under this section it appears to me that if he opts to take his case to a rights commissioner he can then use that process through to the appeals tribunal, and has no comeback under common law.  But if he goes to common law in the first place he cannot use the machinery of this Bill, which I would like to see encouraged. A very important development on Committee Stage dealt with the private hearing of a case by the rights commissioner.  The ideal solution in these cases would be the hearing of them quickly.  Fast action here will help rather than hinder the situation. I am concerned about the experience in Britain.  If a situation develops where too many cases are lining up before a rights commissioner and there are long delays as a result the impact of the Bill will be partly lost.  I would like to see the rights commissioner being used rather than common law procedures.  I fully accept the Minister's point that if it does not go to common law there is no way the employer can raise it with the commissioner or the appeals tribunal.  Is it worth examining whether or not that divide should take place?  People <Col N="325" /> should be encouraged to use the rights commissioner more, although they have the option after the case has been considered by the rights commissioner of going to common law.  The Minister might say that that would commit the rights commissioner to being a witness in a court of law.  I would prefer that the machinery provided under this Bill would be used to the fullest. The employees and the trade unions should be encouraged to use it rather than common law machinery.</P>

      <P>This section does not prejudice the rights of the individual to use common law, but where a person gives notice in writing under section 8 (2) of this Act he shall not be entitled to recover damages under common law because at that stage the State is involved in expenditure.  Does the Deputy suggest that the reference to common law should not exist side by side so as to ensure that people will use this machinery more?</P>

      <P>When discussing another section I undertook between now and Report Stage to look at the idea of setting out a procedure from rights commissioner up.  This option between the court and the rights commissioner was taken over from the 1946 Act.  I agree with the Deputy that the more we get people to use this machinery, rather than spending years in common law litigation, the better. We cannot cut off the option of the individual to take the common law course.</P>

      <Col N="326" /> SECTION 16.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (4), line 6, to delete &ldquo;extend&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;limit&rdquo; and in lines 6 and 7 to delete &ldquo;to other employments connected with medicine or health&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that so much power is being made available to the Minister under this section.  Section 3 seemed to have the medical or health professions, particularly at training or probationary stages, almost excluded from the powers of this Bill.  This amendment was submitted because under subsection (4) of this section:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, by order, made with the consent of the Minister for Health, amend subsection (2) of section 3 of this Act so as to extend the application of the subsection to other employments connected with medicine or health.</P>
      <P>On section 3 (2) I commented on what I thought was too much scope being given to exclusions under the Bill. Rather than the Minister having this power we should limit the powers of that subsection.  This is not a reflection on the Minister, because it would refer to the Minister of the day, and judging from the budget we have just heard, this Minister will not be too long here.  That is the reason for my amendment.  The Minister will recall my expression of dissatisfaction with that subsection.  It specifically excludes a group of very important people in our society.  We will probably have a further discussion on that subsection on Report Stage.  I would like to see any change of order by the Minister being a limiting of powers in that subsection rather an extension of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  A draft order of the character mentioned, and the powers sought here, would be subject to approval by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas under section 16 (8):</P>
      <P>Where an order is proposed to be made under this section, a draft thereof shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.</P>
      <P>Each time we invoke this section the House will have to be consulted and will have to give its approval.  I take it there is nothing personal about what the Deputy has said about the powers of the Minister.  The Oireachtas will have a role in limiting the powers of the Minister in the use of the powers conferred by this section.  Will the Deputy review his position in view of the fact that the House will have to consider it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised to see this subsection.  Subsection (3) says that:</P>
      <P>The Minister may by order amend section 2 (2), 3 or 4 of this Act so as to vary&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the application of this Act in relation to dismissals where the employment was under a contract of employment for a fixed term or a specified purpose,</P>
      <P>I am concerned about powers being given to the Minister to extend the exclusions under this Act.  I find it difficult to reconcile subsection (4) with subsection (3).  Perhaps if the Minister would consider the use of the word &ldquo;vary&rdquo; in subsection (4), I could fall in line with him.  In other words, I am not suggesting necessarily that there be an extension rather than a limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Our problem here is a practical one.  All the indications are that there will be new para-medical jobs.  Radiography is a relatively new occupation and there will be other new occupations as medical techniques evolve.  The likelihood is that such jobs would be subject to a probationary <Col N="328" /> period before the terms of this Bill would apply.  I am told that the use of the word &ldquo;vary&rdquo; here would not give me the power sought.  I do not think there is any difference of opinion between us on the necessity to bring as many people as possible within the provisions of the Bill with the least possible delay.</P>
      <P>It is clear that there will be a necessity for the terms of the Bill to apply to these new categories of employee and that the power sought will be necessary to ensure the extension of the Bill's provisions to these categories. I emphasise that both Houses of the Oireachtas will be able to adjudicate on our actions in this area because it will be necessary to go before each House for sanction for the necessary powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have expressed strongly my point of view on this matter so I do not consider it necessary to divide the House on it.  If the Bill could be criticised from the point of view of employees, one could refer to the nursing profession, for instance, or to the whole range of professions connected with medicine and health. The Minister should consider this aspect carefully.  I do not consider an extension to be necessary.  I appreciate the problem involved regarding guaranteeing employment indefinitely to people in the medical and health professions after they have completed their training but it would be unfair to exclude them entirely from the conditions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the section goes through in this form the result will be that as new employments are created in the medical and health areas, the Minister has power to extend the exclusion under the subsection.  However, in view of our technological development and having regard to our finds of gas and, possibly of oil, there is every likelihood of new skills being created, skills which could be regarded differently from the apprenticeships that we know now. There should be a greater relationship between the apprenticeship situation and the probationary or training period for those in the medical and health fields.  Perhaps the Minister <Col N="329" /> would look at this between now and Report Stage and consider it in conjunction with the profession to which it relates.  There is a wide discrepancy between this field and the apprenticeship situation which, in effect, can be regarded as medicine of another kind in that it relates to the correcting and repairing of things rather than persons. I am not keen on the idea of giving complete powers of extension to any Minister.  The Minister has mentioned the necessity for coming before both Houses for an extension but once the powers are provided for, the Houses will be likely to accord readily with their request.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>A matter which does not come specifically within the provisions of the Bill, but on which the Minister might comment, relates to the position of casual workers.  I have in mind subsection (1).  Let us take, for example, casual workers engaged in the food processing industry and who would not have one year's continuous employment although they would have recurring employment year after year.  They would be employed during the beet campaigns and by food processing plants such as Erin Foods. I am not in a position to offer any ready solution as to how this matter might be dealt with but I would be concerned for the beet campaign worker, for instance, who had given four, six or perhaps up to ten seasons work within that industry, admittedly only for up to about five months at a time.  I thought that such a worker might be entitled to some consideration in this Bill.  I wonder whether the Minister gave any consideration to the question of providing that after a number of seasons of such work, an employee would be guaranteed continuing seasonal work in subsequent campaigns.  No doubt the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be aware personally of many small farmers in the north Cork <Col N="330" /> region of his constituency who depend on that type of seasonal work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We considered such workers but as the Deputy has indicated he appreciates the difficulty in including categories of this nature. He makes the point that after a person has been in so-called casual employment for a number of years he is in a category different from casual workers. It would be difficult to arrive at a formula to cover this sort of situation. We have been unable to reach any satisfactory formula in this regard and that is why we included the provision relating to a year's continuous service. I do not know whether any additional wisdom will come to light between now and Report Stage so I am not in a position to give any undertaking on this except to promise to have a look at it again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be grateful to the Minister for giving the matter further consideration.  I appreciate the difficulties.  There should be some way whereby, after a specified number of seasons working, they would have some sort of preference or priority when that seasonal work recurs.</P>
      <P>Subsection (5) provides:</P>
      <P>The Minister may by order amend any provision of this Act so as to comply with any international obligations in relation to dismissals that the State has decided to assume.</P>
      <P>This is again a rather wide power particularly now that we are in the EEC and the Minister is at the head of the ILO.  Should we not have it written into that subsection, or is it considered unnecessary, that there should be consultation with the joint committee or with the ILO if such a course is considered necessary?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that this, in fact, comes before the Oireachtas Committee on EEC Secondary Legislation.  This is subject to ratification by the House.  It would be untidy to start naming possible international organisations and so forth.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  As I pointed out earlier, there is a danger of overloading and I hope this will not be the outcome here.  Human nature being what it is, most dismissals will get some sort of airing or some effort will be made to get them aired.  I mentioned last night the frightening increase in Britain in the total cost and in personnel.  In fact, 90 per cent of the cases going before the tribunals were cases of unfair dismissal and some of them were very very trivial indeed.  The Minister will need to keep a close watch on the situation so that the legislation will be effective and the machinery will operate satisfactorily.  This is one of the reasons why I am not satisfied about the six-month period or my suggested amendment of three months. The sooner unfair dismissal cases are dealt with the better it will be for industrial relations.  I do not want to see a backlog of cases building up under this section to the point at which the situation becomes somewhat like cases going before the courts with delays <Col N="332" /> and adjournments.  If that is the evolution industrial relations will suffer particularly if there is reinstatement at the end of the day.  The sooner these claims are dealt with the better it will be for employer and employee.</P>
      <P>There is also the problem of the small employer who may get notice of an unfair dismissal claim against him. He will not be able to fill the vacancy in his work force until the claim has been finalised and I would not be in favour of any job going unfilled for any period of time.  That would be very undesirable.  The progress where redundancy claims are involved is pretty slow at the moment.  It is important that the work of the tribunal should not be overloaded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope the majority of the cases would be settled at rights commissioner level.  It is necessary to rename the redundancy tribunal as the Employment Appeals Tribunal because it will have more varied functions under the different Acts and under this Bill when it becomes law.  The Redundancy Appeals Tribunal had a large number of unfair dismissal issues so there should be a lightening of the work of the tribunal to that extent.

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (1), line 1, to delete &ldquo;Anti-Discrimination&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Conditions of Employment&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is very much a personal viewpoint. I know the Minister will not accept the amendment though I would dearly wish he would.  I have never liked the term &ldquo;anti-discrimination&rdquo;. I do think it is the correct term.  It immediately gives the idea that there was discrimination and it is now going to be eliminated.  There may have been discrimination by a very small <Col N="333" /> number of employers.  The vast majority of employers are decent, scrupulous people, hard working and sincere, who would not be in favour of a dismissal of any sort and would take any steps they could to avoid a dismissal.  It would be much nicer if the Title were, as I have suggested, Conditions of Employment (Unfair Dismissals) Act, 1976.  That would be a truer and a fairer description of it. In his earlier years in dealing with such legislation, the Minister probably leaned over backwards to prove to somebody that, during his period as Minister, he intended to eliminate such discriminations as may have existed.</P>
    <P>This Bill will never be called anything but the Unfair Dismissals Act because that is what it is.  From my point of view the title I suggest would be acceptable to everybody.  Small employers are afraid of this Bill because they have never dismissed anybody, never mind dismissed anybody unfairly. I ask the Minister to consider my amendment very seriously as being a contribution to good industrial relations. I urge him to accept it.  I am sure he agrees that it will always be called the Unfair Dismissals Act, but it relates to conditions of employment. My suggested title is fairer and would offend nobody, and it might eliminate some of the fears small employers have in relation to this legislation.  I strongly urge the Minister to amend the Title.</P>

      <P>For some time I have been giving some thought to the genetic titles of these pieces of legislation. They refer to fair terminations of employment and fair hiring conditions. I agree the Bill will be known <Col N="334" /> as the Unfair Dismissals Act.  If the Deputy leaves it with me, I will consider it between now and Report Stage. I am thinking about changing the Title.  I am concerned as to whether the title Conditions of Employment (Unfair Dismissals) Act would confuse it with other legislation.  What the Deputy has suggested echoes some of my own thoughts on the matter.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister.  I have been thinking about this for some time and I will be making suggestions about other legislation. I am not tying him to my title. I am satisfied with the assurance he has given me.  I look forward to finding a more appropriate title for this very important Bill.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to this other than what I said on the amendment.  We will have a further interesting debate on Report Stage of this Bill which I regard as very important.  While we still have some slight disagreements on some aspects of the Bill it has been improved by our discussions on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>The children involved reside less than two miles from Kilcoskin national school which is their nearest school and they are not, therefore, basically eligible for free transport.  In the circumstances it would not be open to the Department to allow transport, either free or fare-paying, to St. Margaret's national school, the school they are attending.</P>
