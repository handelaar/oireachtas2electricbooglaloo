      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the term &ldquo;ship or its cargo&rdquo; is not meant to cover an oil rig or platform.  Because of the recent blow out in the North Sea which caused such trouble and worry, it is important to be clear that they are not covered here.  This section refers to a ship or its cargo.  Could a platform or oil rig not be described as a ship?  After all, it has to be towed out to sea like any other vessel. From the Minister's reply on Second Stage it would seem that the 1969 convention was not meant to cover such an eventuality.  This is 1977. It seems a long time to wait for a Bill to come before the House.  I am not saying the Minister or his Department are to blame for this but is a further Bill to be brought before the House which will cover such an eventuality? The blow out in the North Sea and also off the west coast of America have proved that a danger exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="154" /> The Minister said that this matter came under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and that it would be his job to introduce a Bill.  It is time for us to examine the structure of the two Departments with regard to issues such as this.  The Minister for Transport and Power should have the responsibility for all these matters rather than two Departments being responsible. It would be more businesslike and more workable to have it under the responsibility of the Minister for Transport and Power.  I realise that this would involve a reorganisation of the duties and responsibilities of that Ministry.  I presume that when the Ministry for Transport and Power was set up nobody visualised we would have such threats facing us.</P>
    <P>I understand that there is a convention covering a blow out such as that which occurred in the North Sea but that legislation is needed.  How soon can we expect such legislation?  The Minister might give us some idea of this even though it is the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Barrett.  There is a great deal of apprehension about this problem on the west coast.  I am surprised Deputy Barrett did not mention his own area but I will mention the major area&mdash;Galway.  Tourist resorts, which could be more valuable than oil to people in a particular area, could be wiped out by such an accident off our coast.  While it would be a national asset to strike oil&mdash;and there is great optimism that it is there&mdash;every safeguard possible should be included in this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Cavan) Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Cavan</i>): I can easily understand and appreciate Deputies wishing to discuss the North Sea blow out which took place recently and its consequences and effects.  However, when I replied to the Second Stage debate a short time ago I went out of my way to make it perfectly clear that the Bill we are dealing with seeks to enable us to implement amendments to a 1954 convention which deals <Col N="155" /> exclusively with the pollution of the sea by oil from ships.  That is what this Bill seeks to do.</P>
      <P>Naturally we are all concerned with pollution in all its forms.  It is natural too that we would be particularly concerned with the North Sea blow out because it is a recent occurrence and an in-topic.  Might I request Deputies not to pursue this, because it is simply not relevant on this Bill.  The responsibility for dealing with pollution, such as that caused by the North Sea blow out, falls under another convention which has not yet even been finalised and we are only one of very many countries involved in that convention. That convention, as I say, has not been finalised.  As things stand here at the moment the responsibility for making a contribution towards the finalising of that convention does not rest with my Department but rests with the Department of Industry and Commerce. Therefore, may I summarise by saying that the pollution caused by this blow out is not a matter for this Department, nor is it a matter for this convention.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett raised the point when he intervened first as to whether an oil rig or its platform could be regarded as a ship.  My answer to that is, in no way could an oil rig or its platform be described as a ship or fall into the category of ships.  That is my advice.  I might venture a layman's opinion: a ship, I imagine, is something that propels itself, not something that is dragged out or hauled out and left in position.  I think that deals with the point raised by Deputy Barrett.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the name of the ship escapes me; I have mislaid my note; but there is a case which would come under this section, the case of an oil tanker which is breaking up and despite the efforts of everybody there seems to be an inability to discover the names of the owners.  What would happen in similar circumstances here where ships are in some cases sailing under flags of convenience and where it is not possible to pin down the owners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Deputy Calleary raises the point where <Col N="156" /> a ship is breaking up and which it may not be possible to identify.  I refer the Deputy to section 2 subsection (5), which meets the point he raised, which says:</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to the provisions of any other enactment relating to the service of notices, the Minister, or any person authorised in that behalf by the Minister, may give directions&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to the owner or person in possession of a ship, by serving the direction on the master of the ship,</P>
      <P>(b)  to the salvor, by serving the direction on the person in charge of the salvage operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be acceptable in probably 99.9 per cent of cases, but this case to which I have referred seems to be the other 0.1 per cent.  I am sure the Minister and the officers of his Department have full particulars of the case.  There was an Irishman serving on the ship.  This ship has for a number of years been condemned by most of the marine insurers. The ship is now lying somewhere off the American coast and it has not been possible, despite the fact that the ship has been there for some years, to discover who the owner is.  I understand that there is a possibility that the oil from that ship could reach our coast.  I will look up the details and pass them on to the Minister, because this is something that could affect us.</P>
      <P>I do not want to Labour the point that I raised and which the Minister said is not a matter for his Department, but I do say that it is time our Departments were completely reorganised. We are now in the last quarter of the 20th Century and there have been unforeseen developments in technology. We are told that within the next few years all along the west coast will be a considerable source of oil.  The prevailing winds are from the west, and the west coast which, as Deputy Coogan said, is a highly intensive tourist area, would be within a couple of days of a major oil spillage.  It is time the question of reorganising Departments was considered so as to bring them up to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> I was watching BBC News last night and saw an oil rig three times higher than Big Ben being towed by five tugs.  It makes one worried.  It is time that we started to update all our law.  It goes back to what Fianna Fáil have been saying for a long time. Pollution should come within the control of a Department of the Environment which would be responsible for all types of pollution.  This would help the Minister and his colleagues, who have to look over their shoulders to find who is responsible for various types of pollution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it feasible that oil tankers would carry detergents to deal with a spillage immediately it occurs?  Could this be arranged by convention or otherwise?  Tankers that can carry millions of gallons of oil should be capable of carrying a few hundred tons of detergent to deal with an emergency.  This would remove a great deal of worry for people living along the coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): This question about a separate Department for the Environment with sole responsibility for pollution is raised frequently.  First of all, the number of Ministers is limited by the Constitution; secondly, the arrangement at the moment is that the Department of Local Government is the Department with overall authority in respect of pollution, and by and large that is reasonable because the Department of Local Government has responsibility for many facets of local administration which could cause pollution.  That does not mean that several other Departments have not an input into the prevention of pollution.</P>
      <P>This whole matter was recently considered by a committee from various Departments and a good deal of thought and consideration was given to it.  The result of that consideration was that the present system of dealing with pollution by the Department of Local Government is the most workable and the most effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind Deputy Calleary, who raised the point about an unidentified ship, that we must be clear <Col N="158" /> as to what we are dealing with here. Within our territorial waters we have authority under this Bill to deal with any offending ship.  Outside our territorial waters we have authority to deal only with our own ships or ships belonging to or registered in one of the 23 countries that have subscribed to the convention.  We have no authority over a ship registered in a country which is not bound by the convention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The boat I am referring to is outside our territorial waters and, fortunately, is far enough away from us, but if it were 150 miles off the west coast what would be the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): It would depend on where the ship is registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the problem, because the ship is not registered in any of the countries that subscribe to the convention.  However, I should like to know how we can stop the oil polluting the west coast.  This matter has got a lot of publicity and I understand that a Dublin man is a member of the crew.  The American authorities have made extensive efforts to trace the owners and have discovered that ownership is tied up in a number of holding companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): This Bill will mean a vast improvement on the present position.  It is important that things are done step by step.  We are taking measures to deal with all offending ships within our territorial waters and we are taking authority to deal with the ships of more than 20 other states, some of the biggest in the world, when they offend outside our territorial waters.  We will always come across the ship registered in a country that has not subscribed to the convention, and that ship will not be bound by the convention or this Bill. I understand that there is a second convention which authorises this country to take action against a ship where that ship is obviously polluting or affecting our shores.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): That happens in many walks of life.  The state is called upon to spend a considerable amount of money to prevent somebody causing damage, but if that person causing the damage is not a mark it is not possible to recover the expenses from him.  In the case the Deputy is talking about we can render the ship harmless if it is inside our territorial waters.  If the owner or those in control of the ship cannot be located the state will have to bear the cost involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we not insist that ships like these are not allowed to trade with us?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): If a ship drifts inside our territorial waters and is abandoned, like an old car on the road, what can we do?  If the owners can be located and they are a mark the damages can be recovered, but otherwise nothing can be done.</P>

      <P>Territorial waters is a delicate question at present, and I should like to know if the Minister is referring to 12 miles or 50 miles.  The Minister has not told me whether it could be arranged to make it compulsory for the big oil tankers to carry detergents.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>On the definition of a ship, the Minister maintains that a ship is self-propelled.  The definition of a ship could be very important when we bear in mind oil rigs and platforms.  Could they be described as ships?  It should be borne in mind that canal barges, which were horse-drawn, came under the definition of ships. Surely, there is a precedent for including oil rigs and platforms as ships under this section.  It would be important for us to do so.  The importance of doing this was stressed recently when there was a blow out in the North Sea.  Exploration is being carried out in the Porcupine Shelf and we are hopeful that oil will be discovered, but what happens if we were unfortunate to have a blow out such as occurred in the North Sea?</P>
      <P>This is something we all appreciate can happen a lot quicker than we would have anticipated a few years ago, the consequences of which would be enormous.  I am not saying we should not have exploration or exploitation. It is important that we get this under way with the minimum of delay.  However, we must consider other eventualities in view of recent happenings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From what the Minister has said it appears that matters such as these will be covered under a separate convention not yet finalised.  In due course a Bill will be brought before both Houses by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to cover such matters. However, experience has shown that the time lag between the signing of such convention by the different parties to it, the passage of legislation <Col N="161" /> through the Houses of the Oireachtas and its implementation can be as much as six or seven years.  If such a blow out occurred in the next two or three years&mdash;and it could happen that technology could be devised that would establish a well at depths on the Cork Point shelf on stream faster than we can anticipate at present&mdash;there is no action we can take before such a convention is ratified and legislation passed by these Houses.  Therefore we would be left, so to speak, with our flank completely exposed in that respect. We could eliminate many potential dangers if it were possible to describe a rig or platform as a ship even though the Minister has said that his definition of a ship would be a vessel that is self-propelled.  I have given the example of a canal barge dragged by a horse in the old days.  Surely such&mdash; and there are still some in existence in England&mdash;could have been defined in those days as a ship.  If we could so define a rig or platform it would eliminate a lot of difficulty, delay and danger that might otherwise occur because of the time lag involved before the introduction of legislation to cover such an eventuality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I am advised that the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 defines a ship and that in no way could an oil rig or platform be taken to be a ship or fall within the definition of such.  I have not got that Act before me but <Col N="162" /> I am assured that a ship is therein described as a vessel used in navigation, not propelled by oars, that is, a sea-going vessel not propelled by oars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Specifically a seagoing vessel?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Yes, I am so advised.  The Bill before the House is limited in its effect of implementing a convention which deals with pollution of the sea by oil from ships. Any efforts on our behalf to legislate for occurrences outside our three mile limit, which did not fall within that convention, would be simply a waste of time.  We have the power and authority to deal with the type of incident or catastrophe about which Deputies speak provided it occurs within our territorial waters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>If such a blow out occurred before we have the legislation resultant on the next convention is it the case that the Minister or the Government will be unable to take any action?  For instance, who will be empowered to take action?  This is a very serious matter.  Somebody must invite the &ldquo;Red&rdquo; Adairs and such people to deal with these matters.  It is most important that we be in a position to take some action or, apart altogether from these conventions, should we introduce some Bill in order to be in a position to take the necessary action?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I hope I shall make myself clear but, if a blow out occurs outside our territorial waters there is nothing that any Bill we might introduce here, <i>per se,</i> could do to enable us to deal with that because we have no control over the high seas. They are free to the world and we can get control over them only by way of convention.  We have taken control over ships on the high seas that pollute by oil, by virtue of the Convention of 1954, as amended by the Convention of 1971.  It is futile to suggest that we, as a country, by putting a Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas could suddenly get possession of and control over the high seas, because we cannot. We can do that only by convention. There is no use suggesting that there <Col N="163" /> is something that the Department of Transport and Power, or the Department of Industry and Commerce could do, no matter who may be the Ministers involved, to give us authority over the high seas.  Again, we can do that only through international convention. Hopefully the international convention which will deal with these blow outs will be negotiated by 20 or 30 nations. As a nation we will do everything to encourage the finalisation of that convention. Those are the realities of the situation.</P>

      <P>When the prospecting licences were granted surely our Government could have inserted clauses in them to cover some of the eventualities about which Deputy Barrett speaks.

      <P>I have allowed fairly wide reference to oil rigs, blow outs and such like primarily to facilitate Deputies for clarification purposes.  However, it must be clear to the House that these matters are not relevant to this Bill.  They cannot be dealt with under this Bill and are the responsibility of another Minister. While I have allowed reference to it I want to disuade Members from assuming that they may debate the matter of oil rigs, blow outs and such matters under this measure.  It is not appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister has said, that no legislation will empower us to deal with outside waters, that this has to await an international convention.  The worrying thing is whether, if an oil spillage occurred, we would be powerless to do anything about it.  I would refer to the occurrence in the North Sea which was far outside Norwegian or British territorial waters, yet the Norwegian Government seemed to be in a position to take action and the British Minister, Mr. Benn, went to the spot and immediately got involved.  Does the Minister visualise that we could get <Col N="164" /> involved immediately if such an eventuality occurred before the necessary convention and resultant legislation is brought before the House?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Deputy Barrett has come nearer to reality.  I understood him to have been asking what I am doing in the Bill, or could do in any Bill, to take power to control or to prevent pollution by blow outs.  I can do nothing but of course most things can be done by agreement.  The intervention by the Americans, the British and others in the <i>Bravo</i> blow out to try to render it harmless was obviously done by agreement between the countries concerned and the owners of the oil rig who did not want to pollute the seas and who were very anxious to have help.</P>
      <P>In similar circumstances we would use our international influence and diplomatic connections all over the world if such an accident affected us. Furthermore, we would be prepared to lend our help, by agreement, to render such spillages harmless.  It would be unsatisfactory to get into a very wide discussion on conditions to be laid down for lessors or lessees in regard to steps to prevent pollution. My belief is that they take preventive measures, but it is very difficult to involve ourselves in a debate on such matters.  In any event, that does not concern my Department and is not relevant to the Bill.</P>

      <P>Subsection (4) refers to the directions the Minister may give and paragraph (a) provides that action taken by or on behalf of the Minister may include the removal of a ship beyond the limits of a harbour or the restraint or control of its movements. If there is spillage from a ship, its removal from a harbour would not be the proper action to take because it <Col N="165" /> would spread the spillage over a wider area.  Paragraph (d) refers to the sinking, destruction or taking over of control of a ship.  We are dealing with pollution caused by oil spillage from a ship and there would not seem to be much point in sinking a ship which is spilling oil on to the sea.  An effective way would be to use booms and suction pumps immediately and to have the oil transferred to another ship or to shore storage tanks.  Paragraph (b) refers to the unloading or discharge of oil or other cargo.</P>

      <P>The Minister may give other directions, and when Deputy Barrett was dealing with the subsection he picked out paragraphs (a) and (d) and simply ignored the remainder.  I propose to read to the House the directions the Minister may give.  He may direct the removal of the ship beyond the limits of the harbour or restrain or control its movements.  He may direct the unloading or discharge of oil or other cargo.  That is a very effective step he can take.  He may give directions regarding the taking, or restriction on taking, of specified salvage measures. Not alone may he give a direction with regard to the sinking of the ship but he may also give a direction regarding the destruction or taking over of control of the ship.  Those are all very effective steps he may take.  If sinking stood alone there might be something in what Deputy Barrett said.  If removal beyond the harbour stood alone there might be something in what Deputy Barrett said but taking the subsection and its four clauses together, it is very effective.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): We are implementing a convention here under which more than 20 countries have agreed to come together and agree to be bound by rules and regulations and to bind their ship owners and nationals by these regulations.  In order to get those 20-odd countries to come together and be bound in this way, it was of course necessary for them all to be satisfied that the regulations would be reasonable.  One of the safeguards that was built into the convention was that any ship owner who was given an unreasonable direction or regulation which caused him damage or loss should be entitled to compensation. In deciding whether or not a ship owner is to be entitled to compensation for having complied with a regulation which cost him substantial loss, the convention and the Bill propose to pose the question: was the damage caused or likely to be caused by pollution out of all proportion to the <Col N="170" /> damage or loss which was caused to the ship owner by the direction?  If it was then the ship owner is entitled to compensation.</P>
      <P>I must take an extreme case to demonstrate the point.  Suppose there is a trivial amount of pollution and some Minister directs that the ship be abandoned and be sunk.  That would obviously be a stupid thing to do, imposing a loss on the ship owner which would be altogether out of proportion to the amount of the damage that was being done to the sea.  It would be only reasonable, in my opinion, that if the ship owner carried out the direction he should be entitled to compensation, and that is, in effect, what is built into this subsection.</P>

    <P>The Minister will have no power to act in relation to ships from countries that are not part of the convention. Deputy Calleary referred earlier to the abandoned ship whose ownership <Col N="171" /> nobody would be able to trace.  A ship which has been abandoned and whose ownership cannot be traced to a country which is participating in this convention or whose ownership cannot be traced in any way could be lying immediately outside our territorial waters slowly spilling oil into the sea and the oil could be blown towards our coasts, thus seriously affecting the environment not to mention all the other effects which are involved in such a spillage.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Yes, if it is what I call a convention ship we can deal with it.  Deputy Barrett posed the question, what will happen if it is not a convention ship. Up to this minute we have no legal authority unless by agreement, as took place in the North Sea, to deal with any ship outside the territorial waters. By virtue of the convention and by virtue of this Bill we will get control over the ships of 23 other nations, some of the most important nations in the world.  That is a big step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asked what will happen if the offending ship is not registered in a country which subscribes to the convention. <Col N="172" /> There is nothing we can do about it unless international law is changed.  There is an ongoing conference on the law of the sea and perhaps it will come up with a solution.  It would be a good thing if it did.  Perhaps the international law of the sea will be changed so as to give all countries power to deal with an offending ship, irrespective of a convention. That is another step forward.  We are now achieving very wide control.  That is not to say that I complain about Deputies asking for perfection.  We should all aim at the ultimate perfection and the ultimate measures for preventing the pollution of the sea.

This is an international convention which must be negotiated freely between innumerable countries. It is also bound up by the international Law of the Sea Conference.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the power to detain vessels and the means by which the Minister would exercise the powers vested in him under this Bill.  At present it would appear to be correct to say that the instrument of power would be the Naval Service.  Due to the fisheries dispute this Service will be over-extended from now on.  In the Second Stage debate on this Bill we mentioned that a coastguard service should be considered.  Some people may have got the impression that we were speaking in terms of a separate service independent from any existing service, such as they have in the United States.  We do not support the creation of a new service with all the administration costs which that would entail.  It is not the appropriate time for more public expenditure, but nevertheless it must be agreed that some type of service is necessary.</P>
      <P>We are an island country and we have many interests associated with the sea.  We should consider the setting up of a coastguard unit within the present Naval Service.  The duties of this unit would not be solely confined to arresting ships or enforcing the laws and the powers vested in the Minister under this Bill.  We would visualise their duties going far outside this area. There are numerous fishing vessels operating along our coasts from places such as Killybegs and there have been accidents from time to time.  It would seem that there is no communication between these vessels and the mainland. There are two radio stations that can be used for this purpose, one at Valentia Island and the other at Malin Head, but once the fishing vessels go beyond a certain area they have no contact with either of these stations. A properly run radio communication service could be operated by a coastguard unit within the Naval Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This unit would not have to be as expensive as the Naval Service because a much smaller type of vessel could be used.  The number of personnel would not be too great and the present Naval administration could be slightly augmented to deal with the extra tasks. We must face up to the fact that we are an island people.  We have a very extensive coastline.  In the past we <Col N="174" /> thought in terms of the three mile limit.  The kind of service required to police this area was quite small but with the extension of the territorial waters we will need an expanded service.  The exploration for oil and gas and, hopefully, the exploitation of these resources will mean more and more activity off our shores and this is the appropriate time to consider the establishment of some service within the framework of the present Naval Service.  A small type of vessel could be used, and this unit would be responsible for an extended radio communication service for the protection of our fishermen.  At present it would appear that these men, when they go beyond a certain distance from Valentia Island or Malin Head, have no radio contact other than with some passing vessel using the VHF system. It is an appropriate time to consider this no matter what Government are in power and whatever Department are involved.  We should streamline our service along our coast and have it as a unit within the present Naval Service.  It may be called perhaps a coastguard service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Deputy Barrett on this.  The present situation is not satisfactory.  If we want to implement, under this section of the Bill, the power to detain vessels it is necessary to think along the lines suggested by Deputy Barrett.  The Naval Service are doing a good job considering that we do not have the resources to provide what we would like in this regard.  For possibly a much lesser sum we could provide a coastguard service which would be under the control of the Department of Defence, perhaps by using smaller launches and having them in ports at various points along the coast.  They could play a great role apart entirely from patrol work and assisting in this kind of work mentioned in the Bill.  On the northwest coast we have no lifeboat from Arranmore in Donegal to the Aran Islands, and this is quite a large stretch of coast without a rescue service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of communication has to be taken into account here. For instance, with regard to the radio <Col N="175" /> service, at the moment the Valentia radio messages cannot be picked up even in Cork and the same problem arises in trying to pick up messages from other areas along the coast.  This is something to be taken into account if we want an efficient service.  I would not like to think in terms of huge expenditure in this but I recall the war years when we had coast-watching by Army personnel who possibly did not have boats or anything like that to help them in this activity, but they did provide the service at the time.  If we based the service we are talking about on something on that line we could be doing a very worthwhile job.  This is something that comes under the Minister's Department.  What might be taken into consideration is the fact that a great number of people seem to be getting boats for pleasure, speed boats, yachts and so on.  These could play a big role in the service we are mentioning in the event of accidents at sea or matters of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): The ability of this country to enforce this Bill when it becomes an Act has been raised and it has been suggested on Second Reading Stage and now that we should have a coastguard service. I would like to come down to the realities of the matter and to deal with what is required under the Bill and what this country has proved itself capable of doing in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all I should thank and congratulate our Naval Service for their display and the action they have taken in the recent past in regard to both the Russian trawler and the Dutch boats.  It is obvious that our Naval Service is respected and obeyed. They have equipped themselves magnificently and deserve the height of credit.  The action in regard to the Dutch boats following on the action regarding the Russian trawler has demonstrated that this country means what it says in regard to the enforcement of the law applying to fishing as we see it, and our directions and commands have been obeyed.  It may be that the validity of these will be determined in one court or another, but that is another day's work.  The fact is <Col N="176" /> that we were able to arrest, detain and bring into port a huge Russian trawler and we stopped and brought into port the ten Dutch boats.  That is evidence that we are capable of enforcing the law as we see it and that our directions are respected.</P>
    <P>Let us see what is involved here.  We will be dealing under this Bill with convention ships, that is ships registered or under the control of countries who have subscribed to this convention. These ships will be guilty of a breach of the law in their own country as well as on the high seas, because each country which has subscribed to the convention will be introducing a national law on this matter which will make it an offence for their ships to do abroad those things that we would be complaining of them doing on the high seas.  Therefore, we will be dealing with the ships of a friendly country and we will be enforcing a common law, a law that will be common to this country and the country of registration of the ship.  That is clearly the present position in regard to the fisheries matter, because neither the Russian boats nor the Dutch boats are in breach of their own national law when fishing inside the 50-mile limit, but they are in breach of our law.  As they see it, I suppose we could not expect help or co-operation from ships that are not in breach of their own national law.  However, here, ships which are polluting the sea will be in breach of their own national law as well as our law, and they will not be too difficult to deal with.  I hope there will not be much pollution.  Ships that are causing pollution could be in the harbour, and there would be no problem there.  If a strange ship was polluting the high seas outside our territorial limit, Britain would likely have a common case in preventing the pollution.  If it happened to be a British ship that was polluting the water, being nearer home we could complain or France might have a common cause in relation to that pollution. I can understand Deputies using this debate as a platform to raise the question of the coastguard service, but when one analyses what is involved here it will be found that there will not be a very severe onus on this country in <Col N="177" /> implementing this measure, because we will be acting in common with various other countries who have a common cause.  There may be a case for having a coastguard service, if we could afford it, but we are not an imperial power and we have not endless wealth and we must operate within our limits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We appreciate the great work done by the naval service and we are not being critical of this service.  We also appreciate the extension of their duties as a result of the new fishing limits.  Whereas they would have been operating within a 12-mile limit they will now operate over a far wider area.  We are not thinking solely in the context of convention ships from whom we would expect the greatest co-operation. Non-convention ships which may be registered in a country which is not a party to a convention could cause pollution and oil spillages.  If such a ship caused pollution within our territorial waters the Minister would have power to take action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I know, we have four naval vessels on active duty at the moment, and they would be operating over a very wide area.  Oil pollution must be dealt with quickly.  A coastguard service could be far more effective in dealing with matters such as this.  In relation to the cost of a coastguard service, I believe that five smaller vessels than the ones at present being used by the naval service could be purchased for about £1 million each.  The vessels being used by the naval service at the moment cost about £4½ million or £5 million each.  These smaller vessels could be widely spaced and could be utilised when necessary to deal with pollution, and the Minister's power would be more effective.  The question of cost is not a serious question when one considers that some extra naval service vessel will be necessary to cover the wider area.  The Minister and his Department should seriously consider the extension of the naval service by the inclusion of a coastguard service comprised of these smaller vessels.  The coastguard service could have patrol duties and life saving duties.  They would be on the spot to protect fishing vessels in the event of a disaster such <Col N="178" /> as the one we had off the Donegal coast.  This suggestion is worth considering seriously.</P>

      <P>The provisions of section 3 could be used against the Minister.  Quite a number of our harbour masters are part time, and if one takes into account the number of offences that can be committed under section 13, the owners, masters or skippers of boats could take action against the Minister unless the harbour masters around the country are fully briefed.  I do not mean they should be circulated with a copy of the Bill. They should be taken into regional centres and the provisions of the Bill should be explained to them.  When the pollution officers begin to operate will they be seconded at times to help harbour masters?  The Minister explained earlier that various Departments do not feel there is any need for this.  I believe pollution officers could be of help to harbour masters many of whom are part time and have not got experience, and will not get the experience unless the Department of Transport and Power briefs them fully on the Bill.</P>

      <P>This section says that the Minister or the harbour master concerned may halt and detain a vessel.  In order to be in a position to implement that section it is necessary to do something along the lines suggested by Deputy Barrett and myself.  We do not expect that we will have many cases of oil pollution but we know how serious oil pollution can be from our experience in the last few years.  We should try to ensure that under the terms of the Bill we can control it effectively.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Deputy Calleary feared that section 3 might be invoked against the Minister or the harbour master for acting under section 6.  That could not happen because section 3 only relates to action taken under section 2.  Control of the coast is always under consideration. Our patrolling strength is greater now than it was some years ago.  We have now planes searching out for offending ships.  A discussion in regard to the strength of fishery <Col N="179" /> protection boats&mdash;I again want to congratulate all those concerned&mdash;is hardly relevant to this particular Bill. The offending ships under this Bill will usually be going in and out of harbours. We are acting here under convention with over 20 other countries, who will be coming together with a common purpose.  They will be assisting us and we will be assisting them.  That is the object of the exercise.  I do not see any of the fears expressed by Deputy Calleary.</P>

We have a written Constitution and, by virtue of it, these are the severest penalties we can prescribe for summary conviction.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>

      <P>To convenience traders and in the interest of administrative efficiency goods such as ready-mix concrete imported in bulk for delivery to persons living near the Border who are registered here for VAT, are by long standing practice, given customs clearance at the Border post.  The administrative practices adopted by the UK authorities are, as the Deputy will appreciate, outside our control.  Where any discrepancy in administrative practices arises consideration is given to bringing them into harmony where such a course is feasible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Did they do anything to bring it into harmony?  Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree it is important that equal facilities are afforded to our manufacturers?  What measures have been taken in the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Commissioners considered that the withdrawal of the concession would give rise to complaints by creating inconvenience and hardship to persons who reside near the Border but at a distance from the customs station for whom this facility was introduced in the first instance.  The Commissioners feel that if they withdrew the concession there would be accusations of hampering trade&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not my question.  I am asking that equal facilities be provided.  At present the manufacturers of ready-mix concrete get a clearance even at passenger posts in north Monaghan.  The same <Col N="185" /> facilities are not afforded to the manufacturers of ready mix who are distributing in south Fermanagh.  All they are asking for is equal facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the recent report, the Revenue Commissioners waived certain regulations which allowed the manufacturers of ready mix concrete clearance at the customs posts rather than at their frontier stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that negotiations will have to take place with the British authorities.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was hoped that the 16 classroom school now in course of erection at St. Helena's, Rivermount, would be completed by the end of last month.  However, inclement weather conditions delayed progress and it is now expected that the school will be completed in about two months' time. The Commissioners of Public Works have received working drawings for a further 16-classroom school and they <Col N="186" /> hope to be able within the next week to authorise the chairman of the board of management to invite tenders.  It is yet too early to say when work on this school will commence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that in that area there are 1,200 students being ferried to different schools in the city?

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture (Mr. M. P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>A scheme of subsidies for the non-marketing of milk and for dairy herd conversion to operate in 1977 has already been agreed to by the Council of Ministers.  Details of the scheme are under consideration in Brussels and an announcement will be made at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that since the termination of the dairy herd conversion scheme on 31st December, 1974, no other scheme was introduced?  Is he also aware that when making representations on behalf of people who intend to discontinue milk production we were told another scheme would be introduced for the people going out of milk?  Now, two years later, we are told nothing has been done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="187" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so, as I indicated in my reply.  The position is that at a meeting in Luxembourg on 29th April, 1977, the Council of Ministers of the European Communities approved in principle a draft regulation introducing a system of premiums, non-marketing of milk and milk products and dairy herd conversion. This scheme, even though the regulations have not been finalised, will be introduced shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that from 1st January, 1975, there has been no scheme?  Even now the terms of this scheme have not been circulated.  If you ask the Department of Agriculture if there is a scheme for people who intend to discontinue milk production, they will tell you that there is not, but that one will be introduced shortly. That has been going on for over two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already indicated, agreement was reached on Friday last for the introduction of this scheme.  The Deputy can take it for granted that it will be put into operation within the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it because the question was put down that the Council of Ministers met?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think a question in this Dáil would give rise to a meeting of the Council of Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that it is a very unsatisfactory situation that Deputies who have been making representations for over two years to the Department regarding a scheme which is supposed to be introduced should be told now that it was introduced two years and four months after the last one terminated and in the interim period persons who wished to go out could not avail of any grant aids or any subsidies and were told all the time that there was a scheme in the offing?  Is it not really unfair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot introduce a scheme on our own because <Col N="188" /> EEC funds will be funding this scheme and we had to get agreement of the other Community countries. Such agreement was obtained and the principle adopted and finalised last week.  So, it is quite reasonable to assume that this scheme will be in operation probably in June or July next.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Veterinary practitioners are notified by my Department of the dates on which retests of herds with reactors, or doubtful reactors, are due to be carried out. District veterinary offices have instructions to ensure that there is no unavoidable delay in the carrying out of these tests.  Each affected herdowner should also contact his veterinary practitioner when 60 days have elapsed from the date on which the last reactor from a particular test was removed from his herd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it then that there is no further check on the testing other than what the herdowner does or what you advise the herdowner to do?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the drainage schemes that are now available to farmers for <Col N="192" /> draining their lands; if intermediate rivers are covered by such schemes; and the money that is available from EEC funds for those purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the farm modernisation scheme grant-aid is available for field drainage to all categories of farmers both individually and for joint works undertaken to improve common outfall watercourses.  I am advised that intermediate river schemes refer to catchment type arterial drainage schemes and as such would be for consideration by the Commissioners of Public Works. Portion of the Exchequer expenditure in respect of field drainage carried out by development farmers is eligible for recoupment from FEOGA.  The rate of refund on the eligible expenditure is 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary said that the money would be made available from the EEC and that they are seeking it for arterial drainage.  Is it being sought also for drainage of intermediate rivers because as the situation is at present there is no fund out of which to provide such money at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are particularly mindful of the question of the drainage of intermediate rivers but the carrying out of works on such rivers has more or less been abandoned over a number of years because priority is now given to main arterial schemes as it is the view of the Commissioners of Public Works that the main scheme should get priority.  Of course, we are mindful of the position of what are termed intermediate rivers and in respect of any funds that will come to hand consideration will be given to making funds available for some of these schemes.  The schemes I have in mind were the ones referred to by Deputy Gibbons, intermediate rivers. So far as the other works are concerned, land improvement works, field drainage, the grants vary from 40 per cent to 55 per cent of the cost, and such grants are obtainable without difficulty under the farm modernisation scheme by any farmer or group of farmers who make application and have their application approved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted the contents of this report with considerable interest and I most highly commend the NESC for the work and effort put into its compilation by all the people involved.  As regards making more land available for persons wishing to extend their holdings the position, as the Deputy is aware, is that late last year the Taoiseach, in consultation with the Ministers for Agriculture and Finance and the former Minister for Lands, established a group to carry out a comprehensive and wide-ranging review of the existing policy and programme of land structural reform and to formulate proposals and options for future land policy.  Until the report of this committee is received and is considered by the Government I am not in a position to indicate what lines future land policy will take.  The Deputy will, however, have seen my recent statement that the division of lands on the hands <Col N="195" /> of the Land Commission will be accelerated and that the target allocation for this year will be in the region of 40,000 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary accept that the report indicated that there would be less and less land available for persons requiring land to extend their holdings and they will be more dependent in years to come on the Land Commission providing land for them, and would he also agree that the farm retirement scheme has been a failure and has not achieved the purpose it was hoped it would achieve?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it has not been a success and I prophesied here that it would not be a success and, even though it has been updated by the former Minister for Lands, Deputy T. J. Fitzpatrick, it is not in my view yet a success and it will not measure up to the requirements of many farmers who are anxious to obtain additional allotments.  However, the scheme is still functioning and let us hope that, with the improvements in the retirement allowance for those who avail of the scheme, more land will be coming into the pool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say the scheme was not a success, because that is completely opposed to the view of his Taoiseach as expressed in Cavan a few weeks ago when he lauded the scheme and thought 27 applicants in that county in two years had been a great achievement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kelly) Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kelly)">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>The total annual cost to the Exchequer of financial assistance given to Irish immigrants in Britain is at present approximately £2,308,000.  The disposal of these moneys is not made through any agency but rather through the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Labour and our Embassy in London.</P>
      <P>The overall figure is allocated as follows:</P>
      <P>An estimated £2,236,000 will be paid this year by the Department of Social Welfare to beneficiaries in the United Kingdom, most of whom are Irish emigrants, under Irish social security legislation and EEC regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Labour provides a scheme under which payments of allowances and expenses are made to workers to facilitate their moving from Britain to take up employment <Col N="201" /> in Ireland.  The cost is expected to amount to £45,000 during 1977.  The same Department also will give grants of £5,000 this year to emigrant bureaux which provide information and advisory services for intending emigrants.</P>
    <P>The Embassy in London operates a scheme for the repatriation from Britain to Ireland of Irish citizens who are regarded as being in need of repatriation. Expenditure under this scheme amounts to about £1,000 a year.  The Embassy also generally concerns itself with the welfare of Irish emigrants in the United Kingdom and two officers in the Embassy are involved virtually full time on this work.  The annual cost of maintaining these two officers in the Embassy is of the order of £21,000.</P>
    <P>Concerning the Irish Centre, Camden Town, London, the Government are not in a position to make a grant to the centre having regard to present budgetary and financial considerations. However, the question of extra assistance towards the employment of social workers generally in Britain is still under consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is aware that the British Government have made a substantial grant to the Irish Centre in Camden Town, and would he not consider in the circumstances that the Irish Government should match that allocation pound for pound?  On the matter of the disposal of the moneys in excess of £2 million, allocated to the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Labour and the Irish Embassy, is that spent in Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is paid by the Department of Social Welfare, not the Department of Labour.  That is a separate, much smaller sum.  The sum of £2,236,000 will be paid by the Department of Social Welfare to the beneficiaries in the UK.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the moneys that are allocated in the ordinary way, the purport of my question was to ensure that centres like the <Col N="202" /> Irish Centre in Camden Town will receive financial assistance.  The Parliamentary Secretary will, I am sure, have received some weeks ago the memorandum from Fr. Cagney of the Irish Centre there setting out the very serious circumstances in which they find themselves, and it is our people, after all&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that in regard to some of our people who go to London and other areas in Britain destitute, the people working in the Irish Centre are doing a magnificent job on our behalf? It appears to me to be unfair that they are not receiving assistance and recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am bound to accept what the Deputy says about the work done by this centre and other centres, and ideally I am sure the Minister would wish that we would match pound for pound, and perhaps more than that, what is being done by the authorities in Britain.  I can only repeat that the present financial considerations make it impossible, this year anyway so far as can be seen, to do anything for the centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Col N="204" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of fishery protection vessels at present available to patrol the Irish extended fishing limits is six.  With regard to the fishing zones of other member states it would not be appropriate for me to comment on fishery protection resources deployed by those states.  Fishery protection is entirely a matter for each member state in its own waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that we have co-operated with the EEC Member States in establishing the 200-mile limit on the understanding that they will assist in the patrolling of this area, does it not seem strange that this Government do not seem to have any information with regard to what the EEC are doing in helping to protect these waters from third country states?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking from memory, I think the Deputy is overstating the assumption on which the waters were extended.  The community as such have no territorial waters, and the Deputy knows that.  These are national waters.  There is no specific undertaking about the degree of protection which will be given by other States to us or the degree of help we are going to get.  I take it that the reason for the Minister's rather laconic reply is that he has no Ministerial responsibility for the naval protection services of other states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that we ourselves are the only people responsible for the protection of the 200-mile fishery limit, and that if third countries fish that area other EEC states have no jurisdiction over the area and no authority to arrest boats from third countries for illegal fishing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will admit that the supplementary is a fair distance from his original question.  I cannot answer it accurately off the cuff, but I tell him that there is, as far as I know, at the moment no firm arrangement in regard to the patrolling as against outsiders at the outer part of the 200-mile limit.  The only understanding which has been arrived at is that the ultimate fishery regime <Col N="205" /> will be arranged in such a way that a disproportionate share of the cost of policing what will be a very large maritime zone from our point of view will not fall on a relatively very small economy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he recently proposed to the Council of Europe that no country should be free from inquiry, from inspection or from condemnatory action by the international community in respect of breaches of the rights of individuals; and if he will indicate the steps the Government has taken to implement this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the Minister's address to the Council of Europe on 26th April, 1977, he referred to views that he has previously expressed in the General Assembly of the United Nations regarding the protection of human rights and, in particular, to his proposal that an effective worldwide human rights jurisdiction should be created so that no country should be free from inquiry, from inspection, or from condemnatory action by the international community in respect of breaches of the rights of man.</P>
      <P>In the General Assembly last year, he cited Council of Europe procedures for the investigation and adjudication of alleged breaches of human rights, making specific mention of the optional procedure by which certain countries, including Ireland, have admitted the right of individual citizens to take proceedings in an international forum against the State when national remedies have been exhausted; and he advocated the universal application of such procedures as the objective towards which the international community should strive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will appreciate that the question did not relate to the right of an individual within the State to take proceedings against that State.  The Minister was recommending to the Council of Europe that the Member States of the Council of Europe should make <Col N="206" /> themselves amenable to inquiries from international organisations into any alleged breaches of human rights. Accordingly, I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary if, when the Minister made his statement to the Council of Europe the Government here had already decided (a) that that represents policy and (b) that we would be as good as our word and agree where necessary that what we propose in respect of others should also apply to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must realise that about the only effective international judicial instance that exists on the globe for probing alleged breaches of human rights inside other countries or outside national boundaries is the procedure within the Council of Europe which the Minister has persistently advocated for the rest of the world since he became a Minister.  That is an international procedure.  The Council of Europe has 20 members or thereabouts. That is international enough for me, and I believe that the Minister's point, which he has persistently made, has been that the procedures of the Council of Europe should be extended over the rest of the globe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>They have no greater distance to travel than many other people in Dublin.  It is not the practice to site sub post offices in built up areas in closer proximity than about a mile from an existing post office.  South Finglas is as well catered for by the existing two offices as other comparable areas.  There are no special features to warrant exceptional treatment. The only large undeveloped area in the vicinity has been acquired by the local authorities to be developed as an amenity area, and it is therefore unlikely that any further significant housing development in or near south Finglas will take place.  The only uncompleted development of any size is a shopping centre.  I will re-examine the situation as regards a post office when the shopping centre is completed.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 32 provides that a person seeking the name and address of a person publishing an advertisement, whereas hitherto he could legally get this without going through <Col N="218" /> any intermediary, and potentially thereby interfere with the privacy of certain advertisements, particularly box numbers inserted not in the course of trade or business by individuals for private purposes, now has to apply to the Director of Consumer Affairs who will be the only person who can obtain the name and address of an advertiser.  This is the result of representations received from some newspaper publishers who feared the unrestricted right of people to get names and addresses of advertisers would interfere with the operation of box number advertisements in particular and this amendment is drafted to meet the objections made.</P>

      <P>One can readily appreciate the need for this change. The purpose of the original section 13 was to enable the various procedures outlined in the Bill to be initiated.  An essential part of initiating these procedures would be to ascertain who the publisher of the advertisement in question was.  One can see immediately that this could cause great and widespread difficulties.  Therefore the amendment is very necessary.  Later I shall be proposing an amendment in Deputy O'Malley's name which will seek to exclude box numbers from the operation of the section altogether. This amendment is a necessary precaution or safeguard and, therefore, it is acceptable from our point of view.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (1) line 27, to add:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This section shall not apply to box number advertisements in newspapers, magazines or periodicals&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment simply seeks to make sure that advertisements inserted under box numbers do not come within the ambit of section 13.  This would be a wise provision to make.  The insertion of an advertisement under a box number <Col N="219" /> is a very well-established procedure and it serves a very useful purpose, indeed, particularly in the case of employment.  The ability to have access to inserting advertisements under box numbers in the case of employment is widely appreciated by employers and employees.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to envisage situations where, if the secrecy of the box number were to be done away with, employees could be placed at a very serious disadvantage.  You could have the case of a person who was in employment and who was anxious to change his employment.  In order to look around and see what alternatives there were, he could insert an advertisement under a box number indicating his availability without his employers being aware of some discontent or dissatisfaction on his part with his existing employment, or his conditions of service, or anything of that nature. The good old traditional secrecy of the box number is a very great value to many different types of people in various strata of our society.</P>
    <P>Very often, too, in simple domestic matters a person wishes to put in an advertisement without letting the neighbours know.  Again, the box number is a very useful device to enable him to do this.  If it were to be the case that, under the terms of this legislation, anybody could get behind a box number and find out who exactly was the person advertising, this could result in serious inconvenience, perhaps disadvantage, and even embarrassment. I recommend this amendment to the House as being a worth-while change and a worth-while safeguard to insert into the general provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment No. 32 which we have just adopted is to provide a safeguard in relation to the use of box numbers. As a result of that amendment, only the director or an officer of the Minister or an officer of a council of a county or corporation of a county or other borough who has a consumer protection function may use the power conferred in this Bill to seek the name and address of an advertiser.  It is <Col N="220" /> just the name and address, no more, which may be sought.</P>
      <P>The problem about excluding box numbers altogether from this power, even when it may only be used, as is now the case, by a responsible official &mdash;not by any individual; for instance, not by a person's own employer as in the case envisaged by Deputy Haughey &mdash; is that we are aware that trade or business, and possibly even trade or business which potentially could be quite shady, can be and is carried out under box numbers.  Obviously this is an area of trade where people could be put to considerable inconvenience. They might discover that what was being advertised under the box number was not what it should be, and that the person selling the goods was doing so for business or trade, and was continually using box numbers and purporting to be doing so in a private capacity whereas, in fact, he was doing it in a business or trading capacity.</P>
      <P>It is desirable, therefore, that the Director of Consumer Affairs, and the officers of the Minister concerned with enforcement, should have power to inquire the name and address of people inserting advertisements under box numbers.  Of course they would not pass on this information to other individuals whose interests were purely selfish, as the Deputy has indicated. Perhaps there could be a safeguard included to ensure that this power would be used in a responsible manner, even further to the amendment already adopted.  However, to exclude box numbers from this power to inquire would exclude a form of box number advertisements that are used for trade or business and which could be used for the purpose of promoting deceptive trade practices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>One recognises that this is an area of some difficulty but I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the way we are going about it now is not satisfactory from any point of view.  For instance, after adopting amendment No. 32 section 13 will enable the Director of Consumer Affairs, an officer of the Minister or an officer of a county council, corporation or county borough to get this information. There is no restriction on that <Col N="221" /> ability to get information by these people.  There is no indication that they can acquire it only for the purposes of this legislation.</P>
      <P>One would think that there should be a minimum safeguard included, that the director or officer of the Minister or local authority concerned should be confined to having the right to get this information in order to enable them to implement some provision of the legislation.  That should be <i>sine qua non.</i> That safeguard is not included.</P>
      <P>Whatever about including the Director of Consumer Affairs or an officer of the Minister, to include the officers of a council, a corporation or borough is widening it considerably.  I am concerned here with the question of employment principally.  I would be inclined to restrict it to the Director of Consumer Affairs or one of his servants. I do not think even the officers of the Minister should be included.  I accept that one can see the need for the director to have access to this information because without that the Bill could be rendered largely inoperative in many areas.  Therefore, we are on common ground so far as that is concerned but from then on we have to see if we can draw fairly strict lines of demarcation.</P>
      <P>If any officer of the Minister for Industry and Commerce or of a local authority can go to a newspaper, periodical or journal and find out the name of the person advertising under a box number that is going much too far, particularly in the case of employment. Officers of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and of local authorities are involved in very wide areas of employment.  In fact, if we were to exclude areas of employment in which they are involved we would be excluding much of the employment field.  We should be at pains to ensure that a person, freely and without any fear or restriction, can insert advertisements in regard to employment under box numbers with a total feeling of security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned employment because that is one area that is probably of the greatest practical importance, but it is not difficult to visualise many other circumstances in which ordinary citizens <Col N="222" /> would wish to advertise without having their neighbours or officers of the Minister or the local authority know who is advertising.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I recognise that the Parliamentary Secretary has a difficulty here.  I think it is only a matter of refining the phrasing to ensure that the areas I am concerned about are protected. That could be done in a number of different ways.  We could take Deputy O'Malley's amendment and change it to restrict the box number advertisements to employment situations. Deputy O'Malley's amendment then would read: &ldquo;This section shall not apply to box number advertisements in newspapers, magazines or periodicals in regard to employment&rdquo;. That would go a long way to meeting my objections but I still foresee areas in which difficulties, inconvenience and embarrassment could arise.</P>
    <P>Another way would be to amend Deputy O'Malley's amendment in such a way that, where the director was satisfied from the number, frequency and nature of the box number advertisements that they were being used as a device to get around the provisions of this legislation, in those cases he would be entitled to secure the information. There are a number of different ways in which we could achieve what the Parliamentary Secretary and myself are probably both agreed on, namely, we want to make the legislation work and we want to have the information available legitimately to the Director of Consumer Affairs when he needs it for the purpose of this legislation.  However, we would like to have this time-honoured traditional procedure of box number advertisements retained for certain situations where it has served the public well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given some thought to what the Deputy has said and I have a suggestion which might meet the case.  It is to the effect that where the information is being sought in respect of box number advertisements the officers concerned would be confined to seeking it for the purpose of enforcement of this legislation. Secondly, they would not be allowed to pass it on to third parties other <Col N="223" /> than those who have a responsibility for the enforcement of this legislation or to whom it is necessary to pass it so that the legislation may be enforced.  That would probably get over the difficulty.  I would suggest to the Deputy that the amendment as before us might be withdrawn on assurance from me that an amendment along the lines I have suggested and taking into account as far as possible the points made by Deputy Haughey will be submitted at Report Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (1) line 30, after &ldquo;retail&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;by weight (other than food packed for such sale by its manufacturer or producer or by the person who supplied it for such sale)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The effect of this amendment will be to relieve a person who does not have or use a weighing scales from the obligation to provide one for customers, which they would have been required to do by the present draft.  If, for instance, small shops, kiosks, <i>et cetera,</i> sell food only as an incidental and if all of this is pre-packed and they are not selling it by weight they would not in the normal way have a weighing scales and it would be inappropriate to require that they do so, given that they are not selling food by weight in a loose form and that the weight is only relevant in so far as it has been marked already on a pre-packed food which can be checked at the source of manufacture to ensure that the weight is accurate. I believe that the Bill without this amendment would perhaps, if strictly enforced, create difficulties for small traders of the type I have mentioned who sell food other than by weight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally, the Opposition are pressing the executive personage responsible for piloting <Col N="224" /> legislation through this House for concessions in favour of the general public, and normally one welcomes this sort of concession by a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary, and one can see that the Parliamentary Secretary is endeavouring to have a common-sense approach here in this regard.  However, I wonder if he is not being too accommodating, perhaps, in introducing this amendment. Any shop or outlet which wishes to sell to the general public should take the trouble and go to the expense of providing whatever amenities and facilities are necessary to give the public fair play and to ensure that the public is getting fair play.  The provision of a scales as outlined in the original section 14 would seem to be a very reasonable and fair practice.  The Parliamentary Secretary is worried about small places like kiosks and so on, and he is now providing that unless the goods in question are sold by weight there is no need to have the weighing scales.</P>
      <P>These days a great deal of merchandise goods, are packaged by weight and goods are sold in packages which are supposed to contain a certain weight of goods.  One loathes to think about it, but it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that some of these packages which profess to be a certain weight might not necessarily be up to that weight.  I do not think it is altogether sufficient to confine the necessity to provide a scales to situations where goods are sold by weight only, which is the effect of the amendment.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary has thought of this aspect, that even in the kiosk, the very small hatch-type outlet where nothing is sold except pre-packaged goods, it would be desirable that a member of the public purchasing, for instance, a packaged 1 lb of peas should be able to ensure that the packages did, in fact, weigh 1 lb.  It might be stamped as weighing 1 lb or 2 lb but might not in fact contain the appropriate weight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So, although one sees that the Parliamentary Secretary is endeavouring to be reasonable and accommodating, nevertheless, I wonder if he <Col N="225" /> is not going too far in this regard.  It would need to be a very small outlet that could not in some way provide the facility which section 14 makes mandatory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 14, without the amendment, would mean that anybody who sold any food at all, even the smallest article, would have to have a scales.  That would impose an undue burden on people who might sell only one or two packaged items in a shop concerned with other business purely to convenience a few customers.  They would have to discontinue selling these goods.</P>
      <P>It is possible that this can be dealt with in either of two ways.  If a person buys a pre-packed goods and weighs it and finds it is not the right weight&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he can complain about this matter to the weights and measures authority, who can take action with the manufacturer, who is the person responsible for having the pre-packed goods underweight&mdash;not the retailer.  Furthermore, the general question of pre-packed goods being underweight is a matter of continual concern to the weights and measures inspectors, who can check at the point of manufacture more easily and quickly than they could check at the retail sales level, and I have asked in recent months that special care be taken by the weights and measures inspectors in relation to ensuring that pre-packed goods are up to weight. A campaign of enforcement of this matter is at present in course of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not want to get into a nit-picking argument about this but the argument the Parliamentary Secretary has put forward, that the person purchasing a packaged foodstuff which he subsequently discovers is underweight can take the matter up with the manufacturer, is no good.  The ordinary citizen has not the mental equipment, has not the experience, the expertise, to undertake that sort of process.  He <Col N="226" /> will not bother.  He will say &ldquo;leave it be&rdquo;.  The Parliamentary Secretary is diverting the argument by introducing that as a remedy.</P>
      <P>This section 14 is concerning itself with a very specific requirement, a requirement that in a particular type of establishment this facility, this amenity, this safeguard would be available to the general public&mdash;the provision of a scales.  The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the case of a retail outlet which would sell one or two items of food and he suggests they should not be compelled to have a scales because they are selling only one or two items.  Surely the right approach there on our part as legislators would be that, if only one or two items are involved, that places no great onus on them in regard to a weighing scales and they could cut out the one or two items causing the problems rather than we cut out the weighing scales which is there as a safeguard for the general public.  I do not accept that argument.  Weights and measures legislation and regulations are there to protect the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says packaged foodstuffs are checked at the point of manufacture but many things could happen between the point of manufacture and the retail outlet. Alterations and adjustments could be made&mdash;not necessarily by the retailer; he could be perfectly innocent&mdash;along the line.  I remember a very notorious case in my own constituency where packaged goods&mdash;they were not foodstuffs&mdash;were interfered with between the manufacturing outlet and the point of sale.  The Parliamentary Secretary should not close his eyes to the desirability of this provision.  The provision was made originally to put matters beyond doubt.  Very often it is a useful justification for the retailer to be able to say to his customer: &ldquo;If you do not think it is correct come over to the scales and we will find out&rdquo;.  I want to express a very real doubt as to the desirability of making the amendment.  I will not readily accept that there are any outlets on such a small scale of operation that those operating them should not be compelled <Col N="227" /> to have some sort of scales on the premises.</P>

      <P>In page 9, subsection (1), line 40, before &ldquo;prevent&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, without reasonable cause,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 15 provides that a person shall <Col N="228" /> not be prevented from entering a premises for the purposes of doing price comparisons.  Carrying out price comparisons can be a useful service to the public or to an individual before making a decision.  However, we have decided in this amendment to ensure that the person who is allowed to enter the premises without any obstruction by the owner shall be protected by the section only if he is doing so with reasonable cause.  This amendment is as a result of representations from the Dublin Chamber of Commerce who feared that the protection of section 15 might be used by undesirable persons who had no reasonable cause but were just loitering in the premises and would seek the protection of the section to justify their continued presence on the premises.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley in amendment No. 38 seeks to confine the section to premises other than licensed premises. In the case of licensed premises there is obviously a particular reason for the owner being anxious to prevent people creating a nuisance by staying on the premises and it is possible such persons could claim the protection of section 15 as a justification for their staying there by saying they were simply there to compare prices.  I believe amendment No. 37 will meet the problem adequately in relation to licensed premises.  I believe it goes far enough.  To exclude such premises altogether would not be desirable because <i>bona fide</i> price comparison studies might possibly be carried out in relation to licensed premises as well as in relation to other forms of retail sales.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The important thing about insertions such as this is to make sure they are made in the right place. First of all, I quarrel with the new form of words which will prevail if the Parliamentary Secretary's amendment is made.  It would be much more elegant if the words to be inserted, that is, &ldquo;without reasonable cause&rdquo; were inserted after &ldquo;prevent&rdquo; and not after &ldquo;not&rdquo;.  The section would then read:</P>
      <P>A person shall not prevent, without reasonable cause, another person . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="229" /> As the Parliamentary Secretary proposes to insert the words after &ldquo;not&rdquo;, the section would then read:</P>
    <P>A person shall not, without reasonable cause, prevent . . .</P>
    <P>It is not, as I say, a matter of great moment.  The Parliamentary Secretary's amendment is otherwise quite acceptable from my point of view and is a necessary safeguard for premises in general.  One of the particular reasons why one would welcome the Parliamentary Secretary's amendment is that in these days when we have this modern problem of fire bombs and so on, it is a very necessary safeguard that the Parliamentary Secretary should insert these words.</P>
    <P>Leaving that aside, I think there is still a very good case to be made for Deputy O'Malley's amendment. Licensed premises are fundamentally different places from normal commercial outlets.  A person in a licensed premises consumes the goods sold on the premises.  There is that fundamental difference.  That does not normally apply in other cases.  Therefore, the general provisions of section 15 should not apply to licensed premises, as Deputy O'Malley's amendment would succeed in achieving.  The type of person who would be frequenting, remaining in, hanging around, if you like, a licensed premises is potentially an entirely different type of person from the sort of person who would normally be involved in the operation of section 15.  While accepting the Parliamentary Secretary's amendment, we should still make Deputy O'Malley's amendment as well.</P>

If a person is loitering on the premises and is not staying there solely for the purpose and for the time necessary to make a price <Col N="230" /> comparison, then he is remaining there without reasonable cause and under this provision the owner is perfectly entitled to put him off the premises anyway.</P>

      <P>I wonder does the Parliamentary Secretary realise the position that a publican is put in.  All kinds of undesirable people who are banned from licensed premises and for very good reason will now seek to enter them for the purpose of allegedly fulfilling their rights under the section. That is an undesirable position for a publican or a hotelier to maintain.  The power that he had up to now to maintain what one would call an orderly house is undermined by this.  These people can come along and say they are reading price lists or that they are there under some other pretext and nothing can be done about it.  The very presence of them even for a very short period could cause a good deal of distress to patrons of the hotel or publichouse or lounge in question and cause potentially a considerable loss of business for the publican who might resent very much being forced by the section to allow them admittance although they might have been barred from his premises for a number of years.</P>

      <P>It would be for a court to decide eventually whether or not there was reasonable cause.  The publican or hotelier, or anyone else for that matter, cannot arbitrarily or unilaterally decide that he has reasonable cause.  The question of whether or not there is reasonable cause to exclude him is something that might well be disputed by the person coming in seeking to exercise his rights under <Col N="231" /> section 15.  There might well be an unseemly row in which damage is done to the premises or in which blows are struck and people are injured.  It might be a matter that would have to be decided by a court a month or three months later as to whether the hotelier or publican had reasonable cause for trying to exclude an undesirable person.  The court might well decide that, although that man was barred because of an incident that happened two or three years ago, the hotelier concerned no longer had reasonable cause to exclude him.  It would give rise to a very difficult situation with a great deal of unpleasantness, which in my view is quite unnecessary and would be prevented by the acceptance of this amendment, which would simplify the matter, put it beyond any doubt and prevent the undesirable behaviour which inevitably would be caused by the terms of section 15 even with the Parliamentary Secretary's amendment which was apparently put in in response to mine&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in an effort to meet the problem that my amendment brought to light.  However, it does not do it satisfactorily.  Simply to say that he can put him out with reasonable cause is not sufficient.  The onus would be on the publican to show there was reasonable cause, and it is a matter that would be debated in a court afterwards. The court would have to decide whether or not there was, and if injuries are caused or assaults take place in the course of the publican trying to exercise what he regards as reasonable cause in putting the man out, then the question of whether or not the assault was lawful or unlawful will hinge around whether the publican or hotelier, or indeed other shopkeepers possibly, had or had not reasonable cause in seeking to exclude the man.  The Parliamentary Secretary's amendment does not solve that problem and, I am afraid, will only encourage certain people who want to create trouble in a hotel or publichouse to go in and act in a manner that will cause distress to the <Col N="232" /> owner of the premises and to many of the customers, particularly women, who may be very upset at the possibility of a physical row breaking out and of unseemly conduct of various kinds taking place in their immediate vicinity.</P>

      <P>I am anxious that the work of a publican in maintaining order in his premises should be made as easy as possible and I recognise that problems can arise of a sort which are peculiar to publichouses and which would not occur in other types of retail premises.  Therefore, on reflection of the point put forward, I am prepared to accept the amendment. However, I reserve the right to introduce an amendment to the amended section on Report Stage, perhaps confining this exemption to cases where the publican had displayed at or near the door of the premises a price list which may be specified so that genuine price comparison can be made.  We already have the type of price list required by law anyway in respect of publichouses and it would not be very difficult to provide these at the entrances to publichouses.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 40:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (1), line 3, to add:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and any such authorised officer shall be a full-time civil servant or full-time local authority official&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason for this amendment is to prevent a situation whereby a part-time employee, of a local authority particularly, would be given the right to exercise the powers of authorised officers under this section.  The powers as set out in subsection (3) are very extensive indeed.  They are similar to the sort of powers the Revenue Commissioners have.  The exercise of such extensive powers to inquire into the very private affairs of citizens should not be exercised otherwise than by people who are full-time employees of the State or full-time employees or officials of a local authority and who are responsible and answerable to their superiors, the city or county manager in the case of a local authority, or the secretary of a Department or a Minister in the case of a Department, and who could be disciplined in the way that full-time officials can be disciplined if they breach in any way the secrecy or privacy of the individual concerned and if they abuse in any way the powers that are given to them. The powers under subsection (3) of this section are very extensive.  The section states that an officer may:</P>
      <P>(a)  at all reasonable times enter premises at which any trade or business or any activity in connection with a trade or business is carried on and inspect the premises and any goods on the premises and, on paying or making tender of payment therefor, take any of the goods,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="235" /> (b)  require any person who carries on such trade, business or activity and any person employed in connection therewith to produce to the officer any books, documents or records relating to such trade, business or activity which are in that person's power or control and give him such information as he may reasonably require in regard to any entries in such books, documents and records,</P>
    <P>(c)  inspect and copy or take extracts from such books, documents and records,</P>
    <P>(d)  require any such person to give to the officer any information the officer may require in regard to the persons carrying on such trade, business or activity (including, in particular, in the case of an unincorporated body of persons, information in regard to the membership thereof and of its committee of management or other controlling authority) or employed in connection therewith,</P>
    <P>(e)  require any such person to give to the officer any other information which the officer may reasonably require in regard to such activity.</P>
    <P>The difficulty which one sees immediately is that many local authorities have part-time employees who may devote only a few hours a week to this work on behalf of local authorities and who otherwise are ordinary members of the community who may have personal vendettas or personality clashes with their neighbours and who might use their powers as authorised officers for an improper purpose to embarrass somebody whom they did not get on with or for some other invalid reason. This difficulty would not arise with full time officials and in the case of the Department or the civil service the officials would be full time anyway, so no change is proposed by this amendment in practice in that respect.  In the case of a great majority of local authorities the officials who would be designated or authorised under this section would be full time too.  County Councils have a lot of part time employees <Col N="236" /> in various capacities, as have health boards and other local authorities, and it would be inappropriate and liable to cause difficulty if such part time employees were given the rights and very extensive powers of authorised officers under this section.</P>
    <P>I will have quite a bit to say later on about the extent of the powers of authorised officers, but assuming that they go through as they are, it is not appropriate that part time officials should have the right to exercise those powers.  It will not affect the great majority of local authorities because in practice they appoint full time people. The difficulty about a part time employee who does only a few hours a week in a local authority is that the ultimate sanction of firing him for abusing his powers does not count for very much in the case of someone who may only be in receipt of a small allowance and his career is in no sense affected.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, one can discipline a full time official much more thoroughly with the ultimate threat of dismissing him from his job for the abuse of powers.  That would be a very serious matter for a full time official because his whole career would be gone.  This is a sanction that would only be exercised as a last resort in any event but at least it is there.  There is no real sanction against part time officials and that is why the extensive powers here should be confined.  In practice those powers will be confined in nearly all cases to full time people but it should be spelt out here.  I am not saying that they would have to be full time on a particular job as authorised officers.  They could do other work for the local authority as well but they should not be appointed as authorised officers unless they are already in the full time employment of the local authority or Department concerned.</P>

      <P>It has always been the intention that all people involved in the exercise of these powers should be full time officials.  I can see no objection to giving the additional protection which is sought in the amendment and providing that that shall be such by statute.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 41:</P>
      <P>In page 10, after line 38, to add a subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  The powers conferred in subsection (3) of this section may only be exercised where the Minister, the Director or the authorised officer concerned has reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence under the Acts or this Act. has been or is being, committed&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to add a subsection to this section.  It would be subsection (5) and it would read that the powers conferred in subsection (3) which are set out there very extensively and to which I referred briefly in the course of my remarks on the last amendment which was accepted may only be exercised where the Minister, the director or the authorised officer concerned has reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence under the Acts or this Act has been or is being committed. The reason for this amendment is that as the matter stands an authorised officer, who was potentially badly disposed towards an individual, could arbitrarily go into a premises and inspect the records of the business and ask questions on spec.  He would need no grounds for suspicion or for seeking to try to investigate an alleged or believed breach of some provision of this Bill.  He could simply go in and say that because he is an authorised officer under section 16 of the Consumer Information Act, 1977, he is entitled to ask for the production of records for inspection. If the person in question does not produce the books, he commits an offence under subsection (4) and could be fined a substantial sum or possibly in certain circumstances he could be jailed.  That is quite wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even a garda does not have that power.  If a garda is about to arrest someone he can only do so if he has reasonable cause.  There is nothing here about the officer having reasonable cause.  He can go in as I have described in the hope of finding something as a result of his search.  The vast majority of authorised officers or people who will be authorised would not go in unless they had reasonable <Col N="238" /> grounds to suspect that an offence had been committed but particularly in rural areas this could be done for a vindictive purpose.  The making of an inspection of this kind without reason is wrong and an authorised officer should have no more power than a garda in similar circumstances.  The Garda have not the right to arrest someone out of the blue.  They must have a warrant as a result of sworn information to a district justice or a peace commissioner or else they must have reasonable cause to suspect that somebody had committed a felony, was about to commit a felony or is in the process of committing a felony. We heard all of this at great length on a number of Bills of a security nature or of an anti-subversive nature in this House&mdash;one within the past nine months, another at the end of 1972 and another in 1971.  All the questions of the powers of the Garda to arrest without warrant and so on were gone into in great detail.</P>
    <P>The right of an officer to go in and inspect all the books and records can be no less traumatic from the point of view of the person whose books and records are being taken away and examined than it is for someone who is arrested without a warrant.  In a matter of this kind, I do not think an authorised officer should have the power to go in and inspect arbitrarily, or unilaterally or, as I put it, on spec. At the very least he should have reasonable cause or reasonable grounds, as I suggest in this amendment, for suspecting that an offence under the Acts or under this Act has been or is being committed.</P>
    <P>We are not dealing with subversives here.  We are dealing with people who allegedly put in a misleading advertisement, or people who allegedly did not comply with an order to label their goods properly.  For example, if an order was made that the contents of a tin of goods should be set out on the tin and if there were ten different contents and the man only set out nine, or something of that kind, he might have committed an offence under the law, but it could not be called a heinous crime calling out to Heaven for vengeance.  It is a <Col N="239" /> technical matter and we should see it in that context.</P>
    <P>We should not give these extraordinarily excessive powers to officials of local authorities to be exercised any time they see fit.  They should be able to show they had some reasonable cause.  They must have some reason to suspect the person.  Therefore, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to accept this amendment also.  It will not hinder the exercise of their power by officials.  It will simply ensure that arbitrary, vindictive, unilateral or speculative raids will not be made and that, before he looks for records and books, the man would have to have some reasonable ground to suspect that something is happening.  Maybe nothing is wrong and the inspection will show nothing is wrong.  That will not matter as long as he has some reasonable grounds for suspicion which he can produce in court afterwards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 40, which I accepted, provides an adequate safeguard against any vindictive use of these powers by officers.  They must now be full-time officers and they will be subject to proper disciplinary procedures in respect of any action they take which is vindictive or unjustified.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the powers in the section as extraordinary.  They are not extraordinary.  In fact, they are exactly the same as the powers provided in section 4 of the Merchandise Marks Act, 1970.  The powers in this section are reproduced from the Merchandise Marks Act, 1970.  There has been no complaint about the effects of those powers in respect of enforcement of that Act. If Deputy O'Malley's amendment were accepted, and an inspection could not be carried out of the premises, using any of these powers, unless an offence was suspected, there would be two problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The director or the authorised officer would have to be able to prove he had reasonable grounds for suspecting an offence, which could be a very difficult process for him and would make inspection very difficult even where he had some grounds, but <Col N="240" /> perhaps not sufficient grounds to satisfy a court, for his suspicion.  He would be inhibited from making any inspection or using any of these powers.  There is a lot to be said for routine inspections of premises in this way.  If one acts solely on the basis of complaints received, and has not the power to make routine inspection of premises to ensure that the provisions of the Act are being complied with, even where complaints are not received, the enforcement of the legislation will be diminished considerably.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, if Deputy O'Malley's amendment were accepted, any visit by an inspector or an authorised officer under this legislation to a particular premises would be taken immediately by any member of the public who saw the authorised officer entering the premises as indicating that the person in question had committed an offence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be taken as that anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is clear that a premises may be entered without necessarily any suspicion of an offence, or that a premises may be entered as part of a normal routine inspection carried out on a regular basis regardless of any suspicion of an offence, there would be no stigma attached to such a visit by an authorised officer.  The section, as it stands, provides a better safeguard for traders from unreasonable suspicion and from adverse comment than it would if Deputy O'Malley's amendment were accepted.  Needless to say the powers will be exercised in a responsible manner, as have been the exactly similar powers conferred in the Merchandise Marks Act, 1970.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>When you come to a thing like this, there is no power conferred on an officer of this kind which was not already conferred in some other Act sometimes as long as 60 or 70 years ago, in this case seven years ago.  If the power is too extensive that, of itself, does not morally validate the powers which may have been conferred by a less vigilant Legislature than this one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> Many people consider the powers of the Revenue Commissioners are far too extensive.  Many people consider the powers of the Garda are far too extensive.  I remember when I was on that side of the House, there was a long debate about allowing the Garda with reasonable cause to arrest without warrant IRA people and other subversives who were virtually in the act of committing serious crimes like murders, and so on.  The view was expressed from the benches now occupied by us but then occupied by the Fine Gael and Labour Parties that, in general, arrest without warrant was quite wrong, that the principle was wrong, and that the powers given to the police were too extensive.</P>
    <P>Where the police are concerned, and where subversion is concerned, we are dealing with serious crimes.  In this matter we are dealing with merchandise marks which do not trouble the conscience of the majority of the people of Ireland at any given time.  The fact that extensive powers may have been granted in the past to combat matters which were not very serious by any normal criteria does not necessarily mean they should remain that way forever. In the past seven years the world has moved on a great deal in its consideration of the extent of the powers which should be given to authorities generally over private individual citizens.</P>
    <P>Many things which were acceptable seven or ten years ago are becoming increasingly unacceptable today.  It no longer suffices to call in aid the fact that there is a precedent, because the rights of individuals are being and should be held in much higher regard today.  Great efforts are being made by people on the international scene to uphold the rights of individuals as against the State.  Criticism is sometimes aimed at people who endeavour to do that.  It is no longer sufficient to say that powers such as this existed in the past.  If we are to use that argument, we might as well say that what has been happening in Russia for the past 60 years justifies what is happening in Russia today, or that what happened in Northern Ireland in 1971 would justify something similar happening <Col N="242" /> there today.  I do not think that is a valid line of reasoning.  Where it is proposed to confer powers of the kind contained in this section, they should be looked at not in the context of the fact that they existed ten or 20 years ago but in the context of whether they are necessary and appropriate in May, 1977.  Many people hold that what might have slipped through ten or 20 years ago should not slip through today and that perhaps the rights of individuals should be more carefully looked at and protected where necessary than may have been the case in the past.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the Parliamentary Secretary's argument that because an officer does not have to have reasonable cause to enter a premises, to take away books and inspect the records that, therefore, the innocent trader is protected and that suspicion would fall on him if an inspection were made only with reasonable cause. It will fall on him anyway whether or not there is reasonable cause.  It would be far more equitable if the inspections allowed under subsection (3) could only be carried out with reasonable cause.</P>

      <P>Obviously if one is seeking to check the accuracy of statements made to the public about individual goods it is necessary that the enforcement authorities should have access to the premises in which these goods are stored or produced so that the process of production, the ingredients or any other relevant matter which has been the subject of a statement to the public by the seller can be checked.  If this power did not exist it would be very difficult to check on whether claims made were <Col N="243" /> true and in this instance, I refer to areas where services may be required after the initial contract.</P>
      <P>The powers in this section reproduce exactly the powers that are in operation under the Merchandise Marks Act, 1970.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating; to my knowledge no problems have been caused by the existence of these powers in force under that Act and I am confident that problems will not be created by the powers in relation to this Bill.  Deputy O'Malley has repeatedly stated that this Bill is very close to the Merchandise Marks Act, 1970.</P>
      <P>Naturally I am concerned that these powers will be exercised in a reasonable manner and with reasonable cause and, while I do not agree with the Deputy's amendment that an offence must be suspected before any of these powers are exercised, I would be prepared to consider an amendment to the effect that the powers may only be exercised with reasonable cause if this is considered between now and Report Stage to provide useful additional protection.</P>

      <P>The words &ldquo;reasonable cause for their exercise&rdquo; instead of the words from &ldquo;grounds&rdquo; onwards would seem to meet the point and I would be happy to agree to that. It is just a question of re-wording it in a slightly different way.  The Parliamentary Secretary is right to agree with me that the powers are so extensive that they should be exercised only where there are reasonable grounds or cause for their exercise.  He made the point that it should be open to the authorised officers of the authorities concerned to make inspections and see if claims being made in advertisements are being complied with, but I suggest it would be enough to see if such claims were complied with if there was a complaint from a member of the public and that it should not be an arbitrary or unilateral action on the part of an authorised officer to go in where there is no complaint.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 42a:</P>
      <P>In page 10, after line 48, to add the following subsection:</P>
      <P>(3) (a) Where a court imposes a fine or affirms or varies a fine imposed by another court for an offence referred to in subsection (1) of this section, it may, at its discretion, on the application (made before the time of such imposition or affirmation) of any person who was summoned as a witness on behalf of the prosecution in the proceedings in which the fine was imposed and who suffered personal injury, loss or damage resulting, wholly or partly, from the offence provide by order for the payment of the amount of the fine or of a specified part of it as compensation in respect of the injury, loss or damage to the person making the application.</P>
      <P>(b) An application shall not lie under paragraph (a) of this subsection in respect of any personal injury, loss or damage if proceedings claiming damages for the injury, loss or damages have been instituted in any court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c) Where the whole or part of a fine imposed under this section is paid to a person pursuant to this subsection and the person is awarded damages by a court in respect of the personal injury, loss or damage to which the payment related, the payment shall be <Col N="246" /> deemed to be in satisfaction of so much of the damages as is equal to the amount of the payment.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Many of the observations on the Bill which have been received have laid particular emphasis on the lack in the Bill as originally drafted of any provision for the payment of compensation to those who have suffered as a result of false or misleading trade descriptions or advertising.  The omission of any such provision was initally intended for the reason that claims for compensation even when arising out of criminal cases are a matter for civil suit and it was felt that there could be problems by providing for civil claims in what was a criminal action.</P>
    <P>However, it must be accepted that people who may be the victims of misleading advertising or misleading trade practices which it is intended to outlaw in this legislation may not have the resources or the time to take a civil action against the person who misled them and, if they do not do so, the seller who has mislead them and can be demonstrated to have done so by virtue of the fact that he will have been successfully prosecuted under this Bill would be able to get away without paying any compensation at all to the person who was injured most by his action, namely the consumer. I believe that this type of situation, namely where a civil action could not normally be taken by the consumer, is particularly likely to arise where the amount of money in question and the value of the goods in question is relatively small, and it is for that purpose, to meet this type of case, particularly where the amount would be so small as not to make it worthwhile for the consumer to seek a remedy through civil process, that this amendment, which will allow in limited cases for a civil claim to be made in the course of the criminal proceedings under this Bill, would be put into effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of amendment No. 43 is much the same as the effect of amendment No. 42a. Amendment No. 42a is very much an <Col N="247" /> afterthought on the part of the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary.  It was put in very recently, months after my amendment No. 43 went in. Amendment No. 43 is much simpler and easier to follow and is much clearer than amendment No. 42a and for that reason must be preferable to it.  Amendment No. 43 reads:</P>
      <P>In page 10, after line 48, to add a subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) A court which finds a person guilty of an offence under the Acts or under this Act shall be entitled, in addition to any penalty imposed under subsection (1) hereof, to order such person to pay civil compensation in such sum as it thinks just to any other person whom it is satisfied has suffered a loss as a result of such offence&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There are certain difficulties and limitations which immediately spring to my mind on reading the Minister's amendment.  The first one is that it applies only where a fine is imposed and it applies only to this extent, that part of a fine instead of to the State in the normal way can be allocated to the injured party.  But, section 17 subsection (1), as it will be when the amendments are made, envisages imprisonment being imposed as a possible penalty, for not more than six months in the case of summary conviction and for not more than two years in the case of conviction on indictment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first weakness that strikes one about the Minister's amendment is that where the more serious cases arise there is no compensation payable.  Obviously it is only in the more serious cases that imprisonment would be imposed in a matter like this.  The great majority of offences that might be committed under this Bill or the earlier Merchandise Marks Act would probably be met by way of a fine, and it would be only in serious cases where serious damage was done to some person or body of persons or class of persons that imprisonment would be imposed, but it is in respect of these very cases, the serious ones, where there is a heavy loss involved <Col N="248" /> or serious injury done, perhaps physical injury or death caused, that it would appear that compensation cannot be given.</P>
    <P>Is it not more equitable and in accordance with the usual practices of our law that a fine is a fine and is imposed because of damage done to the public good, as it were, by a breach of the law but that civil compensation is separate in the sense that it should go direct to the injured party irrespective of what the compensation has been in regard to a criminal prosecution?</P>
    <P>My amendment suggests that in addition to any penalty imposed, whether it be fine or imprisonment, civil compensation should be awarded by the same court.  That is the practice in England since the passing of the Civil Evidence Act, 1972, in which section 1 empowers the court to make a compensation order.  That applies to offences generally.  It does not apply to merchandise marks or trade description offences.  It was very slow in coming into English law and it is even slower coming into Irish law.  It is a concept that has always existed in civil post-Roman law on continental Europe.  It frequently mystifies the average layman that you have to have two separate sets of proceedings.  If someone does something which is a criminal or a statutory offence and he is prosecuted and the offence caused damage or loss to another individual, that individual has to go back when the criminal proceedings are over and start a separate set of civil proceedings.</P>
    <P>You do not have that on the Continent. You never had.  The court always had power to compensate the injured party if it were satisfied it was proper and appropriate that he should be compensated.  They have that now in England.  All my amendment seeks is to establish that principle in relation to this Bill and in relation to the Merchandise Marks Acts generally.  It is very limited, but I cannot do any more in the context of this Bill because a wider amendment would be out of order.  The Minister's amendment is confined to cases where a fine is imposed and, if a fine is not imposed, there is no compensation.  This rather long <Col N="249" /> amendment of the Minister's was put in belatedly to meet the point I made.</P>
    <P>The second point that strikes me is that it is only the offences referred to in subsection (1) that are covered and all offences under this Bill and the other Acts are not covered because subsection (1) covers only the case of a person guilty of an offence under this Act and such offences as involve trade descriptions under the Merchandise Marks Acts.  Offences that do not involve trade descriptions are not covered and there can be no compensation.  The Parliamentary Secretary's amendment is a kind of easy way out for someone who is convicted and fined, because the fine is imposed, but the State has to pay all or part of that fine to the injured party in compensation for the injured party's loss.  It will suit those who break the law in this respect very much better to have a situation where, if they are fined, part or all of the fine will go to compensate the injured party, and the injured party has no other rights against them.  If the fine were small, something in the region of £10, and the injured party has suffered £1,000 loss, all he can get is the £10 fine and he will be owed £990. There is nothing he can do about it.</P>
    <P>My amendment is succinct and covers all the instances involved.  It ensures the injured party will be fully and properly compensated.  It applies to all offences under the Merchandise Marks Act and under this Bill.  It is very doubtful, as I see it, if a breach of the Merchandise Marks Acts necessarily gives the right to a civil remedy. Frequently it does not.  One of the reasons is that the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, is grossly out of date and the kind of remedies it allows frequently preclude a proper remedy for the kind of activity one should seek to discourage on the part of some traders who are not as principled as they might be.  The kind of protections given in the 1893 Act are no longer appropriate in 1977.  A different type of protection is needed, and the fact that an offence has been committed does not necessarily give rise to the presumption that a civil wrong, or tort, or breach of contract has been committed.  It frequently may not be <Col N="250" /> committed and the injured party has no right of action.</P>
    <P>The proper way to meet that situation would be for the court to have the right to order whatever compensation is appropriate for the injury suffered as a result of the wrongful action of the defendant.  That power is there in England in all matters under section 1 of the Civil Evidence Act, 1972, and it is something which should be introduced here.  It would do away with the unnecessary prolongation of litigation in respect of the one set of facts or the one misdeed. My amendment is broader and simpler and easier to operate than the Minister's very long amendment, which is rather arbitrary in the things it excludes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble with the Deputy's amendment is that it is entirely unlimited in regard to the way in which it could be exercised.  Take the situation where an individual is prosecuted for a criminal offence and a small fine is imposed; numbers of people who had nothing to do with the initial proceedings could turn up at court and claim similar compensation. The situation could arise that, in the implementation of this amendment, a person who was deemed to be worthy only of a fine for a criminal offence of, say, £10, could in that criminal proceedings find virtually out of the blue that a civil claim was brought by a whole lot of people who were not involved prior to the hearing of the court itself.  In the same proceedings 40 or 50 people who had not been involved, who had turned up at the court and claimed to have been injured by the practice in question, might get civil compensation amounting perhaps to £100 each.  That would be far in excess of the amount which for the criminal offence the court had decided was justified in terms of a fine.  I believe this unlimited scope of Deputy O'Malley's amendment, unlimited both as to the amount of civil damages which may be granted in what is essentially a criminal proceeding and unlimited as to the number of people who may claim civil remedy and the time by which they may come forward with a claim, render the <Col N="251" /> amendment impractical.  I believe also that there are serious grounds for believing it would be unconstitutional, in the sense that a person may suddenly out of the blue find himself in jeopardy not just for a criminal offence but for a whole raft of civil claims for which he may not have been properly prepared in going into court.  He may just be prepared for the criminal offence and could claim that such civil awards being granted in that proceeding against him was an unconstitutional proceeding.  There is serious danger that this provision and the exercise of this provision would be found to be unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley said difficulty would be encountered where imprisonment was the penalty chosen for the criminal offence rather than a fine. That is true, but in cases where imprisonment&mdash;and these would be very rare cases, I believe&mdash;was decided by the court to be the appropriate penalty, it would be likely that the amount of which the injured party had been deprived by the action of the seller would be quite large.  If the amount was large and the case was good, there is no reason at all why civil action in the normal way might not be taken and would not be taken by the injured party.</P>
      <P>My amendment seeks to deal with cases where the amount of money would be so small that a civil action with all the expenses it involves would not be worth while.  It is drafted in such a way as to be effectively confined to such cases, which I believe are the cases in relation to which a procedure of this nature is necessary.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's reply is simply on the basis that too many people could be compensated, that perhaps most or all of the injured parties could be compensated under my amendment.

Surely he must agree that those who are injured by an action which is an offence under these Acts should be compensated civilly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The existence of loss or damage is in itself a civil wrong&mdash; that is a great statement of law.  In other words, all you would have to do is to get hurt and you can automatically recover damages.  That may be the law of some other lands in regard to certain things but it is not the law of this land.  You cannot recover damages simply because you suffer injury, damage or loss.  There must be a breach of your civil rights.  The person who injured you must have done so by way of tort or by way of breach of contract.  If he does so otherwise, you have no right to recover.  That is <Col N="253" /> a fundamental part of the law of this land.</P>
      <P>What gives rise to the right of compensation here under 42a is not, as the Parliamentary Secretary alleges, the existence of a civil wrong; it is, as he quoted and as I quote now, the commission of an offence under the Merchandise Marks Acts or this Bill. There are many offences under this Bill and under the Merchandise Marks Acts, which are not civil wrongs.  There is nothing in our civil law, for example, about marking orders on goods or about advertising orders or definition orders.  The breach of these orders is not a breach of our civil law and is not a civil wrong.  The question of misleading advertising is not as it is here, that where there is misleading advertising there is an offence on the civil side; there has to be actual misrepresentation which is not innocent and which causes loss, and which is far less extensive than the provisions of this Bill.  The definitions, for example, of false trade descriptions here in this Bill are infinitely wider and more extensive than the kind of misrepresentations which would give rise to civil compensation or a right to civil compensation, for example, under the Sale of Goods Act of 1893.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, if he is going to insist on this amendment, is therefore excluding a very large number of people, because the only people who will be entitled to compensation, no matter how seriously they are injured or damaged, will be those who will be called by the prosecution as witnesses in a criminal case.  Only one person may be called in these circumstances, but there might be 50 people seriously damaged or injured by a particular act which is an offence under these Acts.  Fifty people who perhaps are seriously ill as a result of eating something which was a breach of a marking order might go to the Director of Consumer Affairs or the local authority or the Minister to complain and to say: &ldquo;Please bring a prosecution against this man who sold it and have him dealt with by the courts, and we are now giving notice that we want to apply for compensation as well for the injury which we suffered.&rdquo;.  If the director or the local <Col N="254" /> authority takes proceedings the prosecution need call only one man to prove that, because that is all that is necessary.  The court will not hear any more if it is satisfied that the evidence of one man established that an offence did exist, unless the prosecution want to take separate proceedings in respect of the whole 50 offences and call them all, but that would be very unusual.  If they call only one then only the one who is called as a witness by the prosecution is entitled to compensation and the other 49 who are there to back him up, as it were, get nothing.  That is quite unfair and quite arbitrary, because there will be all sorts of accusations afterwards by the 49 who did not get compensation that there was favouritism shown in the case of the prosecution witness, that he got £1,000 compensation for his injuries and that the rest of them are whistling and getting nothing.</P>
    <P>My amendment does not mean that everyone who seeks compensation is going to get it.  The amendment states:</P>
    <P>A court . . . shall be entitled . . . to order such person&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is the defendant</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;to pay civil compensation in such sum as it thinks just to any other person whom it is satisfied has suffered loss as a result of such offence</P>
    <P>The only way that the court can be satisfied is by evidence being given, not necessarily by a prosecution witness, but the people concerned would have to come in and give evidence on oath.  If there were 50 people injured or damaged by a particular action of a defendant then those 50 people should be allowed to come in, make their application and give evidence that they were injured or whatever it is.  As it stands in the Parliamentary Secretary's amendment, only one of them or the small number who are called by the prosecution as witnesses would be able to get compensation. That is very unfair.  There may be cases where a large number of people are injured or otherwise suffer loss or damage, and the Parliamentary Secretary seems to imply that if there is a large number it would be unfair to the defendant to compensate them <Col N="255" /> all.  That is not right.  If he injures a large number of people he should have to compensate them.  He may not be able to do it, but it is their hard luck if he becomes bankrupt or goes into liquidation.</P>
    <P>I point out again that it is not sufficient under Irish law to suffer injury in order to be entitled to civil compensation.  It has to be actionable. It has to be, therefore, either a tort or an actionable breach of contract, and there are a huge number of offences under this Bill and under the Merchandise Marks Acts of 1897 to 1970 which are not actionable offences under civil law and which, therefore, do not in themselves give rise to a right to compensation.  The only right which the injured people would have in a huge number of instances is the right under this amendment to apply for or seek that compensation as part of the criminal or statutory or summary proceedings taken against the defendant.  That is the way they do it in almost every other country in the world except Britain and Ireland, and the British have now brought in this concept in 1972.  We still have not got it.  I tried to introduce it in respect of this, but unfortunately it has been so totally confined now by what the Parliamentary Secretary seeks to do in his amendment that it will be of use in practice to only one person in respect of each offence committed even though there may be 50 people injured or otherwise damaged by that offence.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary surely will agree that it is desirable that those who are injured would have the right to be awarded compensation, but not in a slot-machine fashion by just getting up and saying they are injured.  They would have to satisfy a court and the court would order such a sum as it thought just to be paid to any person whom it is satisfied has suffered loss.  Those words imply the court is making a judicial decision.  The court can be satisfied about the facts only after hearing evidence on oath.  Therefore that presupposes that that evidence would be given, but not necessarily given <Col N="256" /> only by a prosecution witness where one witness may be enough to prove an offence even though there were 50 people injured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Carrying through criminal proceedings against people for breaches of this legislation would be rendered very difficult indeed if an unlimited number of people could virtually walk in off the side of the street to any court which was bringing a criminal case against a party who has put out a particular advertisement and claim there and then under oath that they had been injured.  In respect of each one of these claims, the number of which would be quite unlimited, the defendant would have to put forward rebutting evidence.  In effect the criminal case would be dwarfed by an unlimited number of people coming in and making civil claims in the middle of these proceedings and the cases would go on for a very long time and the enforcement of the criminal law in court in this area of law would become virtually impossible.  There is a need to limit this resort to persons who are directly involved, namely the witnesses.</P>
      <P>The Deputy claimed that there was some discrimination involved, in that only witnesses would benefit under this provision.  The situation is that people who are not witnesses still have the remedy open to them that they had in normal civil law.  The person who is a witness and does get an award under this provision in my amendment will have the amount of any award deducted from any civil award he might get through the normal civil processes otherwise, which is not the case with people who do not get this award in a criminal hearing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is still under the misapprehension that if someone suffers loss that person would have a right of action in civil law.  Until such time as I can disabuse him of that misapprehension he is not going to understand the difficulties he is creating. The suffering of loss, damage or injury does not give rise in Irish law <i>per se</i> to a right to compensation in civil <Col N="257" /> law.  The reason the Department decided to put in this amendment in reply, as it were, to mine which had been put in three or four months earlier&mdash;I suppose there was a political objection on the part of the Minister to accepting an amendment from me, and therefore he tried to put it in a different and much more confined form&mdash;is that there is not a civil right or remedy for dealing with these matters.  If what the Parliamentary Secretary thinks is the case, that injury, loss or damage gives right to a civil remedy, there would be no need for this.  Everybody who wanted to could take that civil action.  It is precisely because there is not that right that it is necessary to put in this.</P>
      <P>The other reason is that it prevents duplication of litigation.  It is desirable in Ireland, as in nearly every other country in the world, that there should be only one case about a particular thing and it should not be necessary, as it is in Ireland and was in Britain until 1972, to take two series of actions, because the only people who are gaining by that are lawyers.  The public, the injured parties and even the offending party are losing by it.  The offender is paying on the double.  He is paying his own and his opponent's civil costs the second time.  In France, Germany and most of the American States they have one hearing and they dispose of the matter.  There is now power in England to do that.  Why should we be so behind all the time and be so foolish that we still insist on two law cases, two sets of litigation, about one event?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If somebody drives a motor car very recklessly, for example, and knocks down and injures someone very seriously, he will be charged with dangerous driving causing serious bodily harm.  The case will be fought out in the Circuit Court normally before a judge and jury for perhaps one, two or three days and all the ins and outs of the case will be gone into in great detail and at the end of that the jury will decide whether or not the defendant is guilty of the offence with which he is charged.  If the person is found guilty the judge will impose a penalty that seems appropriate or just. <Col N="258" /> When all of this is over the whole thing starts again and the injured party must again start proceedings, against someone who has been found guilty of a serious criminal offence with a high degree of proof, if the man or his insurance company denies liability. In other countries the whole lot is done together.  It is much more sensible.  The injured party gets compensation at an early period.  There is no terribly long delay, and all the expense that our method involves. We have a farcical situation here, that for an ordinary simple case of running down and personal injury being caused, it is necessary to employ four senior counsel, two on each side, two junior counsel, one on each side, and two solicitors, one on each side.  That amounts to eight lawyers for a simple everyday thing like a motor car running into a pedestrian, a cyclist or another motorist.  Eight lawyers spend two or three years trying to fix the compensation for the injured party, and that three-year period would not even begin until after the criminal proceedings have finished.  It is wrong for the Parliamentary Secretary to argue to perpetuate that kind of situation. Let us do what other countries do and be sensible about it and not have all this nonsense where the only beneficiaries are the lawyers.  Let us get things over with together.</P>
    <P>This case is different to a running down case, where there is the civil tort of negligence that gives rise to a right of compensation.  In the instances to which we refer, because our law is so out of date in relation to consumer protection, there is no civil remedy available to the injured party in many of these breaches of these Acts, and therefore it is quite wrong for the Parliamentary Secretary to say that if they do not get compensation in the criminal case they can take civil action.  They cannot take civil action. They have no right to take the action, and the right of action in the Parliamentary Secretary's amendment is given not because there has been a breach of a civil right, not because there has been a civil wrong done, or a breach of contract committed, but it arises simply from the fact that an <Col N="259" /> offence under these Acts was committed.</P>
    <P>It is not because of a civil wrong but because an offence has been committed. It is not even every offence, but only offences referred to in subsection (1). If the Parliamentary Secretary looks at the offences set out in subsection (1) he will see that it only relates to this Bill and to offences under the Acts involving trade descriptions, but it does not apply to offences under the Merchandise Marks Act generally.  I do not know why that should be so, but that will be the result of the Parliamentary Secretary's amendment, if passed.  It will give rise to serious injustice and to arbitrary compensation for particular individuals and the total absence of compensation for others who may have been more seriously injured by offence concerned.  The Parliamentary Secretary should not press his amendment, which will obviously cause a great deal of difficulty, unfairness, inequality and inequity, but should accept the much simpler and broader amendment that I put down many months before his amendment was put down, to the effect that anyone who was injured as a result of the offence concerned and who satisfies the court that he was so injured and that he suffered loss that can be measured in financial terms will be awarded compensation by the defendant or the offending party in such amount as the court in all the circumstances, having heard both sides, deems just.  It is perfectly simple, and that is the way it is done everywhere else.  There is no reason why it would not work here.  It should be given a chance to work.</P>
    <P>Nearly everyone who commented on this Bill commented that the primary fault in it was that it created a whole new series of offences that traders, advertisers and others could commit but it gave no right of compensation to those injured.  Because of these comments and because of the fact that I put down an amendment giving that right of compensation, the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister came along months afterwards and put down this rather laborious amendment that we are now discussing, to give a <Col N="260" /> very limited right in certain circumstances in respect of some offences but not others, to some people but not to the great majority of people who were damaged, and to confine the amount of compensation to an amount that would not exceed the amount of the fine, and to give no right of compensation at all in very bad cases where the court felt it appropriate to impose a term of imprisonment.  I have never seen a more unsatisfactory amendment. We would be much better off without this altogether, so that there would be no right of compensation, rather than to have the terribly limited and terribly arbitrary right of partial compensation that is given to a small proportion of injured people by the Parliamentary Secretary's proposed amendment.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary on reflection to withdraw this amendment and to agree to amendment No. 43.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may consider that he has dealt with them, but he is the only one who so considers.  I have heard nothing from the Parliamentary Secretary to contradict this.  It is there in black and white, there is no compensation in a bad case where there is <Col N="261" /> imprisonment, but if it is not a bad case there is.  The compensation is limited to those who are called by the prosecution to give evidence.  The other 50 or 100 people who may be far more seriously injured get nothing by way of compensation.  The fact that there is no civil remedy for many of these offences does not concern the Parliamentary Secretary at all.  He is under the misapprehension that Irish law allows a remedy where there is an injury and that it is not confined to a civil wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an absolutely ludicrous amendment.  It does nothing at all of any value for the injured consumer because perhaps only one in 50, or one in 100, will get compensation in a particular instance.  Then their compensation is limited to the amount of the fine involved.  A justice or a judge might well take the view that, from <Col N="262" /> a criminal point of view, the matter was not too serious and could be met by a £5 or £10 fine, but that from a civil point of view it was very serious, and that there should be £1,000 compensation because the man had to get half his stomach removed due to being poisoned, or something like that.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the Parliamentary Secretary is prepared to agree by default that this amendment of his has all these very serious defects and just force it through by weight of numbers.  There are shades of Bula about this at the moment.  Unfortunately, the Parliamentary Secretary is learning from his master although, God knows, he does not see him very often because he spends most of his time on the other side of the world.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 17, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not attempt to discuss again Deputy O'Malley's amendment but it seems to me that the Parliamentary Secretary, in not accepting the amendment, has missed an opportunity of making a very significant, far-reaching and beneficial change in our legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the section as it stands now is in conformity with the standard practice of our legislation governing matters of this sort with, perhaps, the difference that a court can now take into consideration, in deciding on the level of a penalty, any action which might have been taken by the defendant by way of corrective advertising. This is an improvement, but one would have liked to see the section going a great deal further.  It would be a very effective impediment to false <Col N="267" /> or misleading advertisements if the person inserting such advertisements would be liable to pay compensation for any damage that might have been caused.  The section now is entirely punitive.  It simply has the effect of ensuring that anybody who transgresses by way of having resort to misleading advertisements will be punished by way of being ordered to make a contribution to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>One wonders whether, in this day and age, this is going far enough.  As I have said already, advertising today is a very powerful medium.  The techniques which have been developed and the methods used can have tremendous impact on the public mind and consciousness.  It is vital in terms of the general well-being and welfare of the community that this powerful and relatively new medium which is at the disposal of commercial interests be controlled rigidly and carefully. This Bill goes a certain way towards the establishment of some such control, but we must recognise that the people who use unscrupulously the power of advertising and without caring whether they cause damage to others, should be prevented by every means possible from engaging in such conduct.  In many cases fines at the levels set out in section 17 May not be of any great significance to such people when compared with the benefits they may gain from their advertising campaigns.</P>
    <P>Modern thinking on these matters is pushing us towards a new approach, an approach which would demand that where an advertiser recklessly or without due consideration inflicted damage on a member of the public or a section of the public that he should directly compensate the person or persons so damaged.  The Parliamentary Secretary is missing an opportunity by not availaing of this new type of legislation to incorporate this new principle into legislation.</P>
    <P>He could resort to a device I used when I was bringing in legislation dealing with negligence generally.  I wanted to correct a situation which had prevailed for decades whereby a local authority could not be sued in respect of damage arising from nonfeasance&mdash;<Col N="268" /> in other words, if a local authority did not do something and someone was injured as a result of their not doing something the person injured could not sue the local authority.  If a local authority did something negligent and a person was injured as a result of that, that person could sue for damages on the basis of negligence on the part of the local authority because it was a misfeasance on the part of the local authority.  But the law was that a local authority could not be sued because it did not do something.  A simple illustration would be the case of a large hole in a road which the local authority should have repaired and did not repair and someone was injured as a result of driving into that hole. The injured person could not sue the local authority because it was a question of nonfeasance, not misfeasance, and I wanted to remedy that situation and I made provision that the local authority would be liable in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>That proposal was resisted very strongly because it was felt that it was opening the floodgates and would render local authorities liable to an insupportable burden of liability in the same way as the Parliamentary Secretary would maintain he would be opening the floodgates under section 17 if he did what I suggest he should do.  I met the particular dilemma at that time by introducing this reform for a limited period.  I think it was three years.  The provision was expressed to last for a period of three years.  In the interim records would be kept of what happened as a result of the provision. I was successful in having that particular provision accepted on the basis that it was introduced for a temporary period.  As a result of the experience gained during that period the Oireachtas could decide whether to repeal the provision or make it part of permanent legislation.</P>
    <P>That procedure could have been adopted by the Parliamentary Secretary in this case.  Even if he were not prepared to go the whole distance with Deputy O'Malley he could bring in a limited, qualified, restricted, defined provision for an experimental period, operative for three years, and administratively ensure that during that experimental <Col N="269" /> period records would be kept of the damages awarded and, if they turned out to be uncontrollable and insufferable, or intolerable, then naturally the Oireachtas could in its wisdom decide to set aside the provision. If, on the other hand, it turned out to be reasonable and there was no great rush of disastrous judgments then the proposal could be made part of permanent legislation.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would consider something of that nature before he finally wraps up this Bill.  It would be well worth while, because if an innocent member of the general public is put to great loss by reason of an injurious advertisement it is no great consolation to him to know that the person concerned has been fined or even jailed.  One would like something more positive and more concrete by way of compensation to the person who suffered damage.  In all these areas there is a great temptation to play safe and not branch out into new, unknown and undefined territory and I am suggesting this mechanism to the Parliamentary Secretary as a way in which he could, perhaps, attempt something new and do something different and, at the same time, play reasonably safe by introducing the provision for a limited period.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect, and that is that the fines are stated fixed amounts. Nowadays, with inflation galloping on at the rate it is, one would hope that some new mechanism would be found for adjusting the penalties in statutes at regular intervals without re-enacting or amending every statute separately. I notice in this section the fine the District Court can impose is £500.  It is not so long since the Supreme Court fixed £100 as the maximum fine it would regard as within the competence of a District Court to impose. Apart from anything else it shows the way inflation is raging and the way the value of money is falling.</P>
    <P>It is now written into this statute&mdash; and it is probably the first time it has been done&mdash;that the maximum penalty in the District Court can be £500.  I know from experience in other legislation that it is now the view of the Attorney General that £500 is acceptable <Col N="270" /> as the limit of the jurisdiction of the District Court in imposing penalties. Presumably the Attorney General believes that that is the sum which the Supreme Court will find acceptable as the limit.  It represents a significant step forward.  Statistics will show that £100 at the time the Supreme Court gave its decision would now be equivalent to less than £300 so that this statute is going further than would be justified by the fall in the value of money.  I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary has had any advice as to whether that £500 would be acceptable as appropriate to summary conviction.</P>
    <P>However, this does raise a very general question throughout the statutes.  Scattered through all the statutes are specific figures as maximum penalties for different offences.  Sooner or later we will have to get around to having an omnibus piece of legislation which will automatically adjust all these maximum penalties to keep them in line with changes in the value of money.  I would conclude on the section by suggesting to the Parliamentary Secretary that he would consider this idea of introducing a very restrictive, very qualified provision for a limited period to enable the courts to award damages in addition to imposing fines on people who are found guilty of an offence under the provisions of this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to what Deputy Haughey has said.  I have myself considered for some time now that the concept of introducing measures in legislation for a limited period as an experiment is in general a good one and one for which I think there is room in our legislative practice.  However, I do not think it is appropriate in this case. There is a definite difference between the analogy he gave and the situation in this Bill.  In his analogy the parties to suffer detrimentally from the enactment of this experimental provision were public authorities, and I think it is, shall we say, somewhat more acceptable for the Government to introduce experiments which may be to the detriment of other parts of the Government machine, such as local <Col N="271" /> authorities, than it is for the Government to undertake experiments where those who are likely to suffer detrimentally, if anyone is to suffer detrimentally during the course of that experiment, are, as would be the case in this legislation, private individuals. I would not be as inclined therefore to follow Deputy Haughey in what I regard as a generally acceptable concept of an experimental temporary provision in a case such as the one envisaged in this Bill, where those who would suffer if the experiment turned out badly would not be the Government or their agents but private individuals quite independent of the Government.</P>
      <P>I was also interested in what the Deputy had to say about fines.  I have inquired whether it might be possible to provide some means whereby these fines could be kept regularly up to date without the necessity of complete re-enactment of statutes, and I found that this would not be acceptable as a procedure to adopt, that one would need to follow the normal practice of enacting a new penalty section in a full Bill.  However, there is something to be said for the suggestion Deputy Haughey made of perhaps an omnibus penalty Bill which might be introduced from time to time updating all penalties across the whole range of legislation, but of course this is not a matter for which I would have primary responsibility.</P>
      <P>I am happy that the figure of £500 is appropriate and in order in this context and that is because the Bill has been drafted in consultation with the Attorney General's office, including the aspect of the Bill affecting penalties.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to <Col N="272" /> enable officers of local authorities to prosecute for the use of illegal trade descriptions.  At present Dublin Corporation have power to deal with matters under the weights and measures legislation. They also have powers in relation to quantity marking, prescribed sizes and other aspects of this general <i>corpus</i> of legislation which are very similar to the specific matter of the illegal use of trade descriptions.</P>
    <P>It was represented to us by Dublin Corporation that in the course of their operations they found it necessary to take prosecutions for trade descriptions as well as the matters for which they already have competence, and that in the absence of this power the only recourse they had was to the common informer procedure where the inspector who might wish to prosecute in respect of a trade description, while he would be able to prosecute in the normal way as a public authority would have power to prosecute in respect of other matters in the general area of merchandise marks and weights and measures legislation.  It is to extend the powers of Dublin Corporation and other local authorities involved in this field to trade descriptions that we are introducing this amendment.</P>

      <P>We have no objection whatever to this amendment.  I will have something to say about it when we come to the section.  If, as the Parliamentary Secretary says, Dublin Corporation are under a disadvantage at the moment in implementing legislation because of the outmoded procedure which is the only one available to them, then the Parliamentary Secretary is absolutely correct in making this change to extend the power which this Bill gives to the Minister and county councils or corporation officers to institute proceedings for offences under this Bill to the other Acts to which the Parliamentary Secretary has referred. Therefore we have pleasure in agreeing to the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 18 as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In accepting the amendment I said we welcomed it. There will now be power for the Minister <Col N="273" /> or local authority officers to bring proceedings under this Bill when enacted and under the Acts involving trade descriptions.  Should we not consider putting some restriction on the manner in which the council of a county council or the corporation of the county or other borough in which an offence is alleged to have been committed may bring the prosecutions? Does the wording of the section mean that it will have to be one of those full-scale, formal under seal procedures to which local authorities very often have to resort to do anything of significance?  In local Government law there are many old practices and procedures handed down to us which mean that for the simplest thing to be done a great panoply of Acts have to be invoked and seals produced and Lords Mayor and burgesses paraded and all that sort of thing.  Are we in danger of involving ourselves in that sort of situation by using the words: &ldquo;or by the council of a county or the corporation of a county or other borough in which the offence is alleged to have been committed&rdquo;? In other words the section seems to indicate that only the full council or corporation can institute the proceedings. I would have thought that the inspector or an appropriate officer appointed for the purpose would be enabled to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure.  I am not an expert on local authority law but, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, there are certain things which the manager can do as managerial functions and there are certain other things certainly where property is involved, that only the council can do and which have to be done in the name of the council, where resolutions have to be passed and so forth.  I am sounding a warning note.  I am not being dogmatic, but I am wondering if this wording will mean that resolutions of the council and the full panoply of the council would have to be <Col N="274" /> involved.  Elsewhere in the legislation we talk about the officers of these bodies but here we use the words &ldquo;the council&rdquo; or &ldquo;the corporation&rdquo;.  I would have thought that some wording like &ldquo;proceedings in relation to an offence under this Act may be brought and prosecuted by the Minister or by a designated officer of the council&rdquo; would seem to obviate the danger that might be involved in this.  Perhaps I am wrong.  Perhaps there is no problem because this wording may have a certain connotation in local government law which I am not aware of.  It seems to me that it would involve the entire council, or corporation as the case may be, deeply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the problem that the Deputy has mentioned will arise.  I refer him to section 6 (1) of the Merchandise Marks Act, 1970, where the precise wording that we are using here in section 18 (1) of this Bill is used.  It says that proceedings in relation to an offence under that Act may be brought and prosecuted by the Minister or by the council of the county or corporation of the county or borough in which the offence is alleged to have been committed.  I have heard no complaint of any problem in relation to the enforcement of the 1970 Act by the local authorities, who have an active role in this area by virtue of the wording which was used in that Act and which is now being reproduced in this form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary does not entirely reassure me.  The very fact of him going back to that 1970 Act and quoting the words from it reinforces my suspicions about this.  It is quite clear that the wording has simply been lifted out of that other Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Very often these things last for quite a while and it is only when the issue <Col N="275" /> is big enough and what is involved is important enough that it is worth the while of the litigants concerned to test the validity and the legitimacy of the Act.</P>

      <P>In page 11, lines 25 and 26, to delete &ldquo;prove its truth&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;establish that on the balance of probabilities the indication is true&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As it stands, this section places the onus of proof on the defendant in the case of virtually all matters which could be complained of under the Bill where the truth of any indication given is an issue.  This section was included in response to the National Consumers Advisory Council's recommendation, at paragraph 70, chapter 1 of their report, that advertisers should be able to prove the validity of claims made. There has been opposition however, to the Bill and concern has been expressed <Col N="276" /> particularly that conceivably the defendant in this case might have to to prove the facts that he was contending beyond reasonable doubt, which is the burden of proof normally applied in criminal as distinct from civil prosecutions. Therefore, in order to ensure that this unduly heavy burden should not fall on the defendant, it was decided to introduce this amendment. It is probable that in the absence of this amendment it would be the balance of probabilities burden that would have been imposed on the defendant anyway by the courts, but it is desirable to make it perfectly clear by an amendment to the statute that that is what shall be the case.</P>

    <P>(a) increased Garda presence on the streets</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In my contribution yesterday I referred to the possibility of increased garda presence on the streets and increased patrols in suburban areas because of the fact that we have seen such an increase in the crime rate.  I referred to the situation in the Priorswood Estate in Coolock where there were over 62 burglaries within a two-month period.  I also referred to the maintenance of full establishment strength at all city Garda stations, and I quoted from the April <Col N="277" /> edition of the Garda Review, which severely criticised the Minister's lack of response to the urgent need for extra members of the force in the city. As an example of the lack of manpower I referred to Malahide Garda station which caters for about 25,000 people and only has one sergeant and nine gardaí.  There is no detective force there.  As well as catering for 25,000 people the gardaí have to man a protection post for a Justice, which requires two men each day.  There are about two men to man the station. There is a motorcycle and a Garda car in the station but there is no one to use them.  In the station there are reports of 300 break-ins, and twice or three times a week the station has to supervise the use of explosives at Feltrim quarry.  The station also has to deal with 3,000 summonses and about 1,000 warrants.  Surely a Minister for Justice could not come into this House and tell the people that they have adequate cover.  The same situation exists in Swords, where they have three sergeants and 12 gardaí.  At any time there are only two gardaí on any duty.  Santry Station has six sergeants and 20 men dealing with 40,000 people and coping with the same sort of problems.  The same applies to almost any station in the city and county of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that we should be happy that the increase in the crime rate is decreasing, although the crime rate is increasing.  The increase is decreasing from the appalling figure of 18 per cent to what the Minister considers is an acceptable figure, nearly 12 per cent.  None of us accept that that figure should be acceptable to any Government.  If most Ministers for Justice had that figure on their files they would do the honourable thing and resign.  This is supposed to be a law and order Government.  They thought more about law and order that any Government since their predecessors in the 1920s, but they have failed miserably to protect the property rights and civil rights of the people because they have not provided adequate manpower.  The Minister might ask what would Fianna Fáil do?  Personally I would suggest <Col N="278" /> that people convicted of violent crimes of robbery, house breaking and so on should have the money deducted from their salary each week to pay compensation to individuals injured. If the criminal is not working, the money should be deducted from his social welfare payments being paid to him for compensation and his national insurance card should be taken and endorsed the same way as a driving licence.  Years ago it was said that crime did not pay, but we are now faced with a situation where crime pays handsomely.  I believe that this problem will only be solved if the criminal is hit in the pocket.  We must also have extra gardaí.  I feel that my suggestion is worth consideration.  I hope the Minister will comment on this suggestion when replying.</P>
    <P>I will refer once again to the problem in Dublin city.  The city is being taken apart.  On Sunday it was reported in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> that a member of the Canadian Mounted Police had to chase after a young man who had broken into a car and stolen a coat, and even a Mountie, having chased him into a flat, was scared stiff.  Mr. Cooney has been trying to take on the mantle of the great protector of the rights of the people in the city&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity of participating in this debate.  Any Deputy within the confines of Dublin will realise this problem. When I saw the motion I believed this was an opportunity for fruitful discussion. This should be discussed in a reasonable and serious manner.  All we had from the Opposition was haranguing, and making a political football of it, and calling on the Minister to resign.  That does not solve the problem of vandalism.  I was hoping to hear a suggestion from the Opposition as to how it might be solved, but no.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have his opportunity very shortly and he knows the answer he will get from the people.  This is a very serious matter.  I regret the Opposition treated it in such a flippant and irresponsible manner.  The Minister gave figures which showed a reduction in the percentage of crime in certain areas.  He said it was on the increase in other areas.  Deputies on the other side of the House looked aghast and there were denials by one or two Deputies who said these figures could not be correct.  They would not accept that there can be a reduction in crime.  That did not suit their motivation in putting down this motion, but it highlighted their reason for putting it down.  Bring the political football into the arena; lambaste the Minister.  That was their contribution.</P>
      <P>We should ask ourselves what was the reason for the percentage reduction in crime in some areas.  Perhaps we could learn a lesson from it.  Store Street is an area with a high population and there was a decrease there.  One of the reasons for that was that a task force operated there for some time. As far as I am aware, the task force operated in the Coolock area also. Obviously, the task force is successful. I do not suggest we should flood an area with police, but we should look for new approaches.  When more personnel are available, the Minister should have a task force operating on the north side of the river and the south side of the river.  We would then see a dip in the crime figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister or anybody else is satisfied with the decrease in the figures.  We must try to eradicate vandalism, and crimes of violence must be controlled and contained as far as possible.  The task force will pay dividends, but it needs to be expanded. In the next six or eight months we will have another 400 gardaí.  While we are awaiting them, the Minister might consider the question of overtime particularly in the centre city area.  I am not an advocate of overtime. It is not a solution, but there are times when it is essential.  Pending the drafting of the new recruits into the city, perhaps the Minister would <Col N="280" /> have a look at the whole question of overtime and try to get a greater police presence on the streets.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary to have uniformed gardaí patrolling the streets. Many years ago a garda in uniform might have been a deterrent but unfortunately, he is no longer a deterrent.  These people have their grapevine tactics and, when a uniform is seen, they are away and gone.  If we had more plain clothes policemen operating in different areas, this would pay greater dividends.  We should have smaller, unmarked and different types of vehicles.  We must use different approaches to combat the very wily criminals who are among us.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to hear Deputy Burke saying crime pays now.  That is a very irresponsible statement to make in this House.  It should never be made whether or not there is an element of truth in it.  It encourages people to commit crimes if somebody in this House says quite clearly crime pays.  Of course it does not, and this message must go out loud and clear. It will never pay.  It behoves the Minister and the courts to ensure that it does not pay.</P>
    <P>It is important that the punishment should fit the crime.  We have all gone a bit soft.  There seems to be more concern for the offender than the offended.  That attitude must be changed.  The number of elderly people who are subjected to abuse and assault in this city is bad.  People who commit these crimes must be made to pay in full measure.  The courts are independent.  Deputies on this side of the House who are aware of what is going on in their areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They are.  We might have more gardaí available if we used something the Opposition opposed bitterly last year.  In the Border counties the Army can arrest people and hold them for a number of hours. If that were used more widely, more gardaí might be released to operate in the city.  I would ask the Minister in consultation with the Minister for Defence, to use that power as widely as possible.  I represent a south central constituency where there is an increasing amount of crime.  In the Rialto and Dolphin's Barn areas there is quite an amount of vandalism.  A task force operating there for a period of time would have the desirable effect of eliminating it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dowling mentioned catching criminals.  In many cases they are caught, but the problem is that, when they are brought to court, there is no place to keep them in custody.  We must provide a place of custody for hardened young criminals who will not respond to any approach whatsoever. It must be very frustrating for the gardaí when they make an arrest and spend endless hours preparing a case and the judge says: &ldquo;We have no place to put him&rdquo; and he is set free. We should develop institutions to cater for hardened criminals so that they may be removed from the public and not influence young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Greater emphasis should be placed on juvenile liaison officers and the Garda Síochána have a major role to play here.  In my constituency where there are large flat complexes there is a high density of young people and these officers could work with them.  They need not do this as law enforcement officers but as friends who are interested in their welfare.  That is one way of getting to the kernel of this matter.  If young people have to be put away because of their misdeeds it is a little too late to do anything for them. The liaison officers and the Garda Síochána could encourage the young people in sporting activities.  In this way they would win respect for the gardaí which is not always evident in some areas.  We must apply our minds to crime prevention because this is the way to achieve a reduction in the <Col N="282" /> crime figures.  The problems of young people must be considered and I look forward to a discussion on a new policy by the Government in this connection. If we can get to the root of the problem, we can do something about reducing the crime rate.</P>
    <P>If something is not done soon there will be a backlash from the public.  It is obvious from correspondence in the newspapers that they are concerned about their areas where some of them are living literally under siege.  The public will react and demand harsh treatment for those responsible.  Therefore, it behoves us to ensure that our city is made safe for people to live and walk in.  I am not saying that we cannot walk in safety in most parts of the city but there is a certain element of risk in doing this in certain parts and that should not be the position.</P>
    <P>Last evening the Minister mentioned liaison community officers and he said that inspectors are being trained to liaise with various communities in the city.  That is an excellent innovation and it is the kind of thinking that is required.  These officers will be in constant touch with the people; they will get to know their problems and will be able to help them.</P>
    <P>A speaker on the other side mentioned that there should be changes in the Garda Sochána, that we should not operate the force in the same way that we have been operating it for the last 30 years.  I agree with that because new methods of work are necessary in any walk of life.  I understand a management report on the operation of the police will be coming soon and I hope it will outline guidelines and new structures which we can put into operation in the force.</P>
    <P>I accept that we will have to start at the beginning and build up but, in the meantime, remedial action will have to be taken against young thugs. We will have to deal with them without any sympathy.  Our sympathy must go to the people who are assaulted and we must not shirk this task.  We must speak up against those who show no mercy to the elderly, who beat them and rob them in their houses, who rob them of their handbags and who are not too fussy about the <Col N="283" /> methods they employ.  However, that is not the solution.  Ultimately we must re-think our attitude to young people. I accept that we will always have crime but we must create a climate where it is minimised.  That can be done if we adopt the right approach towards the young people.  They need the right type of education.  We must have the right type of youth policy and give them a sense of responsibility.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the seriousness of this problem and I sympathise with the people.  That is why I ask the Minister to extend overtime until the new gardaí are available.  I also ask him to ensure that there are more plain clothes policemen on the beat and suggest that a different type of vehicle might be used.  I ask him to have a new task force, one for the south part of the city and one for the north, and I would also ask that there would be some place where the young offenders may be placed.  It is useless bringing them before the courts. In my view the courts are far too lenient.  Somebody says a few well-chosen words for a young thug, the judge has sympathy and he is released while his victim may be in hospital.</P>

      <P>When one reads the terms of the motion submitted in the names of Deputy Dowling and other Dublin Deputies one is at a loss to understand why Deputy O'Brien will not support it.  When he reads his contribution he will see that during the course of it he admitted there was need for more gardaí on the streets, more night patrols, the maintenance of full strength in city Garda stations, particularly those in his constituency, and extra gardaí everywhere.  I, therefore, find it very difficult to understand <Col N="284" /> why he is not entirely in sympathy with the terms of the motion.  He indicated that attacks were made on the Minister for Justice.  No such attack was made.</P>
      <P>The motion condemns the Government, who have the ultimate responsibility for providing sufficient gardaí in this city.  It would be very erroneous for anybody to accept that the gardaí and matters connected with the Department of Justice are the sole preserve of the Government in office. If the Deputies on this side of the House did not acknowledge their responsibility in relation to this matter we would not bother tabling motions like the one we are discussing tonight. The remarks I make tonight are made in regard to how I see my responsibility as an elected representative of a Dublin constituency.</P>
      <P>The Minister asked Deputies to refrain from using extravagant phrases in connection with this matter, but he gave us the most blatant example of it. This is my responsibility as much as it is that of the Minister.  Deputy O'Brien, Deputy Hugh Byrne or anybody else.  I believe that the Garda force in this city has become a joke. I get instances of that at meetings which I attend.  I am sure Deputy Hugh Byrne will remember that four or five years ago when we visited resident groups in our area and when various problems were mentioned if there was one which should be dealt with by the gardaí and if Deputy Byrne or I said that we would take that up with the local inspector or the local superintendent everybody was satisfied.  The members of the audience accepted that we could then move to the next business.  I cannot say that any more, I know if I said something like that to members of the public it would be treated with derision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that we have vandalism, mugging and thugs, but I am very concerned that the Garda force, which hitherto enjoyed the confidence of our people and were so well respected by them, are now in the position where the people have no faith in them.  The public have had on many occasions to go to their local Garda station to tell of some robbery or some house <Col N="285" /> breaking or that a Garda was needed at a particular place.  They have invariably been told that no garda was available.  Sometimes they have been told that while there was a squad car outside the station there was nobody to drive it or that the motorcycle man was gone some place else.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that there was a reduction in the rate of increase in crime.  I listened to the radio report this morning and I have read the press reports.  One would imagine that the Minister said there was a considerable reduction in crime in Dublin. The Minister spoke about a reduction in the growth of increase in crime.  He told us that in 1975 it was 18½ per cent increase on the previous year's figure and last year it was only 11 per cent increase on the 1975 figure. However, if we take it for the two years we find an average increase of 14 per cent over the 1975 figure, which is a shattering increase.  It is misleading the people to say that there is an improvement.  It gives an appearance of health where there is cancer.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the position in my constituency, particularly the Garda station in Finglas.  I made inquiries about this station, which serves at least 100,000 people.  It covers an area of approximately seven miles.  The area has 20 public houses, several banks, shopping centres and schools.  I do not say this in any disrespectful manner but this area has two itinerant camps.  It has about 400 unauthorised itinerants with straying horses.</P>
    <P>Last Saturday in Finglas station there were two sergeants and six men. That might seem reasonable when one first looks at it.  However, three of those men were at a check point on the main road approximately five miles away from Finglas village.  They were lost to the community they are supposed to serve.  That reduced the staff to two sergeants and three men. One of those men was attending duties at the Phoenix Park racecourse. That left the village of Finglas with two sergeants and two men.  One of the two remaining men was out on a motor cycle and one sergeant had to <Col N="286" /> mind the barracks.  That left one sergeant and one garda patrolling the whole area and endeavouring to look after what is a city situation on a Saturday afternoon.  I do not agree entirely with those who say that Dublin is being ruled by mobs.  We must be grateful that standards in the community are such as to allow us to continue to live in reasonable harmony.  It is a compliment to the people of Finglas that, despite there being only one sergeant and a garda in the whole area on a Saturday afternoon, the incidence of crime is relatively low.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks of appealing to the community to do better but were it not for the high standards among the community, there would have been chaos long ago.  Surely the Minister was not implying that the maintenance in Finglas of high standards is due solely to the area being patrolled by one sergeant and a garda.  On Sunday evening I made it my business to inquire as to the situation.  This was at about 9.30, a time associated with people leaving licensed premises and when discos are beginning.  I found that there was one sergeant and four men on duty.  The sergeant and one garda were manning the station while one garda was on motorcycle patrol.  The squad car was parked outside the station and, on inquiring as to why it was not being driven, I was informed that it was an automatic and that there was no one available at that time to drive such a model.  This is the position with which the Minister is asking me to be happy.  We should be failing in our duty to remain silent while such conditions exist.  The Minister said that during Question Time I have shown much concern for the Coolock area.  I expect he meant to say the Finglas area.  In any case, I may be forgiven for being parochial enough to be interested in my own constituency.</P>
    <P>It is a tribute to the civic spirit of the people of Finglas that matters in that area are so tranquil but I plead with the Minister not to push his good luck too for and to arrange immediately for an improvement in the policing situation.  What is needed is an improvement <Col N="287" /> that will restore the confidence of the people in the Garda Síochána and which will restore also the confidence of members of the Garda in themselves.  Nowadays nobody qualifies for membership of the Garda unless, to say the least, he is intelligent. Consequently, these men are aware of the situation.  They are mindful of the inadequacies of a system that provides for a situation in which, in the event of, say, two break-ins occurring simultaneously in a population of 100,000 people, they would not have the manpower to investigate the incidents.  I recall that during my schooldays in Finglas when the population there amounted to only about 2,000, the Garda strength comprised a sergeant and two men.  Today Finglas is an expanding area.  Because of development there many new people are coming into the area and, on the law of averages, some of the newcomers must have what are known as records. How can the gardaí be expected to keep in touch with all those people? When I was teaching in Blanchardstown I was always pleased when a garda from the local station came to the school to chat with the students. Nowadays the gardaí have no opportunity to socialise with anybody in the area.  Rather, they are strangers where they should be friends and be familiar with as many people as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister laid much stress on his intention to appoint an inspector in every area, a man who would act as a liaison officer between the station and the community.  Every member of the Garda Síochána should be a liaison officer between the force and the community. Therefore, there should not be an attempt to isolate one man in an attempt to create the impression that some improvement is being made. Having said that, I trust that the inspectors who are being appointed will fulfil the role of liaison officers between the force and the community and that they will ensure that the gardaí become acquainted with local communities.</P>
    <P>I shall not comment on matters that are peculiar to Garda regulations except to mention in passing that regulation which decrees that not more <Col N="288" /> than one man may travel in a squad car.  This regulation is the cause of much frustration among the Garda. Perhaps it is responsible for some of the depression I have noticed within the force.  Should the Parliamentary Secretary or I be found driving a car without having our eyes on the road, we should be deemed to have committed an offence but a member of the Garda is expected to drive a squad car while at the same time watching for anyone acting suspiciously.  Let us take the case of the driver who goes to the scene of some crime.  In some areas he will have to lock his car because otherwise it might not be there on his return. Having left the car, what can he be expected to do on his own?  I am not endeavouring to make capital out of this but we are all aware&mdash;politicians in particular&mdash;that if there is no job motivation you will not have job satisfaction and, for the life of me, I cannot see how a garda employed in that fashion can feel he is performing any useful function and I would be interested to know at some future date the success which has attached to that new regulation.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted figures and again I accuse him of having been in breach of the request he made to us. He asked us not to distort figures and, having done so, he proceeded to draw a comparison between the situation here and the situation in England with reference to the <i>per capita</i> figures.  He told us that for every 100,000 of population there was one garda to every 266 people, whereas in England the figure was one to every 280.  He said we should be very happy about this.</P>
    <P>My simple observation on that comparison is that we do not live in England.  My comment on the distortion is that the Minister did not tell us that, whereas in England the totality of the force there is employed on what might be regarded as general police duties, here out of 8,500 men we have almost 2,000 employed on what are termed special security duties. That immediately reduces the force effectively to 6,000.  I could make further deductions bearing in mind the sophisticated equipment and so on that the police across the water have.  If the <Col N="289" /> Minister were being factual in regard to existing circumstances here, he would not have given the House to believe that the situation here is comparable with that in England and, because it is, one could arrive at a comparable figure.</P>
    <P>He did not make allowance for the fact that straightaway we must reduce our figure by the number of gardaí on special security duties.  He gave the impression that the intention of this Government was superior to that of their predecessors in regard to looking after the force.  I had a look at the Estimates over the last four or five years and I was surprised and, perhaps, pleased to note that in 1972-1973 a sum of £21 million out of a total of £585 million was spent on the Garda Síochána.  The percentage is higher than it is in 1977.  This year the percentage is on 3.4.  This is no distortion.  These figures are extracted from the Book of Estimates.  I have them for the intervening years as well. Of the total Estimates in 1972-1973 we were spending approximately 3.8 per cent on the Garda Síochána.  In this year, 1977, with the great law and order Government we are spending only 3.5 per cent on the Garda Síochána.  These are facts.  They cannot be contradicted.  These are facts which show the manner in which this Government are treating the Garda Síochána.  There is no doubt that the Government's attitude on the question of overtime has aggravated the situation and contributed to a large extent to the problems we have.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Brien that until such time as the 500 extra gardaí are available the Minister should compensate by asking the gardaí to perform overtime duties, the duties that will be performed by the 500 extra men when they become available. Surely he admits there is need now for 500 extra gardaí and, if he is sincere, he will immediately indicate to the Commissioner&mdash;perhaps that is not his function&mdash;or at least make it known that in his opinion overtime commensurate with and in compensation for the absence of these 500 men he now admits are necessary should be done forthwith.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="290" /> I cannot be accused of dramatising or distorting the situation.  What I am about to say is not peculiar to Dublin.  I know people in my constituency who are afraid to leave their houses lest they be attacked.  I know others who are afraid to stay in their houses lest they be attacked because they know such attacks have happened with such frequency as to make them fear for their own safety.  Worse still, they believe there is no point in going to the local police station for help because there are no men available.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling made a telling case. Both he and I are speaking not just on behalf of our own constituents but on behalf of the people generally. I ask the Minister to apply himself now to restoring people's confidence in our Garda force and give people the sort of security that comes out of confidence in that force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the increase of 500 men announced by the Minister.  Since the change of Government the force has increased by 1,000.  It is also pertinent to note that crime has increased.  There are many factors involved.  Generally speaking, there has been an undermining of morality and family life and an erosion of civic spirit and pride. Since 1968-1969 crime, particularly in specific areas, has increased.  There has been an increase in crime connected with drugs, in crime connected with drink, in crime connected with sex, in crime connected with subversives&mdash; bank robberies, post office robberies&mdash; and also in fraud, forgery, shoplifting and other allied crimes.  There must be an overall view of the general situation. Vandalism is not classified as a separate type of crime but it could be related to a contagious disease.  A child is not born a vandal.  It copies another child and takes it from films, television or books.  Acts of vandalism are passed on from one individual to another and could be compared with a contagious disease, and just as in the case of cancer or a boil, the treatment should not only treat the crime but go towards curing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistically speaking, the crime rate has increased throughout the country <Col N="291" /> and the efficacy of the Garda Síochána, though it has increased in strength, is slightly anaemic.  We should, therefore, give a transfusion of funds and of motor vehicles, motorcycles and men into the Garda Síochána.  This could be approached by increasing the number of patrol cars.  The man on the beat is to a large extent outdated in the city because he is immobile while many of the vandals are mobile. What is usually done in a firm or factory where there is an apparent under-manning is to have additional hours of employment and commitment to duty.  Whether overtime in the Garda Síochána was ever a good thing to introduce or whether a standard rate of pay should have been there all the time, is immaterial.  What we must do is bring back men where they are needed and where it is apparent that there is a very large increase in crime. Consideration should also be given to the replacement of men who are tied up in office jobs in the Garda Síochána by female officers to do their office work.  Other duties performed by the Garda Síochána could possibly be transferred to the Army.</P>
    <P>Ex-Army men should be recruited as a second anti-crime force to replace men who have been taken off the beat and put into mobile patrols.  ONE is an organisation whose members have shown tremendous civic spirit and have served the country very well throughout the years.  These men are already trained in many aspects of military life and could be considered as a pool of crime preventors.</P>
    <P>I have already outlined crimes associated with drugs and drink, with sex and robbery and so on, all of which have increased, particularly in the Dublin metropolitan and suburban areas.  There is an onus on different sections of the population, for instance, customs officers to stem the flood of pornography which has occurred since we joined the EEC and with the dilution of the strength of the regulations associated with the importation of pornographic literature and films. These are on sale and available throughout the city and can do great harm to the moral fibre and civic spirit <Col N="292" /> of our younger citizens.  The Garda Síochána and customs officers must work hand in hand.  There is a great onus on all citizens to report crime as early as possible.  I do not think this is being done in every area.  Citizens, representatives of tenants' associations, will complain to public representatives and receive generous Press coverage, so that if these associations want to knock the Garda Síochána they can get immediate and extensive exposure. How often do they pass by the scene of a crime or a row in the street, a vicious attack, and yet not bother to pick up a telephone and report the incident to the Garda Síochána?</P>
    <P>Social workers, the courts, probation officers, school attendance officers, the clergy, parents and schools, all play a large part in creating civic spirit.  One cannot over-emphasise the importance of parents' attitude towards their children and the example they give them in the home.  In this connection, deprived families, one-parent families and so on should receive special attention from social workers and from probation and school attendance officers.</P>
    <P>There should be an examination of the type of penalties imposed for certain crimes.  For instance, what efficacy is there in giving the drunken driver an endorsement?  In other countries, Australia and Germany, a drunken driver is put into a hospital to assist in the casualty ward for, perhaps, six week-ends.  That is one of the instances where the punishment fits the crime.  In regard to vandalism, I would suggest the setting up of a labour force, labour squads, who could be collected each day, brought up the mountains to work the bogs or brought to clean the beaches and canals during the summer, keeping them out in the open air where they would develop an appetite and acquire an understanding of what it means to work hard.  It is the idle mind that creates vandalism.  Let a vandal produce so much until he has paid for the crime or for a certain part of the crime he has committed.</P>
    <P>At present the courts are relatively ineffective in dealing with crimes such as petty vandalism.  They are fully occupied with other cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="293" /> Television nowadays more or less dramatises the criminal.  We need an overall co-ordination of all the different structures of society to prevent crime and create a far greater civic spirit.  On many occasions we have praised the Garda Síochána.  We have said what tremendously brave and dedicated men they have been down through the years.  Not since the thirties have they been called upon to perform such onerous and life-risking tasks as they have had to do over the last period of time.  The Members of this House are totally united in praise and gratitude for the dedication of the Garda Síochána who could be termed the cream of Irish manpower.  I would like also to praise their families who are on many occasions subjected to intimidation.  In these days it is not easy to be married to a member of the Garda Síochána, and it is fitting that every Member of this House give full support to the Garda force.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am particularly aware of the many crimes that occur in the city.  In the constituency of Dublin Cabra there is the Garda Depot and Headquarters, the Bridewell, Green Street Courthouse, the Four Courts, and Cabra station.  The constituency is also served by barracks such as Finglas, Central, Whitehall and Ballymun.  This is not a small number of gardaí to be living in a single constituency.  Through living and working with these men I have become very familiar with the tasks and problems that beset them and their families.  The citizens of Dublin and the people of this nation are indeed proud of the Garda Síochána with their great traditions and the tasks they have performed over the past.  In conclusion, I hope that the spokesman for the Opposition will, as I am sure he will treat the major part of this debate in a responsible manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish I could agree with the remarks of my colleague, indeed my former university colleague for many pleasant years, on the Garda Síochána situation, but I cannot.  I wish that the case made by him were as he would want it to be.  The stark reality of this situation is different. The picture which he had hoped to <Col N="294" /> paint here this evening is not the true picture.  I will say, although I am sorry to have to say it, that, like his Minister, he is blind to the truth of the situation. I must be exceptionally brief because of the limited time at my disposal.  I fully understand why the Minister is not present here.  He is in the Seanad dealing with the Courts Bill.  I wish that he had a substitute for himself in the Seanad rather than in this House, with all due respect to the Parliamentary Secretary, because what I have to say is a matter of grave importance. I fully believe that what is going to be said in this House with regard to the protection of people and their property is far more important than the Bill in the Seanad which is making jobs for certain friends of the Coalition Government and ensuring their continuance in office if there is a general election.</P>
      <P>The Minister last evening took to task my colleague, Deputy Dowling, and tried to dismiss out of hand and with contempt the very fine contribution made by Deputy Dowling.  I only wish the Minister were here to hear what I have to say because the Minister did a grave disservice to this House, to his Department and to an individual Deputy when yesterday he instructed his departmental officials to refuse to give information to Deputy Dowling, information which he wanted to use in the course of this debate.  Last night the Minister uttered words to the effect that it was wrong of Deputy Dowling to make a telephone call seeking a whole plethora of statistical information which, he said, the Minister would not allow to be given out from the Department until he had time to check it for accuracy.  The Minister refuses his information office, which is a courtesy office and an expensive office to maintain in the Department. and which is run by a former journalist from RTE, permission to give factual information to a Member of this House because he does not want the truth to be spoken in this debate if he can prevent it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purpose of the record, the information sought by Deputy Dowling was, first, the number of <Col N="295" /> police stationed in the country as a whole and the number in Dublin.  That was a statement of fact with regard to the number of stations.  He also wanted to know the strength of the Garda Síochána in January, 1973, as against January of this year.  The Minister refused to allow that information to be given because he himself wanted to check its accuracy.  My God, if a Minister of this Government treats a Member of this Parliament with such contempt he has no business being a member of Government let alone a Member of this House.  The third and final piece of information that Deputy Dowling wanted for the purpose of this debate were the figures for the natural wastage from the Garda force for the last couple of years.  This the Minister refused to give.</P>
    <P>If that is how the Minister hopes to run a Department for a Government in a democracy such as ours, let it be clearly understood that his actions in preventing Members of the House from getting such information is doing more to destroy democracy than are many of the people the Minister preaches about in this House on every opportunity he gets.  Whatever the Minister tries to withhold from Deputy Dowling, there is no better man in this House than Deputy Dowling to make the case for the people of Ballyfermot and Drimnagh, and he made it well yesterday evening.</P>
    <P>I have nothing but the utmost respect and regard for members of the Garda Síochána and nothing but great appreciation for the very difficult job they are doing as best they can at present in combating crime despite the severe stranglehold and restrictions put on them by the Government through the Minister for Justice at the behest of the Labour and Fine Gael Parties.  I believe, as do Members of this House, not alone on this side but on the other side, as indicated by Deputy Byrne and Deputy O'Brien who spoke before him, that the guards are prepared to do the job of work which they have been trained to do and which only they can do as it should be done if they are allowed to <Col N="296" /> do it by the Minister for Justice and his Labour and Fine Gael Government. The Minister has stopped the guards from doing their jobs and he now has to live with the situation where crime is rampant, where the criminal is allowed practically to do what he likes.  No amount of twisting and turning by the Minister or anybody in the benches behind him in an effort to help him is going to hide the truth.  Since 1975 the guards have not been allowed by the Minister to do their job and as a result of that the criminal often is allowed to go from one place to another knowing in his heart that the gardaí, because of the restrictions on them, are not going even to be able to investigate the situation.</P>
    <P>The 1975 figures in the Garda Commissioner's report which are the latest figures available to us show a horrific increase in criminal activities.  As late as last November I put on the record of this House my views on the 1975 figures.  Does the Commissioner's report for 1976 contain good news or bad news by comparison with that for 1975?  We must believe that it does because the Minister last evening and on one or two other occasions has been selectively using figures on crime which are available to him only.  The Minister has come in here when we are fast approaching a general election, in the hope of making a bad situation look fair.  I distrust the Minister's figures.  I distrust the Minister's approach to this debate and I distrust his motives.  I have an obligation to accuse the Minister of trying on, in this House last evening, one hell of a bluff in an effort to cover up his total failure to provide proper and adequate protection for our property and people. I can prove that the Minister is deliberately trying to mislead the Parliament and the people as to the true situation.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is not doing it deliberately, he is making a damn good job of misleading them. The Minister strongly impressed the <Col N="297" /> importance of cold statistics while at the same time he recklessly set out to paint a false picture with statistics which are grossly unreliable and he tried to compare situations which are incomparable, to compare a situation that exists in Britain with that which exists in Ireland.  The Minister dishonestly tried to compare the situation here with that in Britain, with regard to manpower available per 100,000 of the population.  This is a deliberate, false comparison to make.  Having telephoned the London metropolitan police as a result of the Minister's statement last night, I learned that the situation in Britain is different from here.  That is the reason why I accuse the Minister of misleading this House and almost getting away with it. Whether it was deliberate or otherwise, I will accept the ruling of the Chair that I cannot use the word &ldquo;deliberate&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In Britain tens of thousands of civilians work with the police doing administrative work and certain types of crime prevention work.  We do not have people working in that capacity here.  Britain also has people working as traffic wardens.  The fact that the Minister did not allude to these things in his comparison shows a complete misrepresentation of the situation.  The Minister was trying to bolster up a very bad case.  The Minister made a request for cold statistics.  The Minister should set his own house in order first in that respect.  What I have said proves that my accusations that the Minister was falsifying the situation as it really is, are correct.</P>

      <P>Having proved my charges against the Minister this House has no option but to agree that I have no alternative but to reject out of hand the remainder of the figures or statistics used by the Minister, particularly the selective figures that were available only to him.  I say to the Minister and his colleagues who spoke &mdash;nobody from the Labour Party spoke in this debate nor was any member of that party present during the debate&mdash;that if the Minister thinks he will create the impression in this House and from this House that crime is decreasing, it is about time that the head was taken out of the sand and the reality of the situation was looked at.  Members from both sides of the House do not believe the Minister; members of Dublin Corporation, members of chambers of commerce, members of community associations, parents committees, youth associations, the Press and the general public do not believe the Minister.  They believe that as a result of the Minister's inactivity and inability to look after the police force, the Minister is allowing an extremely bad situation to become <Col N="299" /> worse.  Why did the Minister and the Government have to wait 18 months for the 500 extra gardaí that we have been hearing about from every member of the Cabinet including the Taoiseach?  Why do we have to wait nearly nine months to get examinations under way?  Even if we have 500 gardaí in Dublin by next Christmas we would only have 125 extra men on the streets of Dublin at any one time.  The 500 gardaí could not be allocated in Dublin because there are other cities, such as Limerick, Cork, Galway and Waterford that are as bad if not worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If 200 of the 500 gardaí promised were trained by Christmas they might possibly only make up for the natural losses or wastage from the force which we have had in the last 12 or 18 months.  Even if the Minister had 500 men, which he will not have by Christmas except on paper, to distribute to each Garda station throughout <Col N="300" /> the country we would only have about two-thirds or three-quarters of a garda extra, for each station, each man prepared to work only 40 hours per week, because that is all he would be allowed to work by the Minister acting on behalf of the Government. Let the Minister try to redeem himself, and to redeem a bad situation by letting the men who are trained to do the job of policing and protecting our people do the job that they want to do.  Let the Minister allow these men to drive the squad cars which are parked idle in many stations throughout the city of Dublin.</P>
