      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will order a public inquiry into the recent tragedy at Saint Kyran's residential home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey) Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that, on 5th October 1977, I issued a statement regarding the death of Thomas Hayden. The statement summarised the action taken by the Eastern Health Board following the placing of this child in their care.  In the statement I indicated my deep concern about the tragedy and my intention to inquire fully into the circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>I have now received a full and detailed report from the Eastern Health Board regarding the care provided for the child in question and other members of his family.  The report includes detailed information regarding the child's stay in Madonna House, the care subsequently provided while the family was at home and the reasons underlying the decision to transfer the children to St. Kyran's Home, Rathdrum.  I am satisfied that the quality of the care provided between 1974 and September of this year was satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The child was removed from St. Kyran's Home without authority on <Col N="150" /> Friday, 16th September and a man has since been charged with causing the child's death.  I cannot, in the circumstances, make any comments on this aspect of the tragedy.</P>
    <P>I can, however, say at this stage that on the basis of the information at present before me I cannot see that any benefit would be derived from holding a public inquiry into this case. I have, however, specially arranged for senior officers of my Department to review existing procedures for liaison, for staff recruitment and training, and for the transfer of children from one house to another to see what improvements in them might be needed.  This review will be carried out in conjunction with the staffs of health boards and with representatives of voluntary child care homes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate that the matter is <i>sub judice</i> in respect of a certain aspect of it.  Would the Minister not agree that there is serious public disquiet at the fact that a child can leave a home without authority and that this can place many a child in jeopardy?  Can the Minister have a directive issued from his Department to these homes to ensure that more surveillance can take place in situations like this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply, a complete review of all the procedures is now being carried out with a view to ensuring that something like this cannot happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply the Minister said he was satisfied with the standard of care up to September of this year.  Would it be fair to take the interference from that that he may not be satisfied about the standard of care from September this year up to the unfortunate event involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The event took place in September this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I got the impression from the Minister that, from the beginning of September to perhaps the 16th, he had certain doubts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if accurate figures are available as to the number of people eligible for free hospitalisation and the source or sources of this information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Accurate figures on this are not available.  It is estimated that something over 85 per cent of the population are eligible for free hospital services.  The main sources of information which contribute to the estimate are the 1971 Census of Population, the General Medical Services (Payments) Board, the Department of Social Welfare, the Revenue Commissioners and the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister if any attempt will be made to obtain accurate figures for this, or how will we be able to know?  Is it the intention of his Department to instruct health boards to issue cards of entitlement to hospital services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is under review at present.  It will also come very much into focus in connection with the new arrangements for the social insurance contribution which we hope will <Col N="152" /> come in on 1st April, 1979; from then on I do not think there will be any problem.  Whether we will do anything in the meantime or not is at present under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the total amount of grants from EEC funds channelled through his Department to date; and if he will provide a breakdown of these figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>For the years 1973-1976 inclusive a total amount of £2,948,945 has been allocated in grants from the European Social Fund towards the cost of training the handicapped for employment.  These grants were approved for health boards, the National Rehabilitation Board and various voluntary bodies.</P>
      <P>Decisions on the applications for grants for 1977 have not yet been taken by the Social Fund Committee.</P>
      <P>The breakdown of the grants is in the form of a tabular statement and with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate it with the Official Report.</P>

If the addition of extra points for these disabilities brings a patient into a higher compensation category the lump sum and allowance already awarded will be increased.  The admission of these further deformities will not have any effect in cases in which the maximum lump sums and maximum monthly allowances were awarded by the German Foundation.</P>
      <P>My Department maintain close contact with the Association for Justice for Irish Thalidomide Children and will facilitate the parents or guardians of any children in making claims for increased allowances or lump sums if they consider that they can benefit from the extension of admissible malformations. A letter to this effect was sent to each parent and guardian on 29th September last.</P>
      <P>Where, as a result of this an increased award is made by the German Foundation, the payments made from the Irish Government will be adjusted upwards in line with the existing formula.</P>
      <P>I should mention that the present German approach to the parents deals with the supplementation of the benefits for those with accepted disability. There is no evidence that the further malformations which are listed in awarding points for compensation exist in isolation from the malformations already identified in accepted cases. Accordingly, it is not expected that new cases entitled to compensation will now come to light.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not agree that there is a whole series of new deformities coming to light as a result of the thalidomide drug? Secondly, is he aware that his Department have a deplorable record in their treatment of such cases, of bringing to the attention of parents their rights and entitlements and even examining the children?  In view of the fact that new deformities have come to light in addition to the ones already existing, would he consider reassessing some cases that were rejected very arbitrarily <Col N="156" /> as a result of previous examinations when there was no knowledge of the deformities that have since come to light?</P>

I would remind the Minister that it was only after my putting down parliamentary questions for several years that we got action.  It took nearly five years to get action in the first place.  I would ask him to consider this matter objectively. I know he is not biased.  Some borderline cases were rejected but some of the children concerned are so deformed they might come under the criteria established for identifying thalidomide cases and, in the circumstances, I would appreciate it if the Minister would consider such cases.</P>

      <P>Persons with full eligibility have free hospital in-patient and out-patient services and free drugs and medicines.  Persons with limited eligibility have the same hospital services and are eligible for a refund of part of the cost of drugs for themselves and their dependants.  In this case, the cost of a month's supply of drugs will not exceed £6.50.  About 85 per cent of the population is covered by one or other of these categories.</P>
      <P>For the great majority of persons, therefore, the hospital services necessary for the investigation of suspected cancer or the treatment and post-operative care of cancer cases is already provided free of charge under the Health Acts.  The necessary drugs are available either free or subject to a net maximum cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" /> For persons who are not eligible for these services the hospital and home schemes of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board cover most if not all of the cost of similar services.  Individual cases of undue hardship will be considered by the health boards.</P>
    <P>The fight against cancer proceeds on several fronts, in the areas of research, treatment, diagnosis and education and all of these are supported by my Department.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The main sources of information relevant to this question are: 1.  Life expectancy tables which show that the life expectancy of persons who live in urban areas is slightly less than for the entire State.  2.  Perinatal mortality rates which do not show any significant differences between urban and other areas.  3. Numbers of admissions to general hospitals which do not reveal any obvious difference between persons who live in urban areas and those who live elsewhere. 4. Numbers of admissions to psychiatric hospitals have not produced definite evidence of difference between urban and rural areas.  5. Mortality rates specific to certain causes which indicate a higher rate of mortality from cancer and from diseases of the respiratory system in Dublin and other major cities than in the entire State.  6.  A study of air pollution, living standards and respiratory diseases in children being carried out by the Medico-Social Research Board, which at a preliminary stage of the study, indicates a higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms in children <Col N="167" /> who live in the more densely populated areas.  7.

      <P>Is the Minister concerned that at least four of the indicators to which he referred in his comprehensive reply, for which I am grateful, indicate that there is a significantly higher health and mortality risk for people living in urban areas, and specifically Dublin, and will he do all in his power to ensure that this will be borne in mind in planning policy and policy in relation to the infrastructure of the city generally, which would be administered by his colleague?  Are there any other steps the Minister could envisage which might help to correct this very serious situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to give the impression that living in Dublin is particularly dangerous, but there is some evidence that it is less healthy than living in the countryside. There are a number of ways in which progress can be made.  As the Deputy indicated, primarily it would be a matter for my colleague the Minister for the Environment, to try to ensure clean air, water and an improvement in our natural environment.  I will also be bringing forward programmes in the preventive medicine area and in the health education field to see if the problem can be tackled from that point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 22 and 23 together. I have not yet had consultations with any organisations in regard to the proposed amendment of existing mental treatment legislation but I intend having consultations with the main professional groups involved, including <Col N="169" /> psychiatric nurses, in the near future.</P>
      <P>I decided that the White Paper procedure was not appropriate for this legislation but I will bring forward a discussion document soon on the general structure and administration of the psychiatric services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the difference between the discussion document the Minister has in mind and the White Paper?  Are they not alike?  In view of the fact that the law is about 30 years old, and I suppose the law he brings in will last another 30 years into the next century, would he not agree that there should be the widest possible discussion not only with the representative bodies but also with the public and that a White Paper is desirable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there are two things involved here, one is the legislation and the other is the structure and the administration of the services.  I decided to proceed, mainly in the interest of expedition, with the legislation separately.  When my legislative proposals are published a discussion process will take place on the actual proposals as published in the legislation. I propose, side by side with that, to publish a document reviewing the structure of the services, their administration and likely trends, improvements and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This seems rather confusing. I do not wish to hold the Minister up in any way&mdash;I am sure he knows this&mdash;but surely the provision of a discussion document, listening to the consequences of that discussion and then making up his mind as to the legislative proposals, is putting the cart before the horse?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy knows more about this area technically than I do but I understand that what is required legislatively is fairly simple, straightforward and pretty much agreed by most people concerned.  I intend to proceed with the legislation in the normal way. There is a whole area separate from that of administrative improvements <Col N="170" /> and structural matters which can be the subject of discussion, maybe for a considerably extended period.  It seems to me that both of these things should not necessarily be bound up together but could proceed separately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept the Minister's <i>bona fides</i> on this.  There is the very important question of the change that the thymoleptic drugs have made.  Custodial care is much less important than it used to be. There is also the question of the legal rights and civil rights of individuals. Does the Minister not propose to have discussions with the various interested bodies on these matters?  I am thinking about temporary commitment and the right of an individual medical man to commit people and keep them there endlessly and so on.

      <P>As I indicated in reply to a similar question from Deputy O'Connell on 13th October, I am considering, at present, as part of my examination of the area of preventive medicine and health education generally, various initiatives for the more effective control of the advertising of cigarettes and alcoholic drinks. I am aiming to intensify the anti-smoking activities of my Department and one of my objectives will be to create a climate of opinion in the community towards smoking which will remove any possible aspect of glamour or sophistication from it.  It is clearly desirable in the circumstances to try to reduce the pressures of advertising on people and I will be seeking the co-operation of the tobacco industry in the near future in regard to this.</P>

In the past there may have been some justification for doubt but the Minister has no such justification today.  He has no justification for not banning all cigarette advertisements <Col N="174" /> and all encouragement to young people to start smoking when he knows nicotine is a very dangerous drug.  It is a dangerous drug.  The Minister must agree with that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that it is the practice in relation to many long-stay institutions for health boards to hold in safe keeping the social welfare books of persons in these institutions.</P>
      <P>This generally facilitates the cashing of the allowances on behalf of the recipients and also facilitates the health board in collecting contributions towards maintenance, where applicable. Some people, however, retain their Social Welfare books and make their own arrangements for obtaining the allowances.</P>
      <P>It is also the practice in institutions for the authorities to hold on behalf of some persons the balances of allowances which accrue after they have paid their contributions.  This normally relates to persons who are unable to look after the money themselves.</P>
      <P>These practices are generally regarded as satisfactory and I am not aware that they have caused any great difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> The amount of contributions collected by health boards from persons in long-stay institutions, almost all of which would be collected from persons in receipt of social welfare allowances, is estimated at £5 million for the current year.</P>

      <P>I crave the indulgence of the Chair in this matter.  Is the Minister aware that these moneys are retained ostensibly to pay for funeral arrangements for those in long-stay institutions?  I would plead with the Minister to examine into this because it is a most iniquitous practice.  I do not think anyone has the right to hold money like this and it should be left to the persons themselves or to people outside the institutions, because large sums are involved.  Would the Minister consider holding an immediate review of the situation?  There is considerable dissatisfaction which is invariably voiced to officials at a low level and the position is creating a great deal of discontent.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would have a look into the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health how many of the 1,250 jobs generated at 13th October, 1977 by way of hospital construction projects were financed from the £13.5 millions capital allocated in last January's budget, together with the £2.5 million from the Local Loans Fund and Hospitals Sweepstakes Fund; how many were since created by a &ldquo;grafted on&rdquo; programme; and how the latter were financed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1,250 jobs referred to in my reply to the Deputy's previous question of 13th October, 1977, related to the 1977 capital allocation which amounts to £16 million.  As I indicated in reply to supplementary questions on that occasion, some of the projects which had been approved for 1977 had not got under way as soon as was originally anticipated. Consequently, to ensure that the target figure for jobs would be met I approved of a number of additional projects following a review of the programme.  Additional capital moneys will not be required for these extra projects in 1977.  Capital will have to be allocated to some of them in 1978 to ensure their completion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also approved of a commencement of work on the new Beaumont hospital project and in a Supplementary Estimate, which I propose to move in the next few weeks, provision will be made for the expenditure which will be incurred on this work in the present year.

      <P>The further development of health services in local communities will be based upon the existence of Community Care teams. The State has been divided into 32 Community Care Areas with a more or less comparable population in each area.  The Community Care team in each area will be headed by a Director of Community Care and he will be assisted by a number of medical officers and public health nurses as well as health inspectors, social workers and other qualified people.</P>
      <P>I have approved in recent months of the strengthening of the staffs of these teams particularly in the public health nursing and social work areas.  The number of public health nursing posts has been increased by 113 and the number of social work posts has been increased by 80.</P>
      <P>The number of centres for the annual training courses for public health nurses has been increased from one to three for the current year and it is expected that when these training courses are completed in June of next year there will be an additional 100 qualified public health nurses available for employment by the health boards. This is a considerable increase over the numbers who were trained over recent years.</P>
      <P>Work has commenced or will commence during the present year in the provision of four health centres and four welfare homes.  Health boards have been asked to consider the extent to which further development of these facilities is required in their areas.  The provision of such accommodation is of course essential in providing appropriate services in local areas and the need for such accommodation will be kept under constant review.  I shall also be encouraging health boards to continue their support of voluntary organisations which are and will remain an essential part of the community-based services.</P>

I realise the problem involved but in view of the fact that the extra expense would not be large, would the Minister consider the request to add this person's name to the panel?</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot. First of all, the Deputy will agree that the panel appointed are beyond reproach. They are experts and completely satisfactory from all points of view.  What we want is an impartial, objective panel.  The parents have indicated that the people appointed meet with their approval.  It is a different matter to go beyond that and appoint somebody whom they indicated they would like to see on the panel.</P>

      <P>Appointments have now been made to 20 of the posts shown as vacant at the 1st May, 1977, in the report referred to by the Deputy and in the case of 14 other consultant posts the Local Appointments Commissioners have recommended candidates for appointment.  In the case of the other posts the necessary steps towards filling them in a permanent capacity are being taken.  In many cases they are already filled in a temporary or locum capacity pending the making of such permanent appointments.</P>
      <P>With regard to the ratio consultants to population the report states that at the 1st May, 1977, the national ratio was one consultant to each 3,300 persons while in the Eastern Health Board area the ratio was one to 2,300. The more favourable ratio in the Eastern Health Board area is largely due to the more specialised services provided in the Dublin teaching hospitals many of which provide services for persons from outside the Eastern Health Board area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take these questions together.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy has made every effort to avert the closure of the Ferenka factory and, as the House will be aware, he was also in contact with the parent company yesterday after the decision to close became known asking them to reconsider their decision but to no avail.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy has also issued a directive to the Industrial Development Authority to explore every possibility of restoring employment in the Ferenka factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the Taoiseach's reply, from which it would appear that he believes AKZO will not continue with Ferenka in its present form.  I wonder if the Taoiseach is aware of the statement made last Sunday by Mr. Joseph Huyter, vice-president of the parent company, that the company's other factories cannot supply the growing demand for the product in question and that therefore the production of this plant is in demand and is needed. Given that the problem derives in large measure from labour relations, I wonder whether the Taoiseach would consider proposing to AKZO a solution that would involve a continuation of production at the plant, possibly as a workers' co-operative selling its output to AKZO at an economical price. Would he be prepared to consider investing in such a project the IDA's stake in the form of fixed assets and such other finance as might be needed as working capital for such an enterprise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This was a carefully prepared statement rather than a supplementary question.  I doubt if it is in order to answer it at all, but I will.  I will take it on since the Deputy has put it in such a carefully prepared way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="232" /> My first reaction would be that since Mr. Huyter indicated that his other factories cannot supply the demand he foresees for wire cord, I wonder that he did not continue in production when the workers reported back for work yesterday.  On the other hand, the proposition just put by the Deputy has never been put to anybody else.  The proposition put to the Government by AKZO was to take over the plant lock, stock and barrel, together with the debts that have accrued since closure, in circumstances when it was agreed between the IDA and the parent company that about £11 million extra input would be required to make the factory viable.  The offer was made at the time when the factory was closed because of an industrial dispute and when it was known that the parent company were losing money heavily in many of their other factories throughout Europe and had closed down some of these factories with the loss of several thousand jobs.  It was in these circumstances and against that background that Mr. Huyter made any kind of an offer to the Government and within the offer there were certain unacceptable terms.  That is my immediate reply to the Deputy, although he has since imported matters that Mr. Huyter himself had not put forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the information now disclosed, and particularly in view of the fact that the workers all reported for work yesterday, I would ask the Taoiseach if as an interim measure he would contact the board of directors of this company and offer an interim State short-term loss subsidy to the company to enable work to be recommenced immediately in the plant and even to bear the cost of such losses by the State for a month or two to enable the proposition which he has now outlined to the House to be considered by the IDA, the Government, the trade unions, the ICTU and the transport unions in order to get production going again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as Deputy Desmond referred to a disclosure, it was his own party leader who disclosed the fact that an offer <Col N="233" /> had been made.  I thought I might elaborate on it and put it in its proper perspective.  There is no indication whatever that an offer, if such were made, would be acceptable to AKZO. In expansion of what I have already said, I might say that the Ferenka factory is an isolated factory producing a very specialised product with very limited market outlets.  It would be difficult to see Ferenka of Limerick working in isolation without the vast marketing network that AKZO and ENKA already have, when these two parent companies were unable to market the product profitably up to this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to what the Taoiseach said. He referred to an offer, the details of which I was not aware of.  In view of the particular circumstances that there is a demand for this product, as we know from the vice-president of the parent company, but that the production of it at this factory involved losses unacceptable to the parent company, would the Taoiseach consider looking at the kind of solution I have proposed which would on the one hand provide the parent company with the additional production and on the other hand ensure them against losses because the production would be by a workers' co-operative here using the assets of the plant?  Would the Taoiseach reflect on this and consider whether such a proposal is worth putting forward?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly would and I would include that broad proposal in the directive issued to the Industrial Development Authority to look at it in detail to see whether it would be an attractive proposition and to see if, as a result of the proposition being accepted, the project would be a viable one.  I should like to emphasise that there is no indication as of now that the AKZO or ENKA companies would be attracted to such a proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that it is an <Col N="234" /> advantage in dealing with difficult problems of this kind that a member of the Government would act on behalf of the Government and be answerable to the Government?  Would the Taoiseach enlighten the House as to who was acting on behalf of the Government throughout this difficult situation? Was it the Minister for Labour or the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and in any future context who will be acting on behalf of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Ministers acted at different times.  When the dispute first arose the Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Labour put forward proposals that he thought might be acceptable to the trade unions involved to settle their differences and ensure an early return to work.  On each occasion these were rejected by one or other or both of the unions.  Subsequently when there was a serious suggestion of closure the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy came into the picture and on several occasions was in touch with the parent company and their directors and the directors of the local company in Limerick.</P>
      <P>I might say that lessons have been learned as a result of this dispute and the Minister for Labour will certainly be looking into the position which resulted in the dispute between the two unions in the first instance and will be looking into the question of personnel relations in factories like this to see how these can be improved.  He is doing this as a matter of urgency and I hope he will be bringing proposals before the Government in this respect. In the meantime the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy will now pursue in conjunction with the Industrial Development Authority whatever other proposals there are to see if employment can be sustained in the Ferenka factory.  The Industrial Development Authority is the specialised agency of the Government under the direction of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy to conduct such negotiations and these will be conducted by them.</P>

      <P>In page 6, to insert &ldquo;or, in case he is authorised under Rule 36 of the First Schedule to this Act by a local returning officer, at the polling station specified in the authorisation&rdquo; after &ldquo;him&rdquo; in line 41.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection 5 (1) of the Bill as it stands provides that, with the exception of postal voters, each Assembly elector will be entitled to vote in person only and at the polling station allotted to him.  The purpose of this amendment is to make it quite clear that the provisions in the subsection do not affect the arrangements set out in Rule 36 of <Col N="237" /> the First Schedule, whereby the local returning officer may authorise an elector employed by him in connection with the election to vote at any other polling station in the constituency if his duties are such as to prevent his voting at the polling station for which he is registered.  As indicated on Committee Stage, the legal advice is that a provision on the lines of the amendment is not essential.  The amendment is being introduced in order to make the position absolutely clear and to meet the point made by Deputy Fitzpatrick on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am grateful to the Minister for introducing this amendment. As he says, he has introduced it in response to a point raised by me on Committee Stage.  I was of the opinion that there was a definite conflict between section 5 and Rule 36.  Section 5 provided that an elector who was entitled to vote at an Assembly election should be entitled to vote in person only and at the polling station allotted to him.  Rule 36 provided that persons in the employment of the returning officer could in certain circumstances vote at places other than the allotted polling stations if they were authorised in writing to do so by the returning officer.  I thought there was a conflict between those two provisions and the Minister was advised otherwise.  At best, I think there was room for dispute.  I am satisfied that the Minister's amendment puts the point beyond doubt.  The authority which we always thought the returning officer had to facilitate employees is retained.  I accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>In page 6, to insert &ldquo;(which order shall be made not less than thirty-five days before the day thereby appointed)&rdquo; after &ldquo;order&rdquo; in line 50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During Committee Stage Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the fact that section 6 as drafted does not stipulate any period within which the Minister's order appointing a polling day must <Col N="238" /> be made.  As indicated on that occasion, there is an implied requirement because rule 2 of the First Schedule requires that notice of election must be published not later than the 28th day before polling day and this notice must indicate, among other things, the day and the period fixed for taking the poll.  Strictly speaking, therefore, it is not essential to stipulate in section 6 when the Minister's order must be made, but there is no objection to so stipulating and the amendment proposes that the Minister's order must be made at least 35 days before the polling day.  The amendment indicates the latest date for making the order.  It will be difficult to set an earlier date because this would depend on how soon the Council of Ministers move to fix the period for holding the elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I have pleasure in accepting the Minister's amendment which writes into section 6 that the Minister's order must give at least 35 days' notice of the election date if the election is being contested.  I accept that, by means of reference from the section to the Schedule and from one part of the Schedule to another, it was possible to find out what notice the Minister had to give; but the ordinary man in the street did not know what notice the Minister had to give.  Indeed, many politicians, who are usually well informed on matters appertaining to elections, found it difficult to be sure of the amount of notice that had to be given.</P>
      <P>There are other provisions in the Schedule which are a bit difficult to ascertain.  The Minister should avail of the passing of this Bill through the Seanad to have a look at those sections and to write them in in black and white.  I refer to the dates for nominations and so on.  These dates are given in reference to some other dates.  In other words, they are not written in simple language.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 9 and 10 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" />&ldquo;(2) The Minister shall, within the period of twelve years commencing on the passing of this Act and at least once in every twelve years thereafter, submit to the Oireachtas proposals for the revision of the constituencies for which candidates shall be elected under this Act to be representatives in the Assembly.</P>
    <P>(3) An area specified in the Second Schedule to this Act shall be taken to be that area as constituted on the 1st day of January, 1977.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick moved an amendment proposing to place the obligation on the Oireachtas to revise the Assembly constituencies at least once in every 12 years, having regard at the same time to the distribution of the population.  I indicated at that time that I accepted the principle of twelve yearly provisions and that I would introduce an amendment to this effect on Report Stage.  This amendment provides for twelve yearly revisions but the wording is slightly different from the original amendment. This amendment requires the Minister to submit to the Oireachtas proposals for the revision of the constituencies at least once in every 12 years. This is considered a more appropriate approach than purporting, as the original amendment did, to require the Oireachtas to carry out the revision.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Fitzpatrick indicated, it is futile to try to bind the Oireachtas by ordinary legislation because the Oireachtas can at any time amend or repeal such a provision.  The requirement to have due regard to change in the distribution of the population is also omitted on the grounds that it will be a matter for the Oireachtas of the day to judge whether or not proposals submitted by the Minister have due regard to population as well as any other factor it considers relevant. No reference is made in the amendment to the date of coming into force of revised constituencies and this is a matter which will be dealt with in the Bill dealing with the revision.  As I indicated previously, the intention is that an independent commission will <Col N="240" /> be set up to make recommendations on any revision of Assembly constituencies.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I appreciate that the Community propose to introduce rules or regulations which will be binding on all member states in regard to the holding of Assembly elections.  Presumably those rules or regulations, which I believe will be introduced by the Community itself, will cover the holding of elections here and I will deal with constituencies and how the elections should be held.  There are many people who feel that the sooner that procedure is settled by the Community for all member states and that we have a uniform system of election, the better.  It is possible that the uniform system of elections I am speaking about will be introduced within 12 years.  In that case we will have an opportunity, through our representatives in Europe, of vetting any proposals and making recommendations. The amendment I introduced in relation to this on Committee Stage was to deal with the position concerning Assembly elections until we have uniform law.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's amendment in so far as it goes.  My amendment suggested that the Oireachtas revise the constituencies at least once in every 12 years and in doing so they should have regard to changes in the distribution of the population.  In drafting that amendment I was guided by Article 16 of the Constitution which provides, amongst other things, that:</P>
      <P>4º The Oireachtas shall revise the constituencies at least once in every twelve years, with due regard to changes in distribution of the population, but any alterations in the constituencies shall not take effect during the life of Dáil Éireann sitting when such revision is made.</P>
      <P>I withdrew my amendment on the Minister's assurance that he would have a look into the matter and that he accepted the principle of that amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's amendment does not go as far as I would like it to, in so far <Col N="241" /> as it does not provide that the Oireachtas shall have regard to the distribution of population at the time of the revision. However, I accept what the Minister says, that the difference between the Dáil provision and that relating to the Assembly elections is that the one concerning the Dáil constituencies is subject to the Constitution, that the Oireachtas are bound by it and that the Oireachtas have no jurisdiction or power to act contrary to that provision.  In the case of the Assembly elections the position is different because the Constitution does not apply to those elections.  I agree that it is open to the Dáil to revise those constituencies at any time and have regard to the distribution of the population. I am sure that the Oireachtas will have regard to the provision in the Constitution and take account of the distribution of the population.</P>
    <P>My mind is put further at ease by the assurance of the Minister that it is the intention of the Government to honour their proposals and submit the revision of the constituencies to an independent commission.  I know the Minister would not be so optimistic as to think that he would be in power when the revision of constituencies takes place, but I am sure the Minister who succeeds him will have regard to the precedent of submitting the revision of constituencies to a commission. That principle has come to stay and I expect that all future creations of constituencies, as in this case, and revision of constituencies will be carried out by an independent commission.</P>

      <P>The next amendment is No. 4, in the name of Deputy Fitzpatrick.  Amendment No. 7, in the name of the Minister, is an alternative and amendment No. 5 is consequential on No. 7.  There-fore, we will discuss these three amendments together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="242" />&ldquo;(3)  Where the Minister has appointed the Sheriff or the County Registrar of a county or county borough, a returning office, he shall appoint a suitably qualified person other than the person whom he has appointed a returning officer to be the local returning officer for that county or county brough.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Provision is made in section 13 of the Bill for the appointment of a chief returning officer who will be responsible for the conduct of the Assembly elections throughout the State.  He will be responsible for the four constituencies provided in the Schedule to the Bill, and he will be responsible for certifying the results to the European Assembly.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill to which the amendment has been put down provides for the appointment of a constituency returning officer and a local returning officer, and provides that the constituency returning officer shall be one of the people qualified to be appointed as local returning officer.  In practice I presume that means one of the county registrars in a county which is part of the constituency will be appointed constituency returning officer.</P>
    <P>As originally drafted, the Bill seemed to provide that, where a county registrar for one of the counties forming one of the four constituencies was appointed constituency returing officer, he would also act as local returning officer.  In other words, he would have the job of acting as constituency returning officer for the Province of Munster, say, and in addition, he would have the job of acting as local returning officer for his own county.  Obviously, the job of returning officer for the entire constituency is onerous, entailing complete supervision of all the counties or county boroughs in the constituency, arranging for the election, assuming responsibility for it and, if the Minister gets his way, assuming responsibility for the count from beginning to end in the constituency.</P>
    <P>That person is still to be entrusted with the more detailed running of the election in his own county or county <Col N="243" /> borough.  When I saw the Bill it appeared to me that was a very onerous task to give to any one man. While in some counties a local returning officer will have to look after his own county or county borough only, in another he will have to do the same work and he will also have to do the work of returning officer for the entire constituency, involving up to 11 counties, I think.</P>
    <P>I put down an amendment on Committee Stage seeking to provide that where the county registrar for county A was appointed returning officer for constituency B, the Minister would appoint a suitably qualified person other than the county registrar to act as local returning officer for county A.  The Minister put down another amendment giving the option to the county registrar who was appointed constituency returning officer to appoint a deputy.  We discussed this on Committee Stage and the Minister agreed to have another look at the matter and come back with an amendment on this stage if he thought fit.</P>
    <P>The Minister has put down an amendment which reads:</P>
    <P>Where a local returning officer is appointed under this section to be the returning officer for a constituency, it shall be lawful for him with the consent of the Minister to appoint a Deputy local returning officer for the discharge of all or any particular part of his duties as local returning officer.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Minister is saying if he appoints a county registrar for a particular county as a constituency returning officer, that county registrar may then, with the Minister's consent, appoint a deputy to perform all or some of his duties in his own county.</P>
    <P>In effect, I have repeated my Committee Stage amendment providing that, where a county registrar is appointed a constituency returning officer, it shall be obligatory on the Minister to appoint a fully-fledged local returning officer for the county from which the constituency returning officer has been appointed.  My proposal is sounder than the Minister's. <Col N="244" /> If the Minister's amendment is accepted, it may be that the county from which the returning officer for the constituency is appointed may have a local returning officer other than the constituency returning officer, or it may not.  It also means that the county from which the constituency returning officer has been appointed may have half a local returning officer, or it may not.</P>
    <P>The Minister is saying the constituency returning officer may, if he wishes, with the consent of the Minister, appoint a deputy for the discharge of all or any particular part of his duties as local returning officer. That is not good enough.  It is unreasonable. I suppose we will be dealing with this on a county basis rather than a constituency basis.  There are 26 counties and a number of county boroughs.  If the Minister's amendment is accepted, all these counties and county boroughs, with four exceptions, are sure of having a local returning officer, but four or less may not have a local returning officer and may be dependent on the services of the returning officer who has the huge job of looking after the entire constituency.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The Minister may say to me that he will rely on the good sense of the constituency returning officer to appoint a deputy.  None of us is infallible or like Solomon; we are not all men of great wisdom and it could quite easily happen that if the Minister were unfortunate enough to make a less than perfect appointment of a returning officer, it is the man who might most need a local returning officer who would be slowest to appoint one.  I think the Minister will get my point.  If the Minister is lucky enough to appoint four constituency returning officers who are men of common sense, not over-anxious for power or control and who have excellent relations with their chief <Col N="245" /> clerks and the county secretary, then he will most likely have a local returning officer appointed in all the constituencies including the constituencies or counties from which the constituency returning officers come.</P>
      <P>Mistakes can be made, however, and people who are ordinarily men of great common sense and reasonable in every way can have a blind spot and decide that the right thing is to hold for themselves all the duties of local returning officer as well as of constituency returning officer.  I believe that if a person were to do that he would have some shortcomings; he would be a person who would be in most need of a local returning officer. I greatly fear that if the Minister proceeds as he is proceeding in his amendment, relying on the wisdom of the constituency returning officer to appoint a deputy, he will come across the case where for some reason&mdash;perhaps due to the personality of the constituency returning officer or that, unknown to the Minister, one of the constituency returning officers he appoints may not be on the very best terms with his chief clerk who might be appointed Deputy; or might not be on the best terms with the county secretary who I suppose would be in the reckoning for deputy returning officer&mdash;the constituency returning officer will decide not to appoint a local returning officer.  In that case, I believe the proper running of the election will suffer and you will not have the perfection or near-perfection desirable.</P>
      <P>The Minister also visualises in his amendment a situation where the constituency returning officer might not go the whole hog and appoint no local returning officer, he might say: &ldquo;I will not have anybody here taking over my powers within the county or constituency but I shall appoint a sort of mini-local returning officer who will have some of the functions but not all that a returning officer would have.&rdquo; There is a provision for that in the Minister's amendment.  I do not think that is desirable; it would probably lead to friction rather than the smooth running of the election.  I find it difficult to see why the Minister thinks fit to introduce the procedure provided in his amendment.  Let us read it again:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="246" /> Where a local returning officer is appointed under this section to be the returning officer for a constituency, it shall be lawful for him with the consent of the Minister to appoint a deputy local returning officer for the discharge of all or any particular part of his duties as local returning officer.</P>
    <P>The Minister concedes that there is reason for it.  Why would a returning officer not accept the Minister's option and appoint a deputy returning officer? I believe there is only one reason why he would refuse to appoint a local returning officer and that is his own makeup, either that he would not trust anybody in his county with the duties which would be delegated to him or that he is a man who likes power and is not prepared to shed any of it and for that reason would insist on holding all the power himself or because, perhaps, he is not on the best of terms with his chief clerk or with some other officer in the county.  If any of these reasons is the reason why the constituency returning officer would not appoint a deputy, in my opinion, it makes the strongest possible case for ensuring that he has a deputy.</P>
    <P>If the Minister looks at this from all angles I believe he will conclude that the way to deal with it is to have a clear decision.  All the Minister has to do, if he decides to accept my amendment instead of his own, is to say: &ldquo;Yes, a local returning officer is essential in each county and I shall see that there is one.&rdquo;  Apparently, the Minister accepts that, because he has provided in the Bill for the appointment of a local returning officer.  Why, then, does he not go the whole hog and say: &ldquo;In the four counties or county boroughs from which the constituency returning officers are to be recruited, there will be another person appointed?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are no grounds for saying a qualified person might not be available. That is not so.  The invariable practice is that the county registrar if there is one, acts as returning officer at Dáil elections, at referenda and Presidential elections and that the county secretary acts as returning officer in local government elections. <Col N="247" /> Therefore, one may be satisfied that there are at least two persons in each county qualified to fill this post.</P>
    <P>The chief clerk in the county registrar's office carries a lot of the burden of Dáil elections as a rule.  In almost every case he too would be fully qualified for the position.  The strongest point I want to get across is that the person who would be least likely to appoint a deputy is a person who would be in most need of one and the person who would be least likely to appoint him should have a mandatory direction in this Bill to appoint him.</P>

      <P>When we were on Committee Stage I was in agreement with Deputy Fitzpatrick's desire to see that somebody was appointed in that national Dáil constituency where the county registrar or the sheriff was the person who happened to be appointed to the position of returning officer for the Assembly election constituency.  It was a reasonable request that a person be given all the duties of the local returning officer in that area and not only part of them.  I again support Deputy Fitzpatrick on this Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see that the Minister has gone some way to meet the needs of Deputy Fitzpatrick and if it is possible at this stage I would propose an amendment to the Minister's amendment.  The Minister's amendment would meet the need better than Deputy Fitzpatrick's if we were allowed to remove from the Minister's amendment the words &ldquo;all or any particular part of&rdquo;.  This refers to the duties of the local returning officer. If the Minister's amendment read: &ldquo;where a local returning officer was appointed under this section to be a returning officer for a constituency it shall be lawful for him with the consent of the Minister to appoint a deputy local returning officer for the discharge of his duties as local returning <Col N="248" /> officer&rdquo;, I believe that the needs of Deputy Fitzpatrick and myself would be met.  My objection to Deputy Fitzpatrick's wording: &ldquo;a suitably qualified person&rdquo;, is that all sorts of questions could be raised about who is a suitably qualified person.  Would it have to be a solicitor, a county registrar, the local sheriff, or would a court messenger be suitably qualified?</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider my proposition.  It would have the same effect and would meet the needs of Deputy Fitzpatrick in requiring a person to be substituted for the returning officer in his Dáil constituency or county borough area which he was removed from in order to perform his duties as the returning officer for the constituency in the Assembly elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Since Committee Stage I have gone into this matter very fully and I asked the officials of my Department to discuss the matter with a cross-section of the returning officers throughout the country in order to get their views.  From the discussions that took place with the returning officers it is clear that they favour a flexible provision under which the constituency returning officer would have the option of appointing a deputy for some or all of his duties as local returning officer.  The returning officers also pointed out that Assembly elections will represent an entirely new situation and that the approach to them should not be hampered by rigidity.  They also said that individual returning officers tend to adopt different approaches to the organisation of elections.  Some like to have one right hand man to help them generally in the supervision of the election and others prefer to have a number of assistants dealing with different aspects of the election.  Some tend to involve themselves very closely in the detailed arrangements while others, particularly those who are responsible for more than one constituency tend to delegate more of the duties to their assistants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to the views of the returning officers it seems appropriate <Col N="249" /> to have regard also to existing practice in electoral law.  In the law relating to presidential elections and referenda there is a flexible power for a local returning officer to appoint a deputy for any part of his duties and there is similar power in the local elections code.  These provisions have worked very well in the past.  The appointment of a deputy for counting the votes is compulsory where the same person is returning officer for two or more constituencies. The reason for this is obvious.  The appointment of a deputy for other purposes has always been discretionary in the past.  The duties to be performed by the constituency returning officer and the local returning officer on examination would support the view that a flexible arrangement for appointing deputy returning officers would be more appropriate. The constituency returning officer will receive nominations, will arrange for the printing of ballot papers and for the supply of them to the local returning officers throughout the constituency.</P>
    <P>This completes his duties as returning officer at the early stages of the election and his remaining duties do not arise until the end of the election. They are to obtain suitable premises for the counting of the votes and to engage suitable staff.  The constituency returning officer will have to receive and accommodate ballot boxes on arrival from the local returning officer and finally it will be his responsibility to count the votes and to declare the result.  The duties of a constituency returning officer will arise at the beginning of the European elections and again at the end.</P>
    <P>The local returning officer, on the other hand, has no duties to perform at the beginning or at the end of the election.  He has no formal functions in relation to receiving nominations or counting votes.  His duties are to issue postal ballot papers, to employ the presiding officers and poll clerks to select polling stations to take the poll, open postal ballot boxes and check the postal voting papers and finally to deliver all the ballot boxes to the returning officer of the constituency. From the point of view of time there is no overlap between the <Col N="250" /> two sets of duties, namely those of the constituency returning officer and the local returning officer.  It is quite conceivable that the one local returning officer could do the lot in his own constituency.  It would obviously be helpful to him if he could hand over to a deputy specific duties for instance, the issue of the postal ballot papers or checking postal voting documents&mdash; and the amendment makes provision for this situation.</P>
    <P>The organisation of an Assembly election will be a big task, but there is no need to let the size of it frighten anyone.  We should bear in mind that a Dáil election in Dublin, for instance, involves close on 400,000 electors and nine separate constituencies and has always been supervised by one man, namely the City Sheriff and that deputy returning officers are appointed for counting the votes only.  Having full regard to the views of the returning officers, the desirability to be flexible with regard to the arrangements wherever possible and the existing practice in the electoral law, I am satisfied that the appointment of a deputy ought to be discretionary and not mandatory, as Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment is proposing.  We should not forget, when worrying about the various approaches and personalities of different returning officers, that we are not talking about a very big number of constituency returning officers. In all we have only four constituencies and we will have only four constituency returning officers, so there would not be tremendous variations in the characters of four people as there might be with a larger number. Having discussed this matter in great detail and my Department having got the views of the returning officers throughout the country and those views being in favour of our amendment, I am satisfied that our amendment is the right one on this occasion. I recommend amendment No. 7 and amendment No. 5 is consequential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Apparently the Minister has made up his mind pretty firmly on this subject.  I believe that the method proposed by me is the safer one and will lead to the conducting of the <Col N="251" /> Assembly election in a more efficient way.  All I am asking the Minister to do is to make obligatory what he says may be done.  The Minister says that the constituency returning officer in question may, with the Minister's consent, appoint a deputy for his own county to discharge all or some of his duties within that county.  I am asking the Minister to say that the returning officer in question shall appoint a deputy to discharge all his duties within that county.  There is not much difference between the two proposals.</P>
      <P>We will take it for the sake of argument that there are 20 counties. When you take county boroughs into account there are more, say 26 counties. Twenty-two of these are going to have local returning officers and the other four may or may not.  That is unsound. Why not have a uniform practice, applying over the entire State that each county or county borough will have a local returning officer as well as the constituency returning officer?  The Minister said that the local returning officer will not have very much to do. First of all the constituency returning officer, in my opinion, has a very onerous job.  He is responsible for the overall running of the election in the entire constituency.  The local returning officer reports to him in a lot of things and acts subject to him.  Surely to goodness the local returning officer will have a very onerous job; for all practical purposes he will have the entire conduct of the election to look after, with the exception of the nominations and the count, if the Minister gets his way.  The nominations are not a very onerous job; the count is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister gets his way we will have a position where if there is no local returning officer appointed&mdash;and we must visualise that position because the Minister's amendment leaves the way open to such a situation&mdash;a man on one county will be responsible for rounding up the ballot boxes when the poll is closed, for checking that all the ballot boxes in county A are brought in safe and sound and checked off. The same man will then be responsible for receiving those ballot boxes in another place may be 100 miles away. <Col N="252" /> That does not make sense, and that is the situation which may face us if the Minister's amendment is accepted.</P>
    <P>If boxes are lost, who is going to be responsible?  If there is no deputy how will a person check out the ballot boxes in one place and at the same time be in another place to receive ballot boxes coming from two or three miles and some coming from maybe 100 miles?  It may be said that it is the one man, but the one man cannot be in two places at the same time: and he would require to be in two places at the same time because some ballot boxes could come from his own county within a very short time but the ballot boxes in a local constituency miles and miles away would have, I presume, to be checked into one spot before being dispatched to the central counting place.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that he has got advice.  With all due respect to the county registrars, it is the most natural thing in the world that they would say: &ldquo;Yes, leave it to us and we will appoint a deputy if we consider it necessary.&rdquo;  That is understandable, and apparently that it the advice that the Minister has sought and that he has got.  The county registrars want to retain that bit of power.  That develops the point that I was making: that people like to have power and do not like it to be taken from them.  If the Minister asks the returning officers who should have the decision as to whether a deputy should or should not be appointed, it is the most natural thing in the world that they would advise that the decision should remain with them.  As I see it 24 of the 26 counties will have local returning officers while in the other counties there may or may not be local returning officers depending on the approach of the county registrars concerned. That situation is not fair to the county registrars.  Neither is it fair to the county secretaries who would be eligible to be appointed or to the chief clerk in the county registrar's office who also would be eligible to be appointed.  This type of provision is not in the interest of the proper running of the elections at local level.</P>

In other words the Minister is required to rule on a net issue, on one point only, whereas the amendment would appear to go much further and to require him to define the full range of duties of a local returning officer whenever any point of duty is raised.  I am satisfied that the provision in the Bill is preferable to the proposed amendment and, consequently, I am not disposed to accepting the amendment.  Its acceptance could lead to complications whereas the provision as drafted has worked since its introduction in the Electoral Act, 1963.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It is not my intention to raise any major controversy on this point but I do not accept the Minister's approach, that is, that simply because something appeared in the 1963 Electoral Act or in the 1937 Presidential Electoral Act or, say, in some Act of 1924 and has never given rise to any difficulty by reason of its never being questioned, we should accept it now and should not consider ourselves free to depart from the provisions or to improve them.  If that were to be the position, once a Bill had passed through this House it would be infallible forever after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never heard anybody say that one determines a doubt.  One determines a fact.  A doubt is not a fact: it is the opposite.  If the Minister has any anxiety in regard to acceptance of the amendment resulting in all the duties of the officers being thrown wide open, that question can be overcome simply.  Instead of the wording in the Bill is it not simpler to say that if any doubt arises as to the duties of a local returning officer, the duties in doubt shall be determined by the Minister?  That would make common sense.  It is our duty here on Committee and Report Stages of Bills to go through such provisions and improve them.  In this context, for example, I have never been able to understand why the law relating to Dáil elections provided for the appointment of a sub-agent <Col N="255" /> in a polling district while the law relating to Presidential elections or to referenda provided for no such sub-agent. It was not proposed in this Bill either to provide for a sub-agent but after I raised the matter the defect was made good.  I am clear, too, that there should be provision for a sub-agent in respect of a Presidential election.  However, it is only by raising such points here that we improve matters.  They will not be improved by slavishly taking provisions from other Acts on the basis that they had not given trouble to date and that, therefore, they would not hopefully give trouble in the future.  That is not doing our job properly. It is not applying ourselves to improving matters.  In the point at issue there is no major controversy, political or otherwise, involved.  If a person, speaking ordinary English, said that he would resolve a doubt, one would take it that he was talking of clarifying the position but one could not know what was meant if the person said that he intended determining a doubt.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would look at this again before the Bill goes to the Seanad.  I suggest that the last two lines read that if any doubt arises as to the duties of the local returning officer, the duties in doubt shall be determined by the Minister.  The Minister may prefer that wording to the wording of my amendment.  Opposition amendments are never put down in the spirit that their language is absolutely perfect. That is not so.  They are put down in order to establish a principle or a defect in the Bill.  I put down this amendment to establish a defect in this section.  I think I have established it and, if the Minister would accept it. I believe the section would be better than it is now.</P>

      <P>In page 9, lines 19 to 21, to delete &ldquo;the relevant representative elected to the Assembly pursuant to this Act at the last preceding Assembly election&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;by reason of the last preceding Assembly election the relevant place in the Assembly was held by a person who&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage Deputies sought to have the meaning of section 15 (1) (b) clarified.  They suggested that the draftsmen might be asked to take a further look at the paragraph, particularly at the expression &ldquo;the relevant representative&rdquo;.  This amendment proposes a change in the wording of the paragraph which it is hoped will make the meaning clearer. The wording of the paragraph presents certain difficulty because it is designed to cover a number of different situations. For example, it covers a situation in which the elected representative <Col N="257" /> dies and must be replaced.  It also covers a situation in which the replacement, in turn, dies and the vacancy must be filled again.</P>
    <P>Perhaps an example might help to illustrate the point.  Let us say that at the Assembly election a Mr. Brown &mdash;with no disrespect to the Chair&mdash;a candidate for Party A is elected to the Assembly; a year later he dies and, under this section, Mr. Black is appointed by the Dáil to fill the vacancy on the nomination of Party A.  Subsequently Mr. Black changes his allegience and joins Party B. Say, a few months later he too dies or becomes disqualified&mdash;for whatever reasons there are for disqualification &mdash;in accordance with this section the Dáil will look to Party A and not Party B for a nomination to fill the vacancy.  In other words, any time a particular seat falls vacant during the life of an Assembly it will be filled by reference to the political affiliation of the candidate elected to the seat at the preceding election, at the time of that election.</P>
    <P>I would hope that this revised wording would help to clarify the matter in this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I know the Minister is trying to help me to clarify the position. I know that it is the politics of the person who was elected at the last <Col N="258" /> preceding Assembly election, who may die, resign or be disqualified, will determine the politics of the person who will fill that seat until the ensuing Assembly election.  I know that that is what the section wants to do.  But what did and still gives me trouble&mdash;and I do not think the Minister has put it beyond doubt&mdash;is where it says &ldquo;in case the relevant representative&rdquo;. There is no definition of the word &ldquo;relevant&rdquo;.  As this paragraph stood it says:</P>
      <P>(b)  in case the relevant representative elected to the Assembly pursuant to this Act at the last preceding Assembly election was at that election a candidate of a political party which at the time of the said election was and for the time being is registered pursuant to this Act in the Register of Political Parties, the person appointed under this subsection to fill the vacancy shall, if, but only if, the nomination is made within three months of the day on which the vacancy occurred, be a person nominated by that political party.</P>
      <P>My problem is that if I were asked to adjudicate on this would I know what the word &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; meant?  I suppose I would if I said: &ldquo;I do not know what the section is saying but I know what it means.&rdquo;  I would have to say that because, reading the section, I do not really know what it is saying.  But I know that the sense of it is that they are talking about the fellow elected at the last Assembly election who died, resigned or was disqualified. The Minister's amendment does not improve matters either.  It says simply:</P>
      <P>In page 9, lines 19 to 21, to delete &ldquo;the relevant representative elected to the Assembly pursuant to this Act at the last preceding Assembly election&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;by reason of the last preceding Assembly election the relevant place in the Assembly was held by a person who&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The subsection would then read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  in case, by reason of the last preceding Assembly election, the <Col N="259" /> relevant place in the Assembly was held by a person who ...</P>
    <P>There should be inserted a definition of the word &ldquo;relevant&rdquo;.  Without any training as a draftsman, which I have not, without any consultation with any such person or without resorting to a parliamentary draftsman's library, I suggest that an additional paragraph be added to this section, to be known as paragraph (c) and should read something like this:</P>
    <P>in this subsection &ldquo;relevant representative&rdquo; means the representative elected at the last preceding Assembly election whose death, resignation or disqualification caused the original casual vacancy.</P>
    <P>The only thing there giving me any trouble are the words &ldquo;original casual vacancy&rdquo;.  If I were redrafting that I would say:</P>
    <P>in this subsection the &ldquo;relevant representative&rdquo; means the representative elected at the last preceding Assembly election whose death, resignation or disqualification caused the vacancy now being filled, or the vacancy giving rise to this vacancy.</P>
    <P>I would suggest something like that, when we would also have a definition of the word &ldquo;relevant&rdquo;.  Indeed I think the word &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; is defined in many Acts of Parliament, and I think the Minister will find it has been so defined in various sections of various Acts of Parliament.  I know what is meant.  If I were a judge and were to use my common sense, rather than be compelled to reply on the section.  I believe I would arrive at the right decision.  I do not think the section should be drafted like that or that it should leave this House like that if it can be improved.  I hope I have made my point clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I may make two comments on this section. A very new and important principle has been introduced, under this section to the Irish political scene in that the Minister in this Bill&mdash;and let us face it, also in the previous Bill&mdash;intends to adopt the party allegiance of a member rather than the member's <Col N="260" /> wishes himself as to who should fill the vacancy.  The proposal here states that if a person should change his allegiance and then die one goes back to the ballot paper and consults it to see which party in whose favour the candidate stood.  When making out ballot papers I always understood the political parties' aim was to avoid any likelihood of confusion.  The procedure now suggested will have a significant effect in that it commits a seat in the European Parliament to a party and not to an individual.  That is a new procedure in Irish politics and it is worth pointing it out now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The parliamentary draftsman drafted the amendment on the conclusions arrived at in the debate on Committee Stage.  This was what he was guided by.  Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment does not take into consideration the original casual vacancy.  A simple example would be where a person is elected to the European Parliament and thereafter is appointed a Minister of his national government and thus he could not continue as a Member of the European Parliament.  Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment, unlike mine, would not cover such a situation.  As I have pointed out, my amendment was drafted as a result of the debate on Committee Stage.  I am quite satisfied from my discussions that it covers all that is required to be covered.  It is quite adequate without any further changes.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy Kavanagh, I thought it was more or less unanimously accepted that if a man who was elected to the European Parliament on behalf of Party A dies that party should be entitled to the seat despite the fact that the person originally elected may have changed his allegiance to two or three parties.  In my opinion the fairest procedure is that the seat should go to the party that originally won it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="261" /> In page 15, to delete lines 53 and 54, and in page 16, to delete lines 1 to 11, and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  A candidate, his election agent or his local agent may appoint with respect to any polling district in the constituency one deputy local agent to assist the candidate in the polling district and to act therein as deputy for the candidate's election agent and local agent.</P>
    <P>(3)  An appointment under this Rule may be revoked by,</P>
    <P>(a)  in case the appointment is made under paragraph (1) of this Rule, the candidate,</P>
    <P>(b)  in case the appointment is otherwise made under this Rule, the candidate, his election agent or his local agent.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where an appointment under this Rule is revoked or an agent appointed under this Rule dies, resigns or becomes incapable of acting during an Assembly election, another agent may be appointed pursuant to and in accordance with this Rule to replace him.</P>
    <P>(5)  The name and address of every agent appointed under this Rule (whether originally or substitutionally) shall immediately after the appointment be communicated by the person by whom the appointment was made to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in the case of the election agent, the returning officer,</P>
    <P>(b)  in the case of a local agent or a deputy local agent, the local returning officer.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill in relation to the appointment of agents is modelled on the corresponding provision in the law on presidential elections.  Unlike the Dáil electoral law there is no mandatory requirement to appoint election agents in presidential elections.  Instead there is a discretionary power for the appointment by a candidate of an election agent to assist him generally and a local agent to represent him in each county and county borough in the Assembly constituency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> The Dáil electoral law permits the appointment of a sub-agent or deputy agent for each polling district but there is no provision for sub-agents in the law relating to presidential elections. The present Bill makes no provision for sub-agents presumably on the grounds that in this respect the Assembly elections may be more akin to presidential elections.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on Committee Stage it was suggested that some candidates, particularly those who would not be in a position to have a personation agent in each polling station, might wish to appoint a sub-agent to look after their interests in a polling district.  The amendment makes provision for the appointment of a deputy local sub-agent in respect of any polling district and it includes the usual provision for the replacement of such an agent if he dies, resigns or if his appointment is revoked.  That is the purpose of the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): As the Minister has said, his amendment was introduced to meet the point referred to by me, namely, that in Dáil elections during the years provision was made for a personation agent for each polling booth or presiding officer's table and, in addition, provision was made for a sub-agent for each polling district.  No such provision was made in the Presidential Elections Act, 1937 or in the Bills dealing with referenda.  Apparently when drafting this Bill the parliamentary draftsman followed the procedure in legislation dealing with presidential elections rather than with general elections with the result there is no provision here for the appointment of sub-agents.</P>
      <P>I thought that was a mistake.  I said we should avail of this measure to draw attention to defects in it and in other electoral measures.  I am glad the Minister has checked on what I have said and that he has put down the amendment which meets the point raised by me.</P>

      <P>I do not want to say or do anything I should not do or say, but I must refer the House to columns 1250, 1251 and 1252 of the Official Report dated 17 November, 1977, where these matters were raised by me with particular reference to the point I want to make now.  I referred to the position of a candidate who was a next door neighbour of the returning officer and who died at 8.30 a.m. on the morning of polling day and I outlined what would happen.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): With respect I submit that I raised this matter.  I want to put on record that, if Rule 20 (1) and (2) is allowed to stand, a position may arise where you have excluded days, as happened this year, when a bank holiday intervened between the closing of nominations and the date fixed for withdrawals.  If a person died hours before the closing of nominations on Saturday, by virtue of Rule 20 (1) and (2) he would be deemed to have withdrawn his nomination and his party could not possibly have found an alternative candidate within two hours before the closing of nominations.  It might very well be that the sole representative of a party died at 10 or 11 o'clock on Saturday.  By virtue of this rule he would be deemed to have withdrawn and that party would <Col N="264" /> have been deprived of a candidate in that constituency.  That would be the position if this rule is allowed to go through without writing into Rule 20 (2) after &ldquo;hours&rdquo; in the second line &ldquo;disregarding any excluded date&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If I were moving the amendment, naturally I would be speaking at greater length and spelling out how this can happen.  It says &ldquo;within 72 hours of the time fixed for withdrawals in the last general election was 12 o'clock on Tuesday.  Nominations closed on Saturday and Monday was an excluded day.  Therefore, we would have 72 hours between 12 o'clock on Saturday and 12 o'clock on Tuesday.  Because of the rule as drafted if a person died at 10 o'clock on Saturday and the county registrar knew about it, he would be obliged to have regarded that person as having withdrawn his nomination and the election would have gone merrily along and that party would have have any candidate to replace the deceased candidate.</P>

      <P>In page 20, lines 4 and 5, to delete &ldquo;other names are the same, in the alphabetical order of their occupations&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;surnames and other names are the same, in such order as shall be determined by lot by the returning officer&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Rule 22 of the First Schedule deals with the form of ballot paper and sets out the directions to be followed in the preparation of the ballot papers. Paragraph 2 (a) contains the standard provision about the order of names on the ballot paper.  In accordance with this paragraph the names are to be in alphabetical order of the surnames or, if there are two or more candidates with the same surname, in the alphabetical order of their other names; or if their other names are also the same, in the alphabetical order of their occupations.  This is identical with the corresponding provision in other electoral codes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="265" /> During the debate on Committee Stage it was pointed out that, if the occupations were identical as well as the surnames and the Christian or other names, the returning officer is given no further guidance as to what order the names should appear on the ballot paper.  Deputy Fitzpatrick gave an instance of two Patrick O'Reillys at a local election.  Having considered what is involved here, in my opinion the simplest way to meet this point, without spelling out the matter in very exhaustive detail, is to provide that whenever two or more candidates have identical surnames and Christian or other names, their order on the ballot paper will be determined by the returning officer by lot.  This amendment provides accordingly.  During the Committee Stage debate we all agreed that the simpler the Bill the more acceptable it is to Members and the public at large.  This amendment simplifies the issue somewhat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I accept the Minister's amendment, which fully meets my point.  As he says, the rule as drafted provided that names should appear on the ballot paper in order of surnames, or if they were the same, in order of other names, or if they were the same in order of occupation.  In certain counties very frequently the same surnames and Christian names crop up time after time.  I imagine in Donegal you might have many O'Dohertys and McLoughlins and in Cavan you could have McGoverns, Reillys, Smiths and Bradys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My attention was drawn to this because on one occasion we had two Patrick O'Reillys on the ballot papers, both were respected members of this House at different times, both were farmers&mdash;I have not checked up on this&mdash;one had a second occupation. Perhaps that occupation decided their order on the ballot paper, but if he did not use his second occupation I do not know how this problem was resolved. This is the kind of thing which could give rise to a big row because you know how jealous people are about getting their names high on the ballot paper.  Commentators sometimes think that in certain circumstances <Col N="266" /> people go for the members of a party highest on the ballot paper and that results in unfair preference.  That is all right if names are placed in order pursuant to a well defined and clearcut rule.</P>
    <P>If there were two Tom Fitzpatricks, as in this House, and we were both publicans or solicitors and were in the same constituency, we might easily have a row as to which of us would be first on the ballot paper.  The Minister's amendment puts this beyond doubt and I accept it.

I believe that is a slip and that it came from lifting a marginally defective Schedule from some other <Col N="267" /> Bill and putting it into this one.  If I am correct I believe that &ldquo;section&rdquo; should be deleted and the word &ldquo;rule&rdquo; inserted.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is right. The amendment rightly draws attention to a drafting error.  The reference to &ldquo;section&rdquo; should, of course, be to a &ldquo;rule&rdquo;.  I would like to thank the Deputy for bringing the matter to our notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 22, Rule 28, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  It shall be an offence for any person to interfere with or use a polling card addressed to an Assembly elector for the purpose of influencing or inducing that elector to vote or to abstain from voting or to vote in a particular way.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We had a discussion on polling cards on Committee Stage.  It was not seriously contradicted that sending out polling cards from the returning officer to each elector on the register of electors, giving him his number and telling him where he can vote, is helpful. I do not think it was seriously contradicted either that those polling cards lead to abuses and can facilitate personation.  We have, for example, in the city of Dublin a moving population of flat dwellers who may move from one area to another and may have been correctly placed on the register of electors at a given address. However when an election is about to take place they may have moved away but the polling cards are delivered to those addresses.  It is common knowledge that those cards in many cases are collected by political enthusiasts and used to vote on behalf of those addressees, in other words, to commit personation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an offence and those people could be imprisoned.  I believe those polling cards can be used in other ways to take unfair advantage of the <Col N="268" /> addressees especially if they are not too bright or old or infirm or in many cases if they are inmates of institutions. I believe those polling cards are withheld in some cases and those people feel they have not a right to vote.  In other cases some people may get possession of those polling cards and use them to persuade some of those people to accompany them to vote or suppress them altogether when those people think they are not entitled to vote.  Polling cards give rise to serious abuses.  It should be the law that whether a person lives with a family, lives on his own or lives in an institution his polling card should be delivered to him and retained by him.</P>
    <P>I know that this amendment is not perfect but it conveys my sentiments on the particular practice which prevails in many cases in relation to those polling cards.  My amendment would add another paragraph to Rule 28 as follows:</P>
    <P>It shall be an offence for any person to interfere with or use a polling card addressed to an Assembly elector for the purpose of influencing or inducing that elector to vote or to abstain from voting or to vote in a particular way.</P>
    <P>That does not mean that I want to outlaw fair canvassing.  I want to outlaw malpractices in connection with those polling cards.  It is tied with a system of companion voting about which I have a later amendment.  If the drafting of my amendment does not appeal to the Minister, an amendment should certainly be inserted in this Bill and, at the first opportunity, in all Electoral Acts which would make it a very serious offence for anybody to deprive a person of a polling card or to use a polling card as an inducement, a decoy or some way of getting that person to vote.</P>
    <P>I may be told that a person who takes one of those cards is committing the offence of larceny and that such a person could be convicted and could have a penalty imposed.  That is true, but larceny involves permanently depriving a person of something which belongs to him.  If a person means only <Col N="269" /> to keep an elector's card until the day of the election for fear that particular person would lose it or do something foolish with it and intends returning it on the day of the election, that would not permanently deprive the owner of a polling card and no offence would be involved.  That person, however, could be guilty of sharp practice from an electoral point of view.  I believe polling cards were introduced approximately 20 years ago.  They are a great help in built-up areas of cities and large towns but they lead to some undesirable practices.  I want to spell that out.  Some amendment, such as the one I suggest, should be incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage both sides were agreed that the purpose for which the polling card was originally intended had often proved less than successful.  In the recent general election there were postal delays and cards posted on Thursday did not reach the recipients until the following Monday or Tuesday.  In some cases they never reached the recipients at all.  At best, polling cards lead to a great deal of confusion.  If a voter does not receive one he may feel hurt and refuse to go out and vote because he knows his neighbour has got a card and, to the former, that ranks as an invitation.  Again, it is a simple matter to become possessed of polling cards in areas in which there are flats.  Inquiries are made and it is found that certain tenants have moved out to another area and the cards are used for purposes of personation.</P>
      <P>I do not know if Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment would solve the problem.  I think the best thing would be to do away with these cards altogether. Candidates and electors now have the facility of radio and television, to say nothing of elaborate election literature.  Why could not voters be informed that their names are on the register?  Surely computers could be used here.  They are used by the ESB for sending out bills and by local authorities for the purpose of sending out the rates demand.  Why not have a central computer bank to send out this information to electors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he would look at <Col N="270" /> the problem.  If he is not going to accept this amendment then he should introduce an amendment himself.  He may be able to do something to solve the problem.  I do not know if these cards are sent out in local elections but I certainly see no need for them in today's circumstances.</P>

      <P>Both sides agreed on Committee Stage that the issuing of polling cards was anything but satisfactory. I agreed then to have a look at the procedure and I said we could return to it on another occasion.  We were all agreed there were abuses and confusion was created and I intend to review the situation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the amendment, it is possible for an unscrupulous person or even a party worker to come into possession of polling cards where voters have died or left the area and such a person may prevail on others to use the cards rather than chance using them himself.  The situation appears to be adequately covered in the Bill.  Under Rule 72 (1) a person who applies dishonestly for a ballot paper may be charged with personation while the person who supplies the polling card would appear to be open to a charge under Rule 72 (3) af aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of the offence of personation.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Yes.  Technically it probably is covered by Rule 74 of the Schedule.  I put down the amendment in order to spell this out because I believe polling cards are being used in many ways to persuade people to vote in a certain way or to get to know who is entitled to vote.  This thing goes on in institutions.  The polling cards should be delivered to the addressees so that they can do what they like with them.  They should not be kept in the custody of institution staffs whose duty it might not be to look after the cards and whose only interest in them would be to identify the addressees and, perhaps, to persuade them to vote in a certain way.  There should be some offence created in addition to the omnibus one on page 41 dealing with undue influence.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 26, line 19, after &ldquo;companion&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;whom he shall nominate by name&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not entirely unrelated to the previous amendment.  Rule 39 provides for voting by blind, incapacitated or illiterate electors.  The rule, I am sure, has been taken from <Col N="272" /> previous Bills and it is to facilitate in a genuine way blind, incapacitated or illiterate electors to vote as they wish; in other words, it is to facilitate such people to express their personal genuine wishes at election time.  This is a comparatively recent innovation.</P>
    <P>The position used to be that a person voted in the ordinary way by going in to the polling booth, marking his paper and putting it into the ballot box, or, if he were an illiterate or incapacitated person, he went to the presiding officer who marked the ballot paper as the person wished to have it marked, showed the paper to the agents and then put it in the box. The new system provides that an illiterate person must still vote in that way but a blind or otherwise incapacitated person may have the help of a companion who may go into the booth with him, mark the paper for him and put it in the box.</P>
    <P>But just as the polling cards were introduced to facilitate people but led to confusion and serious abuse, as Deputy Kavanagh has said, I am afraid this has also come to be abused seriously in regard to unfortunate people who are confined to institutions and who are beyond voting, because in the past they have been able to communicate their views to the presiding officer or to a companion.  Such people are being brought in from institutions, and the first chore on the day of an election is to descend on old people's institutions to get them out and to the polling booths.  That chore is entrusted, I regret to say, to ruthless people and that system has gone beyond the standards of decency.  Some of those old people have walked in, some of them have been carried and some wheeled into polling booths.  It generates ill-feeling between the parties in the polling booths on election morning and it is most undesirable.</P>
    <P>The companion to whom this would have been entrusted would have been a relative or a friend, not some political enthusiast from several miles away charged on the morning of election with getting first to the county home or old people's home.  My amendment is to paragraph (3) of Rule 39 which states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="273" /> Where this Rule applies in the case of an Assembly elector who satisfies the presiding officer that his sight is so impaired or that he is otherwise so physically incapacitated that he is unable to vote without assistance, the elector may request that his ballot paper shall be marked for him by a companion and, subject to paragraph (4) of this Rule, the companion may go with the elector into one of the compartments in the polling station and there shall mark the ballot paper for the elector and shall fold it and show the back of the folded paper to the presiding officer so as to disclose the official mark and forthwith place the paper in the ballot box.</P>
    <P>My proposal is to add the words &ldquo;whom he shall nominate by name&rdquo;. I have personal knowledge of people being brought out to vote who could not talk or communicate with anybody in regard to how they wanted to vote. There is provision for an oath of affirmation to be administered by the presiding officer, if requested to do so by a personating agent, and the elector swears that he or she is incapacitated. We know that some people have been brought in by companions to vote but when they were freed or released from the companions they voted in a way diametrically opposed to the way in which the companions would suggest.  It is time something was done about it.  That happens. I put down this amendment to highlight this.  The difficulty could be overcome if all returning officers in booths which are used by large numbers of incapacitated or elderly people knew the rules thoroughly and were prepared to enforce them.  The rules are there and a personating agent can insist that a person swear that he or she is incapacitated and wishes that somebody should mark the ballot paper for him or her.</P>
    <P>It is an insult to human dignity that the old people I am talking about should be treated in this way, and they are so treated.  It is politically offensive that this should be so.  I would suggest to the House that the rules should be amended by making it obligatory on the person who seeks <Col N="274" /> the assistance of a companion to nominate by name that companion. It may be said that it is not fair and that it is posing a burden on the elector.  It is not the elector I want to get at; it is the person posing as his companion who is not actually his companion.  I have put on the record of this House the feelings I genuinely hold about this abuse.  The amendment I have put down would improve matters but I also believe that the strict and rigid enforcement of the rules by a presiding officer who is known to be a stickler for rules and has a good knowledge of them would make this practice unprofitable and bring it to an end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The change which allowed a person to vote through a companion was a desirable one.  It allowed a number of people to vote who would not otherwise have done so because they were not prepared to accept the embarrassment and indignity of having to vote by the illiterate process.  Rather than be classified as illiterate, some people took the ballot paper, went to the box and either did not mark it at all or made a total mess of it because they did not want to indicate to a friend or neighbour who happened to be a presiding officer that they did not have the ability to mark the ballot paper properly.</P>
      <P>The provision whereby a companion could accompany that voter was a desirable and humane one but it has been abused.  The extent of this abuse is difficult to determine.  Most companions who accompany voters do the job they are intended to do and are <i>bona fide</i> companions, perhaps brothers or sisters, and they carry out the wishes of the voters honestly and fairly.  Most people have already made up their minds as to which way they will vote and they have a voting pattern and simply want someone to help them out.  This has allowed an area of abuse at a time when it is impossible to do anything about it. When the paper is in the box there is little point in making a fuss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has previously stated that something should be done about this problem but whether he intends <Col N="275" /> to do so in this Bill I do not know. Because of malpractices that have developed, there will have to be a stricter definition as to who is a companion and the duties he must undertake. A stricter penalty must be introduced for abuses.  A possible way of stopping such abuse would be by the compilation of a register whereby a person would make an application before voting to be accompanied by a companion and the personating agents of all parties should have their say before that person arrives into the polling station.  It is a political fact of life that on the morning of the poll there is great activity and people are dragged out in mini-buses from local hospitals and homes.  Sometimes they do not understand why they are being taken out.  They are accompanied by companions who have very strong political allegiances.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will say something about this problem and how he intends to tackle it.  It is irritating that the electoral process can be upset and the result changed by practices such as those outlined, either with regard to polling cards or the improper use of the facility to vote through a companion. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment or undertake to bring in his own legislation to deal with this problem.</P>

      <P>The motive behind this amendment is very laudable and praiseworthy.  It is designed to protect the disabled from unscrupulous people, party workers or otherwise.  It is my contention that simply naming the companion in the polling station would hardly fulfil the purpose intended here. If the unscrupulous person can persuade a disabled person to allow him to go along as a companion, surely he can persuade the disabled person to nominate him when they go into the polling booths.</P>

      <P>My contention is that it is not sufficiently adequate to protect <Col N="276" /> the person.  On Committee Stage I agreed that there was great need to look at the legislation in relation to incapacitated voters.  At that time I said we would look at the legislation in a general fashion to see if we could improve it.  With respect, the present proposal may go some of the way but it would be preferable to carry out a full review.  I recommend that the provision in the Bill, which is identical with the arrangements in the existing electoral codes, should stand until we have had an opportunity to review the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It seems to be common-case&mdash;and it could not be otherwise because we are all aware of the political facts of life&mdash;that this rule is being abused in a way that is no credit to those who abuse it and it is an affront to the dignity of the elderly people concerned.</P>
      <P>I put down my amendment to afford me an opportunity of saying what I have said.  I do not believe my amendment would go the whole way but it would at least ensure that the elector could talk and in that way communicate with a companion.  An experienced presiding officer, such as an officer from the county registrar's office, would go a long way towards eliminating abuses.</P>
      <P>The difference between an illiterate voter and an incapacitated voter is not understood.  Many officers do not appreciate the difference between how an illiterate voter should vote and how an incapacitated voter should vote.  An illiterate voter must vote openly through the presiding officer while an incapacitated voter has the right to vote through a companion.  I agree with Deputy Kavanagh when he says that this rule, properly used, is a desirable facility for incapacitated people. I agree that before this rule many incapacitated or blind people did not want to vote in front of their neighbours. It is better for them to be able to go into the polling booth with some member of their family to have their vote recorded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am of the opinion that people <Col N="277" /> confined to old people's homes who have home addresses in their constituencies should be registered under their home addresses.  Those who have no home addresses are entitled to vote in institutions, but many people in institutions are in contact with their families and they should be put on their local registers.  If this was done it would reduce the snatch-and-grab operations on the morning of elections.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has recognised the abuses that occur.  I do not propose to press the amendment as I take the Minister as saying that he intends to have an in-depth look at the abuses referred to under this amendment and under the polling card provision, and in regard to other defects in the electoral law in respect of which amendments have not been put down. I have no way of compelling the Minister to do that, but I am grateful to him for saying that the law needs to be looked at and that he intends to do so, in order to remedy the abuses and shortcomings.  It is only right that the electoral laws should be considered now and again.  It is apparent from our discussion that no worth-while consideration has been given to updating the electoral laws since the foundation of the State.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 26, line 45, after &ldquo;agents&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Poll clerk and Garda on duty&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="278" /> I put down this amendment to officially recognise a procedure that has been in operation for many years. It is an amendment to paragraph 5 of Rule 39, the provision dealing with the marking of ballot papers by the presiding officer on behalf of illiterate electors.  Rule 39 (5) states:</P>
    <P>(5)  Where this Rule applies and&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the Assembly elector is illiterate, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the Assembly elector does not request that his ballot paper shall be marked for him by a companion, or</P>
    <P>(c)  the Assembly elector having so requested, the marking of his ballot paper by the companion would be in contravention of paragraph (4) of this Rule,</P>
    <P>the presiding officer shall, in the presence of the personation agents and no other person, mark a ballot paper as instructed by such elector and shall then fold it and place it in the ballot box.</P>
    <P>If that is the rule it has been breached, in my opinion, at every polling booth for the last 50 years where an illiterate elector voted, because the acknowledged practice is that the poll clerk and the garda on duty are allowed remain on.  I understood from the Minister that his interpretation, and that of his Department, of the rule is that the poll clerk and the garda must leave the polling booth.  I understood that nobody is entitled to remain, with the exception of the presiding officer and the personating agents.  In my view the practice is correct. It is strange that a poll clerk, an official of the returning officer, should be excluded while the personating agents are allowed remain.</P>
    <P>In rural Ireland the garda on duty is regarded as the most important person around the place.  He is regarded as the person who keeps law and order and one who is as important as the presiding officer.  If the law is as is stated in that rule then that should be known everywhere and poll clerks and gardaí excluded.</P>
    <P>I would not agree with that action because it is not necessary or desirable. <Col N="279" /> A poll clerk is a part of the staff of the polling station and he has many duties to perform.  When the name of the elector is read out the poll clerk must cross it off the register.  A garda is required there to preserve order. For example, a person could approach the polling station under the guise of an illiterate voter, ask to vote and when the garda is excluded throw a lighted match into the ballot box. That is one reason why it is necessary to have a garda there.  It would also be necessary to have a garda there if two personating agents started to fight.  I do not think it was the intention of those who drafted the Bill to exclude poll clerks and gardaí.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience is that the practice varies from that outlined by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  In my view the individual presiding officers never interpret this rule properly.  The procedure varies from one polling station to another.  We are all familiar with the call to clear a polling station when an illiterate person comes in to vote, and this means on occasions that everybody is put out and the presiding officer insists that only himself and the illiterate be left.  I accept that that is the exception.  In my view it would be better for the garda to be outside the door of the polling station keeping unwanted persons out so that the business of the illiterate voter is not interrupted. I do not think it is necessary to have a garda present.  While presiding officers are selected carefully by the returning officer that does not happen in all cases with poll clerks. On occasions this job is given to people with no experience and it is possible that they would be given to gossip.  I would prefer to see the Minister leave well enough alone in this matter and continue with the existing procedure, even though it may have been interpreted wrongly on many occasions.  The voter, if he wishes and knows the rules, can ask that the poll clerk and the garda be excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We are speaking about a blind, incapacitated or illiterate voter who has the same right to the <Col N="280" /> secrecy of the ballot box as anybody else.  It is all-important that we protect the secrecy of the ballot and it is essential that as few as possible are aware of how an incapacitated person voted.  The presiding officer and the personating agent, or agents, are permitted to remain in a polling booth when such a person is voting.  As I stated previously, the garda and the polling clerk are not entitled to be present and if they have been permitted to remain on in the past the fault for this lay with the presiding officer who did not read his instructions properly.  The function of a garda at a polling station is to maintain law and order in the area.  It is permissible to have the presiding officer and two personating agents present.  That means that three, or four at most, would know how such a person voted.  To increase that number and include a garda and a polling clerk is unnecessary. The unfortunate person anxious to vote secretly like everybody else would be overcrowded.  I can see no reason for accepting the amendment because it would infringe further on the rights of such voters to have secrecy.</P>
      <P>It is not always necessary for the two people concerned to have to go outside the station.  We are all aware that in urban areas halls are used for such voting and it is usual for the presiding officer and the personating agents to move down the hall to an area away from the crowd to conduct the business.  I can see no reason for allowing the poll clerk or the garda to remain there, thereby infringing the right of the voter to secrecy.  Already this has to be infringed by the presence of a presiding officer and personating agents.  I am afraid I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

By and large, the practice as outlined by me, which is that the presiding officer, the poll clerks, the Garda and the personating agents remain, is the practice.  I was surprised to hear the contrary is the practice.  If it is the practice&mdash;and I do not disagree to any great extent with the Minister&mdash;it should be written in black and white into the instructions. Many presiding officers will be surprised to hear that.</P>
    <P>It may be written in as it is in the Bill and I suppose that covers it, but I do not think any presiding officer ever took the exclusion &ldquo;and no other person&rdquo; to include his assistants, the poll clerks, or his protectors, the Garda.  On a vast number of occasions it has been operated as I have said.  If the Minister feels strongly about it, to put it beyond doubt another line should be put in to say the exclusion includes the poll clerks and the Garda.</P>
    <P>I certainly do not agree with excluding the poll clerk because I believe he has a duty to perform.  He performs one duty and the presiding officer performs another.  The poll clerk has custody of the register and he marks off the voter when he has voted.  It might happen, and it often did happen, that an illiterate voter was not capable even of voting illiterately.  In such a case, his name would not be marked off the register.  So the poll clerk has a function to perform.</P>
    <P>This may sound like having two bites at the cherry but I believe it was never intended that the poll clerk should be excluded.  He is part of the staff.  This is a matter of what is right and what is wrong but I do not propose to press the amendment.  I suggest the Minister should make inquiries as to what happens throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I move amendment No. 19:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="282" /> In page 29, to delete lines 43 to 45, and substitute the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  The local returning officer shall appoint a place within or convenient to the constituency as the place at which he will open the ballot boxes and arrange the ballot papers in parcels as hereinafter provided and shall at that place so appointed provide suitable accommodation and all furniture and equipment necessary for opening the ballot boxes and arranging of the ballot papers in parcels as aforesaid.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These three amendments propose to have the first count in the election conducted locally at a local centre in each county.  The Minister, Deputy Kavanagh and I have already had a fairly extensive debate on this.  The Minister's proposal is that the entire count, including the opening of the boxes, the checking of the ballot papers against the ballot paper account, and the first count, should take place in a centre in each constituency.  This would involve transport of up to a couple of thousand ballot boxes from all over a constituency into one huge counting centre and the recruiting and transport of a greatly augmented staff to the central counting place.</P>
    <P>I am not too clear why the Minister insists the entire count should be conducted in a central place, rather than having the first count conducted locally, and then conveying the ballot papers, sorted in bundles under the name of each candidate, in a few boxes to the central place.  I cannot understand why the Minister insists on this new departure, because new departure it is.  There is no precedent for it in this State.</P>
    <P>At a Presidential election the votes are counted in the local constituency and then the ballot papers are brought to Dublin.  The first count is conducted in each of the local constituencies and then the ballot papers are brought to the city where the second and subsequent counts, if there are such, are conducted.  In the past, on one occasion there was a second count in a Presidential election and it was <Col N="283" /> held in the city of Dublin.  The first count was held throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The same procedure is followed in referenda.  The votes are counted in the local constituencies and the total sent to Dublin with the ballot papers. The ballot papers are sent under an Army escort.  That has been the procedure in the past and it has worked well.  So far as I am aware there were no complaints about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he has considered the method in the Bill, that is, to have one counting centre in each constituency, and he has considered the method put forward by me, and supported by Deputy Kavanagh, that is, that the first count should be conducted in each local constituency and the papers forwarded to the centre in each constituency, sorted under the names of the candidates.  The Minister concedes either system would work. That is the worst he had to say about it.  His information is that his system would work and that the old system worked.  My advice is that the Minister's system would work but it would work inefficiently.  It would lead to difficulties and possible dangers because it involves rounding up all ballot boxes for the constituency of Connacht-Ulster into one place and then the transfer of about 2,000 boxes to one central place.  There may be more than 2,000 boxes in one centre; I am averaging them.  A fairly formidable Army escort will have to be provided for those boxes and at the same time a similar escort will have to be found for Dublin city and county, and for the remainder of Leinster and for all Munster.  A huge building will have to be found at some centre in each constituency. We know how difficult it is to find a building sufficiently commodious and comfortable in which to conduct the count when there is only a local constituency involved.  In this case there will be the greatest difficulty, when the security difficulty has been overcome, of accommodating the count in a suitable building.</P>
    <P>There will be the additional difficulty of augmenting the staff by several times to carry out the counting. <Col N="284" /> Staff will have to be recruited from outside constituencies, conveyed to the centre and kept overnight.  That cost will have to be borne.  As I said, and as emerged from our discussion here today, broadly speaking, within the rules, different returning officers apply the rules in different ways but get the end results right.  The same applies to counting.  Different returning officers have different approaches; some have two checkers on a box when it is opened; some have three and some four.  Some facilitate agents in seeing boxes being opened and checked; others are not so accommodating. There will be a mixed staff with varied experience and different interpretations of the broad rules.  Will they be brought in a couple of days beforehand and instructed by the constituency returning officer as to his understanding of how the count should be conducted?  If so, will that not lead to further trouble and expense and take people away from their full-time jobs in other counties?</P>
    <P>I also made the case earlier&mdash;a very real one&mdash;about the difficulty in adjudicating on doubtful votes. Usually, there are 200 or 300 spoiled votes in a normal constituency but doubtful votes usually number several times that figure and I suggest there would be at least a couple of thousand in a local constituency.  When you multiply that by eight or 11 you find that a huge number of doubtful votes will have to be adjudicated on and investigated. I repeat that only one man can do that.  I do not accept that you can have one mind determining what is a valid vote in one county and another deciding what is a valid vote in another county in the same election. One person in the central counting place will have to adjudicate on each doubtful vote, an enormous task which will slow down the count. When the count is over, although there is no great urgency, the ballot boxes will have to be returned, involving more time and money.  Therefore, the overall cost of conducting the count in one place will be considerably more than in conducting it locally.</P>
    <P>Apart from the difficulties and inefficiency that a central count will involve <Col N="285" /> it is another major step towards centralisation and another major blow at local democracy.  Before each election we hear lip service paid to the necessity for people to exercise the franchise.  That is made possible by the full co-operation of political parties.</P>
    <P>This is sometimes over-enthusiastic, as I complained earlier but you get the people out by maintaining local interest.  Fears are being expressed at present that there will not be as much interest as is desirable in the European election.  The way to kill interest is to have an impersonal approach and having the count in a central position scores of miles away from parts of the constituency is bound to lead to that.  We politicians know how keen is the demand among key workers and political enthusiasts for tickets for the count.  They want to be there, see what goes on, see boxes opened and how one town votes as against another, one parish as against another.  That will all be out of the question.  You will not get people to travel the long distances involved here and if they did travel, you could not accommodate them in the central counting place.  That is one of the major objections from the politicians' point of view to the central count.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh, on Committee Stage, raised the very good point that it is quite possible that at some time you will have an Assembly election and a local or other election on the same day.  If that happened it is absolutely certain that ballot papers will find their way into the wrong box, that general election papers&mdash;if there is a general election&mdash;will be put into the Assembly box and the Assembly paper into the Dáil ballot box.  If that happens, and even if it is known immediately or shortly after it happens, nothing can be done about it until the boxes are opened because nobody is entitled to open boxes during the count once they have been sealed.</P>
    <P>The ballot paper for the Dáil election or the local election, as the case may be, will be hauled miles away and if the Minister has his way the local count will begin immediately and the Assembly count may not take <Col N="286" /> place for several days.  When the Assembly ballot boxes are opened it may transpire that Deputy Begley from Kerry has been wrongly eliminated or that one of his county council candidates has been wrongly eliminated because a vote for him was in Cork or some place else instead of in Tralee or Dingle.  That is too horrifying to think about.  We may laugh about it but there is nothing so important for a person who stands as a candidate in an election as that he should get elected.  It is bad enough if he is not elected, but there is nothing so frustrating as to find out a week or three days after the election that not alone was he defeated but that he was defeated when there were still enough votes left to elect him.  That man will go down into his grave, decades after, bemoaning that and feeling a sense of grievance because of it.</P>
    <P>There is no way that can be avoided if the Minister does what he intends. The Minister complained that in order to avoid that it would be necessary to postpone the local count for perhaps a couple of days because the Assembly count cannot take place until all the elections in the member states have concluded and that those elections might not conclude until the Sunday, whereas it is unlikely that out election would be held later than Thursday.  If that is so, it would be much better to delay the local count for a couple of days rather than elect the wrong candidate. I believe that the election should be held here on a Saturday and that all the counts should commence on the following Monday.  The Minister knows that it is politically unthinkable that we should tolerate a system here under which two elections can be held on the same day and where the result could be that the wrong candidate could be elected.</P>
    <P>Even if the Minister agrees with me and decides to commence the count in each case at the same time but to conduct the counts in different places he will find that it will be necessary to send ballot papers hundreds of miles whereas at present if a mistake is made it is only a matter of sending the ballot paper from one room to another within a building or sending it from the town hall to the courthouse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> The Minister is on record as saying that either system will work.  For the purposes of this argument I accept that, although the Minister's system will not work well.  It will give rise to all sorts of difficulties.  I put it to the Minister that the arguments are overwhelmingly in favour of my system&mdash;from the point of view of avoiding a mix-up when two elections are being held on the same day with disastrous results, from the point of view of security in transferring these boxes long distances, perhaps in the midst of winter, from the point of view of recruiting staff for the count and conveying this staff long distances from one end of a constituency to another to the counting place, from the point of view of the enormous task that is involved in adjudicating upon thousands of spoiled votes, and having regard to the fact that the Minister admitted that he had been advised by experienced returning officers that they were in favour of my system but against his.</P>
    <P>The Minister argued here today for his system of appointing local returning officers, that he was adhering to his method of giving the constituency returning officer the right to appoint or not to appoint a deputy because he had been advised by an experienced cross-section of people whom he had consulted that that is the way they wanted it.  On the last day the Minister admitted that the same people, presumably had advised him that they wanted the count conducted locally, but he is not prepared to accept that. It is beyond me why the Minister holds on so doggedly to this innovation.  Innovations are dangerous especially when there is a considerable volume of opinion against them.  The Minister is holding on to this innovation against a system that has worked.  We try another system invariably to replace a system that has proved faulty or which has disclosed abuses, but we do not usually have an innovation or a new system to replace a system that has worked well.  This system has worked well.  I have argued in favour of my amendment at some considerable length on Second Stage and on <Col N="288" /> Committee Stage and I am renewing that argument now.  I have no doubt that the proper procedure is to hold on to the Presidential system of voting &mdash;the tried and approved system, the system that has given satisfaction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage we should do everything to ensure that the largest possible turnout is provided for the European Assembly elections. If we can assist in some way through this Bill to ensure that as many people as possible give their verdicts on our entry into Europe and elect the 15 members for Europe, we can certainly face any criticism if the turnout is in excess of the 60 per cent level, which is usually the figure that we have in a local election turnout.  If the figure drops below 50 per cent it will be open to any critic in Europe to say that there is apathy and lack of interest in the country with regard to the Assembly election.  The Minister is contributing to this when he refuses&mdash; as he has done on Committee Stage; maybe he will change his mind today &mdash;to accept the amendment of Deputy Fitzpatrick which would allow the first count stage to take place in the county and county borough areas. When the results come in in each county and county borough area and the first count takes place in those areas, then the traditional electorate for the Dáil constituencies can judge the strength of the various parties.  Each of the four constituencies is huge, and if all the votes for one constituency are brought together to the central counting place for a constituency as large as Leinster, the returns will tend to be less immediate and this will tend to blur the result for a lot of people in so far as those people will not be able to compare where loyalties have lain from one election to the next within their traditional constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local party workers in this election are going to be vital to ensure a large turnout.  The local party worker is the person who gives his time freely and for nothing in all our parties.  If he is not involved in the result then there will be a great diminution of effort in all of our party machines in getting out the electorate for this election.  If these party workers cannot without <Col N="289" /> great expense to themselves go to a counting centre and watch the ballot boxes for their traditional constituencies being emptied out, if they are not there to do their traditional jobs of checking and cross-checking the ballot papers and scrutinising them, if these very important people who are the backbone of our electoral system are deprived of that then we will see a drop in the number of people voting.  All the countries of The Nine will be watching this election and it will be vital to the successful conclusion of the election that there is a relatively high turnout.</P>
    <P>The Minister is wrong in thinking that the result of this election could be achieved more quickly by taking all the ballot papers into one central area within the Assembly constituency.  The know-how and expertise of local constituency counters is now well established and the first count could be accomplished far more quickly if it proceeded within each county or county borough area where there are the traditional counters with their expertise bringing about a first count result which will to a large degree, because the seats are limited within each of these constituencies, indicate clearly to within probably two seats of the 15 exactly what the result is going to be.  The political commentators will probably go even closer to the final outcome if they get the first count figures.  The succeeding counts will obviously have to continue in the central area, but the heightened interest which always goes with the sorting of ballot papers and the first count figures will satisfy most people in an election of this nature.  The Minister has not an amendment of his own here, and I hope that he will accept Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment.</P>
    <P>I have one reservation on the amendment. It states:</P>
    <P>(4)  The local returning officer shall appoint a place within or convenient to the constituency as the place at which he will open the ballot boxes...</P>
    <P>I believe that Deputy Fitzpatrick wants that to mean the county or county borough within the Assembly <Col N="290" /> constituency and that when he mentions &ldquo;constituency&rdquo; at that level he does not intend to mean the Assembly constituency but he wishes that the count continue in those constituencies which are the traditional Dáil constituencies within the Assembly constituency.</P>

Supposing a member decided to stand for the county council and for the European election and the two elections were held on the same day.  In the European election it is possible that a lot of candidates will stand who have no chance of being elected. This will be strategy in order to get out the maximum vote.  If the European election count was taking place in, say Cork and the county council election count was taking place in Tralee, a vote thrown into the wrong box could make a big difference to that county council.  I ask the Minister to consider seriously the points made by Deputy Fitzpatrick.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Health to devise a system of differential grants for the mentally handicapped which will take account of the degree of handicap and the extent of home care required; that powers of admission to and discharge from all institutions for the mentally handicapped be under the control of a panel of public health psychiatrists and social workers employed by the Health Boards; that an approved points system be established to decide <Col N="291" /> priorities for admission to residential and day centres for the handicapped, such a points system to take into account (a) the degree of handicap, (b) behaviour difficulty, (c) disruption of family life, (d) family circumstances; and the health boards be instructed to undertake their statutory obligations for the care of the mentally handicapped by providing a special annual budget for this purpose.</P>
    <P>In the entire domain of our health and social welfare services the issue that has been the subject of least public exposure, of the least legislative effort and the least political interest has been the quality of care for the mentally handicapped.  We have had benign neglect and more than 50 years of indifference in this area. That is the only way to characterise the total lack of Government policy and commitment to the mentally handicapped, their families and friends and the voluntary organisations who have unselfishly provided care for the mentally handicapped since the foundation of the State.  Both as a Parliament and as a people our record in this sphere is one of dismal failure.  We have seen fit to ignore the problem whenever and however possible.  We have hived off our responsibility and placed it on the shoulders of a few voluntary bodies.  We have allowed these bodies to skimp and to scrape on piecemeal finance facilities.  We have ignored the plight of those both inside and outside residential care just as we have ignored their families and friends.  We have tolerated conditions in mental hospitals that would disgrace the Victorian age, merely implementing paltry reforms and these only when the cries of scandal became so loud and so frequent that even we as politicians could not ignore them.</P>
    <P>As legislators we have been extraordinarily lax in our efforts.  The friends and the champions of the mentally handicapped have come to rely on press exposes, certainly not on parliamentary initiative, in regard to the hope of some reforms being implemented. We know that newspaper <Col N="292" /> scandals are short-lived, that after a few weeks of national attention and of a few token gestures on the part of the authorities we return to the <i>status quo</i>, to a state of tolerance of the problem that borders on criminal complacency.</P>
    <P>The motion I put before the House tonight is not in any way a party political motion because there is no single political party, no Government either past nor present, that do not stand indicted for the legacy of indifference and neglect of the mentally handicapped for which we must all share the blame.  This motion is concerned solely with practical and immediate measures to alleviate the problem now by ensuring that the State meets its statutory obligation to the mentally handicapped and that the anomalies which bedevil our system of residential care will be remedied as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>At the outset I should like to examine the situation that prompted this motion.  According to a census conducted in 1974 by the Medico-Social Research Board and organised by Dr. Michael Mulcahy, there were 11,256 mentally handicapped people in Ireland, representing an incidence of 3.8 per 1,000 of the population.  This total includes those of moderate, severe or profound disability and does not include those with borderline or mild mental handicap.  When compiling the census Dr. Mulcahy decided for a number of reasons to exclude cases of mild mental handicap.  Of the total mentally handicapped tabulated in the census, 55.9 per cent were in residential care while 44.1 per cent were living in the community.  The main problem is with the latter group of 4,863 persons who are living outside residential care and for the majority of whom living in the community is a real hardship. These people need residential care.  Of the total, 20 per cent are in the five to nine age group.</P>
    <P>Although the concept of community care is very popular and represents the way of the future in most types of health care, it is not a panacea for all our problems.  In the case of moderate, severe or profound mental handicap, the concept of community care is no solution at all.  This is a point on which we must be clear from the outset <Col N="293" /> if we are to crystalise the issues before us.</P>
    <P>Community care is desirable for the mildly mentally handicapped but for all other categories of mental handicap residential care is essential.  In this regard we are falling down badly.  Large numbers of mentally handicapped are being deprived of residential care for two reasons.  First, there is an appalling lack of provision of residential centres for the adult mentally handicapped and, secondly, there are anomalies in the procedure for admitting mentally handicapped persons to places in residential homes.  These anomalies have resulted in 22.6 per cent of existing places being taken up by people who should not be there&mdash;cases of borderline or mild mental handicap.  These are the cases that belong in the community and for whom adequate day-care facilities should be provided.</P>
    <P>I shall elaborate a little further on this point.  According to the census there were 8,652 places in residential homes of which 2,359 were taken up by borderline or mild cases, cases which those who compiled the census did not see fit to include in the final tabulation for the prevalence of mental handicap.  Therefore, we must ask how many of these borderline or mildly-mentally handicapped persons belong in residential care and, if a substantial number can be excluded, how many actual places have we for the treatment of the moderate, severe and profound mentally handicapped who really need residential care. According to the census there were at least 1,319 cases of mildly mentally handicapped with no behaviour difficulty and there were 514 borderline cases whose presence in residential care was related to social factors and not to mental handicap.  Therefore, there were a total of 1,833 who did not belong in residential care and who were preventing those with moderate, severe or profound degrees of mental handicap from receiving care.  This is a very serious situation.  It leaves us with only 6,918 places actually devoted to the care of the moderate to profound mentally handicapped. Having regard to the 1974 census showing a return of 11,256 people with <Col N="294" /> such handicap we can see that there is a shortage of more than 4,000 places. It may be that more places have been created in residential care since 1974 but the incidence of handicap will ensure that the proportion between places and those outside residential care would remain as it was in 1974.</P>
    <P>We have, then, two clear problems before us.  The first is the overall shortage of residential centres for the adult handicapped and the second is the large number of places being taken up by cases of mildly-mentally handicapped persons who would be treated best in the community.  The first problem can be solved best by the Department instructing the health boards to introduce a special annual budget of sufficient size to provide residential and day-care facilities to meet existing needs in each health board area in the shortest time possible.</P>
    <P>The second problem can be solved best by the introduction of a points system for admittance to residential centres.  As I envisage such a system it would be administered by an independent panel of health and social welfare experts on the basis of the degree of the mental handicap and of the family circumstances.  I admit that the solutions that I am suggesting are not easy.  They demand that once and for all the State must accept its responsibility to the mentally handicapped and must provide the financial commitment and the administrative expertise necessary to ensure that there are adequate facilities managed equitably in accordance with criteria of need.</P>
    <P>Is it not time that the State stopped shirking its responsibility to the mentally handicapped?  We can no longer get by with a mental health week once a year and with ritualistic pats on the back for the voluntary organisations who are providing care for the mentally handicapped.  We must accept responsibility as a community as well because the increase in the finance necessary for decent care must eventually come from the community. It will have to cost money and we will have to pay the price. Our respect as a self-proclaimed Christian country is at stake here.  In <Col N="295" /> demanding that the State meet its responsibility I am in no way denigrating the work of voluntary organisations in the care of mental handicap. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to state that it is to the voluntary organisations that we owe a debt of gratitude for the dedicated service they provide here today for our mentally handicapped. For much of the time the voluntary bodies have worked in anonymity while nobody knew the real extent of the problem.  Throughout the years they have worked under appalling conditions. With lack of money they faced a near impossible task and carried the full burden of care for the mentally handicapped.  The State at the time abrogated its responsibility with a few flattering remarks on the work done by the voluntary groups.  At the time the public viewed mental illness as an unnatural aberration, a condition to be swept under the carpet at all costs and be hidden away.</P>
    <P>To a very large extent things remain the same today.  But there is hope: mental handicap has at last taken its first tentative steps out of the shadows of superstition and ignorance.  The public here are beginning to hear of the rights of the mentally handicapped to suitable care.  Parents and relatives who are affected are becoming less and less content to keep quiet.  They realise that their loved ones are entitled to proper care and, in the light of the present inability of the system to cope, the State does have an obligation to them and must respect that obligation. It is not a case of the parents wishing to shake off their responsibility.  We must always remember that we are talking of the moderate to the profound mentally handicapped, those who require institutional care, not those whose parents would like to pass off and shrug their responsibilities. No, these need quality residential care. They are cases which cannot be cared for in the community and their parents have a right to obtain quality residential care for them.  The time is long overdue when a more militant position was adopted by the parents of mentally handicapped children.  In the hard realities of modern pressure group politics the voice of protest is heard <Col N="296" /> only when organised and persistent.  In this regard I should like to acknowledge the work being done by the Association for the Rights of the Mentally Handicapped in lobbying for a just and adequate service for the mentally handicapped of Ireland.  They are doing great work and I wish them every success with it.  The establishment of such a service is dependent on the State meeting its obligation both financially and administratively.</P>
    <P>The specific proposals in this motion outline the manner in which this obligation can be fulfilled.  First, the Department should institute a system of differential grants so that all available resources are distributed according to the level of prevailing need.  The present system, under which a global grant is paid in respect of a number of institutions, is not an effective means of ensuring that scarce financial resources are allocated to areas of greatest need.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the wording of the first portion of my motion is a little ambiguous and may confuse the Minister. I apologise for that because he may understand it to mean that I am looking for differential grants in respect of the constant care allowance for severely-handicapped children.  On that score I should like to say, as I have already mentioned to the Minister, that the £25 introduced in 1973 is totally inadequate to meet the parents' needs.  While the Minister will agree with me that the cost of living has increased by over 100 per cent since 1973, it would mean that we should out of justice to these people increase that amount 100 per cent to meet the rise in the cost of living.  It would constitute a small gesture to the benefit of a person needing constant care.</P>
    <P>Other very important points are the powers of admission to and discharge from institutions for the mentally handicapped.  This power should be placed in the hands of an independent panel of public health psychiatrists and social workers employed by the health boards.  It would be incumbent on this panel to assess and grade the degree of handicap, to consider a social report on the family and home circumstances of the child or children <Col N="297" /> in question.  This could be done according to a points system, the points being allotted to the degree of handicap, the behavioural difficulties, the disruption of family life and other family circumstances.</P>
    <P>The problem at present is that parents whose children have a moderate to profound handicap have no information whatsoever available to them as to when their child is likely to be admitted to an institution.  Also they cannot see how other children are being admitted before theirs. Parents feel that they are up against an arbitrary system in which they see places going to cases which to all appearances are of a markedly less serious nature.  That is the situation obtaining at present.  That there is substance in these anxieties on the parts of parents can be gauged from the fact that the 1974 census showed that there were at least 1,319 places taken up by those who should not be in residential care.  There may be cases where a mildly mentally handicapped child or children were admitted for a good reason, but without a points system there is no way of knowing.  Any system of admission to these institutions must not only be just but must also be seen to be just.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the social workers involved in mental handicap.  I received from them this morning a document relating to the work they are doing in this field.  I understand they have formulated a points system, strangely enough, at the request of the Mental Handicap Committee of the Eastern Health Board. They submitted their proposed system to the committee early in 1977 but, aside from an acknowledgment, have received no further communication. They worked out a comprehensive points system based on familial factors, factors specific to the handicap and community and economic factors. It is an equitable and flexible system and could provide an ideal guide for an independent assessment panel.  I am not saying it is the complete solution, but there is among workers in the field of mental handicap a realisation that there is the need for a points system to be established.  They feel the one they have produced for the Mental <Col N="298" /> Handicap Committee&mdash;by the way, at their request&mdash;should be taken as a guideline, examined and perhaps used to form the basis of a pilot study.</P>
    <P>They put forward the following arguments for their points system: firstly, the limited resources presently available to the mentally handicapped must be allocated to those most in need.  They say the present system, where resources are insufficient to meet existing needs, creates injustices.  For example, those families who pursue their applications more vigorously or who are fortunate enough to have a persuasive advocate would have an advantage over the person without such influence.  They say that, though it is impossible to quantify human suffering, a points system is the only equitable solution so long as it is flexible enough to take into account objectively verifiable causes of stress, strain and suffering as well as subjective responses to certain extenuating circumstances or events.  They emphasise the crucial importance of consultation on a points system with the administrators of all the voluntary and statutory agencies at present providing care as well as the other professional groups working in the field.</P>
    <P>They stress also that any points system would need to be tested in a pilot study before being finalised. They make the point that the points system should work in conjunction with a clearing house and a centralised waiting list.  They put forward the following argument in favour of such a system: they say there is no way a given applicant can know which residential centre is more likely to accept an application at a given point in time.  One person can be on a number of waiting lists for different residential centres which have different sized lists and different criteria for admission.  They continue to say it would be more equitable, efficient and advantageous for all to establish a central waiting list and clearing house to co-ordinate and standardise the criteria for residential placement.</P>
    <P>Any waiting list will create problems when people do not know where they are placed on such a waiting list. Indeed the housing list of Dublin Corporation was for many years a source <Col N="299" /> of grievance to those on it because they did not know where they stood on the list.  When I finally got on to Dublin Corporation the first motion I moved was one calling for the introduction of a points system.  Everyone will agree that the points system is working fairly well.  The people know that nobody can jump the list&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally those at the bottom of the list know that their chances are not so good and they may condemn any system that does not give them an opportunity to get ahead. The system has worked and is seen to be fair.  I am not saying that the previous system was not fair but the people did not know where they stood. When one cannot explain to someone how others have got ahead one is in great difficulty.  Not only is justice done but it is seen to be done and I am sure that the vast majority of those on the corporation housing list will agree that it is fair.</P>
      <P>There is no such thing as a waiting list for admission to residential homes. Recently I asked the Minister a question regarding the number on the waiting list but he said there was no way of knowing because people apply to different places.  I am suggesting that we establish a points system, one that will give points based on the degree of handicap, behaviour disorders, disruption of family life and family circumstances. In that way we would know the extent of the problem and we could tell people how long they would have to wait.  We should associate that with a central clearing house that could decide to what place they should assign a child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason why we cannot have a points system.  I agree that it is impossible to quantify disability accurately.  The city medical officer in Dublin awards points on the basis of medical evidence submitted to him in respect of people who are seeking houses from the corporation.  He is responsible for people getting medical priority by awarding points in respect of disability in the household.  In respect <Col N="300" /> of thalidomide deformities and various disabilities, the points system has been introduced successfully.  The points system is working successfully in Britain for admission of the mentally handicapped to residential homes.  There is a precedent for it, we have seen it can work and there is no reason why we cannot introduce it here.</P>
    <P>It could be worked by setting up a panel of doctors and social workers in each health board area.  They would examine each child, set up a register of every mentally handicapped child and award points on the basis of the handicap, behaviour disorders, disruption of family life and the family circumstances. It is essential that these places be allocated on the criterion of need and a thorough and objective assessment of such need should take place.  I agree that a points system will not be perfect but it can be applied equitably in the medical domain as was shown by the thalidomide cases and in instances where the city medical officer gave priority where there was medical evidence put before him.</P>
    <P>The establishment of proper priorities by way of a points system must take place in the context of the health boards accepting their full statutory obligation to take care of the mentally handicapped by introducing a special annual budget for this purpose. To date the health boards have been content to await the efforts of the voluntary organisations to raise funds and to produce plans for day and residential facilities.  While the health boards are happy to throw the burden on the voluntary organisations, it is the thousands of mentally handicapped persons and their families awaiting the provision of institutional care who are suffering.  Some 44.1 per cent of the mentally handicapped are living outside residential care&mdash;I am not talking about the mildly handicapped people.  Children are growing to adulthood in residential homes and are staying on because there are not enough places for them.  The number of places for mentally handicapped people is getting smaller each year. The large number of mentally handicapped outside residential care does <Col N="301" /> not mean that there are adequate day centre facilities for them.  These are devoted mainly to the mildly mentally handicapped.  I must emphasise again that I am talking about the moderate to profound mentally handicapped&mdash; the 44 per cent figure.  On the basis of the 1974 census we are short more than 5,000 places in respect of residential care for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>Voluntary organisations cannot be expected to cope with the financial and administrative strain of providing additional places, much less to handle the demand for the additional day centres and for general programmes aimed at the updating of the standards of all our institutions for the mentally handicapped.  The voluntary organisations cannot be expected to cope with such a tremendous demand.  The only organisation that can cope with it, one that has an obligation to do so, is the State.  It can produce the finance and the administration.  It is up to the Department of Health to allocate a special annual budget to each health board.  At present area health board expenditure for the mentally handicapped is subsumed under a number of headings so that there is no way to gauge the precise amount of finance available in each area.  The system must be changed.</P>
    <P>We have no places for multiple mentally handicapped.  Special places are needed for the treatment and care of these people.  I would envisage each area health board being asked to compile a register of the mentally handicapped in their area.  On the establishment of such a register each person could be assessed on the basis of the points system I have outlined. A special budget could be provided on an annual basis to meet each health board's requirements for day and residential care as well as a capital building programme to provide the extra places needed.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the facilities available at day centres.  I do not deny that efforts have been made to provide good facilities for such centres but there is also the question of getting a mentally retarded child to such a centre.  How does he travel to the <Col N="302" /> centre?  He may have to travel on a few buses and some of the children are so retarded this may not be possible. The facilities may be there in the centres but the transport problem is a serious one.  What happens in the case of a mute child who must take two buses to get to the centre?  Such a child could quite easily get lost. Some parents have complained that the children are regressing at the centres because of inadequate facilities.</P>
    <P>We should talk about improving the day centres as well as providing more residential places for the moderate to the severely mentally handicapped. Our target must be to cater for all such people in each health board area within a period of three to five years. This can be done only by having a register, by having a points system and by providing a special budget for the purpose.  The register would not only be an effective way of planning for the provision of sufficient facilities but it would let the parents of the children know where they stood on the list.  If the health boards were to adopt a special budget, for the first time the parents would see some light at the end of the tunnel, they would realise that something was being done for them.  Most of us here have come across cases of parents seeking places for badly handicapped children.  This poses enormous problems especially in large families where they are unable to cope.</P>
    <P>We are refusing to face up to the fact that there is an onus on the State to provide for such cases.  I see no reason why health boards should not be directed to take an active role in ensuring that adequate facilities are provided for the care of the mentally handicapped in their area.  They should accept this responsibility.</P>
    <P>Planning and building must commence now.  In the meantime, the points system would ensure that places that are available would be granted to those in greatest need.  Although the specific details of the programme I have outlined tonight might be open to some change, the introduction of the points system, the register and a special budget for each health board <Col N="303" /> area would help solve the problem.  I know this will cost money but I have no doubt the Minister will be sympathetic towards it.</P>
    <P>I realise that the health boards accepting their statutory obligations in this regard will mean more money from the Department.  I know the Minister must have a set of priorities. I accept that fact and appreciate it more than anyone, but he will agree that the people most in need should be catered for.  We have to provide the money.  If we are to accept the slightest veneer of self-proclaimed Christian society, we cannot stand aloof from this.  We must face up to our responsibilities to the thousands of mentally handicapped in need of care.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister is concerned about the problem.  He has indicated that the whole area of mental health legislation is under review and he intends to improve it.  This would be a step in the right direction.  I know he wants to do something about the waiting list; I am not blaming him for that. He has done a tremendous job already as Minister for Health and this calls for my congratulations.  I was saying earlier what a person can do as Minister for Health without spending one penny and the Minister has done this.</P>
    <P>Where the present day centres are unable to cope, we must provide better services.  This motion provides the Minister with an opportunity to take swift action.  He might mention all the new places that have been provided since 1973.  The mentally handicapped are living longer due to the tremendous technological advances in the last ten to 20 years.  Prior to the antibiotic era many of them died and now they live into late adult life.</P>
    <P>The Minister may quote the fine work being done by voluntary organisations. I praise these organisations for what they have done but it is not enough to pat them on the back and say they have done wonderful work. We have to come to their aid now. They are living in difficult times.  They are facing growing problems and are unable to cope.  They want a better system.  They want more help.  We have an obligation to help them.  They have <Col N="304" /> carried this burden for us over the years and we cannot praise enough all the work they have done.  We would be burying our heads in the sand if we do not realise this.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot ignore the plight of the thousands outside residential care who are in desperate need of accommodation.  We have to face up to this.  There are practical and financial obstacles to health boards assuming their statutory obligations. I do not think there are obstacles to compiling a register, establishing a points system, letting people know exactly where they are on the list and having a central clearing house.  That can be done without any great effort and would be appreciated by all.</P>
    <P>If we refuse to face this fact now, if we say &ldquo;no, we will not do it, because we are doing wonders as we are; the State has provided so much and voluntary organisations have done wonders,&rdquo; then we are really saying that we do not give a damn about the mentally handicapped.  I do not care how we wrap it up.  We can say: &ldquo;Feasibility problems&rdquo;&ldquo;enormous difficulties for the Department&rdquo;&ldquo;scarce resources&rdquo; or any other bureaucratic euphemism to excuse our inaction.  We may try this but I do not think it will work.  We are only fooling ourselves if we approach it that way. We have to realise that the mentally handicapped do not have the political muscle to force change.  This calls for our legislators to move in and see what we can do on their behalf.  This is not a party political motion but one we should all be concerned about.  I earnestly appeal to the Minister to give it consideration.</P>
    <P>What if we just say &ldquo;Let them be. Let them stay at home&rdquo;?  Are we saying euthanasia is the answer?  That is what we are implying if we ignore our obligations to the mentally handicapped. Should we do that?  If we do not accept our obligations to these children, if we leave the 4,000 at home living in terrible circumstances, if we do not provide residential care for them, we had better be honest and say &ldquo;We will introduce euthanasia&rdquo; and that will solve the problem immediately.</P>

      <P>I would like to congratulate Deputy O'Connell on introducing this motion.  We all agree that the care of the mentally handicapped is and should be a priority area for every one of us.  However, the Deputy wants the State to fulfil its statutory obligation but I want to know how he sees the State fulfilling that statutory obligation.  In this motion he calls on the Minister for Health to devise a system of differential grants for the mentally handicapped taking account of the degree of handicap and the extent of home care required.  In principle most of us would agree that there should be some rational system of deciding the kind of aid required, the extent of aid required, the difficulties associated with particular homes and degrees of handicap.  How to allocate and apply such differentials is another question.  I very much doubt if a system which is paralleled in the allocation of housing is the right answer for dealing with such a sensitive and delicate area as the allocation of priorities among various mentally handicapped adults and children. Nevertheless, in principle I agree that there should be some rational way of doing this.  In contrast, currently there is such a rational way and these factors are taken into account in the allocation of priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This leads us to the second point, that is, that powers of admission to and discharge from all institutions for the mentally handicapped be under the control of a panel of public health psychiatrists and social workers employed by the health boards.  Here we have to link these two points.  The differential grants must be available in relation to the degree of handicap and the admission to and discharge from all institutions being under the care of a special board raises a number of questions.  The first is this: Who currently provides the aid and assistance for the mentally handicapped?  Who has provided it over the years?  My information is that 90 per cent of the care is provided by voluntary organisations. Yet, in Deputy O'Connell's proposal I see no reference to the inclusion of voluntary organisations on the suggested board.  Consequently it is <Col N="306" /> very difficult to see how such a board could be effective in the first instance or realistic in relation to the people who are doing the work.  In management terms it would be an extraordinary arrangement, because the people doing the work and administratively organising it, and who have done so over the years, seem to be excluded from this arrangement.</P>
    <P>The people doing the work are the Daughters of Charity, Glenmaroon, St. Michael's House, St. Joseph's in Clonsilla under the Daughters of Charity, St. Teresa's in Blackrock, St. Vincent's in Limerick, The Sacred Heart of Jesus and Mary in Monasterevin and Delvin, St. John of God Brothers, Drumcar, Celbridge and other places and the Rosminian Fathers.  I could go on with many more voluntary groups.  The administration of the St. Michael's House group is a very good example for all of us in relation to the sophisticated approach of a voluntary organisation. Their operations are widespread and their administration is very directly related to the needs of the organisation. They have centres at Belcamp, Raheny, Clontarf, Ballymun, Grosvenor Road, Drimnagh, Templeogue and Goatstown, the administrative headquarters.  They have adequate care units, long-term training centres, adolescent groups, group home children, special care units and a range of other provisions for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>Those people carry out their work in a very dedicated fashion and in a comprehensive way.  I have visited many of those units and have found the standard of their administration leaves very little to be desired other than that they have more priorities to be met and they have further work to do.  I cannot see why people like those need another board separate from them to organise and co-ordinate admissions to and discharges from all of those institutions.</P>
    <P>I believe there is scope for greater co-ordination of the work of all the voluntary organisations.  If there is to be such co-ordination it must be a coalescing of the people directly involved in the work.  That is not to suggest that the people mentioned here, <Col N="307" /> the public health psychiatrists and social workers, are not providing very valuable services under the health boards.  When we are talking about co-ordination we must include in it the people who are currently doing the work.</P>
    <P>I find that co-ordination among those institutions is not as bad as has been indicated.  The health boards are currently responsible and, to a large degree, they fulfil their statutory obligations but they are not able to do everything.  I find there is a ten-year plan for each area.  I do not know how much further Deputy O'Connell wants the planning to go.  In the plan for each area the voluntary groups are invited to state what they will do as part of the plan.  This shows very clearly what is missing in relation to the State fulfilling its statutory obligation.  The operation and administration of the service by the health boards is highly co-ordinated.  The voluntary organisations provide plans.</P>
    <P>I also find there is a budget for each voluntary group, especially the major groups carrying out large and diverse works in this area.  All the voluntary groups are invited to fit their own budget in and indicate what the priorities are in their budget.  Each voluntary group prepare and put forward a budget as part of the overall health board area's requirements.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Connell that in regard to our overall budgeting we should give more attention to the amounts of money provided for the mentally handicapped in our annual budgets.  This is a global matter. Deputy O'Connell has rightly raised the question of providing additional facilities, accommodation and housing. Those facilities require capital.  There are great needs at the moment.  I find, when looking at the organisations involved here, that they need junior care units, adult care units, hostels and group homes, sheltered workshops and special adult care units.  Those organisations are at the moment putting forward their requirements in regard to facilities for the future.</P>
    <P>I agree, and I am sure the Minister also agrees with Deputy O'Connell <Col N="308" /> that there are many things which we will have to do.  I know from experience that the Minister has a great interest in this area and in the care of the mentally handicapped generally.  I am, therefore, confident that he will do all in his power to increase the resources which are available for the type of specialised units and facilities that are needed for the mentally handicapped and which in many instances have been very clearly specified.</P>
    <P>With regard to co-ordination much technical co-ordination goes on at the moment with regard to the mentally handicapped, I understand that even this area is to be improved further in the future.  Finance is the greatest problem. There is a very fundamental question raised in relation to this motion about the mentally handicapped.  It is not, as Deputy O'Connell said, a political matter.  It is a question for everyone in Dáil Éireann individually and collectively and in relation to our work outside in our communities and as a people.  The question is: How much are we prepared to give to the mentally handicapped?  How much are we prepared to give to back those people who are doing the work and also to provide, where necessary, directly through the State, the facilities which cannot be provided by the voluntary organisations? How much are we prepared to allocate from our annual budget?  How much is anybody here prepared to set aside?  How much extra are we prepared to pay if we have a special allocation, either individually or collectively, for the mentally handicapped?</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Connell said, there are certainly great hardships and great needs.  I have come across such cases myself in the course of my work.  However, Deputy O'Connell tended to over-emphasise the need for residential care.  Indeed, one of the things that has always struck me is the fact that so many parents are so anxious to devote so much of their time to their mentally handicapped children, requiring at times from the State and the societies help in easing their burden by providing specialist teaching and helping them in coping with these children.  I am thinking now of non-ambulent mentally handicapped children.  In <Col N="309" /> such cases parents put endless hours into caring for these children.</P>
    <P>One of the problems that arises here stems from the fact that one cannot mix the non-ambulent with the ambulent because the former would quite literally be walked on and so a specialist unit must be provided for these children.  Now, as I say, I have been very impressed with the care and attention lavished on these children by parents but I would like to see specialist assistance provided for them in specialist teaching and training units.</P>
    <P>One of the edifying results of past efforts has been the success of the services so far provided and here I would like to record my commendation of those who preceded me here.  A major problem now is the increased life span of the mentally handicapped. They are now being trained to work. This is the result of a tremendous input of resources in terms of both manpower and money.  But this creates a problem because, since these people are now living longer and living better lives, they need to be accommodated at a more sophisticated adult level. This, in turn, provides a new challenge for society&mdash;a challenge we should be prepared to meet.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell referred to accepance and change in attitudes.  Acceptance by society of mentally handicapped who have been to a large extent rehabilitated and brought to a level of participation which no one would have envisaged some years back will become more important as time goes on.</P>
    <P>Here, I would make two suggestions. First of all, we should look at the possibility of mixed workshops, instead of just sheltered workshops.  There should be a mix of the normal and the mentally handicapped.  I am speaking now from personal experience.  In Kilbarrack the old folks' home was originally designated as a sheltered home, implying that those for whom it catered would need a great deal of assistance.  Only about 25 per cent would, in fact, fall into that category. The remaining 75 per cent were fully mobile and active.  The result is that a mix like that leads to a more normal <Col N="310" /> atmosphere and a healthier environment. In regard to the mentally handicapped then we may now be at the stage at which we should be looking at the possibility of mixed workshops.</P>
    <P>The second point is the possibility of extending employment premiums to employers prepared to provide employment for the moderately mentally handicapped.  I understand some of these premiums are available but I should like to see them publicised more because we will need more opportunities and outlets for those who have been trained to a fairly high degree by the organisations catering for them.</P>
    <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy O'Connell.  We should do more for the mentally handicapped. We should be ever vigilant in their interests.  We should certainly care for and about them.  We should be forever examining objectives and provisions to see what more can be provided for them.  From the point of view of timing, we should at this juncture be giving the whole problem top priority.</P>
    <P>I would not support the motion because I have every confidence in the Minister where this problem is concerned. I know, again from personal experience with constituents, that he is giving urgent attention to the whole matter and I am sure he will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>I would not support the motion because the mechanisms suggested smack too much of a misguided bureaucratically controlled system which would not and could not relate directly to either the people who are doing the work or to the work itself.  I do not believe the suggestions made are necessary at this point in time.  That is not to say we cannot improve the system.  There is always room for improvement.  I have every confidence the health boards as they evolve will meet requirements in this regard.  Nothing should be done to discourage the voluntary organisations which are providing 90 per cent of the care at the moment.  In contrast to Deputy O'Connell, I would rather build on what is there and expand the operations of the voluntary organisations. I would rather back them, back <Col N="311" /> the Minister and his Department and the health boards in the good work they are doing and provide more money for the work they are doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It was either in the 1974 report of the Medical Socio-Research Board, to which Deputy O'Connell referred, or in the earlier report of the Commission on Mental Handicap that mental handicap was defined as ranging from those so severely mentally and physically impaired as to require continuous lifelong care and supervision to those who needed only special forms of education or training during their formative years.  That definition is a good one and gives an indication of the degree of the treatment and care necessary to be introduced in this wide-ranging field.</P>
      <P>The wording of the motion follows almost exactly the recommendations made by the Association for the Rights of the Mentally Handicapped circulated to all Members some weeks ago. The motion varies from the recommendation only in the form of words used, but the main recommendations in the motion are those in the association's document.  The motion could best be boiled down to four separate sections which are brought together in a composite, and I will deal with them in their separate capacities.  There are parts of the motion which deserve to be questioned but there are other parts which have extreme merit and which we need to look at carefully.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate to discuss the mentally handicapped at this time when legislation is due for revision within 12 months.  What the motion is endeavouring to express are the grievances and dissatisfaction of some of the parents and relatives of mentally handicapped children either in or out of residential care at the difficulty in obtaining information on the financing of the system and the degree of care being provided.  That is an area we can well examine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the first part of the motion, Deputy O'Connell said the wording was a little ambiguous.  I am <Col N="312" /> not sure whether the motion calls for differential grants to the voluntary organisations who operate residential institutions or for differential grants to parents who keep their children at home.  The latter grants are at a flat rate of £25 per month.  My understanding of the situation is that the voluntary organisations who operate the residential institutions do so under a system of differential grants and this to me would be one of the main areas where the members of ARMH were most concerned.  They are concerned particularly at the situation obtaining where one institution would get £X,000 and another would get £Y,000. Where institutions are the same size, they felt this appeared to indicate that the stronger the organisation the more likely they were to get money from the Department.</P>
    <P>My inquiries lead me to believe that in recent years there has been a system of differential grants paid depending on the type of institution, the type of staff structure and the type of care provided in residential institutions. For that reason I am at a loss to understand the relevant portion of the motion.  There is merit in the second part of it which suggests there should be a system of differential grants for home care.  As I have said, this was at a flat rate of £25 per month to parents of all mentally handicapped, irrespective of income, who kept their children at home.  There might well be consideration given to increasing that grant and to the introduction of a graded system of grants to parents, depending on the degree of incapacity of the child being kept at home.</P>
    <P>If that is the purpose of that part of the motion it is laudable and I should like to be on record as supporting it. In relation to differential grants to voluntary organisations, that system is in operation already, but parents of children who want their children in care do not seem to understand that that is operating, and what we want to ensure is that greater publicity will be given so that there will be public awareness in regard to the basis on which different institutions are being paid, how one institution is being paid more <i>per capita</i> than another.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> The voluntary institutions themselves came together and said that this is not operating, that some are giving a much higher service, are devoting more staff to the service than others, that some have a more detailed capital programme.  What is needed therefore is to explain to all involved in the care of mentally handicapped the basis on which grants are paid to voluntary institutions.  We must also go out of our way to ensure that the feeling does not emanate from us tonight that anybody is being critical of the role played by voluntary organisations who in the past have done magnificently a selfless, thankless job at a time when the level of financing and other support was not as high as it is today.  It would be too bad if the impression went out, now that the service has developed largely through these organisations with the help of State subvention, that there is a move afoot to transfer the service to the control of the health boards.  I do not think that is generally what the House wants or that it would be a good thing, and I do not think it is what the people want.  The role played by the voluntary organisations has been tremendous and let us hope it will remain so.</P>
    <P>As far as grants to parents of children in home care are concerned, it is important to distinguish that there are parents who have children in care at home and that it has an effect on the remainder of the families.  It has been suggested, on the other hand, that some of those in residential care are so mildly affected that they could equally be kept in the community.  However, even a mildly handicapped child should not be kept in the community if the parents are unable, through financial circumstances, or unwilling, to look after the child.  Consequently, there will be a number of mildly mentally handicapped in residential care because their own families are unwilling or unable to support them.  In that instance it is right that the State, through whatever agencies, should become involved in the residential care, if necessary, of that mentally handicapped child.</P>
    <P>The motion calls for powers of admission to and discharge from all <Col N="314" /> institutions for the mentally handicapped to be under the control of a panel of public health psychiatrists and social workers employed by the health boards.  Concerning admissions, I agree tht it would be very welcome if an independent body were to be in charge of deciding on the admission of patients to residential care.  At the moment the vast bulk of beds, especially in special centres, are provided by voluntary institutions.  I wonder how practical it is to suggest that a group of people involved in the public service should be the final arbiters on the type of patients to be admitted to voluntary institutions operated by other people, though with State funding and finance.  Perhaps it would be a good idea if a panel were to be set up composed of people involved in the public service and people representing voluntary agencies and representatives of the general public, laymen or representatives of the parents or the health boards involved. If that sort of thing is being suggested I welcome it.  It would help to inform and educate the public as to the extent research is carried out before a patient is admitted or admission is refused.</P>
    <P>It is probably impractical to suggest that an independent body, having no connection whatsoever with the institution in which a patient has been hospitalised, would fairly or adequately be able to decide when that patient should be discharged.  It does not seem to be feasible that an independent group, no matter how highly trained, could say that a patient should be discharged from an institution unless that group had been involved in the therapeutic care of the patient or unless they were involved to the extent that they could decide that an institution was no longer able to cater for the patient and that he would have to be moved to an institution catering for patients of a more disturbed nature.</P>
    <P>There are real difficulties contained in the suggestion in what I refer to as part (b) of the motion.  In the last few years the question of the admission and discharge of patients to and from voluntary institutions outside the public service and the health boards was <Col N="315" /> discussed at the behest of the Department of Health and a committee were set up.  They went into the question of the standards for deciding on the admission of patients to voluntary institutions, the sort of patients that should go into various types of institutions and which institutions were capable of catering for moderately and severely handicapped people.  A standard for decision on admissions was drawn up by the voluntary bodies, the health boards and the Department at that time.</P>
    <P>All the association are looking for is an assurance that this sort of thing is being done and that there is a degree of fairness.  I have met some of these parents and they believe, rightly or wrongly, that there are in certain institutions people who are mildly handicapped, while people in the same area who are severely handicapped and in poorer circumstances are not able to gain admission.  I find that difficult to accept but I also find it disturbing to think that parents and people involved who are anxious to help in the care of the mentally handicapped should think that such a thing would happen. To the extent that this part of the motion can bring it about, it would be a good thing to get home to parents and those involved that there is a degree of fairness and equity, irrespective of income and social standing.  I hope the Minister will deal with that point.</P>
    <P>If such a panel in respect of admission were to be set up, it would be important that it should not bring about delays.  Social workers have been pressing for a points system and they made a submission which was discussed some time ago.  Deputy O'Connell said that the social workers had been suggesting a centralised waiting list.  My idea of such a system is that the person who comes to the top gets the first bed available.  It would be unthinkable and unworkable if it were suggested that a patient from Wicklow would be assigned to residential care in Limerick, from the point of view of the patient's happiness and the likelihood of visits by his family. It would have to be on a regionalised <Col N="316" /> basis.  A body operating in the way suggested might bring about delays.  It is fair to say that adult beds for the mentally handicapped become available only on the death of the present occupant and as soon as a bed becomes available everybody is looking for it.  It would be ridiculous if some beds for the adult mentally handicapped were to lie idle until such time as an assessment board could decide on who should be assigned to that place.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of a points system as long as it will work.  The House knows enough about local politics to know how difficult and complex a points system is in relation to the allocation of public housing.  The authority of which I am a member were the first public authority to introduce such a points system.  During the course of the last six or seven years we have had to revise our system at least once every six months and sometimes twice during that period in order to take account of various areas which did not appear to be receiving equity treatment in the system as originally devised.  At the time we thought the original system was the fairest possible.  If a points system in relation to housing is as complex as that, how can we devise a points system under which we can grade the different degrees and aspects of mental handicap?  The social workers have put forward a system which they believe will work.  When a points system was introduced in a much simpler area it required constant attention and revision. If a points system will work it will prove to the public that the system is fair.  It is difficult to decide into what category an applicant for a place would fit without having carried out previous assessment of his behavioural difficulty and I do not see how that can be done by a board unless the patient has been under their observation for some time in a day centre or residential centre.</P>
    <P>The motion calls for the health boards to be instructed to undertake their statutory obligations for the care of the mentally handicapped by providing a special annual budget for this purpose.  This part of the motion is <Col N="317" /> slightly different from the suggestion that the national budget should make greater provision over the next number of years to see that standards for the care of the mentally handicapped are brought up to an acceptable level.  We all know very well that the health boards are as controlled by the Department of Health as the local authorities will, I am afraid, be controlled by the Department of the Environment.  The Department of Health decide on the level of spending of any health board in any one year and they decide directly on the level of finance to be made available to each of the voluntary institutions.  If a call is made to increase the level of spending then it should be made to the Department of Health.  I do not believe the Minister will disagree with that.  Within the allocations made to the health boards there should be a separate budget for the mentally handicapped and the mental health services generally.  I think some health boards do this already.  In that respect it is worth mentioning that the effort being made by the Eastern Health Board to distinguish between the psychiatric service and the mental handicap service is laudable and worthy of our support.</P>
    <P>In 1967, 6.3 per cent of the money for capital services was devoted to the mental health service and in 1977 the figure was 12 per cent.  In the period the figure was doubled and in some years it was as high as 20 per cent.  In 1967, 7.7 per cent of the money was allocated to the mental handicap service and in 1977 it was 8 per cent. That share has remained static while the capital programme has almost trebled.  Since the base year of 1967, the share for current expenditure has remained static.  The Minister should pay attention to that area and should try to increase the share as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to the main areas which cause dissatisfaction and are the reason for the submission of this document.  The association of concerned parents and friends of the mentally handicapped feel that the health boards have abdicated their statutory responsibility and have transferred it to the voluntary agencies, that <Col N="318" /> the more the voluntary agencies do the better the health boards like it.  I agree with the parents that that situation is wrong.  It is right to insist that the health boards should be more aware of, and do more work for, the mentally handicapped.  Deputy O'Connell quoted some figures from the 1974 census but I have later figures which were given to me in answers to questions by the Minister.  There are 5,000 places for the mentally handicapped in special residential centres and a further 2,700 places in general psychiatric hospitals.  Those figures compare with the figures for 1974, though it should be pointed out that there are 710 new places in special residential centres.  Of the 5,000 places in special residential centres, only 216 are provided by the health boards.  All other special residential beds are provided by voluntary agencies.  The health boards ought to provide more than 200 beds.  In the general psychiatric hospitals there is often intermingling of psychiatrically ill patients with long-and medium-term mentally handicapped patients in the most unsuitable conditions, and they are nursed by staff without special qualifications.  Many of the public mental hospitals are antiquated and unsuitable for the care of long-term mentally handicapped patients.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods referred to the numbers attending day centres and it is interesting to note that the present number is 5,731.  Great strides have been made in that field through the efforts of the voluntary agencies.  I welcome his suggestion that mentally handicapped patients should be allowed to mix more with those in physical and mental health in the special centres.</P>
    <P>The total number of registered nurses with training in the care of the mentally handicapped is 723.  We all know that many of them are not actively involved in caring for the mentally handicapped.  Many of these nurses have married and left the service and many more are doing general nursing.  Therefore, the number of specially trained nurses is smaller than 723 for 8,000 patients in residential centres.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> In 1966 the Commission recommended making the best use of the facilities and staff then available in residential centres for children and stressed the desirability that these centres should not be encumbered with adult cases.</P>

      <P>Many people are concerned with the lack of places for young mentally handicapped persons. When they reach puberty they become unsuitable for retention in the centres provided for young people.  As there is no other place for them they remain in the centres.  This means that there arae no vacancies for younger children. As Deputy O'Connell says, half of those outside residential care are between five and nine years of age.  In addition, the voluntary bodies are now experiencing staffing difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that there should be differential grants for mentally handicapped children being kept at home.  The system of payment of differential capitation grants to the institutions should be publicly clarified.  I agree with an independent panel of assessors if the voluntary agencies and the public are involved and if it can be shown to work.  I agree with a points system if it can be shown to work.  There is a <Col N="320" /> need for more specially trained staff for the therapeutic care of the mentally handicapped.  There is a need for the health boards to provide more places for the mentally handicapped. There is a need to relieve the blockage in the child care centres so that young adults can be moved to other centres. There is a need to reassess some mildly mentally handicapped patients at present in residential care.  There is a need to keep the parents and the public informed.</P>
    <P>This is an area which requires special skills and the compassion and patience of all those involved.  The public should be made aware of the situation and of the need for increased expenditure, and it is our responsibility to ensure that it is done.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 348 and 349 together.</P>
      <P>The general planning brief for the development of Castlebar General Hospital has been completed by a project team representative of the Western Health Board and my Department.  A design team of architects and other consultants have been appointed to the project and this team have commenced the detailed planning of the hospital. This planning will take approximately two years.</P>
      <P>While this planning is going ahead, some features of the proposed extension need to be clarified.  This is being done and decisions will be taken on them as soon as possible, so that they can be taken into account in the preparation of the complete plan within the time-scale I have mentioned.  One of these features is the nurse training school referred to by the Deputy.  The exact form of training content for inclusion in the expanded Castlebar hospital will be influenced by the studies being made by the Working Party on General Nursing, who are expected to report next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The means of a male applicant for unemployment assistance who is living at home in common with those of other applicants have to be determined under section 13 of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, and regulations made under that Act.  Items which must be taken into account include the yearly value of all property owned, personally used or enjoyed by the applicant and all cash income, with certain exceptions, which he is likely to receive during the coming 12 months including income which he may reasonably expect to receive as head of a household.</P>
      <P>Where the applicant is not the head of a household the yearly value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by him such as free or partly free board and lodgings must be reckoned as means. This is determined factually by reference to the standard of living of the household in which he resides and to his position in the household.  Each case is decided on its merits by a deciding officer in the light of these circumstances.  Account is taken of the income of the household and of the composition of the household with particular reference to the number of persons who are not self-supporting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The present means test limit for any applicant for unemployment assistance is the maximum weekly rate of unemployment assistance appropriate in his case.  This rate is determined by reference to the marital status of the applicant, the size of his family and as to whether he lives in an urban or a rural area. The rate of assistance payable to him is this amount less the weekly value of his means.  Consequently a revision of the means test limits requires a revision of the weekly maximum rates of <Col N="198" /> unemployment assistance which is a matter for consideration in the context of the budget.  I should mention that the rates of unemployment assistance and consequently the means test limits were recently revised with effect as from the 28th September, 1977.</P>

      <P>Claims for unemployment benefit are not invariably disallowed in the circumstances postulated by the Deputy.  All claims for unemployment benefit from persons who have lost their employment by reason of a stoppage of work which was due to a trade dispute fall for consideration under the trade dispute provisions of the relevant social welfare legislation which are to be found in section 17 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, as amended by section 8 (a) of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1967. In general these provisions disqualify such persons from receiving benefit for the duration of the stoppage of work but they do not apply to persons who are not participating in or financing or directly interested in the trade dispute and who do not belong to a grade or class of workers any of whom are so involved.  Persons who satisfy these conditions are not disqualified for the receipt of benefit.</P>

      <P>A claimant to benefit is entitled to an increase of benefit in respect of his wife if she is living with him or is wholly or mainly maintained by him.  If the couple are separated, the claimant is only entitled to the increase for his wife, if he is wholly or mainly maintaining her.  Where he is entitled, there is power to pay the increase of benefit for the wife directly to her if the circumstances so warrant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="203" /> I am not aware that separated wives are experiencing difficulties in obtaining payments where title can be established. The extra inquiries necessary to establish that the conditions for entitlement are satisfied in the case of separated couples and that payment can be made to the wife may be a source of some delay and misunderstanding. If the Deputy has particulars of any case of difficulty, I will have them examined.</P>
    <P>A father's entitlement to an increase of benefit in respect of a qualified child depends on the child being normally resident with him.  Normal residence is determined under statutory regulations. If a couple are separated and their child lives with the mother, then under those regulations the child must be regarded as normally resident with her. In those circumstances, an increase of benefit in respect of the child is not payable on the father's benefit claim even though he may be contributing substantially to the support of the child.  I am having this aspect of the matter examined to see what changes in the regulations would be warranted.</P>

      <P>The scheme covering <Col N="204" /> dental, aural and optical benefits is properly a health service, but has been continued under the Social Welfare Acts pending its integration into a national structure covering all health services by the Department of Health. The transfer of the scheme to the Department of Health has been approved in principle and, until the necessary arrangements for transfer are completed, it would not be opportune to consider the question of possible extensions of the scheme.</P>

      <P>Because the pension rates are higher than other benefit rates, a person receiving a benefit would normally get an increased payment on qualifying for old age contributory pension or retirement pension.  However, due in the main to concessions which allow payment of more than one benefit to persons below pensionable age, cases can occur where a person may, before reaching that age, have been receiving more in the aggregate <Col N="205" /> than his subsequent pension entitlement.</P>

      <P>In order to comply with the provisions of the EEC Regulations governing State aid to transport undertakings a new subvention structure for CIE was introduced with effect from 1st January, 1975.</P>
      <P>Particulars of the relevant EEC Regulations and of the manner in which they have been applied to CIE are as follows.</P>
      <P>(a) EEC Regulation No. 1191/69 enables payment of compenation by the State to transport undertakings in respect of losses incurred on services operated under public service obligations which are deemed essential to ensure the provision of adequate transport services.  Payment is being made to CIE under this regulation in respect of losses remaining on rail passenger services after fares increases and any possible economies in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) EEC Regulation No. 1192/69 provides for compensation by the State <Col N="208" /> in respect of specified financial burdens borne by railway undertakings. Payments were made to CIE in 1975 under this regulation to cover the following costs in respect of rail freight operations; superannuation and pensions costs less savings arising from the board's exemption from payment of certain social welfare insurance contributions in respect of clerical and supervisory staff; 50 per cent of the costs of maintenance and control of level crossings.</P>
    <P>(c) EEC Regulation No. 1107/70 specifies certain additional circumstances in which State aids may be paid to transport undertakings.  Under this regulation payments are being made to CIE in respect of; 50 per cent of infrastructure costs in respect of rail freight (Article 3.1 (b)); losses on the board's road passenger services which cannot be recouped by fares increases or eliminated by economies in operation (Article 3.2); residual deficits on railway operations and losses on maintenance of canals (Article 4).</P>
    <P>As provided for in the June, 1975, budget introduced by the Minister for Finance, the board reduced, with effect from 28th July, 1975, its fares on Dublin city bus services, provincial road passenger services and Dublin and Cork commuter rail services to the levels which obtained before 12th May, 1975.  Compensation was paid to the board to cover the losses of revenue in 1975 arising from this reduction in fares and which amounted to £1,790,000 on Dublin city bus services, £945,000 on provincial road passenger services and £76,000 on Dublin and Cork commuter rail services.</P>
    <P>A grant is also paid to CIE by the State in respect of losses incurred on the Galway-Aran ferry service.</P>
    <P>Particulars of the total Exchequer grant of £26.5m. paid to CIE under Subhead D.1 of Vote 42 of Dáil Éireann in 1975 are given in the following table showing the relevant provisions of EEC Regulations:</P>

    <P>NOTE: The amounts under Regulations Nos. 1191/69 and 1192/69 in respect of &ldquo;excess payments&rdquo; i.e. a total of £397,186, represent the extent to which payments received from the State exceeded the deficit on rail passenger services and normalisation costs as established in the final accounts.  However, the residual deficit grant made to CIE under Article 4 of Regulation 1107/70 was inadequate to the extent of £479,788 and this inadequacy was offset to the extent of £397,186 by the excess payments received under Regulations 1191/69 and 1192/69.  After taking account of the payment of £945,000 in respect of road passenger provincial services which more than offset the deficit in respect of these services, the total net deficit on all services subventable under EEC Regulations and on the Galway-Aran ferry service was £26,512,981, compared with the total payment from the State of £26.5m.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if he will state in relation to the developments in progress at Rosslare Harbour, County Wexford (1) the total estimated cost (2) the amount of State investment (3) the proposed handling capacity of the harbour facilities in relation to through-put of (a) passengers and (b) commercial vehicles; and the other Departments and agencies involved in the scheme and the nature of their involvement.</P>

      <P>1. The estimated cost of the provision of a second roll-on/ roll-off berth at Rosslare Harbour, with associated facilities is £3.63 million.  2. No decision has yet been taken about this aspect.  3. It is not practicable to express in figures the potential capacity of the proposed new berth, which would depend on operating schedules and frequency of service, but the berth would be capable of meeting the estimated passenger and commercial traffic requirements of the shipping services using the port.  The design would be such that a further berth could be provided later at minimal extra cost if required.  4. The other bodies currently involved in consideration of the scheme are: (i) Córas Iompair Éireann, the managers of the port, and their consulting engineers; (ii) the Commissioners of Public Works. <Col N="211" /> as my engineering advisers; and (iii) Bord Fáilte Éireann, in relation to tourist promotion and the preservation of coastal amenities.</P>
      <P>My Department are also consulting with a number of other Departments about various aspects of the proposed scheme, that is, Departments of Finance, Economic Planning and Development, Environment, Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>

      <P>The answer to parts (a) and (b) of the question is &ldquo;nil&rdquo; in each case.  As regards (c), I consider that a small committee of the kind proposed offers the best means of examining the problem of how to use and maintain cut-away bogs.  There are other interests apart from the Bord na Móna group of unions, who could claim representation on the committee and who are not represented.  However, the committee will consider any views which interested persons may care to submit.</P>
