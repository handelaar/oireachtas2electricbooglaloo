    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will make a statement on the failure of Irish companies and professionals to obtain more than three contracts under the European Development Fund; and the action that is being taken by his Department to raise the matter with the EEC Commission in Brussels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The importance which the Government attaches to ensuring that Irish organisations, enterprises and firms are awarded a fair share of consultancy contracts under the European Development Fund was one of the first matters which I raised with the European Commission after taking up office.  In mid-September and at the recent Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 17th/18th October I met with M. Claude Cheysson, Commissioner responsible for Development, to discuss this whole area and to make clear Ireland's interests.</P>
      <P>The Commission is in no doubt as to the importance which the Government places on ensuring adequate participation by the Irish business community in the activities of the European Development Fund.  In addition to my own discussion with Commissioner Cheysson, my Department has been, and is, in regular contact with the Commission on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The up-to-date position is that one State-sponsored body, Córas Tráchtála and three Irish firms of consulting engineers have been awarded contracts &mdash;in Jamaica, Upper Volta, Tanzania and Zambia respectively.  The total value of these contracts is of the order of £320,000.  The Deputy will probably be aware that only a proportion, less than 20 per cent, of the European Development Fund, will be allocated <Col N="5" /> to funding consultancy contracts.  The Irish contribution to this section of the fund is approximately £1.8 million, at current exchange rates, which is considerably in excess of the value of the contracts awarded to Irish firms to date. However the operation of the Fourth European Development Fund is still at a fairly early stage and I am satisfied that an increasing number of Irish firms are being placed on shortlists by the Commission.  I am confident that further contracts will be awarded to Irish business under the European Development Fund.  I might also mention, in a related context, that Bórd Fáilte has been commissioned by the Industrial Development Centre, which was established under the Lomé Convention, to prepare the terms of reference for a master plan for the development of the tourist potential in Zambia.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm that the efforts of Irish businessmen to secure contracts under the Lomé Convention have the full support of my ministerial colleagues and of our Departments.  My Department, in co-operation with the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy and with Córas Tráchtála, and in close consultation with the Confederation of Irish Industry, has been active in providing information and assistance to individual firms; our Missions abroad have also made representations on behalf of individual firms.</P>
    <P>I should, perhaps, point out that it is not the European Commission which awards consultancy contracts. The Commission draws up a shortlist of firms which it submits to the beneficiary State&mdash;the authorities of which choose the contractor.  It is important that these firms placed on shortlists make every effort to advance their interests with the authorities in the states concerned and in this regard my Department and its Missions will continue to offer assistance to the extent that our resources permit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the detailed reply the Minister has given, could the Minister elaborate on the last item where he refers to the onus being on individual firms to make the <Col N="6" /> last lap on their own?  Perhaps the Minister might like to comment on recent occurrences in Zambia in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of lobbying.  Once the firm gets on the shortlist then it is a question of the firm concerned doing its thing.  Our diplomatic Missions will give them every help but basically that help will be supplementary to the actual muscle the firm itself can apply.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that representations in this area are often questioned and there is a tendency for some countries to direct their protest only against regimes of the right or in other cases the left, would the Minister always ensure that when protests are made we make it clear we are not concerned with the political complexion of the regime but we are concerned with any breach of human rights, no matter by whom that breach may be made?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he is satisfied with the level of Irish involvement abroad in operations related to development aid; and, if not, the steps he proposes to take to encourage Irish business firms to take up the opportunities open to them in Third World countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The earnings of Irish business from activities related to development aid and from consultancy and project activities in developing countries generally have been provisionally estimated at upwards of £40 million for contracts secured in the year ended June, 1977.  This figure does not distinguish between earnings from contracts awarded to Irish firms and State-sponsored bodies from international aid funds and earnings from contracts secured in the wealtheir countries with developing economies such as the OPEC countries.  In fact, of this figure of upwards of £40 million only about £1 million is accounted for by contracts awarded by international aid funds.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that this is the limit of the potential which can be reached.</P>
      <P>Encouragement and support are given to Irish firms by the Government, principally through the relevant Departments and Córas Tráchtála, in a variety of ways which include the involvement of Irish firms in the official programme of development aid; the dissemination to the business community of relevant information; diplomatic support and representations; and the range of export incentive schemes. The Government will continue to use all the resources at its disposal to help Irish business interests to avail of business opportunities in the Third World and, indeed, elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government discussed recent developments in connection with the hijacking of aircraft at their meeting on 21st October, 1977. A statement issued after that meeting indicated <i>inter alia</i> the Government's belief that the most effective way of combatting terrorism in civil aviation is through international action at governmental level.  The Government also declared their willingness to join in international consideration of further effective measures to outlaw hijacking, the taking of hostages and similar crimes.  The Irish delegation to the current 32nd session of the United Nations General Assembly had been directed to support proposals for urgent consideration of the question. Ireland has, therefore, joined with other nations at the General Assembly in requesting the inclusion, as a matter of urgency of an additional item entitled &ldquo;safety of international civil aviation&rdquo; in the agenda of the 32nd session.  Additionally, Ireland has cosponsored a draft resolution which <i>inter alia</i> appeals to all states, not yet parties to three international conventions dealing with air piracy, to consider urgently their becoming bound by these conventions.  Ireland has already ratified the conventions (Tokyo Convention of 1963, The Hague Convention of 1970 and the Montreal Convention of 1971) and the provisions of these conventions have been embodied in our legislation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will consider as a solution to the international aircraft hijacking problem an international convention where all countries who are party thereto would refuse asylum to hijackers and, with the co-operation of the Airline Pilots' Association, would enforce a blacking of all countries who refuse to sign such a convention; and if he will take steps to institute discussions on such a convention.</P>

      <P>The Irish delegation to the current 32nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly has co-sponsored a draft resolution which has three main elements: first, a call to all states to take the necessary steps, taking into account the relevant recommendations of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, to prevent acts of aerial hijacking or other wrongful interference with civil air travel; second, an appeal to those states, which have not yet done so, to become parties to the three international conventions dealing with air offences; and third, a request to the International Civil Aviation Organisation to undertake urgently further efforts with a <Col N="11" /> view to ensuring the security of air travel.</P>
      <P>On the subject of suspension of airline services, a proposal was put forward at an Extraordinary Conference of ICAO held in Rome in 1973 to the effect that member states of ICAO should refuse facilities to the airlines of states which accepted or harboured hijackers.  No agreement proved possible on this proposal.  I do not consider that any useful purpose would be served by raising this or a similar proposal at this point.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On 1st January, 1977, the exclusive fishing limits of the State were extended to 200 miles in concert with the other maritime member states of the European Community. Effect was given to this under the Maritime Jurisdiction Act (1959) by the Maritime Jurisdiction (Exclusive Fishery Limits) Order, 1976 made by the Government on 22nd December, 1976.  Negotiations for a revision of the common fisheries policy of the Community have now been taking place for a considerable time in the new conditions created by the extension of their exclusive fishing limits to 200 miles by the member states of the Community and several other states. In these negotiations Ireland has been seeking an exclusive fishing zone of up to 50 miles and that remains our position. To date, negotiations have not been concluded.  The matter was again discussed by the Council of Ministers at a special two-day meeting held in Luxembourg on 24th and 25th October, in an effort to reach agreement on a revised common fisheries policy.  However, the Council did not reach agreement on a definitive fisheries policy to operate for 1978, and their discussions will be resumed at a special fisheries council to be held in Brussels on 5th and 6th December next.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the European Commission has asked the European Court of Justice to determine the legality or otherwise of the unilateral fishery conservation measures taken by Ireland earlier this year. In its statement of defence on the substantive action submitted to the court the present Government have contended that the provisions of the Council Regulations 2141 of 1970 and 101 of 1976&mdash;which provide that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rules applied by each member State in respect of fishing in the <Col N="14" /> maritime waters coming under its sovereignty or within its jurisdiction shall not lead to difference in treatment of other member States&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>took effect only in relation to the maritime waters under the sovereignty or within the jurisdiction of the member states at the time of the adoption of the said regulations and that they do not relate to the maritime waters coming under the sovereignty or within the jurisdiction of Ireland subsequent to that date.  Consequently, the right of Ireland to establish an exclusive 50-mile fishing limit must be regarded as <i>subjudice.</i></P>

      <P>Belgium acting on behalf of the nine countries of the European Community made a <i>démarche</i> last week to South Africa protesting at the recent bannings of organisations and individuals in South Africa. Ireland was fully associated with this protest.  Furthermore, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs speaking at the opening of a seminar organised by the Irish anti-apartheid movement on the churches, racialism and South Africa voiced the Government's dismay at the most recent efforts to stifle legitimate protest in South Africa.</P>
      <P>Obviously there is little that Ireland acting alone can do to bring pressure to bear on the South African regime to secure change in its apartheid policy. We do, however, support the concept of concerted action through the international forum of the United Nations Organisation.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister have regard to a principle with which he expressed agreement earlier that it is necessary for this country to protest in all cases where human rights are violated so as to make it clear that we are being thoroughly objective and that we are not having regard to the complexion of the regime?  If we participate in protests against South Africa we should participate in protests against regimes of a different political hue, to maintain our objectivity and our reputation.</P>

      <P>I agree that there should be no discrimination in regard to human rights.  They are fundamental and should apply across the board.  That is our attitude.  We took action behind the scenes on this aspect.  Obviously other countries did too, and the Polish authorities responded fairly promptly in the matter. That is sometimes the best way to deal with a situation of this kind, but I share the Deputy's view completely.</P>

That is not an issue.  But the script, as circulated to the media, contained a specific condemnation of paramilitary organisations and activities in Northern Ireland and also contained a specific welcome and praise for the commitment for the United States administration to seek out and prosecute persons in the United States who were engaged in the exportation of money and arms to Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister regret that the circulation of his speech and a considerable departure from that speech as circulated, gave rise to the suspicion&mdash;which I know is unfounded; the people in the United States might not know as much as we do&mdash;that he was prevaricating on these two very vital issues?  My second question is: having regard to Press reports that people attending the function in question praised the Minister because he did not condemn the IRA, or did not ask people in the US to stop sending money and arms to paramilitary organisations in Northern Ireland, have any steps been taken to disabuse anybody attending that function, or indeed anybody else, of the impression that the Government have two views on this matter?</P>

In view of that does he not think it rather strange that a Minister for Foreign Affairs should overlook these two very important points in such a speech no matter what audience he was addressing?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the proposals circulated by his <Col N="28" /> predecessor contained a number of simple proposals such as those facilitating the establishment of the office of mayor in certain towns and the establishment of new local authorities in developing areas, simple proposals that could be proceeded with quickly?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my speech of 21st September to the annual conference of the Association of Municipal Authorities in which I had the following to say:</P>
      <P>On the question of rates, the Government are wholly committed to their manifesto undertaking to abolish rates from 1978 onwards on houses, secondary schools, community halls and all farm out-buildings. Implementation arrangements are a matter for me, as Minister for the Environment, and I will be introducing legislative proposals in the coming Dáil session to provide for these important reliefs.  I want to emphasise that no diminution of the standing of either county or urban authorities will result from the decision to abolish domestic rates. From the financial point of view, the Government are determined to see that each local authority is compensated fully for the loss of rates income arising on domestic and other property.  Equally, from the point of view of local democracy, we are anxious to ensure the minimum of interference with the existing powers and discretions of local elected representatives.</P>
      <P>Clearly, some safeguards will have to be provided for the Exchequer, which will be contributing about two-thirds of gross rates in 1978.  At the same time, we fully acknowledge the need for a genuinely local form of government and we are anxious that its contribution should continue to be felt, not least in the vital area of facilitating job creation on which so much Government effort is now being concentrated.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="32" /> At this stage, I can only say that the Bill to deal with rating arrangements consequent on the Government's decisions will afford Deputies the opportunity to discuss these matters in full.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>A circular from my Department of 17th August, 1977, requested rating authorities to defer consideration of their estimates for 1978 until dates to be notified by me.  As soon as these dates are notified, adoption of estimates of expenses by rating authorities and determination by them of rates in the pound will proceed in accordance with the appropriate statutory requirements.  The reason for deferring preparation of rating authority estimates for 1978 was to enable proper consideration to be given to the measures, including legislative changes, needed to give effect to the abolition of rates on domestic premises and certain other categories of property and also, in the context of overall budgetary arrangements, to the provision required to compensate rating authorities for the abolished rates.  When this consideration has been completed, I will notify rating authorities of the periods for preparation of their estimates of expenses and give them detailed instructions in relation to the rating reliefs.  Pending this, it may be appropriate to issue further interim advice to rating authorities.</P>

      <P>On the 5th of July last, the Taoiseach announced in the Dáil that he intended to appoint Ministers who would not be members of the Government to help Ministers of the Government who have especially heavy workloads by reason of modern developments and international commitments. As the Taoiseach went on to point out, an amendment of the Ministers and Secretaries Acts is required to give effect to this decision.</P>
      <P>In considering this measure Deputies will be aware that while in recent years much attention has been given to the question of public service reform at an administrative level, successive Governments have been slow to consider the needs of Government itself.  Yet if the structure of the public service needs to be adapted to the needs of the last quarter of the twentieth century, it would be strange if some changes were not required also at Governmental level.</P>
      <P>Up to 1937 the maximum number of Ministers permitted by the Constitution was 12; in addition the Ministers and Secretaries Acts provided for up to seven Parliamentary Secretaries. Under Bunreacht na hÉireann the maximum number of Ministers was increased to 15; the maximum number of Parliamentary Secretaries permitted by law remained at seven.  In the 40 years since then no change has occured in the limits on the number of members of the Government or of Parliamentary Secretaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The workload has however increased enormously.  When the basic framework of the Government was laid in the early 1920s Government involvement in the social and economic fields was low.  The increase in such involvement since that date is reflected in <Col N="60" /> the growth of the administrative machine.  A civil service which was just over 20,000 strong at the foundation of the State has now almost 50,000 members and the whole State-sponsored body area with an employment figure of more than 60,000 has emerged in the same period.  At the same time there is a continuous expansion in the staff employed on local and regional services.  The list of additional duties which have been undertaken by this large establishment is very long.  Industrial promotion and economic development and impressive advances in social welfare and health services occupy more and more time and resources.  Education, transport, agriculture, fisheries, consumer protection and minerals development are only some of the many aspects of national life which, with the ever present needs of defence and civil order, are the responsibility of Government today.</P>
    <P>On top of all this our position in international affairs has been transformed. International action by governments on matters of mutual concern has been intensified in recent decades and a proliferation of international conferences and other meetings require representation of the Government. The most significant development however has been in relation to the European Communities.  I think that everyone accepted at the time that Ireland's accession to the Communities in 1973 was bound to increase the pressures on our machinery of government. Few, I think, foresaw the extent to which these pressures would increase in recent years or predicted the extent to which they would fall on individual members of the Government. It is of vital importance for us, as a small country whose economic strength is far below the average in the rest of the Community, to have our needs and entitlements pursued vigorously at the highest levels in the Community.</P>
    <P>Given such an expanded workload, and the strict limitation on the number of Ministers, the burden on individual Ministers is becoming intolerable, and I think that this will be recognised on all sides of the House.  For many years it has been necessary to keep the <Col N="61" /> number of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries fully up to the maximum limits.  The undertaking of additional functions by the State has resulted in the increase in the number of Departments to a figure which will be 18 on the creation of the Department of Economic Planning and Development, but the constitutional limitation of 15 on the number of Ministers means that some Ministers have had to take charge of two Departments. The number of matters that must be decided by a Minister is great and growing and, though the reforms in the public administrative machine envisaged by the present Government will afford some relief in executive matters, the weighty issues of planning and policy will make increasing demands on time and energy.  Moreover, the volume of parliamentary business is certainly not falling and the calls on a Minister's time to meet representative bodies, attend at public functions and respond to the communications media, are an inevitable consequence of a growing openness in Government.  It is however international commitments, and particularly the requirements involving frequent travel of our European participation, that has proved the greatest single addition to the heavy workload of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries.</P>
    <P>Since the resolution of the problem by the increase beyond 15 in the number of Ministers would require a constitutional amendment, I will not speculate on the advantages or disadvantages of increasing the size of the Government.  Instead, I will concentrate on the means by which the law can be changed to permit of an increase in the assistance which can be afforded to Ministers by the creation of a new office of Minister who will not be a member of the Government.</P>
    <P>The present position is that, under the Constitution, the Government shall consist of not more than 15 members; the executive power of the State shall, subject to the provisions of the Consitution, be exercised by or on the authority of the Government; the Government shall be responsible to Dáil Éireann and shall meet and act as <Col N="62" /> a collective authority and shall be collectively responsible for the Departments of State administered by the members of the Government.  The Ministers and Secretaries Acts provide for not more than seven Parliamentary Secretaries to Ministers.  The Parliamentary Secretaries are, in effect, junior Ministers.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the provisions of the Constitution, the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1939, provides for the delegation by Government Order of the statutory powers of a Minister to his Parliamentary Secretary subject to certain provisions.  The main features of these provisions are that the Minister remains responsible to Dáil Éireann for the delegated powers; the powers delegated remain concurrently vested in the Minister and they are exercisable by the Parliamentary Secretary under the general superintendent and control of the Minister.  Parliamentary Secretaries can and do relieve Ministers of a considerable part of their burden. They can, by order, undertake statutory duties of a Minister but usually their main contribution is in the lightening of his parliamentary task and in the discharge of the many duties which, though not statutory, are integral elements of ministerial office. Over the years the Parliamentary Secretaries have played an essential role in enabling the business of government to be carried on.  The time has now come when the support to Ministers needs to be significantly strengthened.</P>
    <P>In the first place, given that the number of Ministers cannot be readily increased, and increase in the numbers at junior Minister level is essential to deal with the increasing volume of Government business.  Secondly, experience has shown that the effective delegation of functions and of the necessary authority for their discharge to Parliamentary Secretaries is impeded by the title of the office.  To begin with the domestic level, it is a fact of life that it is difficult to secure full acceptance for their discharge of ministerial functions in a representative or executive capacity by a man who not only lacks the title of Minister but is designated as the Parliamentary Secretary to a Minister.  In international <Col N="63" /> affairs, the position is even more difficult. In other countries the office of Parliamentary Secretary is quite a junior position in the Government hierarchy and the term &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo; is commonly recognised as meaning a junior Minister occupying an office immediately below Cabinet rank.  The assignment of the title &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo; to junior Ministers therefore offers a means by which a much greater delegation of functions to junior Ministers will be acceptable at home and abroad.  This Bill therefore proposes to create ten posts of Minister of State and to repeal the provisions of the Ministers and Secretaries Acts dealing with Parliamentary Secretaries, thereby abolishing that office.  It is intended on the appointment of the Ministers of State to assign to them wider and heavier responsibilities than have hitherto been assigned to Parliamentary Secretaries.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill provide for the appointment of Ministers of State and delegation to them of statutory powers and duties of Ministers subject to the requirements of the Constitution.  I might point out to Deputies that, since a Parliamentary Secretary was originally envisaged as having mainly parliamentary duties, he ceased to hold office on the dissolution of the House of the Oireachtas of which he was a member. Ministers, however, continue in office until their successors are appointed. Since Ministers of State are intended to take some of the burden from Ministers, it is provided in this Bill that they will have the same provisions for continuance of office as Ministers have under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The title &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo; is clearly the most appropriate title for the junior Ministers, particularly when regard is had to the practice in other countries.  However, under paragraph 18 of the Schedule to the Interpretation Act, 1937, the term &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo; is defined as meaning a member of the Government having charge of a Department of State.  The expression &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo; is used in this sense in a number of subsequent enactments, for example, the Civil <Col N="64" /> Service Regulation Act, 1956.  Two consequential legislative amendments will, therefore, be required on the enactment of this measure.  First, it must be provided that in legislation enacted after the passing of this Act the expression &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo; will no longer mean a member of the Government having charge of a Department of State.  In legislation enacted before this Act the old meaning will continue to apply.  Second, it is desirable that there should be an expression to describe, where required in future legislation, a member of the Government having charge of a Department of State.  The most suitable expression is, I believe, Minister of the Government.  Section 4 provides for these amendments.</P>
    <P>Finally, section 3 is designed to deal with a doubt that has been raised about the proof of Orders made by a Parliamentary Secretary or, in future, by a Minister of State.  Section 5 is designed to alter the reference to a Parliamentary Secretary in the Defence Act, 1954, since the office of Parliamentary Secretary will disappear on the repeal of section 7 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, and sections 8 and 9 of the 1939 Act.</P>
    <P>To avoid possible misunderstandings and the extension of the debate beyond the scope of the Bill, I would mention that the question of the remuneration of Ministers of State will be dealt with in an amendment to the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Acts which will be the subject of further legislation.</P>
    <P>This Bill is therefore a further step in the programme of reform of the institutions of Government.  We are convinced that Ministers are in need of assistance in the discharge of their functions and we know that Members of the Opposition when in office were also aware of this need.  After a full consideration of the needs of the situation and the available remedies, I can confidently recommend the provisions of this Bill to the House as a significant development in our institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Being a significant development in our institutions involving the institution of Government itself, <Col N="65" /> it would have been appropriate that the Taoiseach should have introduced the Bill.  The debate on this is a debate basically on the structure of Government and on the adequacy or otherwise of our present system of government, and it raises a number of wider issues than those provided for in the Bill.  I regret that the Taoiseach did not open the debate.  I hope that he will reply to it because I feel that in this debate issues will be raised which are preeminently and exclusively within the prerogative of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>I and my party accept without difficulty the need for more people in Government in its broadest sense.  In the narrow constitutional sense we are confined to the 15 people the Constitution makes provision for and who share collective responsibility.  I do not know how one can assess with precision or objectively the workload of Government in the first half-century of the existence of the State.  If one tried to measure it in terms of the volume of real resources being managed by the Government then the increase would be many times over, but the increase in work is probably not directly proportionate to the increase in resources handled.  If the job of Government could be made amenable to work study and if work study could be extended backwards to the early years of the State after the initial critical period of civil war, I would not be surprised to find that the workload has even trebled in the half-century.  Since we joined the EEC, as the Minister said, the workload has increased further.  I had the impression in Government, no more than a subjective impression, that the EEC added something like a further one-third to the workload of Government, not necessarily to the total workload in the whole civil service but the workload of those engaged in the work of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of this expansion in the burden of Government that has occurred gradually throughout the lifetime of the State and which has accelerated in the last five years, one is moved to wonder whether the Bill is not too modest in simply proposing the net addition of three other people <Col N="66" /> to the ranks of those involved in the task of government.  It may well be that the total of 25 people is simply insufficient for the tasks that have to be handled.  What I doubt however&mdash; and on this I would be anxious to hear the views of the Taoiseach&mdash;is the wisdom of elevating all to this new grade.  The introduction of an additional level in the Government, the Minister of State level, was envisaged by the National Coalition and would undoubtedly have been implemented in a second Coalition in the light of experience gained during four-and-a-quarter years in Government.  What we had in mind was the addition of a new level of Minister to give additional flexibility to Government where at present there are only two levels available.  Minister and Parliamentary Secretary, and where the tasks to be performed do not fit easily into this narrow categorisation of two levels alone.  The Governments in other countries&mdash;for example, the United Kingdom and France&mdash;have a number of different grades of Ministers.  The British system of course has the great advantage of having inherited from the feudal period various offices with extraordinary titles, the titles themselves being partly sinecure, to which tasks can be allotted which not only vary from Government to Government or even within the lifetime of a Government but where the level of responsibility involved can be moved up or down quite arbitrarily.  The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who has, I understand, to do some odd jobs in relation to the Duchy of Lancaster, can also be given any other jobs which may occur to a Prime Minister of the day and at almost any level of Government inside or outside the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>Our system is in its present form inherently inflexible.  It seemed to me and I think to others in Government that the addition of a third tier, an intermediate tier in Government, would give greater flexibility.  It seems to me that the tasks which are undertaken by Parliamentary Secretaries or which could be undertaken by them vary considerably in the degree of responsibility attaching to them and, therefore, several different levels, <Col N="67" /> Minister of State and Parliamentary Secretary could usefully be retained.</P>
    <P>I am sceptical about the wisdom of a general inflation, just as every Minister Plenipotentiary in the diplomatic service throughout the world, with almost the single exception of the British representative in the Vatican, is now an Ambassador Extraordinary whereas up to the last war Ambassadors were rare birds indeed.  Here again there is an inflation taking place, so that not merely in the cases where a higher level of Minister below Cabinet rank is required, are we to have a new grade, a Minister of State, but all existing Parliamentary Secretaies, regardless of their particular level of responsibilities, are also to be entitled Minister of State.</P>
    <P>I recognise, as the Minister has said, that where external representation is involved the present title of &ldquo;Parliamentary Secretary&rdquo; is confusing at best and at worst may prevent the person concerned from carrying sufficient weight when attending an international gathering whether within the Community or outside it.  There is, of course the title &ldquo;Secretary of State&rdquo; which is used in continental countries, which is equivalent to the Minister of State which we are now creating here, although in Britain the first Secretary of State is a title of very senior Ministers in the Government.  There is in fact a good deal of confusion here in the international usage of terms.</P>
    <P>There is further confusion because of the fact that in France a Minister of State means a very high rank of Minister indeed, equivalent to Secretary of State in Britain.  &ldquo;Parliamentary Secretary&rdquo;, whatever confusion there is between all these titles, means little or nothing outside of these islands, and for all I know some countries of the commonwealth which continue to follow the UK practice.  Therefore, in terms of external representation and having someone whose title carries with it authority which will enable him to act effectively on the occasions when a member of the Cabinet cannot be present at an international discussion, it is appropriate that the title &ldquo;Minister <Col N="68" /> of State&rdquo; or some title of that kind be used.  I would not quarrel with that.</P>
    <P>I believe the same may be true also if somebody were to be appointed to assist the Taoiseach in dealing with Northern Ireland affairs.  There again, because Northern Ireland affairs clearly involve our relationship with another country, the title &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo; might be more appropriate than Parliamentary Secretary and also because of the inherent vital importance to us of Northern Ireland and of our relationship with that part of the island.</P>
    <P>In the domestic area it seems to me that there are cases also where the existing arrangement is unsatisfactory. There seems to me to be a fairly clear distinction between the case where a Parliamentary Secretary takes over and operates effectively subject to his overall control by the Minister an entire Department of State, and cases where he either simply assists the Minister with his duties generally or takes over and looks after a part of a Department of State or some particular parts of it.  If, for example, you have a Minister for Social Welfare and Health and if a Parliamentary Secretary undertakes effectively all the work in one of these areas, so that the Minister apart from overall supervision, confines himself largely to the other area, it seems to me that the appropriate title for somebody who is <i>de facto</i> in charge of a whole Department of State would be Minister of State.</P>
    <P>On the other hand where a Parliamentary Secretary is concerned only with parts of, and at times not even closely interconnected parts, of the work of a Department or where he is simply acting <i>ad hoc</i> for the Minister from time to time, then the existing title of Parliamentary Secretary would seem adequate for domestic purposes. It seems to me once again that it is a mistake to inflate everybody to Minister of State level and not retain the existing Parliamentary Secretary title and functions where it is appropriate for certain domestic purposes.</P>
    <P>In speaking more generally on the issue of the addition to the membership of the Government, in the broad <Col N="69" /> sense of the word &ldquo;Government&rdquo; which this Bill involves, I say the burden of office is not appreciated by people who have not been directly involved.  I suspect that even within the House, many who have not been members of a Government underestimate the burdens that this work entails.  There are very real difficulties now about carrying on the work of Government with the existing pressures. While the addition of three members to the ranks of those engaged in the work of Government may be useful, I do not think it resolves the problem.  I would like to take this opportunity to develop this point a little and to indicate some of the problems which seem to me to exist and to raise the question of whether we may not need to take further action than is proposed here if the work of Government is to be carried on effectively.</P>
    <P>Let us take a typical week of a Minister who is not involved in the EEC but simply carrying on his own duties.  Let us assume, whatever part of the country he comes from, that he arrives in his office punctually on Monday morning and sits down to work.  In many Departments, but not in all, the week may start with a management meeting of the senior officials running over outstanding issues for collective discussion.  This is a very useful meeting where it takes place and possibly even essential in some Departments.  Such a meeting may continue on for most of the morning. The Minister may have Monday afternoon free for work.  He can even perhaps, if he is lucky and very firm, get Monday afternoon free for uninterrupted work.  On Tuesday morning there is the Government meeting. Tuesday afternoon he is in the Dáil, Wednesday he is also in the Dáil and on Thursday as often as not he is in the Dáil, although the Dáil business is sometimes so arranged that Ministers can escape back to their Departments to do some solid work.</P>
    <P>It may be said that Ministers can work within the Dáil.  This is true in respect of part of their work.  It is certainly true in respect of that part of their work which involves receiving <Col N="70" /> delegations or receiving representations from their colleagues in respect of constituency matters or possibly receiving visitors from abroad.  There is much work of this kind which can be carried on reasonably efficiently in the House, despite the interruption of Division Bells.  It is impossible, in my experience, to carry out in the precincts of this House and in one's office here uninterrupted work, work involving reflection, creative work, work of a kind which pre-eminently should be the task of a Minister.  The constant interruption by people coming to call about problems they may have, delegations coming, Division Bells and so on is such that, unless one has an extraordinary mentality, and is capable of cutting oneself off and concentrating absolutely for relatively brief periods which are disturbed by constant interruptions, it is not possible to carry on much of the essential work of a Minister in the conditions of the House.  Come Friday morning there is a Government meeting and, on Friday afternoons, very often the Minister is expected somewhere in the country to address some function or other whether it be a party function or a dinner of some kind.  He may have to leave for that at lunchtime or well before the afternoon is completed.</P>
    <P>It is by no means impossible, therefore, that a Minister can find himself with no more than Monday afternoon to do the solid work, which basically he is paid to do in his office, of reflecting on the problems of his office, on creatively trying to resolve them, on drafting documents and proposals for the Government, on drafting white papers, putting down on paper his ideas, or carrying on a discussion with a group to tease out a problem which, again, may require no interruption. Even leaving the EEC to one side, the burdens of his office as they operate at present on a Minister who, under our Constitution is necessarily a Member of the Dáil and, <i>de facto</i>, has to attend throughout most of the period the Dáil is in session, are considerable.</P>
    <P>To all this has now been added an EEC dimension which is very considerable, <Col N="71" /> not merely for the Minister for Foreign Affairs as I know myself, but for many other Ministers.  There are also many other foreign involvements which have grown up either before or simultaneously with our involvement in the EEC.  For instance, the IMF, the World Bank, the Council of Europe and a wide range of other international bodies, and the necessary work of industrial promotion which may take the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy or, on occasion some other Minister, outside the country seeking to bring new industry to this country to provide employment.</P>
    <P>It is by no means abnormal for a fifth, a quarter or even a third of the Government to be absent from the country simultaneously.  While from the benches opposite there was some criticism about the extent to which while we were in Government numbers of Ministers were absent simultaneously, I have noted with interest and a certain wry amusement that the ratio of absences has in no sense diminished since the Government changed and, if anything, it seems to me that the number of ministerial absences is greater now even than when we were in office.</P>
    <P>This subtracts from the time available for work and, of course, it is not just a question of going to a meeting abroad.  There is the preparation for it and the follow-up afterwards, and the co-ordination between Departments entailed in relation to external affairs, whether within the EEC or elsewhere, all of which adds greatly to the burden of work at home during the reduced period in which a Minister can be at home.</P>
    <P>From all this it is evident that there is a great need to have more personnel available to the Government to whom to devolve functions.  In certain areas where there are an exceptional number of delegations to be received, and/or an exceptional number of public appearances to be made, I wonder whether an additional office may not be required equivalent to that in Britain of Parliamentary Private Secretary, if I understand how that <Col N="72" /> office operates, that is to say, TDs without remuneration but having an office and title and a political role of representing their Minister.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I do not see how the Minister for Education ever finds the time to tackle the immense number of problems in education, given the insistence, and the understandable insistence, by so many people engaged in education, whether teachers or parents or others, to be received by him to present their viewpoints, and the widespread expectation, widespread demand indeed, that when a new school is opened, or a school is added to, he should be present in order to add lustre to the occasion and make a few appropriate remarks.  In practice in that Department what seems to me to have happened over the years is that the burden involved in receiving delegations is sometimes delegated by Ministers.  But this is essentially a political task and is not a job which should be delegated to civil servants. It is a question of a politically sensitive person involved in politics and in the work of politics in dealing with people and hearing what is bothering people, trying to assess the reality and importance of the issues raised, and making a judgment as to what action should be taken.  That is a political task.</P>
    <P>The task of cutting a tape might be delegated to a civil servant but as this is rarely done in complete silence and utterances are required on these occasions, and these utterances often have a political content, this has always seemed to me to be unsatisfactory. In many cases the Minister for Education, through the sheer force of lack of time if he is ever to do any work at all nevertheless has to delegate not merely the receiving of delegations but also public appearances and speeches, sometimes with a high political content, to civil servants.</P>
    <P>I am not in any way suggesting that civil servants should never make public utterances.  This would be a great mistake.  There are many suitable occasions on which civil servants can add to the store of knowledge which the country needs in a public forum.  They might speak in fora <Col N="73" /> such as the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society which has a long tradition of members of the civil service reading papers on different aspects of their work in a non-controversial and non-political manner.  It would be a great loss to the country if civil servants had to be completely silent.</P>
    <P>But the appearance on a public occasion like the opening of a school to make a speech about educational policy is not a civil service function, and is not a function which should be delegated to them.  There have been unhappy experiences in the past.  I can recall an occasion when the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture was asked by his Minister to make a speech denouncing the Irish Farmers' Association which I think everybody would agree was an intensely political act, and one which no civil servant should be asked to undertake.</P>
    <P>If anything, the Bill is too modest in that it mistakenly retains only two levels, where it could have had a third and I am not certain that there should not have been a fourth in which in certain departments TDs might be appointed with some title which would make them valid representatives of Ministers, capable of receiving delegations and speaking politically on political occasions to relieve the burden on Ministers.  I very much doubt that we will ever get the multifarious problems of education sorted out unless something of the kind is done to help the Minister for Education, whoever he may be.  My deepest sympathies go to Deputy Wilson on his task.</P>
    <P>When I became shadow Minister for Education&mdash;and that carried fewer burdens than being Minister and gave one a much freer range&mdash;on the first occasion when I had to speak in the Dáil as shadow Minister there were 40 issues current, and controversial and alive to which it seemed relevant to address myself.  I was accused, not without justice, of being prolix on that occasion.  Indeed, it was not the first or the last time I was so accused.  But the fact is that there were that number of issues.  Perhaps somebody else might not have felt the compulsion to talk <Col N="74" /> about all of them as I did.  I merely mention this an in illustration of the range of problems the Minister for Education has to face.  Yet he is expected at the same time to do all the other things and if he cannot do them, to delegate them to a civil servan' whose job is not to undertake a political function.</P>
    <P>I am doubtful about the adequacy of this Bill and I am doubtful about the decision to retain the two-level arrangement for Government.  wonder whether it should not be three or perhaps even four levels if the system is to work effectively.  The whole system of Government at present leaves little or no time for reflection, reading and policy formulation This means too much of this has to be left to the civil service who, therefore come to be expected to undertake the political role of formulating policy and are expected to tackle problems with the imagination and political insigh which are really the qualities politicians are meant to have, although they may not always have them.  These are qualities one cannot always fairly seek from a civil servant whose  should really be to give reasons to  Minister why the Minister's policy a he formulates it may have defects  weaknesses.  The Minister can then consider the arguments and reformulate his proposals.  What happens in practice is that much policy is formulated by civil servants and, all too often in the past, and certainly in the long period of 16 years when this Government were in office from 1947 to 1963, it was merely rubber stamped by the Minister when it came to him.</P>
    <P>The whole pace of policy making is slowed down by the absence of adequate time for members of the Government to do their task.  All of us in the previous Government must regret that the pressures on us prevented us in the four-and-a-quarter years from doing as much as we had hoped to do. I have a personal regret.  Because of the pressures under which I operated, I was not able in the time available to prepare a draft bringing forward a white paper on the issue of development aid policy to the Government which would have proposed the establishment <Col N="75" /> of a development aid agency, a development aid council.  It was my job to do this.  I should have done it but I did not.  The reason is that there was no hour of the day or night when there was the necessary time available for reflection, drafting, to do the job that had to be done, and many of my colleagues must have had the same frustrations.</P>
    <P>Our system of government is unique in the way in which it limits the possibilities of action by a Minister and puts him under pressure.  Many parliamentary systems entail the attendance of members of government in parliament, but although we are well behind the United Kingdom in this respect, our Dáil sits a good deal more frequently than most.  Because we are in such close proximity to Britain comparisons are constantly being made between ourselves and our near neighbour without regard to the fact that there are 150 other countries in the world and even between 20 and 30 parliamentary democracies.  We tend to measure ourselves against our neighbour, and by that standard our House here does not work as hard.</P>
    <P>In the last issue of <i>The Economist</i> dated October 22nd there is a table which sets out for the 21 countries for which figures are available the number of hours their parliament sits.  The British House of Commons comes tops with 1,528.  Of the 21 countries listed for the period 1968 to 1973, only five sat longer hours than our Dáil, and 15 sat shorter hours.  It has been observed that during the lifetime of the National Coalition the Dáil sat more frequently and for longer hours than in any previous time.  I seem to recall the previous Taoiseach giving some figures which showed that, even before we had been in office four years, the Dáil had sat longer than any previous Dáil in the full five-year period.  Therefore these figures I have are out of date, and probably our position in the roll call of parliaments as to the amount of time we sit is higher; we probably passed out India and Australia during the lifetime of the last Dáil, and we may have been the fourth busiest parliament <Col N="76" /> of the 21 during the last four years.</P>
    <P>Here we have a situation where Ministers are detained in parliament for more hours than is the case in the great majority of other countries. That is the first problem to be faced. In some countries this problem is overcome&mdash;and I mention the Netherlands and France; France is a semi-parliamentary democracy with a presidential system; the Netherlands is a straightforward parliamentary democracy&mdash;in that Ministers are required to resign from parliament on the basis that they could not possibly do their job and attend parliament as well. I am not for a moment suggesting that we do this.  Our traditions are against it, and there would be a good deal of understandable and reasonable resistence to any such change here. However, I mention the fact as an indication of the recognition in some countries of the pressures of parliamentary attendance for the government and the difficulty, even where, as in the case of France, parliament sits a lesser number of hours than in Ireland, posed for Ministers if they have to attend parliament instead of getting on with the job of government.</P>
    <P>In Ireland's case there is a unique combination: first of all, a small number of Ministers in actual terms, 22, now to become 25, including the Parliamentary Secretaries, now to become Ministers of State; secondly attendance at a parliament which, by the standards of other parliaments, meets relatively frequently; thirdly, and this is a particularly Irish feature, the tradition of a Minister being called upon to help with an enormous range of constituency problems.  I do not think there is any parallel in any other country for the scale of constituency work which Members of our parliament and Ministers are expected to handle; fourthly, competition between a Minister and the members of his own party for re-election, in his own constituency; in all other democracies I know of with the exception of Malta, the systems are either single seat systems, where the Minister does not have to compete with anybody from his own party, or list systems where the Minister can be put at the top of <Col N="77" /> the list so that if anybody from his party is selected it is he; only here does the Minister have to compete within his own party for re-election, and under a system where the burden of constituency work is uniquely heavy.</P>
    <P>Against this background of a unique burden of work, there is no &ldquo;cabinet&rdquo; system of the kind which exists in continental countries, in a somewhat different though greatly enlarged form in the United States, and in the EEC Commission itself.  One wonders whether one can indefinitely expect a reasonable standard of government to be achieved against all these odds, bearing in mind that we have to find from amongst 3,000,000 people two teams for Government and Opposition and that therefore even allowing for the fact that our Government is smaller than others, the proportion of the total population required to serve the Government is higher than in most countries, which does not pose a problem of securing sufficient people of ability for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Even accepting the constraints of our form of proportional representation which the people have twice endorsed and which no one wishes to challenge and even accepting ministerial membership of and attendance in parliament unless paired for official duties, can we not consider doing more to ease the load?  We could do it perhaps by, as I said, introducing something like a Parliamentary Private Secretary system for representational purposes and for receiving delegations.  Or we could do it perhaps by introducing a rudimentary &ldquo;cabinet&rdquo; system.</P>
    <P>In the last Government, at any given time, there were about four Ministers each of whom employed a research officer or an equivalent.  I found that to have somebody of the kind available to me, especially as a Minister who was often abroad a good deal, was an immense help in ensuring that I could be reasonably effective in Cabinet by being fully up-to-date and by being able to have carried out any particular studies or research necessary for me to contribute adequately to general Cabinet discussions.  In the particular context of my Department, perhaps because of the special recruitment <Col N="78" /> system there, I did not think there was a need for a &ldquo;cabinet&rdquo; officer in relation to departmental affairs but that certainly somebody was needed to help me in relation to my general Cabinet work.</P>
    <P>Where problems arose on a couple of occasions which affected Departments where the Minister had a research officer of this kind, it transpired that by working together at their level the research officers were able to resolve problems without dragging the Minister in and taking up his time. However, as there were only four cases where such officers existed, the number of cases where they could work together to reduce the burden on the Minister were relatively few. Nevertheless, I was moved to wonder whether, as we face the increasing complexity of Government, there might not be something to be said for every Minister having at least one &ldquo;cabinet&rdquo; officer, so that, not alone would he have the assistance which I am convinced he needs from somebody, on the one hand, politically sensitive, and, on the other hand, highly skilled in the relevant disciplines of economics and sociology, but such research officers, by working together where interdepartmental difficulties arises, could resolve some of the interdepartmental problems which take up so much of the time of Ministers&mdash;as is the custom incontinental countries and in the EEC Commission.</P>
    <P>One of the lessons of Government for me was that the departmental structure poses very great problems for efficient government.  Each Department is, I will not say an empire but a kingdom in its own right.  Each has its own predilections and attitudes which are handed down and which seem relatively immune to the movement of Ministers through the Department, although sometimes a strong Minister leaves his stamp and a sniff of him will remain behind in the departmental attitudes for ten or 20 years afterwards.  But basically each Department has very clear ideas of its own, and on almost every issue you will find the civil servants either want to keep the function they have or to take over a function somebody else has or&mdash;and this arises quite <Col N="79" /> frequently&mdash;no Department wants to take on a particular function.  Both of these opposite sources of quarrels take up endless time which might not cost the country quite so much ultimately in terms of quality of government if the quarrels were confined to civil servants, but when Ministers are dragged into them and expected to represent the departmental view, and when the whole matter has to go to Cabinet for final adjudication, as happens in our system, a great deal of time is wasted.</P>
    <P>For a Government, which never had any difficulty as between two parties in Government, we certainly frequently had problems between Departments, which had nothing to do with politics but which arose simply from departmental attitudes, with Departments refusing either to accept responsibility or trying to take somebody else's responsibility.  These demands and attitudes were at the civil service level rather than at ministerial level so that on occasions Ministers were having to moderate enthusiasm or, when there was a refusal to accept responsibility, stir up enthusiasm.  Given that so much of the time consumed is consumed in sorting out these difficulties, judging by our experience, to have a &ldquo;cabinet&rdquo; system through which many of these difficulties could be reconciled without having to go to the Government would be a great improvement.</P>
    <P>While I certainly welcome the addition of three members to the Administration I regret that the Taoiseach is not here to give us his views on the very important issues involved and to tell us how he proposes to use these new additions to the Government. There have been repeated rumours in the Press to the effect that one of these additions might be a Minister of State for Northern Ireland. I should like to comment briefly on that, though only on the basis of rumour.  I certainly accept the wisdom of the Taoiseach retaining overall responsibility in this area, even in a Government totally free from the kind of tensions from which Fianna Fáil suffered for a long time in respect of <Col N="80" /> Northern Ireland.  This system of the Taoiseach having overall responsibility has worked well and was a very important element in ensuring that we had a clearcut Northern Ireland policy and in our relations with the United Kingdom we knew where we stood and they knew where we stood. The system worked and works as of now on the basis that the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs engaged on Anglo-Irish affairs generally did and does the work, in close liaison with the Taoiseach's office.  It is not on the basis of the Taoiseach's office having a separate Northern Ireland section undertaking that work.</P>
    <P>The reason for this is quite simple. The whole relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom, including the relationship with Northern Ireland, is so complex, and the different elements interact so closely, that you cannot divide off Northern Ireland relations from other Anglo-Irish relations.  In fact, in the Department itself you will find that right down to the lowest diplomatic level each officer is engaged simultaneously in work related to Northern Ireland and to Anglo-Irish relations generally.  To try to take out the Northern Ireland aspect and bring it over to the Taoiseach's office would be a grave mistake and, therefore, if it is in the Taoiseach's mind to appoint a Minister of State for Northern Ireland I would hope that that Minister of State would continue to work with the existing staff in the Department of Foreign Affairs and be Minister of State to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach.  This is important for many reasons including the fact that there is a danger of our being divided in dealing with the United Kingdom Government, a Government which could at times have its own reasons for finding it useful to deal with different Departments on aspects of the same problem which are closely interlocked.  It is not improbable that there have been moments in the past when there has been some evidence of members of the United Kingdom Government thinking it possible to do that and that is why the overall co-ordination should be in the Taoiseach's hands and it is also why all Anglo-Irish <Col N="81" /> work, including that related to Northern Ireland, should departmentally be kept together.</P>
    <P>I hope to hear the Taoiseach on this subject and on the subject of what other areas he believes there is need for strengthening by the addition of Ministries of State.  It is unsatisfactory that we should be asked to buy a pig in a poke.  It is unsatisfactory that we are not told what is the thinking behind the additional posts, what responsibilities will be allocated to the new people or whether, in adding three new people to the team, the existing responsibility pattern will be modified, namely, the responsibilities of the existing seven Parliamentary Secretaries.  I trust that at some stage of the debate the Taoiseach will enlighten us on some of these points.</P>
    <P>There are two other points.  One is the suggestion that these Ministers should continue in office during an election instead of finding themselves deprived of office and the emoluments and trappings of office, the traditional Mercedes, or Peugeot as it became during our term in office.  I can see the political disadvantages at the next election if there are more people moving around with greater facility in their own cars but nonetheless I think it is the right solution, It may work against us in the next election.  It will certainly work against Fianna Fáil in the following one.</P>

      <P>It is absurd for office holders to find themselves in the uncertain position of having to be reappointed, after the Government have lost office, for the period of the transition.  It is an Alice-in-Wonderland system and it is a situation that should be tidied up.  Even if it works against us in the next election the Minister is right in making this change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One matter I would like to query&mdash; it is a carry over from the past&mdash;relates to the appointment of a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of State for the Department of Defence. My recollection is that this arose originally during the last war.  I may be wrong in that.  There may be provision in the Constitution for a Parliamentary <Col N="82" /> Secretary to the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It goes back almost to another war.  I think it arose when the functions of the Department of Defence were, unhappily for the country, much greater and more important and onerous than they are now.  Since then a Parliamentary Secretary has always had to be appointed to the Minister for Defence irrespective of whether or not there was work for him and irrespective of whether or not the Minister has been able to discharge the duties of that Department fully.  There is an artificial element here and so I wonder whether it is necessary to keep this particular appointment.  I have no objection to any Taoiseach, if he thinks it proper, appointing a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence but it is a bit akin to putting into the Constitution a proviso that there cannot be any legislation for divorce.  It is the same kind of superfluity.  If the Taoiseach feels he needs a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence and if for the purpose of the meetings of the council referred to in section 5 (2) it is necessary to have political representation there and he wants that representation to be by way of Parliamentary Secretary, fair enough, but I do not see why the Taoiseach's hands should be tied and I think the person attending the meetings of the council should be the Minister for Defence if, in fact, there is no other need for a Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;that is, in so far as this council meets and however frequently. We have a somewhat fictional situation here.  The council may not meet very often and the Parliamentary Secretary may have no other relationship with the Department beyond being required to exist in order to attend this council, if it ever meets. <Col N="83" /> I would prefer the matter to be left to the discretion of the Taoiseach.  I just wonder whether it is necessary to carry on this provision in this mandatory form.</P>
      <P>We welcome the Bill but I hope that before the debate concludes we will hear from the Taoiseach.  I hope some of the points I have raised will stir echoes from other speakers in the Labour Party and in Fianna Fáil so that we may have a reasonably wide-ranging discussion on the functions of Government.  This Bill provides us with an opportunity for such a discussion.  We have inherited a system of Government which struggles on. All of us involved in Government have done our best to make the system work but the system has serious defects.  I think it is no harm to discuss it in a detached way.  It is not a political issue and we are not opposing the Bill and, therefore, a wide-ranging, non-political debate would be useful.  Even if it does not lead to substantial changes in the Bill it might help the thinking of the Government and of the House, the media and public opinion generally on these difficulties of the Government which are too infrequently aired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody on this side of the House will oppose the idea that there should be an extra tier of office holders acting for the Government. Anybody who has had experience of serving in Government knows that especially since our membership of the EEC the duties of Ministers have become much more onerous and demanding in time and so on.  We have no reservations on this step by the Executive, their nominations, change of title of the Parliamentary Secretary and the naming of ten Ministers of State under this Bill.  We might understandably argue about the actual personnel but I do not think anybody on this side would argue about the need for such extra assistance in the performance of the duties of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Administration in which I served was the first administration to operate as a member Government of <Col N="84" /> the EEC.  Looking back on it, I do not think the Opposition in that period fully understood the wider demands being made on all office holders in that Administration from 1973 to 1977.  It is something that they are obviously learning now after a relatively short period in office&mdash;that the workload is so much heavier than when they were formerly in office and when this State was not a member of the EEC.  One might question whether the change in title which the present seven Parliamentary Secretaries will have when this measure is passed should involve modification of their existing duties, what changes should be made and whether their fitness for the new role of Ministers of State has been fully examined by the Executive before their nomination as part of the new ten-member Ministry of State.  Possibly that is a matter of personal opinion. The Executive are entitled to look for this extra assistance.</P>
    <P>I should have thought the Minister was overstating the case in saying that this was another instalment of the programme of reform of the institutions of Government.  It is a very small step that, I think, had to follow our membership of the Community and I am disappointed that the Tánaiste in his capacity as Minister for the Public Service has not made the Bill more wide-ranging in relation to the Cabinet offices themselves.  Some attention must be given to the present organisation of the Departments of State.  We have only to look at Britain to note that they have been much more adventurous in their organisation of the Cabinet.  They have abolished Departments as the need for them disappeared and amalgamated Departments when that appeared to be the need of the hour.  Over the past ten or 15 years one may have seen even in this State that particular Departments, as circumstances altered, coming to the forefront or seeming to have a more crucial role than they formerly had.  It behoves the Executive when that happens, when there is extra pressure on a Department, to give consideration to the powers of existing Departments being changed or amalgamated.</P>
    <P>I think especially of the new role assumed over the last few years by <Col N="85" /> the Department of Justice and the Department of Defence which, one could say slumbered on in the Sixties and which in the more dangerous period of the late Sixties and early Seventies found that very heavy responsibilities rested on the men controlling those Departments.  Other Departments also come to mind.  If the Minister does not do so here and if he is committed to wide-ranging reforms in the public service.  I hope he will give some consideration to such developments as these.  While in recent years in regard to the Public Service we have had the Devlin Report very little attention has been given to the organisation of Government itself.  It could be argued that Devlin's work and recommendations concentrated on the organisation of the Departments as service units and did not consider what is at the heart of the democratic control of Departments.  The question is how do we organise these Departments so that the political head is truly the head of the Department and truly responsible for its policy formation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold the view that the Aireacht does not meet that function.  I believe the function properly belongs to the Minister as head of the Department.  I take the Minister's point that he would suggest that the Aireacht meets that point.  I maintain that it does not.  I also maintain that the whole thrust of the Devlin Report is not concerned with this interaction, this relationship between the Minister and his Department which I believe to be the most important question arising in the organisation of a democratic state. To some extent, we have ignored that problem just as we have ignored over the years the actual reform of this Parliament.  In the period of the last Administration some changes were made in the organisation of this Parliament, and for the better I think, but they were not sufficiently wide-ranging.  I hope the new Administration will turn its attention to the actual reform of Parliament itself because, quite outside any individual <Col N="86" /> party political view on the matter I think it would be better in the interests of the State itself that Parliament should be seen to be more responsive in its own organisation to changes occurring in our society.  The same caution that marked our approach to the organisation of Government marked our approach to the organisation of Parliament.</P>
      <P>We have no objection to the changes sought in this Bill, to the appointment of ten extra Ministers of State.  The delegation powers are spelled out in section 2; as yet, we have no details about the areas of responsibility coming under these various delegations. Presumably when these have been made known the Ministers of State will answer to this House for the policy areas delegated to them in Departments. I hope we shall not find Ministers of State coming into the House acting as shields for the Ministers of the Government in relation to their overall departmental responsibilities when this measure goes through.  I hope, in other words, that a Minister of State will answer to the House for his exact area of responsibility but that the Minister of Government, as he will be known when this Bill is passed, will be here just as frequently himself answering for his responsibility at Question Time and so on.</P>

    <P>I think the case has already been well enough made that in conditions of our membership of the European Community if a Minister is anxious to make a proper input into policy formation at EEC level a good daal of time will be consumed by that effort.  There is also the Council of Ministers' meetings which will be more frequent depending on which Department is involved.  These functions will be much more demanding in relation to the Departments of Finance, Agriculture or Foreign Affairs which will be to the forefront in relation to policy formation in EEC affairs.  Their policy input is extremely important for domestic reasons.  Other Departments not as much involved in EEC affairs as these three Departments will be called upon to make a very heavy policy input.  The Department of Labour for which I had responsibility in our period of administration has <Col N="87" /> responsibility for the social fund.  Next to the moneys coming from the agricultural funds of the EEC the social fund gives us most money on an annual basis and it is clear that the policy input of that Department in relation to decisions on the disbursement of the social fund is of crucial importance to us.  The policy input by the Minister concerned cannot be confined simply to his attendance at Council of Ministers' meetings.</P>
    <P>It is often necessary to garner support for a proposal before a Council of Ministers' meeting takes place.  A Minister may have to call on his counterpart in London, Paris or Bonn to get support for a particular measure. Of course, a Minister may simply rely on a departmental brief but if he is genuinely interested in getting a successful outcome it will be necessary to get as much support as possible before a Council of Ministers' meeting. This means that the Minister would be called away from home duties. There is a conflict between home duties and such duties and this conflict is sharper in relation to certain Departments.  As year follows year decisions made in Brussels will become more and more important and the outcome of developments at home will depend more and more on them.</P>
    <P>Apart from participation in other international institutions, our participation in the European Community lays a heavy burden in all Departments of State and in the Cabinet as a whole there is a greater need to understand the latest policy developments at EEC level.  This requires constant contact with one's counterparts. It is easier to arrange for the success of a national viewpoint if one's counterparts have been contacted to get support before a meeting.</P>
    <P>In relation to the transport regulations which are again before this Administration it was necessary for us in our period in office to contact our counterparts in Copenhagen and in London for support and with that support we managed to hold a position for a longer period than was thought possible at the time.  That <Col N="88" /> was possible because we explained our view to the other Ministers and made a united approach.  All of this calls for a good deal of political attention to the realities which exist for support in the EEC.  If Ministers have the assistance of Ministers of State, negotiating powers could be delegated to them where it is not possible for a Minister to attend.  It is not always possible for a civil servant to get the kind of support or make the kind of appeal that only politicians can make. I have no hesitation in saying that the measure before us today is worthy of support.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Department of Labour's involvement in the social fund of the EEC, the Department were also involved in the affairs of the International Labour Organisation.  The United States have announced their intention of withdrawing from that organisation.  In my time the Department of Labour took a very strong interest in that organisation and with the threat of the US withdrawal I called to see both Mr. George Meaney in the United States and called on other EEC Ministers.  I considered it my duty, since there had been a historical connection between this State and the International Labour Organisation, that we should do our utmost to see that our influence was put behind the survival of this organisation. Much of the international effort, much of the work abroad of Departments in the EEC context especially, is not understood.  There is an opinion that the making of political contact with other Ministers in the Community is not important and is to no avail.  I hope I shall never criticise any member of the Government for making contact with his counterpart abroad.  That kind of criticism should only come from those who do not understand the obligations of sovereignty in the Seventies for this State.  They do not understand that they are running down their own country when they suggest that a Minister should not maximise his and the State's influence before a decision is made.</P>
    <P>We have learned from our experience of the need for extra help for office holders.  After the direct elections, <Col N="89" /> when the European Parliament comes into office presumably there will be need for office holders to attend certain sessions of the Parliament.  It is probably too soon to say whether that will become a heavy call on their time but it is possible that it might.  Since we cannot have extra Departments of State, I feel there is a case for the amalgamation of certain Departments. The British have been much more adventurous in this area.  I hope that the Tánaiste and Minister for the Public Service will turn his attention to this and see whether a case can be made for the amalgamation of certain Departments.  For example, on the inference before us, it is not possible to say to what areas the new Ministers of State will be allocated.  There is the suggestion&mdash;to which I think the Leader of the Fine Gael Party referred&mdash;that there may be a new Minister of State for Northern Ireland.  That continuing problem could well merit the attention of a Minister of State who would report, presumably directly, to the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>However, I would suggest there are other small departmental areas which could call for the attention of a Minister of State.  This goes back to my argument that particular Departments, depending on the circumstances of the time, come to the fore and are seen to have a more crucial role to play than they had formerly.  If problems in industrial relations continue at their present intensity&mdash;despite the best efforts of the Minister for Labour not to intervene &mdash;it is possible that more and more of that Minister's time will be consumed by such interventions.  Though I did my best to remain out, believing that the parties themselves ultimately were the best settlers of any problem, in certain national disputes that did occur&mdash;especially over the final period of office of the last administration&mdash; it was impossible to remain out because they did not appear to be coming anywhere near settlement.  A clamour arose for something to be done and it was impossible not to intervene in those circumstances.  However, if the situation and these pressures continue as serious as they are at present, then a good deal of the <Col N="90" /> time of the Minister for Labour will be occupied in such interventions.  My experience of such interventions is that a great deal of time is used up.  Other things one would like to do cannot be tackled.  From August, 1976, to practically the general election I was involved continuously in discussions with either employers or unions.  I spent the entire month of August, 1976, involved in the bank dispute. That continued until September.  Then straight afterwards I had tripartite discussions with employers and unions and they continued until October.  All that was vital in laying the groundwork for a possible national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>The problem all of us must face in this House in explaining a Bill of this sort is that if one were to explain to the public on what one's time was spent one would not receive a great deal of sympathy; there would be a misunderstanding about whether or not one was working.  If a Minister, in the performance of his departmental duties can be called into long meetings with representative bodies, where relations have broken down between them and he is asked to settle disputes of that character and simultaneously is asked to introduce as much legislation into Parliament as possible obviously he has got some conflicts to resolve in how he does his work.</P>
    <P>The Ministers of State could be very helpful to other Ministers in this matter of preparing legislation.  The material for the legislation in which I was involved in the last year of the previous administration's life, in 1976-77, had gone into the parliamentary draftsman's machine quite some time before it emerged finally in this House. Since we are talking about reform of the public business of the State here, of government, I would recommend to the Tánaiste that early attention be given to the extra staffing of the draftsmen's office.  A great deal of delay occurred in the production of our legislation because the staffing situation in that office was poor.  I am not blaming the personnel of that office&mdash;they had a difficult task&mdash;but in a matter as important as the bringing forward of legislation it is an indictment <Col N="91" /> of one's efficiency to say that a particular office is poorly staffed.  It can be cited as a delay in bringing forward that legislation.  That was my predicament in such legislation.  Even if one does increase the staff in the draftsmen's office it will still be necessary for a daily, certainly weekly, political input on the whole matter of the bringing forward of legislation.  It will be necessary to have a good deal of consultation.  There is the consultation with other Departments of State that must continue.  But there is also the necessity for continual contact with the draftsmen's office and one's own Department, which is very time-consuming.</P>
    <P>Here the Ministers of State could play a very valuable, important and helpful role in assisting a Minister interested in bringing forward as much legislation as possible.  The only imprint a politician can make in office is that on legislation.  Admittedly there may be other Departments where other achievements can be arrived at but, if one finds oneself in a social department, then obviously one is talking about new legislation.  My assessment of a competent Minister is one who is decisively in control of his Department.  That is what democracy is all about.  The voter votes for a party and a politician in the hope that that party, if they come to power, will really run the business of State.  He does not want some civil servant doing it for him; he wants the person he voted for to do it, admittedly with the advice of the civil servant, but he wants the decisive control to be in the hands of the politician in charge of the Department.  That is the first assessment of any office holder&mdash;is he or is he not in charge of his own Department? Having established that, the next question is whether he is doing a good job.  It is another day's work to decide that.  But the first and most crucial test is whether he is in control of his Department.  He is not in control of it if he is simply accepting advice from his Department, without any opinion of his own on the file before him and stating what are his views without any policy input of his own.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="92" /> The point has been made already that there is here the suggestion of the abolition of the Parliamentary Secretary's role in substitution for that of Minister of State.  Had the Government come in here today with a whole battery of extra titles to assist office holders, people selected out of their ranks, I would have supported that also because there can be no contention on this side of the House that we will oppose any Bill designed to improve the performance of government. We might argue about the personnel who will carry out those duties and that is understandable.  However, we certainly could not oppose any Bill which seeks seriously to improve the performance of the Government in office, by way of seeking extra assistance from the House.</P>
    <P>I think it a pity also that perhaps the function of Parliamentary Secretary is eternally abolished and substituted by Ministers of State because there are functions that could be carried out by Parliamentary Secretaries also.  I would have thought there was some merit in the idea, it was a matter some of us did consider in our period in office, that there is a good case to be made for adopting the Parliamentary Private Secretary convention which I understand is used in Britain, that is, the nomination of parliamentary members for duties with particular Ministers and Departments, as I understand it, in a non-paying capacity.</P>
    <P>It is a good means of recruitment for later promotion for Ministers of State, as they will exist now, to ministerial level.  We must begin to develop in this Parliament a rational line of ascent to ministerial office. Perhaps it may be naïve to think it possible to separate that promotion path from the rather more time-honoured political connections based on constituency strength and so on.  By nominating TDs who are interested in State service, by giving them the possibility of becoming Parliamentary Private Secretaries, the Executive would have the opportunity of testing people.  If holding office does any one thing it probes and tests one's weaknesses. <Col N="93" /> Under the present system no one can tell if a person will stand the test until he is appointed.  However, we can lessen the dangers of someone not being able to face up to the responsibilities of office by having some system such as the Parliamentary Private Secretary arrangement.</P>
    <P>Ministers of any executive will be subjected to extra work from now on. There is a public demand for what is referred to as &ldquo;open government&rdquo;, one that explains its policy measures and its approach to particular questions.  A Minister must be an administrator in his own Department and he must also steer through legislation in this House.  He must be on top of the work in his own Department, he must know about work proceeding in other EEC countries and understand about the policies operating there.  As a Minister he must maintain his own influence in Cabinet. People do not really appreciate that if a Minister is to be an effective member of the Cabinet a considerable amount of paperwork must be got through and there must be many consultations with colleagues.  All of this is time-consuming.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any one on this side of the House who has served in Government could, in conscience, oppose a measure that suggests that these Ministers of State, by delegation of powers, will take over some of the duties that presently belong to Ministers. Of course this is on the understanding that these powers of delegation will be clearly limited and explained, that the Ministers of State will be answerable to the House for the areas so delegated to them, that they will not be sent in here as reluctant shields for Ministers who do not want to attend before the House when they can do so.  I should like to hear from the Minister on that aspect. While he may not be ready to declare on it now, I should like to hear from him whether it is contemplated giving consideration to the question of organisation of the Departments of State themselves.</P>

      <P>Before saying anything about the specific provisions of the <Col N="94" /> Bill, I wish to draw the attention of the House to the general state of business in which the Bill is being taken.  This is the fourth week the Dáil has sat since the summer recess&mdash;I do not count the two days it sat in July&mdash;a recess that was three months long.  I have the most acute recollection of the way the Government I served was treated in 1973 when we were slow in bringing forward new legislation, particularly legislation corresponding to the programme on which we were elected.  I invite the House and the nation to consider the situation in this Dáil where the House has been working for the past four weeks essentially on steam generated by the National Coalition.  Essentially it has been working on Bills that in most cases were on the Order Paper or which had progressed to the middle of Committee Stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are a couple of exceptions of which this is one and it is a very significant one.  However generally the business of this House since 12th October&mdash;notwithstanding the three months recess&mdash;has been business which the National Coalition left behind.  I contrast that with the situation in 1973 when we inherited a country which so far as legislation was concerned resembled Mother Hubbard's cupboard.  It was absolutely bare.</P>

      <P>I do not want to fall out with the Chair, least of all at an early stage of my contribution, but I think I must paint in the background against which I shall make some remarks about this Bill.  I am afraid there will be more asperity in them than what the House has heard from the Leader of my Party or from Deputy O'Leary.  Not one Bill from the 19th Dáil was reinstated at the beginning <Col N="95" /> of the 20th Dáil because no Bill was fit for reinstatement at that time.  However, when this Dáil met, six or eight Bills could be reinstated straightaway&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="96" /> The only legislation brought before this Dáil, which is absolutely brand new Fianna Fáil legislation, is this Bill and the very closely cognate first Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill, as well as the Bill relating to the European Assembly.  I observe from the Minister's demeanour that he is not willing to listen to me in the same silence and with the same patience that he showed to Deputy O'Leary and Deputy FitzGerald.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The only serious legislation we have seen from this new Government, which had all the answers in June, and which was not on the Order Paper of the 20th Dáil, is the European Elections Bill, which was all there bar the Schedule, which is the guts of the Bill, and the two Ministers and Secretaries Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first of these Bills, which was passed by the House last week, created a change in the organisation of the public service, a change which was conspicuously not recommended by the Devlin Review Group.  The Minister's colleague, Deputy Barrett, now Minister for the Environment, in occupying a re-titled Department and nothing more than a re-titling is in the change, as a question on today's Order Paper was designed to elicit.  That change was not recommended by the Devlin Review Group either.  I freely admit that there is a lot of room for a restrictive interpretation of what the <Col N="97" /> Devlin Group were supposed to do. They were asked to do this:</P>
    <P>Having regard to the growing responsibilities of Government, to examine and report on the organisation of the Departments of State at the higher levels, including the appropriate distribution of functions as between both Departments themselves and Departments and other bodies.</P>
    <P>I freely concede that they were not specifically asked to make recommendations in regard to the political heads or leadership of Departments.  Since the twenties there has been no such thing in this country as a Minister floating in a void, a Minister, senior or junior, without a job.  An arrangement of Departments is the same thing at the business end as an arrangement of Ministries.</P>
    <P>The only thing we have seen from the new Government is a regarding, what they think is a voguish regrading, of a couple of ranks and the upgrading in title, in nothing more than language, of themselves.  That is the sum total of new Fianna Fáil legislation. We have not yet seen what is going to be done about the ground rents; we have not yet seen what is going to finance the local authorities when the rates go; we have not yet seen anything to regularise the fact that, at present, everyone driving round with an out of-date tax disc is technically in breach of the law.  What we are seeing is a lace curtain mentality promotion of themselves, only in words&mdash;it is not going to mean more brain input or more work input &mdash;and a more voguish re-adjustment of Departments to correspond with what they think is up-to-date thinking in that regard.  Perhaps they do not know that the Department of the Environment created in Britain has been dismantled and that the Department of Economic Planning has been dismantled.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as this Bill effects an increase in the number of recognisable office holders, recognisable persons carrying ministerial responsibility, I support it.  Quite apart from party discipline, I would have supported it if such a Bill had been introduced by the Government I served.  The former Taoiseach volunteered in his acceptance speech on 14th March, 1973, that the Government were going to consider the institution of further political offices which he described as &ldquo;Ministers of State&rdquo;.  I thought it was a good idea.  I hope the Minister will not think that I am trying to disarm him when I say that I had not specifically in mind any prospect of promotion for myself in supporting the idea.  I believe that too much work is spread among too few, as Deputies FitzGerald and O'Leary have said.  It might have been a good idea if the former Taoiseach had gone ahead and introduced a small number of extra jobs.  Some Ministers in the <Col N="99" /> Coalition Government were grotesquely overworked.  Perhaps the Minister can now imagine for himself what it must have been like.  It would be wrong to single out individuals because it might imply that others did not pull their weight, but there were two or three Ministers who were visibly overworked. Only for the fact that they had constitutions like horses, and in the case of the Leader of my Party, the constitution of three horses, it could not have been done.  The public and some Members of this House have absolutely no conception of the weight of the burden that lay on them.</P>
      <P>This Bill is to be welcomed to the extent that it will produce a further three office holders, but I want to emphasise that what the former Taoiseach had in mind was most positively not the automatic upgrading of all the seven Parliamentary Secretaries. What he had in mind was the creation of a new layer of office holder, somewhere between a member of the Government and a Parliamentary Secretary.  The word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; or the phrase &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo; does not appear in our Constitution. The only expression recognised by the Constitution is &ldquo;Member of the Government&rdquo;.  The former Taoiseach had in mind a man who would be between the two grades.  If that idea had gone through I would have urged him to call these new office holders just plain &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; and not &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo;, which is a clumsy title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I have irritated the Minister and will irritate him again before I finish, I would urge him to consider, instead of traipsing along behind the English and taking yet another feather from them, calling these persons, of whom I trust Deputy Lalor will be one, plain Ministers and not Ministers of State.  There is no point in the objection being met by saying that this would confuse them with higher personage such as the Tánaiste.  That is not even a legal point because the Tánaiste's strict description in constitutional terms is not &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; but &ldquo;member of the Government&rdquo;. The point about these additional persons <Col N="100" /> is that they will be Ministers who are not members of the Government but to simply refer to them as Ministers would be simpler, clearer, less pompous and less obviously borrowed from the British.</P>
    <P>In reference to the chivalry of a German general, Churchill used the expression &ldquo;If I can make myself heard over the din of battle...&rdquo; might I say that if I could make myself heard over the din of battle, that Deputy Colley should respond to my urging him to delete the words &ldquo;of State&rdquo; from this Bill?  Let the English work out the difference for a change instead of our going on all fours to explain it to them.  Likewise, let everybody else take the trouble to look at the Irish way of doing things instead of lifting our caps to them like the Paddies that Fianna Fáil, in their hearts, believe us to be.  Let us say now that we are very sorry for causing all this confusion on the international scene but that we are doing it our way.  Despite all the flummery of the Minister with regard to international practice what we are doing here is falling into line with the British. For the umpteenth time I protest at that being done.  The Coalition were not altogether faultless either in this regard but never since the foundation of the State have there been a party so enslaved mentally and emotionally to the British as the party who are now in Government.  This is curious. It is something on which it would be worthwhile hearing Senator Cruise-O'Brien expound.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows only too well what constituents tend to be interested in.  His party have a better grasp of such matters than we have.  That is the secret of the success of his party.  I have not yet received any letter from a constituent about this Bill.  Neither have I heard anything from them about the Minister's ambitions for the country and about his fears that we would be mistaken for parliamentary secretaries when we really have such a lot of junior Ministers. I have yet to have a deputation take up my time in trying to persuade me about the rightness or otherwise of that point of view.  All constituents are interested in is medical cards.  houses and ensuring that the Government keep their promises.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be fair to the Minister's devoted staff to say that they have let him down but he has let himself down by acquiescing in the statement in his speech which says that &ldquo;experience has shown that the effective delegation of functions and of the necessary authority for their discharge to parliamentary secretaries is impeded by the title of the office&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I was a Parliamentary Secretary for four years and on my oath I can say that not at any stage did I consider myself impeded by my title.  I was proud to have had a title that goes back to the first Government, a title created at a time when it was dangerous to support that Government and dangerous to be in office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was proud, too, of the confidence that the then Taoiseach displayed in giving me that title.  I did not seek to have the title changed. Neither did it cross the then Taoiseach's mind that it would be a flattery to me or an improvement to my status merely to promote me in <Col N="102" /> title.  I was surprised to find that the notion had even occurred to Deputy FitzGerald that in any sense it was an impeding of my occasional appearances on the international scene that I was not a full Minister.  I was not a full Minister so why should I masquerade as one?  Why should I behave in that way and hope that foreigners would be taken in when in fact, so far as the Department of Foreign Affairs were concerned at any rate, I was the man who stood in when the Minister could not attend, the man who was put into the Department when the presidency of the EEC rendered it essential for the first time since the foundation of the State to have a parliamentary secretary in that Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This whole element of title, of sham, of show and of eyewash in this Bill really sticks in my gullet although I support the idea of lightening the burden.  Consequently, it was not my intention to oppose the Bill.  However, I dislike very much what the &ldquo;Europologues&rdquo; are now calling &ldquo;the modalities&rdquo; by which it is being effected.  The Minister would achieve the same result by creating a new grade of Minister <i>simpliciter</i>, leaving out the &ldquo;of State&rdquo; and by leaving the Parliamentary Secrtary grade as it is, a grade that has served the country well.  The Minister would be better engaged in creating three new Ministers and appointing people to recognisable spheres of activity.  Something I would be very keen on would be the appointment of the kind of person who might not be of sufficient political weight to warrant inclusion in the Government in the strict constitutional sense but who would be appropriate for appointment to a position superior to that of Parliamentary Secretary, an appointment that would give him responsibility for that sphere recommended by the Devlin Committee, namely what they called national culture.  I trust nobody will misunderstand me on this.  I detest the expression &ldquo;national culture&rdquo;.  It seems to me to be an expression used by countries that are self-conscious about their national culture or lack of it.  However, the Devlin idea in this context is correct.  They condemned the present <Col N="103" /> splitting of responsibility in regard to our cultural heritage, to the manmade physical environment to the extent that it is not purely functional and for the interesting of the public in these matters between the Department of Education, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Office of Public Works and the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a separate Ministry being given the responsibility of combining all those functions but I trust that the Minister has not forgotten that recommendation.  In our time in office, for reasons which I think a Deputy explained in the debate last week, that at a time when everbody else was being asked to tighten his belt we, as the former Taoiseach said, ought not be seen to make life easier for ourselves.  That was the uppermost factor in his mind in not going ahead with this idea but, perhaps, in time it will become easier to implement.  In the event of a Bill being introduced in this regard I promise not to be abrasive about it.  The present position is that all these functions are more or less the Cinderellas of three or four different Departments. Conversely, that is an additional new office that is necessary but for which this Bill makes no specific provision. I realise that it is not designed to do that.  It is not excluded that there might be such a thing, and I would like to see it.</P>
    <P>Conversely&mdash;I do not want to be categorical or dogmatic about this because I have not heard the point argued&mdash;I am not sure if it is necessary to have a Parliamentary Secretary as heretofore, or now a Minister for State, in the Department of Defence.  I occupied the nominal title of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence for a little less than two years.  I had not even a room in the building of the Department of Defence in Parkgate Street nor did I ever seek one, nor was any business ever given to me or my co-operation ever invited in a matter which would have required it.  My only function, apart from ceremonial occasions of a military kind which I attended <Col N="104" /> occasionally, was one resulting logically from the existence of a body known as the Council of Defence.  In the roughly two years that I was there that council met twice and on one of the occasions I could not attend it because of my job as Whip here in the House which prevented me from attending.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not in breach of any great secret or letting the country down in the sight of the world by saying that on the occasion I did attend the Council of Defence, the only matter discussed related to the use of the Irish language in the issuing of military commands.  That function, if there are no other functions than that kind, does not need to exist.  If it does need to exist I cannot see that it is absolutely necessary to include a provision for a Parliamentary Secretary or a Minister of State in that Department.  Let the provision in question be amended to say that at a time when there is in existence a Parliamentary Secretary or a Minister of State in the Department of Defence he shall be a member of the Council of Defence.  The classic consequence of the way the law at present stands is that whether the Government feel the need for it or not there has to be a Deputy, or a Senator perhaps, carrying this title although he has virtually nothing whatsoever to do with that Department.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to hear these three incidental points over the rumble of warfare through the seats. I urge him to cross out the words &ldquo;of State&rdquo; in this legislation.  As a personal preference of my own I urge him to consider going ahead with that general recommendation in regard to the Ministry of National Culture and attribute that Ministry to one of these new Ministers.  I urge him to look again at the legislation which this Bill proposes to amend regarding the existence of a junior Minister in the Department of Defence.  There may be a good reason for having one there.  My existence there was characterised only by ceremonial occasions and standing in occasionally for the Minister at Question Time.  It is a pity that a serious matter like the <Col N="105" /> distribution of State offices should be in even the smallest degree made inflexible by the existence of this provision in regard to the Council of Defence which plays a very small role in official life.</P>
    <P>The other thing I want to mention is the question of the burden of ministerial office, which is central to this Bill.  The Leader of my party, Deputy FitzGerald, who, as I have said, has the constitution of three horses and any number of men, spoke about this burden. I thought he was the only man I had ever met who never seemed to feel such a burden.  There were times when it could be seen from his demeanour and in his person that he must have been fatigued but he never seemed to realise that he was fatigued.  It was very impressive to me that even that man, who I am certain even his political foes as well as his political friends will admit is unique in everyone's experience, feels that he has to speak about the burden of ministerial office.  Sometimes he seems scarcely flesh and blood at all, his energy is so superhuman.</P>
    <P>I want to say something about flesh and blood office holder.  I was never a member of Government and was only very briefly at the end of the last Government in an office senior to that of Parliamentary Secretary.  Before I say anything which might be interpreted as making an excuse or a begging-off from the performance of duties commonly expected of office holders, I want to say a word in regard to Press reaction on issues of this kind.  I have noticed with pleasure that on a couple of occasions when there has been a conspicuous death in ministerial ranks here or across the water the Press have tended to react by saying &ldquo;They ought to look again a bit more carefully at what they expect our public men to do&rdquo;.  I recall that at the beginning of this year when the British Foreign Secretary had a stroke and died within 24 hours the papers all printed an account of the way he had spent the last week of his life.  This was a man certainly not in his first youth, neither was he an old man.  I suppose he could be described as being in the late prime of life.  The description of the last <Col N="106" /> week of his life probably would not have been much different from the description of any other week, but it was something which no human being ought to be asked to bear.  Even some of the Irish papers said that perhaps we should look again at what was expected of public men and see whether we are not expecting too much from them when a thing like this can happen, when this brilliant man, a member of his own Cabinet, nearly the most senior man in his own Government, a possible contender for leadership of the Labour party who possibly would have been Prime Minister, was struck down by overwork.  The same thing was said here nine years ago when the late Deputy Donogh O'Malley dropped dead in the middle of a by-election campaign.  <i>The Irish Times</i> printed an editorial which said: &ldquo;We have seen this week that politics is literally a killing occupation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Against that background which I am not ashamed to evoke, I may be allowed something additional to what Deputy FitzGerald said about the burdens of ministerial office and not be accused of being lazy or unwilling to pull my weight or do my share in or out of Government.  The description which Deputy FitzGerald gave of a Minister's week I thought was fairly mild.  He left out of the description many of the minor things which can get in a man's way.  An ordinary man who is flesh and blood has a wife and family and perhaps problems with neighbours and financial worries and so on.  Deputy FitzGerald spoke about a ministerial meeting on Monday morning with the central advisers of his Department.  That is all very fine, but he has forgotten that on the odd Monday morning something happens which leaves one late for the office. Some problem, something about the children, something in one's constituency which cannot be neglected, cuts the tripe out of one's morning.  In his case as Minister for Foreign Affairs he had to escort an ambassador to Aras an Uachtaráin.  That could destroy his morning.  It is not always possible to arrange these things for some morning when he does not have a ministerial conference.  Please do not believe that the relatively civilised <Col N="107" /> description which the leader of my party gave of a Minister's Monday morning is a universal one.  It by no means is so, as I know from my limited experience.  Any number of things will come in and torpedo your morning.  Some of them are domestic. Others are of a political kind which cannot be avoided.  There is no use in saying that you are not paid to do that, you are paid to do the other and so you must do the other.  That is not the practical response to the problem.</P>
    <P>The average Minister or Parliamentary Secretary or whatever he is going to be called, and to a very large extent the average Deputy, lives an existence which is at times not the life of a dog. The fact that the public complain about their performance in their office I take for granted.  That is part of the game.  If you do not like it get out of it.  If you are not able to put up with that you ought not to be in politics at all.  They are treated not so much by the complaining members of the public but by the relatively indifferent or perhaps, friendly members of the public with a total lack of understanding in regard to what they are physically capable of.  No professional association feel that their annual occasion or even their twice or three times a year occasion is complete these days without the attendance at least of a Minister, if at all possible the Taoiseach, failing him the Tánaiste and failing him a Minister.  Some of them will turn quite sour if they are fobbed off with a Parliamentary-Secretary. Possibly this is one of the reasons for the improvement in the title of the seven junior colleagues of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time it was said a bit more forcibly, that we joined together in saying it and that we are not afraid to take the political consequences of it.  I get a delivery of the output of the Government Information Service.  It is very illuminating.  It means that I know more or less what a Minister would wish to say, whatever he may in the end have found himself saying or whatever the papers may <Col N="108" /> report him as having said.  I was away a few days at the end of the week before last and when I got home there was quite a pile of these handouts from the GIS waiting for me.  I looked at them and instead of finding sticks to beat Fianna Fáil with I tried to see what burden rests on the individual office holders.  I do not want it to be thought that this week was typical. The man who seemed to be doing the most work was the Minister for Agriculture who was at four scripted functions&mdash;that is altogether apart from funerals, party meetings&mdash;he would not have sent a script of those&mdash;opening this, that or the other or closing something which would not require a script&mdash;he was at four scripted functions, each of which, if it was any distance from him, would have taken up the full day and many of which would have taken up a sizeable number of hours even if they were quite near him.</P>
      <P>It is not the Minister for Agriculture I feel sorry for.  The person I want to mention to the House is the Taoiseach.  I discovered, on looking through his pile of scripts, that the Taoiseach was at a function in Dublin on Thursday evening with a long script, at one in Waterford on Friday evening with a very long script and he was at another in Cork on Saturday evening again with a long script.  I know he represents Cork city in this House and that he has to go to see his constituents but it is public knowledge that he lives in Dublin as a Taoiseach must do.  What was left of the Taoiseach's weekend by the time he had recovered from three nights on the trot?  Absolutely nothing.  I do not care how strong his constitution is, no human being ought to be asked to stand up to that.  That is the Taoiseach and it gets worse at it goes down.  My Taoiseach was exactly the same.  He said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to an invitation if he possibly could.  He did not say &ldquo;no&rdquo; unless he had to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A man who has fought his way up through politics and distinguished himself by some quality which others admire and are willing to concede leadership to, once he finds himself on that bench whether in the top seat <Col N="109" /> or anywhere else&mdash;the same goes to some degree for this side of the House &mdash;should be allowed do the job.  He should not be lifted into the saddle and then have lead weights not only put in the saddle but strung round his neck as well.</P>
    <P>I know how hard it is to say no, particularly when a professional association, a local body or all these multifarious organisations make a personal approach, come to the Minister and say: &ldquo;I wonder, George, will you come and do this for us?  We are very keen that you come.&rdquo;  It may be impossible to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; in that case but I feel some type of appeal should be made.  I feel it comes better from this side of the House now than when we were over there because we do not have to do so much of it.  There should be come moderation in professional bodies and public bodies inviting the attendance of office holders to those functions.</P>
    <P>It was partly in recognition of those things which are required of office holders that I struggled, when I was Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, to bring some reason into the way the Dáil did its work.  I never worked as hard in my life as I did during those four years.  Apart from my experience I saw night after night that we were in here&mdash;there were times during that session, particularly in the middle of 1975 when the Dáil used to sit regularly for months on end four days in the week and until 10.30 p.m. on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays&mdash;Ministers coming into me grey in the face.  One would wonder if they would make it to their cars without collapsing with absolute dog weariness brought on by the hours in this House, by having to uselessly sit around waiting for Division bells. Although a certain amount of work can be done by a superman like Deputy FitzGerald, many Ministers and many office holders do not find this House easy to work in.  The ventilation system is bad.  The heating system is bad.  The conditions are bad.  There is not enough privacy.  There is not enough room for staff and there is not enough room for papers or books.  It is not really possible unless one is a <Col N="110" /> superman or something near it to get much work done here.</P>
    <P>I saw those men in whom the country was making an act of faith, who had been promoted by the people's wishes to the supreme authority&mdash;so far as anyone can have supreme authority they had it&mdash;who were not being given a chance to exercise it.  I say &mdash;I am not ashamed to say it as I have already said it on many occasions in Government and I will now say it for the benefit of the Minister and his colleagues&mdash;that a man, particularly as he gets older, can only work so many hours in the day.  Most people work eight hours a day five days a week and come in by the clock and go out by it.  Let it be nine or ten hours a day for five or five and a half days a week.  This is the most anybody ought to be asked to work.  He ought to have his weekend for himself.  That has not been possible the way this State is run.</P>
    <P>I consider the degree to which office holders have committed themselves for political reasons or out of the goodness of their hearts to be ground down by this pressure is appalling.  They get out of the habit of saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;, of exercising self defence where they ought to and where it is their duty to do so.  They get out of the habit of saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to everything.  That is only part of the same softy complex which produces the soft election promises, the soft options.  It is the very same idea which persuades the public that they can get off all obligations, that a contract seriously entered into can be dispensed with, that burdens they laid on themselves at various times in their lives or which they inherited can be shed if they shout loud enough for the Government to remove them.</P>
    <P>I believe it is all part of the elephantiasis of the democratic process.  The democratic process is fine so long as it means the people choose their rulers. Once it gets to the stage that once the rulers are there they have to keep feeding the people their bones, bodies and blood as long as the people want, whether it is justified or not, the thing is suffering from elephantiasis and is on the downward path.  It simply is not <Col N="111" /> possible effectively to run a State and in the end not even democratically along those lines.  I did my best to try to rationalise the Dáil hours.  I met tooth and nail resistance from Fianna Fáil.  In the end the Government decided by dint of force, by vote, to introduce more rational sitting hours, ones that more resembled an ordinary working day.  I will not forget the debate we had here at that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Bill we are dealing with new titles and I have been speaking about the burden on office holders.  I feel it is more appropriate for me to do it now because I do not carry that burden.  I am doing it for the benefit of the people opposite.  Perhaps we will get the benefit of it again.  I want to say they did very little for our benefit when we were in office.  They did quite the contrary.  We were obstructed at every hand's turn.  Every move towards simplifying the business of this House so as to make is humanly more bearable and, in particular to lighten the load on office holders which his Bill is all about, was resisted as hough it was the Last Trump for denocracy. I remember the day we moved that motion to rationalise Dáil sitting hours.  Deputy Lalor spoke.  All the big guns spoke.  Deputy Haughey spoke.  Deputy O'Malley spoke.  Deputy Brennan spoke, the present Ceann Comhairle.  It was the end of democracy as we knew it that day, because we were to sit on Wednesday mornings instead of sitting late on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to say too much about that because I acknowledge this Government have gracefully continued those hours.  I do not want to say any more in case I might provoke them into changing their minds.  I have to record that the efforts I personally made to do something for office holders in the range open to me were resisted bitterly from the far side when were in Government.  I will heap coals on the Minister's head by <Col N="112" /> promising him my personal support&mdash; I do not know if it will carry my party, and I do not know how far it will go with the Labour Party, and I do not know how far it will go in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges&mdash;if his side want to go further in rationalising Dáil business with a view to reducing the useless footling waste of time sitting around here waiting for votes which may not be taken that evening.</P>
    <P>Now that the Minister is back in Government and will get the benefit of it, if he wants to propose that there should be a fixed time for the taking of votes on divisions on Second Stage of Bills, with all due allowance for a Bill which may be urgent, I personally will support in Opposition the same ideas as I supported in Government. There may be other ways in which the Parliamentary side of ministerial life can be made less burdensome and, if the Minister and his colleagues produce reasonable proposals, I certainly will support them and I will show him a solidarity which I did not get from his side when we were in office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the sincerity of the Deputy's offer but I am sure he will understand that a number of people might feel his approach was somewhat coloured by the fact that we have a majority of 20 and there is not a great deal of point in calling divisions in an effort to defeat us suddenly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have been trying to do for the past quarter of an hour or so is to put into perspective the whole question of the ministerial burden which is very much aggravated by the way business is done in this House.  We improved the matter to some extent.  All I am doing is offering my personal support to the Minister and his side in regard to getting my side to go along with further improvements if such occur to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="113" /> On the point the Minister has just made about divisions, obviously he was never a Whip.  It does not matter what his majority is.  It gives him a certain leeway, no doubt, in carrying absentees.  From my experience as Whip I can tell the Minister that, if you start letting people off unpaired, you will get a chorus from the rest of the Deputies: &ldquo;Why cannot they go too?&rdquo;  I would not encourage him to suggest that to his Whip.  He should keep his troops here, whatever he may feel about the large gap between the two sides.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the Opposition troops have to stay here as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for us. I used to try to see who was here from the Opposition and I usually had as good an idea as the Opposition Whip.  Essentially it is a matter for us. On Committee Stages which cannot be postponed for obvious reasons and on Report Stages the Minister will have to take his chance as we did, and we were never beaten in four-and-a-half years except when we beat ourselves. Although I am interspersing these constructive comments with ones which the Minister may think are not constructive, I seriously mean that, if he would like to cast around in the Dáil procedure to see to what extent the ministerial burden can be lightened by improving it, he will have me as an ally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not realise I was going to say this, but I completely share Deputy FitzGerald's reservations about the wisdom of making this blanket promotion of Parliamentary Secretaries. To a point, an additional three office holders&mdash;it will depend entirely on who they are&mdash;will not add all that amount of brain power to the Government's input of brain power or all that much energy to their work.  I suspect this is what is behind the measure; it will enable the functions to be spread a bit thinner.  There seems to be a rather piebald Harlequin set of cars these days and that is all to the good. That parade of Mercedes was a disagreeable vulgar sight.  It will enable the Government to put three more well-washed and polished cars on the <Col N="114" /> road.  This will certainly take a load off the remaining office holders so far as going to functions is concerned. That is certain and I do not begrudge the Minister that ease.  The real way to make this easier for himself is by saying: &ldquo;No more of them&rdquo;, and taking up an attitude of self-defence.</P>
    <P>I do not admire the Fianna Fáil Party.  I do not believe in their programme. I think it is a fraud and a sham but they should be given a chance to put it into effect.  They should not be battered into the ground by being given an average of five or six hours' sleep a night and only one weekend in every four which is common ministerial experience.  They should be given the chance of living as ordinary human beings with an ordinary amount of rest, an ordinary amount of relaxation, an ordinary amount of time to see their families and their friends, and to pursue their hobbies if they have any outside politics.  That sort of thing should be as much the entitlement of a Minister as of anybody else.</P>
    <P>Those functions are a severe burden, but I want to advert to another function which Minister sometimes accept voluntarily, but which is not necessary.  It has nothing to do with the kind of functions I have been talking about.  That is, what I would call ministerial skites or trips.  Perhaps I should not have used the word &ldquo;skite&rdquo;.  It has another meaning which I do not intend.  I should like that word blotted from the record.  I do not mean a skite in the sense of a binge.  I mean a ministerial trip.</P>
    <P>I do not hold this of one party more than another, but I think Ministers, possibly because their whole organisms scream for relief, for just a few days, relief, from the crushing burdens and sequence of work in their Departments, work in this House, constituency work, going to functions, reading scripts, always being on their best behaviour, take the opportunity frequently, and I mean frequently, of going on absolutely indefensible, idiotic, exotic trips around the world.  I do not say Fianna Fáil are any worse than we were in that regard, but they are shaping up, and may get worse quickly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" /> I will give the House an example of the kind of thing I mean.  This is an accidental example.  I want to emphasise that I produce this example for no other reason than that it came into my post from the GIS yesterday. It concerns the Minister for Defence. I want to ask the House to believe that in no sense do I intend this as an attack on Deputy Molloy.  If this debate had taken place next week I would have had another example.  If it had taken place the previous week I would have had the example of Deputy Barrett, Minister for the Environment, who was then in Japan, Japan if you please.</P>
    <P>On 26th, 27th and 28th October, 1977, according to the GIS, the Minister for Defence was, if you do not mind, at the colloquy on the conservation of the living resources of the seas held in Valetta, Malta, under the auspices of the Council of Europe. There were three sitting days.  The Minister for Defence has nothing whatsoever to do with the conservation of the resources of the sea except for patrolling it.  He and his Department know as much officially about the conservation of the resources of the sea as the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Please believe I do not mean this as an attack on the Minister for Defence.  It is a pure accident that this came out this weekend.  These things are out every weekend.  This is the most recent one.  There is absolutely no excuse or defence in the wide world whatsoever for that attendance.  The Minister more nearly apposite would have been the Minister for Fisheries for whom he was standing in.  Even his attendance would have been indefensible. At that kind of colloquy held by the Council of Europe, although they invite ministerial participation, I know from experience they do not really expect it.  No one would have known or cared if Ireland had been represented there by some political personage other than a Minister or perhaps by no political personage at all but merely by an official.  Although I have not done any research on this, I defy the Minister <Col N="116" /> for Defence Deputy Molloy, the Minister for Finance or anybody else to tell me which other Minister for Defence from all the other Council of Europe nations spend three days in the middle of the week plus a day at either end for travelling there and back, in Malta, at a conference on the conservation of the resources of the sea.</P>

      <P>This Bill is being sold to the House on the basis that it is to relieve a ministerial burden which is becoming unbearable.  The ministerial burden is unbearable, but to some extent Minister are themselves to blame because they are too weak to say no to invitations at home and abroad.  I would say that absence was indefensible.  Colleagues in the National Coalition Government occasionally used to do the same thing, but it is indefensible.  If Deputy Molloy needs a rest, he is entitled to a rest, but he should have that rest by way of not going out every night of the week to functions in his constituency, reading scripts&mdash;I do not know what exactly his conditions of life are like; I am only guessing this&mdash;and getting three, four or five hours' sleep a night, when a man in his job needs eight or nine hours' sleep a night and needs relaxation above that.  Ireland must be unique in respect of this kind of attendance.  Did the Minister for Defence of Italy show up in Malta at this conference?</P>

      <P>Here is a man in what is now, by common consent, an important Ministry, Defence, and he is absent, so far as this hand-out goes, for three days of a conference.  As I say, if the Minister wants rest he should have that rest by working reasonable hours and leading a reasonable life, and he should be left to lead it.  This is not an attack on Deputy Molloy.  I am trying to make a case for him.  It is absurd that the only <Col N="117" /> way he can get away from the strain of political life is by hiking off to Malta in the middle of winter.

      <P>I do not want to quarrel with you, Sir, but it is more relevant here.  I will finish this point quickly. On Wednesday of that week there was the other script so unremarkable that the Irish people did not notice it, this defence of the Irish workers.  What do you think <i>Osservatore Romano</i> or <i>Correire dele sera</i> would have done with it?  On that day there were 13 questions down to him for answer in this House.  They were dealt with by Deputy Lalor, who is Parliamentary Secretary to him as well as to the Taoiseach, in his usual efficient and courteous way, but the point is that the Deputies who put those questions down could not get an answer from the Minister because he was in Malta and he was in Malta for no good reason.</P>
      <P>I do not single Fianna Fáil out in this respect.  I was scalded as Whip by what I judged to be unnecessary absences of my Minister and Parliamentary Secretaries, not often but occasionally.  We had a very narrow majority, but Fianna Fáil can carry the Minister for Defence, as the Minister for Finance just boasted a few minutes ago, a kind of boast which very often goes before a fall.</P>

      <P>That is the burden of what I wanted to say.  I have given examples of the inhumanity of what Ministers are expected to do and, irrespective of party allegiance, I do not want to see Fianna Fáil Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries killing themselves any more than I would like to have had fatalities among my own party or Coalition members.  The important point is that the people owe it to themselves that when they put Ministers into office through this gruelling democratic policy&mdash;and it is gruelling &mdash;to see to it that they are let do their job and that they are not left in the situation that they can barely stagger in on Monday morning because they have not succeeded in shaking off the fatigue of the previous week.  I am as fond of trips abroad as the next man, and I have had a fair few of them, but to the extent that that kind of absence complicates his work and complicates the work in here because he is not present to answer questions, it is to be deplored. He was not present either, presumably, for the meeting of the Government last Friday morning.  For all I know there may have been Government business bearing on the Department of Defence that had to be postponed because he was in Malta talking about the conservation of fisheries and mesh net sizes which do not concern him at all.</P>
      <P>By the way, it is not the case that there is a general Minister of State pattern in Europe or outside this country.  The expression &ldquo;Parliamentary Secretary&rdquo; in its Germanic translation is well known and well understood in Germany.  The Parliamentary Secretary there has a function not identical with but comparable with that of Parliamentary Secretary here.  There are Parliamentary Secretaries in Britain, too.</P>

It happens in other contexts which are nearly too shaming to talk about.  Would you believe that the very insignia of the Irish Army have been changed over the last number of years in deference to confusions <Col N="119" /> that might arise in Cyprus or in the Lebanon.  Irish sergeants when I was a child, used to wear two stripes because of a legend that Sergeant Custume of Athlone had two stripes on his sleeve, but because the English or the Canadian Mounted Police or some outfit of that kind have three chevrons, we must have it too? Would you believe that the national volunteers from which the Minister's party and my party both sprang thought it good enough to indicate an officer's rank by sewing stripes on his shoulder, probably for the homely and aboslutely respectable reason that it was a uniform that could be adapted in the home by his wife&mdash;a reason that you would not find a Chinaman apologising for in the days when we are all kowtowing to them and talking, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Kennedy, is about establishing diplomatic relations with them.  No modern people that has hauled itself up by its boot straps would apologise for that, but because Irish captains, with their three stripes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I suggest also, as my Leader did, that the blanket promotion of seven Parliamentary Secretaries and the abolition of that respectable and long-standing and never-complained-about title is a bad idea and running away from our own tasks and our own roots.  I suggest these are respects in which this Bill, which otherwise, to the extent that it relieves ministerial burdens, I take pleasure in supporting, might be amended.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  In the first week or so of the former Government the Taoiseach, Deputy Cosgrave, indicated that it was the intention of the Government to consider the whole concept of Ministers of State and many Deputies on the Government side were in support of that proposal.  The proposal was supported by the Tánaiste, Deputy Corish. However, there was a change of mind. A cost factor was involved and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan, in true Deputy Sweetman tradition, took a very stringent view about expenditure of that nature.  There was, too, another reaction in the early days of the National Coalition that additional ministerial appointments would smack of jobs for the boys and there were people who were reluctant to take appointments as Ministers of State.  Inevitably, it was decided not to proceed with the idea.  There was a lack of foresight here because at the end of the six months period of Ireland's responsibility for the chairmanship of various Community portfolios I thought at least half a dozen members of the Cabinet were about to suffer imminent heart attacks or drop dead with fatigue.  Men who two or three years previously were in the pink of health were in physical tatters. Such were the pressures imposed on them in that six month period in which they made a magnificent contribution on behalf of this State as chairmen of their respective portfolios. That was one period during which we should have had Ministers of State to work for the nation at international level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years Parliamentary Secretaries have been nothing more than <Col N="121" /> glorified messengers for their Ministers, reasonably paid, equipped with sophisticated and expensive transport in which to carry their messages.  Parliamentary Secretaries have a very minor role.  I can recall only one, Deputy Frank Cluskey, who made a political input into his Department. What does a Parliamentary Secretary do in the Department of Agriculture? My colleague, Deputy Michael Pat Murphy, had responsibility for Fisheries. Now Deputy Lenihan has responsibility as Minister for Fisheries. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture attends ploughing matches and functions from which the Minister is unavoidably absent. What does the Parliamentary Secretary in the Department of Education do?  He has responsibility for school transport.  He allocates moneys to sporting organisations.  He represents the Minister at the occasional opening of an extension to a national school.  It is very costly keeping a Parliamentary Secretary on the road these days.  His car and driver cost the best part of £20,000 a year.  He gets another £2,000 or £3,000 as Parliamentary Secretary.  He has a private secretary and a secretariat.  That costs another £10,000 or so a year.</P>
    <P>What does the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance do? He looks after the Office of Public Works.  His work largely consists of preventing Deputies beating down the door in an effort to get someone a job, a job to which he may not necessarily be entitled.  He makes sure that these premises are kept in reasonably good order.  He makes sure that places like the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park and the John F. Kennedy Park and various public buildings are kept in good order.  He makes sure that the commissioners are happy.  Otherwise, he has not very much work to do.</P>
    <P>Let us be frank and honest about this.  What does the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach do?  He makes contact with the Opposition Whips every Thursday or Friday and has consultations with them on the order of business.  His main function is to ensure that business proceeds <Col N="122" /> smoothly.  What does the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs do?  He pays an occasional visit to the Council of Europe or helps to form part of the ceremonial escort to President Hillery when diplomats are presenting credentials. He goes to the odd dinner in various embassies or presides over the odd dinner in Iveagh House.  Apart from that, he does not do very much more.</P>
    <P>What does the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government do?  His sole function related exclusively, as far as I could divine, to planning appeals.  These are now the function of An Bord Pleanála. The Parliamentary Secretary is now redundant.  Parliamentary Secretaries to the Department of Health and Social Welfare did little except attend occasional prize giving ceremonies in hospitals, shaking hands with some lovely nurses and wishing them well on behalf of the Minister, who was unavoidably absent.  As I say, the only Parliamentary Secretary who made an impact and an input was Deputy Cluskey.</P>
    <P>What does the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce do?  Our colleague, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, has responsibility for something called &ldquo;Consumer Affairs&rdquo;.  There are two Bills in regard to consumer affairs which have not yet been enacted.  She acts as a carrier pigeon bringing the reports of the National Prices Commission to the Government and back to the Department with Government sanction for the price increases and attending the occasional function, talking about the need for good quality products and the need to ensure that children's pyjamas are not made of inflammable material.  Otherwise, what does the Parliamentary Secretary do?  Therefore, we come to what I think is a rather odd concept announced by the Taoiseach that he proposes that the present Parliamentary Secretaries will go through this metamorphosis into Ministers of State with not much change in function.  That is a singular defect in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste made an interesting <Col N="123" /> if not very controversial or illuminating speech in some respects but with nothing very much in it since it lacked a number of essential ingredients to make it essentially a good speech.  He did not say what the function of a Minister of State at the Department will be.  If the Tánaiste were to say: &ldquo;There will be a Minister of State with responsibility for law reform in the Department of Justice&rdquo;, I would give three cheers and say that we were getting somewhere with reorganisation of the structures of Government.  If he were to say that there would be a Minister of State with omnibus responsibility for the four or five different aspects of child care I would agree. This was something we fought vigorously for in the previous Government and which we eventually got allied to responsibilities of the Tánaiste and Minister for Health.  Reluctantly, the Cabinet rather shuffled off this responsibility and it rested there in a sort of no man's land for a couple of years. It has not yet emerged with clear ministerial responsibility.  If we had a Minister of State for child care, I would say we were talking business in terms of specific functions which a Minister could perform.  We have a minor indication&mdash;one is not sure whether it will be a Senator or a Deputy who is &ldquo;dead safe&rdquo; in terms of the views of the Taoiseach&mdash;that there may be a Minister of State for Northern Ireland or Northern Irish Affairs or for what the GAA president would call &ldquo;all six occupied counties of Ireland&rdquo;.  It seems that responsibility will be allocated to some individual but it is interesting that there is no reference in the Tánaiste's speech to that proposal which has been mooted in the media.</P>
    <P>One would have hoped to see some allocation of responsibility in the area of local government.  Within two or three months the State will assume responsibility for the administration of some 66 per cent of local government finances.  We see the massive workload which falls on the Minister for Health and Social Welfare when he has to sort out health board estimates every year, estimates running into many millions, spending weary hours arguing, as he must, with the Minister for Finance <Col N="124" /> and the health boards as to their precise allocations.  If we have similar massive State supervision over the finances of local government as is implied in the abolition of rates, I hope we shall not have a situation where the Minister for Finance would be running around like a duck in thunder every January trying to find out how much he should give in block grants to every local authority.  I would hope that a Minister of State with a responsibility for local government finance would be appointed.  Because of his extravagant promise in the general election, a promise he gave to everybody irrespective of his rateable valuation, the Minister is now wondering where to get £106 million next January.  That is an area where we could have some delegation of responsibility.</P>
    <P>Last week in another area of responsibility I accused the Minister for Finance of rowing back.  I have a slight hearing defect and was not quite sure at the time what the Minister had said.  I pricked up my ears at his comment that the Fianna Fáil Party would, of Course, be tackling inflation. They are still at the question of the 7 per cent and the 5 per cent wage increase.  It has not yet dawned on them that it is not on.  The Tánaiste went on to say that even Fianna Fáil could not tackle all three together but that all three had to be tackled and that our priority had to be unemployment and inflation but that the manifesto proposals also involved tackling the state of public finances.  He went on to say that the beginning in that regard would be made a year after the beginning of our attack on unemployment and inflation.  I accused him of rowing back from a particular commitment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If one is to appoint a Minister of State one might ask him to start now, since these appointments will be made in January, with this examination of the state of our public <Col N="125" /> finances because while the Tánaiste and the Government may well get away with a few hundred million pounds of additional massive borrowing for the budget of January next, certainly the 1979 budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the overall point that the central issue here is the responsibilities devolved on these Ministers.  I have mentioned child care, local government, Northern Ireland and our public finances and these responsibilities should be the issues with which we are concerned.</P>
      <P>I do not begrudge the cost involved in setting up the Ministers of State. It will probably cost the best part of £150,000 of additional State money to get them going but I want to make a parallel point.  If we are spending money of that kind and we have in a Parliamentary democracy a Government which is reforming itself on the Governmental side there is need to make some provision on the Opposition side also so that they can perform their duties.  I can speak with a reasonably clear conscience as I think the Minister will agree, because it was he who in the first month or so of the previous regime kicked up holy hell when the Government proposed to allocate about £15,000 I think, to the then Fianna Fáil Opposition.  I remember saying to the then Minister for Finance: &ldquo;Let us stop the nonsense; let us fund the Opposition with a reasonable amount of money&rdquo; and I actually suggested £25,000.  The Government then agreed.  It was about the only time that I felt I had any influence on expenditure.  These were the early days and after a while they became accustomed to this kind of thing from the back benches and we were all told to hump off.  In any event, we succeeded in getting £25,000 for Fianna Fáil.  Nobody was more surprised at the time than Deputy Colley and Deputy Lynch.  We actually had an amendment to the Bill passed that evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We are spending about another £150,000 in the setting up of three new Ministers of State as well as elevating the whole Parliamentary Secretaries' salary scale.  We are putting three new cars on the road at about £60,000 per year and simultaneously we have an Opposition which in the performance of its functions is impoverished. It is entirely incongruous to have a situation where a Government in a country which prides itself in having a parliamentary democracy, has an annual allocation to the party in Government of the best part of £1 million a year, and an Opposition with about £50,000 to spend between the two parties.  There is no hesitation on the part of the Government to create ten Ministers of State but if I were to ask Deputy Colley for an electric typewriter in my office in Dáil Éireann. I would be told that the Houses of the Oireachtas do not supply electric typewriters. These are the type of contracts one can get in the operation of democracy. If we in Opposition are to ensure that the Government of the day is kept on its toes in more ways than one, then we will have to have reciprocation in terms of expenditure.  It is ridiculous that the total State assistance to the Fine Gael Party is about five or six clerk typists, a couple of typewriters and £37,000 and to the Labour Party, two clerk typists and approximately £13,000 while there is no hesitation in spending the best part of £150,000 at the drop of a hat in having Ministers of State.  It cuts both ways.  Facilities for Deputies in the House are atrocious in the context of the new appointments and the way we are to respond to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the decision of the Government to proceed with the appointments. I view with some scepticism the penultimate paragraph of the Minister's <Col N="127" /> speech where he said that this was part of a great reform on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is not a major reform but a step in a programme of reform which will prove to be very useful but we will have to go much further if we are to reform the structure of Government.</P>
    <P>A number of Parliamentary Secretaries in the previous Government were acutely aware of the danger of inability to co-ordinate between the Ministers of State and the 15 members of the Cabinet.  Ministers of State should have specific responsibilities.  There is the danger that some individuals will go off into the night and proceed to do their own thing without consultation. This very real problem of ensuring that there is no confusion between the two sets of Ministers must be tackled at Cabinet level.  For example, will the regular Cabinet papers be given to Ministers of State? To my knowledge, Parliamentary Secretaries had no access to Government papers unless a Minister in his Department showed them to a particular Parliamentary Secretary before locking them in a safe.  Will we simply have 15 Ministers of State chasing around the country addressing every dog's dinner with Fianna Fáil speeches about the wonderful manifesto without doing any real work?</P>
    <P>I am quite convinced that with limited experience as a Member of this House I could go into any Government Department, look down through the Book of Estimates over the years and pick out major segments of responsibility in each Department that could be allocated to the Ministers of State for the next four years. Unfortunately, most Ministers when initially appointed are quite convinced that they alone can handle the multiplicity of responsibilities in their Departments.  Ministers on appointment tend to have a change of personality.  It is noticeable in all countries that when power and the trappings of the public service surround a Minister, people are not prepared to tell the truth or to criticise, and the party machines tend to become obsequious towards their Ministers in <Col N="128" /> the hope that if they do not criticise unduly they might get something from the Minister some day.  That attitude tends to isolate a Minister and make him impervious to criticism until in the end after a general election he discovers that the public and the party had an entirely different view of his role in Government.  I strongly urge the Fianna Fáil Cabinet and the Taoiseach to allocate ruthlessly segments of Departments to Ministers of State in order that they can make a real contribution in Government.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his efforts to reform.  I shall have further comments on the Committee Stage of this and other related Bills.  Deputy Colley should not regard the planning process within Government Departments with such a degree of isolationist purity.  It should be put into perspective.  The Deputy has become excessively preoccupied with what I would call the wisdom of Devlin.  We now have 25 individuals to formulate policy.  Presumably they are there to preside over meetings of their Department and implement that policy in consultation with the executive staffs they employ. Perhaps Devlin did not foresee that kind of development but that is another day's debate.</P>
    <P>I welcome this reform in so far as it has come about.  I express the regret that the previous Government did not do so when they had the opportunity. We will get value for money, as taxpayers, in the setting up of this new structure of State.  I hope their role in Government will be co-ordinated properly by the Taoiseach and that they will consult fully with one another, ensuring that there is no confusion.</P>
    <P>I hope, as did my colleague Deputy M. O'Leary, that these Ministers will come into the House, that we can say to them: &ldquo;You are responsible&rdquo; and that the fact that the Ministers of the Government may not be present will not mean they will be hiding behind anybody's political skirts, that they will have personal responsibility and that it will be seen to be in operation. I welcome this reform and in no way begrudge the Fianna Fáil Party for having initiated it.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Garret FitzGerald said, we welcome this Bill.  Perhaps the Government are fortunate in that five years ago when Fianna Fáil were last in office probably they would have had very much more virulent opposition to this Bill than they have now after our four years' experience of the weight of office.  Probably they have been concerned too shortly with the affairs of Europe and the vast growth in the amount of international commitments that present-day Government Ministers have to undertake to realise that had they waited a little longer and looked somewhat harder they might have introduced a different Bill.</P>
      <P>However, as Deputy Barry Desmond said, it is a step in the right direction.  Perhaps I might take up a point he made five minutes before he concluded&mdash;the necessity for more support for the Opposition parties. For example, when I received this Bill and was researching it this morning I was seeking an answer, which I have not yet received, to a particular point. I had to go to the Library myself and research this matter because our funds and those we get from the Government do not allow us to employ a sufficient number of research officers, or indeed any research officers, to do so for us.</P>
      <P>Section 6 of the Bill reads:</P>
      <P>Section 7 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, and sections 8 and 9 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1939, are hereby repealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I found that sections 8 and 9 of the 1939 Act say that a Parliamentary Secretary who is a Member of the Dáil can go into the Seanad&mdash;the words used are: &ldquo;Will have the right to attend and to be heard....&rdquo;  The position obtains <i>vice versa</i>&mdash;a Parliamentary Secretary who is a Member of the Seanad will have the right to attend and be heard in the Dáil.  There is no doubt that these two sections of the 1939 Act are being repealed, but I could not find where.  I should like reassurance from the Minister that there is some section of some other Act that gives them that right to <Col N="130" /> attend and to be heard here if they are Members of the Seanad and <i>vice versa.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is probably the position but I just could not lay my hands on it.  It must be governed by some other Act.  The reason the Leader of our party led off in this debate was that we presumed, in a Bill as important at this&mdash;where the restructuring of actual government was being brought forward by the Government&mdash;the Taoiseach, as head of that Government, would come into the House, introduce this Bill and justify his decisions for creating these three extra posts and indeed for the changing in name which Deputy Kelly found not to his satisfaction.  The Taoiseach should have come in, introduced this Bill and justified to the House and to the country the reasons he considers it necessary to expand. We on this side of the House do not disagree that it is necessary to expand government here at this time.  Deputies FitzGerald, Kelly, Barry Desmond and M. O'Leary said, in their contributions, that Deputy Liam Cosgrave. on the day he was appointed Taoiseach referred to the necessity he saw at that stage to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that technically the Bill is under the control of the Minister for the Public Service.  But that would not dispense the Government from the courtesy to the House and the country of the Taoiseach introducing the Bill in the House and explaining to us exactly why it is necessary at this point to extend the office holders to ten and indeed to change the titles of seven of those office holders.  Indeed as Deputy FitzGerald, Deputy Kelly and Deputy M. O'Leary said, the memory is all too fresh in our minds on this side of the House of the physical and mental burden placed on people given the very high honour of serving in an Irish Cabinet.  That memory is too fresh for us not to put aside any political temptation there might be to stop what some Members who have not had that experience would interpret as jobs for the boys.  There was no hesitation in <Col N="131" /> our putting aside any outside pressures brought to bear on us to oppose this Bill.  The burdens of office attendant on a Government Minister are all too fresh in our memories.  As Deputy Kelly said, Deputy FitzGerald, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, very modestly described one week in his life.  Also as Deputy Kelly said, Deputy Garret FitzGerald has a capacity for work totally unknown to anybody of his or indeed my acquaintance.  I have never known a man who could get through so much work.  Not alone did he do a lot of work in short periods but he extended the periods and the expectation on other people's parts that we should all follow him down that road.  Were all former Ministers to try to imitate the pace set by Deputy FitzGerald in his term of office it would have killed 14 members of that Cabinet and he would have been left in office alone.  It is just not possible physically for an ordinary flesh and blood human being to work at the pace he found necessary.  Indeed, anybody without his strength and stamina could not have done so.</P>
    <P>This pressure probably is something that had been building up in government over the ten or 15 years prior to our assuming office.  But, because of our commitment to Europe, it escalated out of all proportion in the past four years.  The Taoiseach, Tánaiste and their colleagues in Government will find that, of necessity, the workload imposed on them will curtail the amount of attention they will be able to devote to their Departments.  Therefore, it is essential and welcome that there should be some method of lightening their workload.  The amount of legislation being put through parliament, say, since the last war has increased enormously Ministers' workloads. Certainly in the last four years they trebled compared with the volume experienced before that.  I recall seeing a letter written by a constituent to a Member of this House in which he complained about the laws, about the driving laws and the liquor laws.  Of course, on reading the letter further it was obvious that part of the problem was that his on-the-spot investigation <Col N="132" /> of the liquor laws was what had caused him a lot of trouble.  He went on to say that the wolf at the door had come in and had littered on his kitchen floor and he said he would sell the pups to stay in business.  That is an exaggeration but it gives the feeling of an ordinary person faced with many complex laws in order to keep a small business in operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has many heavy obligations.  He has to attend at Luxembourg or Brussels and he also has to attend meetings of the IMF and the World Bank.  All of this necessitates much travelling.  Anyone who has crossed the Atlantic knows about American &ldquo;hospitality&rdquo;&mdash;I put that word in inverted commas&mdash;and is also well aware of jetlag.  They know it is impossible to do a day's work for some time afterwards.  On one occasion when I was Minister I was asked by Bord Fáilte to travel to America in order to promote tourism which was then at a low level. I left Ireland on a Saturday morning and returned the following Tuesday week.  In the meantime I made 23 speeches, appeared on eight television shows, participated in 15 broadcasts, attended lunches and dinners on every day and shook hands with 3,000 people.  I arrived in Dublin on the Tuesday morning, went straight to a Cabinet meeting, attended in this House and received some deputations. Having had only a cup of coffee and a sandwich for lunch, I went to a hotel at 10 p.m. to have a meal.  I was just inside the door of the hotel when I met someone who said to me: &ldquo;Are you just back from America? You certainly have a great life.&rdquo;  If that person had only known.  I lost a stone and a half in the week I was away from home.  At that time I could hardly tell what part of America I had visited.  It had got to the stage that one stood up in Toronto and said how nice it was to be in San Francisco. I suppose it is natural one got totally confused.</P>
    <P>Ministers wear themselves out on this kind of essential trip on behalf of the country.  We must recognise Ministers have to be out of the country reasonably frequently but while taking this into account their first duty <Col N="133" /> is to this House, to answer questions and to take part in the business of the House.  The Minister for Finance, next to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has a very heavy duty in Europe. However, coming close behind&mdash;perhaps even ahead of the Minister for Finance&mdash;is the Minister for Agriculture. I saw this in the case of Deputy Clinton who was Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in the previous Government. For some reason Ministers of Agriculture in the European Community seem unable to come to conclusions before 4 a.m. or 5 a.m.  They talk during the evening and break and they resume their talks at 12 midnight. A little sustenance is served to keep them going and they come to conclusions that to my rather simple point of view were obvious the previous night.  Deputy Clinton would then get on a plane and on arrival here would have to face a battery of television cameras and reporters at Dublin Airport.  He would then come here and start a normal day's work, including attendance at this House where he introduced Bills and replied to questions. He might then have to go to a dinner that night, an invitation he had probably accepted six or eight weeks beforehand naturally not realising he would be held up in Brussels until 5 a.m. that morning.</P>
    <P>A point that members of the Government may not be fully aware of&mdash;it was touched on by Deputy O'Leary&mdash; is that it is not purely attendance at council meetings that determines the course of events in Europe.  In July the Regional Fund was being discussed in Brussels or Luxembourg and the Minister for Finance asked his Parliamentary Secretary to attend.  In spite of what the Minister said in his speech, after four years in Europe the term &ldquo;Parliamentary Secretary&rdquo; is well known there.  It is known to Ministers from other countries and to the officials that it means the junior Minister attached to whatever Department is involved. However, to send the Parliamentary Secretary to attend a meeting of the council, where Ministers for Finance were talking about the Regional Fund, a matter of vital importance to us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am concerned with the implications of the transfer of responsibility for the board from the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy to the Department of Economic Planning and Development. If the board are to make a decisive impact on the application of science and technology to future industrial natural resources and energy projects it would be best that they should continue to function under the aegis of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.  It is hoped that major boards such as the IDA, IIRS, ESB and CTT would have a good relationship with the national board.  These boards will continue to function under the office of the Minister. Having read through the debate of the special committee, I saw no reference by the Minister that they should be hived off from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It is fair to say that last March I recall Deputy O'Malley indicating to the special committee that the board should have an &ldquo;industrial bias&rdquo;.  At that time he spoke of the need for the practical application of scientific and technological knowledge to industry itself.  There is a body of responsible political opinion which does not see any great justification for hiving-off this board to the Department of Economic Planning and Development. I know the Government are hard put to find specific areas of responsibility for Minister O'Donoghue but he himself has indicated on many occasions that he is only concerned with long-term economic strategy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is being transferred from one Minister to another and we must consider the functions of both Ministers.  If the IDA had an outline project of major scientific import and were unsure of their ground, the normal practice for them would be to refer the matter to the Minister.  The Minister would then authorise the IDA to act or he might refer the matter to the IIRS.  The Minister has responsibility for the IDA and he would be obliged to send it to another Department which in turn would send it to the Board for Science and Technology for their views.  If the board are to have a cutting edge and are to be the pivot of the application of science and technology to industry, then they should operate under the Minister's Department.</P>
      <P>It is a political fact of life that the Government have decided to transfer responsibility for the board to the Department of Economic Planning and Development.  Therefore, I have put forward an amendment which it would not be impossible for the Minister to accept, particularly in relation to specific projects which he may have in mind or which may come under his Department.  In relation to these projects there should be a provision whereby the Minister can contact the board and act directly with them.  It is not an impossible position for the Minister to accept and it would keep the board at the coalface of the application of science and technology to industry.  For these reasons I put forward my amendment and the Minister should not have great difficulty in accepting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to support Deputy Desmond in his urging of an amendment on these lines.  On the last occasion, when the Bill was being discussed on Committee Stage, I expressed a doubt as to whether there was any necessity to transfer the political function of supervising this board to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  I can see the kind of long-term sense in <Col N="138" /> associating that Minister with it but I agree totally with Deputy Desmond that if the board superintend research or are associated with results that are of immediate relevance&mdash;a cold-faced relevance as Deputy Desmond recalls the former Minister describing it&mdash;it seems an absurdity that the Minister's Department should not be the first to know about such results.  I do not wish to make an issue of this.  Essentially, we are talking of the same human beings.  The Minister admitted last week that there would be some transfer of personnel from his Department to the Department of Economic Planning and Development in connection with the functions of this board.  Perhaps, therefore, it is only a question of that personnel receiving information which they will then pass back but at the very least it can be said for Deputy Desmond's amendment that it cuts the third corner off the triangle.  I have no wish to make an unnecessary political point but it is possible that what is being done here is by way of an effort to find something for Deputy O'Donoghue to do pending the economic millenium.  It may be that he should be given something to do. Perhaps it is not a bad move to give him this board.  I asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy whether this meant that his Department would be shedding all responsibility for science and technology and he told me that that would not be the case.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond's amendment to the extent that it merely requires the board to report to the Minister's Department as to what is going on in relation to matters of immediate relevance to the Minister, is a modest suggestion and I am inclined to support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the reasons underlying Deputy Desmond's amendment but I am satisfied that the Bill as it stands provides adequately for close collaboration between the new board and the other Departments, including my Department and between the new board and bodies concerned with particular aspects of science and technology.  For example, paragraph <Col N="139" /> (b) of subsection (1) of section 4 provides that the board shall:</P>
      <P>advise the Government or the Minister on the Board's initiative or at the request of the Minister on policy for science and technology and related matters.</P>
      <P>According to the advice that I have received from the parliamentary draftsman the Government in this context may be read as comprehending any Minister.  Therefore, any Minister has access in that sense.</P>
      <P>Section 5 which deals with the science budget provides in subsection (2) for the submission of a statement on the national programme for science and technology with the board's observations and recommendations to the Minister for Finance and the Government. Statements prepared by the board under this provision will cover all areas of science and technology, primary responsibility for which rests with the various individual Departments, institutes or other bodies.  In performing their functions under the Bill the board, as a matter of course, will be interacting with all Departments and other institutions in the public sector.  There will be a network of committees supporting the board on which the various Departments and other institutions will be represented. This will include my Department in relation to any matters of concern to it, for example, matters relating to industrial development, natural resources and energy.</P>
      <P>The basic concept of this legislation is co-ordination through a single channel. One of the principal arguments for setting up the National Board for Science and Technology was the existing fragmentation of the national effort in science and technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inclusion of a provision of this kind proposed by Deputy Desmond would upset the balance that has been achieved after lengthy and protracted discussion with all the Departments and institutions in respect of whose activities the new board will have a co-ordinating function although it is I, as Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, who is being singled out <Col N="140" /> for a special direct relationship with the board in the Deputy's proposed amendment.  I am satisfied that there is no need for such a provision and that my interest and the interest of my Department are safeguarded sufficiently in the Bill as drafted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the Minister and while I appreciate his point of view I consider his apologia in defence of the situation to be rather weak and something about which he would not appear to be convinced.</P>
      <P>Regarding his remark about his being singled out individually as Minister, he is aware that, for example, there is a section in the Bill that has another relationship.  I refer to paragraph (g) of subsection (3) of section 4 which provides for consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs in relation to international activities in the sphere of science and technology.  In relation to industrial promotion and to industrial development of a scientific and technological nature generally, how much more appropriate it would be for them to engage in direct consultation with the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  I note with rather wry amusement the suggestion of the Minister that such a provision would upset the long process of consultation that has taken place in relation to the giving of the functional nature of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister knows well it was never envisaged that the board would operate other than under the general auspices of the Department dealing with industry and commerce.  Even when the Taoiseach announced the setting up of the Department of Economic Planning and Development there was not any suggestion that responsibility for this board would be given to the new Department.  The ESRI were transferred to the new Department to give it, I suppose, some bit of body.  Somebody in the Cabinet put forward the idea that the new board also should be placed under the aegis of some other Ministry.  The decision is retrograde.  During the debate in March last, the Minister made some excellent contributions.  I <Col N="141" /> refer him to some of the things he then said, for instance, that the board, despite whatever feelings certain bodies may have, should have an industrial bias, that one of the reasons he welcomed the move was that science and technology had lagged behind.  He went on to say that even with limited powers the board would do something in that direction and that he would not apologise to anybody for seeking to have an industrial bias in that respect. Deputy O'Malley said also at that time that he was thinking of the technical advice and assistance that could be obtained from knowledge that the board might be able to obtain through the co-ordination of investment in science and technology, and that could be made available to smaller industries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <P>The Minister for Economic Planning and Development has responsibility for a national plan, for a 5 per cent wage increase, for a 7 per cent inflation rate and for about 500,000 long-term strategy manifesto problems of the party.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy is accepting responsibility for those areas in which the board might make contribution to new industries.  He is responsible also for the IDA, for the IIRS, for the nuclear energy board, for the ESB and for a whole cosmos of contributions to industry and to industrial development.  Yet, he has shuffled off this other responsibility. But I do not blame him for this because he is much too far-seeing, too sensible and realistic to be held responsible for that.  Some guru of the manifesto decided that the board should come within the ambit of the Department of Economic Planning and Development.  I do not see the logic of that decision.  I predict that the board will drift into a backwater. It will be very hard to rescue it from that kind of involvement.  I do not see it being logical.  I ask the Minister again to consider the matter.  I will <Col N="142" /> quote the previous Minister in this regard.  He says in the Official Report of 4th November, 1976, volume 293 column 1180:</P>
      <P>Those right at the coalface, if I may use that expression, of scientific discovery or new technological application should be in those institutions, be they third level, be they the pure institutions, be they laboratories in individual departments or be they, as I would wish them to be, in the industrial workshops where knowledge can be used to make a better product, to improve a product, or make a cheaper product, so that the application, participation and practice of the development of science and technology permeates the whole of our economy, industrial, agricultural, public and private.</P>
      <P>That kind of concept does not set up as an advisory board the National Board of Science and Technology merely to advise the Government and the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, so that he can have a few choice paragraphs in the national plan next January in relation to science and technology.  Rather I see the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy having regular consultations with this board and saying: &ldquo;Here is a scientific project.  Assess its merits.  Let us not spend £70,000 or £80,000 in employing consultants in London to assess it.  You are getting the money to do it under my Department.  It will be the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy who will be at the back of the project now, and the IDA can come in on it directly&rdquo;.  As the Minister well knows, matters of this magnitude are often matters of the utmost confidentiality. Shuffling them over by messenger from the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy to the Department of Economic Planning and Development means another Minister has his fingers on it then.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy in many ways is a man of great energy and capacity.</P>

      <P>In page 4, after line 10, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5)  The Board shall not engage in or promote any activity of a primarily military relevance without the prior approval of the Government.</P>
      <P>This amendment speaks for itself.  I raised with the Minister on Thursday last the question of areas of scientific research which were not of purely industrial relevance but which, under the Bill as it stands, the board seems to have capacity to enter into.  I gave two instances.  One was the question of military research.  From reading the debate as it appears in the published report it seems that the Minister does not understand the point I was making.  Perhaps in the heat of the moment he was confusing it with a point which Deputy Desmond was making.  I said nothing about nuclear research in the question of the capacity of, for example, the Timoney armoured personnel carrier to withstand nuclear attack.  That was not in my mind.  I mentioned the Timoney carrier only because the Minister when he was on this side of the House mentioned it in a debate earlier in the year.  He devoted much of his speech to questioning technological research and work of a military kind. It is a most conspicuous instance in which we have moved into the world of technology in a quarter where we were not previously prominent in the economy. He gave us an instance of the personnel carrier which at that time apparently could not be produced in commercial quantities in Ireland and could only be put on to an assembly line in Belgium.</P>

      <P>These are the only drafting amendments. I concede freely that they are of no serious importance to a serious board.  The section as it stands is not entirely perfect from a pure drafting point of view.  Section 9 (1) reads:</P>
      <P>The members of the Board shall be a chairman and such number (not being more than ten) as the Minister may from time to time determine.</P>
      <P>Therefore even the chairman is a member and the references in the later subsections to a member, if those subsections are taken in isolation, must include the chairman as well.  The specific references to the chairman in the intervening subsection make it obvious that he is not intended to be comprehended by the latest subsection but it does seem that there is a minute failure in drafting.  I will not press the point, but if the Minister sees anything in it he might accept these amendments; otherwise he might think about them between now and when the Bill goes to the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  No person shall, knowing that such disclosure is a breach of the foregoing subsection of this section, receive any such information as is referred to in the foregoing subsection.</P>
      <P>The object of this suggestion, as adverted to when debating this last week, is to make criminal any act of accepting disclosure of information.  The disclosure itself is made criminal by the section.  It ought in logic to be criminal also to receive that information knowingly. Of course if it is wished on someone and he has to take it inadvertently no criminal liability could arise unless it were spelled out in absolutely clear language by the Oireachtas, and that would probably be undesirable.  In the practical situation which we have to envisage a consultant who, as a result of his association with this board, is in possession of material which the board has classified as confidential and is the product of research which the board has paid for or instituted, is forbidden to disclose it.  If he arranges to disclose it and hands over a sheet of paper or a formula or something of that sort, it seems that for the person who receives it knowing that this is an illicit operation on the part of the person communicating the information, it should be equally criminal.  I am not sure, looking at the thing in cold print, that my amendment is a very happy one.  It was intended to encompass the recipient of this information which ought not to have been disclosed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept the amendment.  It is reasonable to apply sanctions to people in the employment of a semi-State board who disclose confidential information but it seems draconian to extend such sanctions to the public at large for receiving such information.  In any event, it may be unnecessary if it is possible to prove receipt of such information.  The source of the disclosure must also be fairly easily proved.  The existing provision covers those disclosures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> The proposed amendments could operate in a way that an innocent member of the public who would voluntarily receive such information would find himself liable to prosecution. I feel that the provision, as already amended by my amendments earlier and by my amendments on Committee Stage, provide adequate safeguards in relation to the protection of confidential information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not entirely happy with that explanation.  I take it that the Minister has talked to the draftsman and to the people in the Attorney General's Office.  If that is the case, I will not take up the time of the House. I deliberately designed the amendment in such a way as not to encompass an innocent member of the public.  It is designed to encompass somebody who arranges to get information which he knows he ought not to have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 14, after &ldquo;liable&rdquo; to insert the following &ldquo;on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £5,000 or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I looked at this subsection again and it seemed to me that the limit of £500 which can be imposed by a district justice on a summary prosecution would not really meet the seriousness of any case which we might have to envisage in the future.  It seemed to me that an industrial consultant, an engineer, a biologist, chemist or somebody whose work might have a very important industrial association would regard £500 as a flea bite.  He is not dealing in £500 of anything which would scarcely pay for a holiday but in material which would be a serious target for industrial piracy or espionage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe, without wishing to be accused of being draconian, that to make the thing merely a summary offence triable in the same tribunal as an offence of a very minor kind in connection with road traffic, for <Col N="148" /> example, is not appropriate.  I do not ask the Minister to do this before the end of this Stage but he might consider between now and bringing the Bill to the Seanad if there might not be a very serious dimension to an offence under this section and whether in that case it might not be right to impose a much heavier penalty for which, of course, a trial on indictment in the Circuit Court with a jury or in the Central Criminal Court will be necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the creation of a summary offence here and the provision of a fine up to £500 which has increased tenfold over what was proposed by my predecessor on summary conviction is a greater deterrent against disclosures of confidential information.  The parliamentary draftsman advises that provisions for indictable offences are rarely, if ever, included in this type of Bill for this type of offence.</P>
      <P>It should also be borne in mind that the £500 penalty is only a minor part of the consequences of conviction for this offence of disclosure.  Loss of employment would also follow immediately which could be a very serious matter for the person concerned.  It is an immeasurably heavier penalty than the fine proposed of £500.  I do not think it is necessary to create an indictable offence here.  Most Bills of this kind do not have this sort of provision. It is generally felt that the sanction of possible loss of employment is adequate.  Of course, that sanction is there in addition to the monetary section which is referred to here and for that reason I do not think it is necessary to create an indictable offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Minister's point of view and if the parliamentary draftsman so advises I would be slow to contradict him.  At the same time, the main burden of what the Minister has just said is not applicable to the case which I have primarily in mind.  Of course, it is quite true that a servant of the board, such as an official who is employed and gets a monthly pay cheque from the board, will be much more heavily hit by dismissal than by a £500 fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> The case which I instanced is not that of an official or servant of the board.  It is the case of an outside consultant employed by the board, the sort of person who might think it proper to disclose some process which had been reached by research and by work the board had sponsored.  He is not amenable to discipline of this kind. His contract to the board is perhaps terminated.  We have just provided by an amendment of the Minister that past consultancy or past service with the board renders one liable.  It seems to me that it is somebody like this one really needs to deter.</P>
    <P>I quite see that loss of employment is a far more serious thing.  I would like to see there being two offences under which a relatively trivial breach would be a trivial offence which would be triable summarily.  In the case of an industrial consultant, an engineering consultant, a biochemist or somebody like that who will make big money out of disclosing what he should not disclose the fine would be a real deterrent.  That is the only deterrent which the board can effect against him.</P>
    <P>I realise we can only speak once on this Stage and I do not want to hold up the House.  I ask the Minister in good faith to think about this point again between now and bringing the Bill to the Seanad and, perhaps, see if the draftsman might have second thoughts or possibly even consider recasting the penal provisions of this section following the analogy of some appropriate provisions in the Official Secrets Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill are explained in the memorandum which was circulated to Deputies on 27th October.  The Industrial Development Bill, 1976, which lapsed on the dissolution <Col N="150" /> of the last Dáil, contained a number of provisions amending the powers of the Industrial Development Authority as they related to the provision of assistance for the development of new enterprise and for sectoral restructuring, together with a number of provisions which are technically necessary to keep the industrial development legislation up to date. Since the proposals in the Bill had already been announced and are awaited by certain firms and since a number of the measures were in any case long overdue from the authority's point of view the Government have decided to take a positive view of the merits of these proposals and to proceed with the present Bill, which incorporates the provisions of the 1976 Bill together with a number of amendments to which I will refer later.  It is my intention however that a more comprehensive review of the authority's powers and functions will be undertaken at a later date.</P>
    <P>As the Bill is, in its broadest sense, concerned with enchancing the job creation abilities of the authority, it will be seen to fit in very well with current Government objectives.  A programme of immediate job creation has been our first priority in the months since taking office.  Already the Government have initiated a series of measures in key areas which will create over 5,000 new jobs in 1977 and will contribute to the target of 20,000 new jobs in the year to mid-1978. These measures include significant extensions to the employment incentive scheme, the establishment of an Action Team on Youth Unemployment, a substantial increase in the public capital programme for housing and other capital works to boost employment in the construction industry, and the recruitment of substantial additional numbers to the Garda Síochána, health and other services.  In addition, the Government have had meetings with the major national representative bodies in the economic sphere to exchange views on how best to boost job creation, and there will be further meetings at various levels.</P>
    <P>The Bill's main objective is to enhance the capability of the IDA: to <Col N="151" /> encourage and assist the development of domestic industry, and particularly the small and medium-sized indigenous firms; to stimulate the emergence in much greater numbers of new entrepreneurs.  I will, of course, dwell further on this, but first I think some comments on the activities generally of the IDA, as at present constituted, would be expected from me by the House.</P>
    <P>The reconstitution of the IDA in its present form under the Industrial Development Act, 1969, enabled the authority generally to expand its job creation capacity and, as Deputies will agree, it has addressed itself to this task with considerable success.  Indeed, the results it has achieved would have been far better had it not been for the job losses that have occurred in recent years in our older industries and the impact which the recession has had on the investment plans of overseas firms.</P>
    <P>In the period from April, 1970, to December, 1976, a total of over £237 million was approved for new industry projects with a job potential of 84,311.  In the same period over £71 million was approved towards projects involving the re-equipment and modernisation of existing industries; £13 million was committed under the small industries programme towards the creation of over 12,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>I think all Deputies are aware of the main programmes operated by the IDA, that is to say: the new industries programme&mdash;which largely but not exclusively is concerned with the attraction of new projects from overseas&mdash;the home industries programme &mdash;which is concerned with the development and maintenance of existing industry, and of whose activities the re-equipment grants scheme is a major feature&mdash;and the small industries programme.  What may be less well known are the series of new measures taken by the authority in recent years to supplement and reinforce the main programmes. These new measures include a joint venture scheme, the operation of a project identification unit, a service industries programme, and a <Col N="152" /> product and process development grant scheme.</P>
    <P>Some Irish firms find that the best means of expanding is to enter into partnership with an overseas company with complementary attributes.  In such cases the IDA's joint venture unit will seek a suitable partner and help to develop the ensuring project. In the period to December, 1976, 19 joint venture projects were approved which will produce a total of 1,500 jobs at full production.</P>
    <P>Many smaller industrialists have developed by taking advantage of business opportunities presented by the establishment of larger foreign industries in this country.  There are also opportunities to supply existing Irish firms with materials which are currently imported.  To identify these opportunities the IDA has set up a project identification unit which takes the initiative in identifying manufacturing opportunities for Irish firms. Already the IDA has approached over 400 Irish firms with specific proposals, often based initially on import substitution but also having strong export potential.  About 40 of these projects have been brought to the approval stage and 50 are under negotiation at present.</P>
    <P>Another scheme introduced to promote employment creation is the service industries programme.  This programme provides jobs for highly skilled people&mdash;such as graduates and professional and technical personnel&mdash; by encouraging Irish and foreign firms in the service industries to expand their overseas-orientated operations in Ireland.  In 1976, almost 1,200 jobs were approved under this programme in 19 projects, nine of which are being promoted by Irish firms.</P>
    <P>The response of Irish industry to the IDA's product and process development grants scheme has grown to the stage where commitments have reached a level of about 150 projects each year involving close to £1 million of grant commitments.  This underlines the growing sophistication of Irish industry and the positive attitude of Irish industrialists towards future growth and expansion.</P>
    <P>The job creation task now facing <Col N="153" /> the country necessitates further measures, however.  One of these is obviously to increase considerably the numbers of new small industries that are established.  It is well recongnised, not only in Ireland but throughout the EEC generally, that continuing industrial growth requires an increase in the &ldquo;birth rate&rdquo; of small firms.  In recognition of this the Government have recently undertaken to double the rate of project approvals for small Irish industries.  To enable this target to be met I recently announced a package of new measures.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, the small industry &ldquo;cluster&rdquo; concept, introduced on a pilot basis a couple of years ago, is to be immediately extended throughout the country with a nationwide programme of nine small industry clusters.  The new programme will involve the construction of almost 200,000 sq. ft. of factory space at a cost of over £2 million.  Subject to planning permission, construction at all locations will start in the next few months and the availability of these facilities in the near future will enable companies to get into production quickly.</P>
    <P>I also recently authorised the IDA to proceed with the building of five 7,000 sq. ft. advance factories specifically for small industries, and plans for construction are proceeding at all locations.  In addition, the fixed asset investment criterion for small firms has been raised from £200,000 to £300,000, a change which will enable a greater number of projects to come within the scope of the small industries programme's generous package of incentives.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the need to encourage and foster small industries specifically in Dublin, two further initiatives are being undertaken in conjunction with Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council.  At Marley Grange the county council are making craft workshops available and these are being actively promoted by the IDA as a location for suitable craft industries.  And in the Liberties area of the city the IDA is currently arranging with Dublin Corporation for the <Col N="154" /> construction of a number of industrial units.</P>
    <P>These measures represent a substantial commitment by the Government to increasing the resources available to promote local Irish enterprise.  Taken together with the generous financial and aftercare advisory services at present available, I am confident that they will lead to accelerated growth of the small industry sector in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>While emphasising this commitment to the development of domestic industry our job creation needs are such that we will continue to need&mdash;and in increasing numbers&mdash;the establishment of new overseas projects for many years to come.  To illustrate this, the IDA estimate that in the four year period 1977-80 overseas investment will have to provide about half of the new job approvals needed.</P>
    <P>The task of attracting here the sort of overseas project that we are interested in is getting tougher, however. In the first place international competition for such projects is growing, from both developing and developed countries. In addition, the volume of internatioanl mobile industrial investment, particularly from the USA, has declined in recent years.  The number of investment proposals generated by our overseas industries programme has been somewhat disappointing in the past two years; only 39 projects with a total job potential of 7,896 were approved under the overseas new industry programme in 1975, and 33 projects with a job potential of 6,358 in 1976.  This compares with 80 projects involving total job potential of 13,694 approved in the year 1st April, 1973, to 31st March, 1974.</P>
    <P>In this situation the IDA has been stepping up its promotional efforts to get an increased share of mobile industrial investment for Ireland.  And it is my intention to maintain overall industrial incentives at a level which will be adequate and competitive and to have the position reviewed and adjusted as circumstances require.</P>
    <P>In the past, some Deputies on the opposite side have put forward the view that to meet our job creation needs, the establishment of a National <Col N="155" /> Development Corporation was necessary. This viewpoint was most recently put forward by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions at their meeting with the Taoiseach and other Ministers and myself on 23rd September.  I indicated then that with the provision for the IDA of the additional powers contained in the Bill and the establishment of an Industrial Development Consortium the need for a National Development Corporation did not in my opinion arise.  The question of the establishment of the consortium was the subject of a question in the House last week.  I would now like to tell the House what are my proposals in regard to the establishment of this consortiom and what objectives it would have.</P>
    <P>The remit of the consortium will include the following: (a) setting job creation targets and monitoring and reviewing industrial progress in general, with particular reference to job creation and job maintenance; (b) identification of obstacles to growth and suggesting solutions, and (c) co-ordination of activities of existing State agencies to maximise the contribution of these agencies to industrial development.</P>
    <P>One of the main objectives in establishing the consortium will be to ensure that industry has available to it the resources necessary to achieve industrial growth targets.  Job maintenance will get as much attention as job creation, and special attention will be given to mechanisms for assisting enterprises in difficulties.  The constitution and operations of Fóir Teo. and other agencies concerned in this area will be looked at.  In particular I have in mind the possibility that Fóir Teo. might be revamped into a body not associated with impending &ldquo;bankruptcy&rdquo;. Such possible restructuring might entail transfer of shareholdings acquired by the IDA and other bodies to the new entity.  But further study and deliberation will be needed before we can come to final conclusions on these matters.</P>
    <P>Initially the consortium will consist of the Ministers and Secretaries of Departments concerned with industrial <Col N="156" /> development and job creation, principally the Departments of Industry, Commerce and Energy, Finance, Economic Planning and Development and Labour, together with the chief executives of State agencies directly involved in industrial development, that is, the IDA, Córas Tráchtála, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, An Chomhairle Oiliúna, the Industrial Credit Co. and Fóir Teo. Provision will be made for participation by other State bodies and companies and for consultation with national representative organisations such as the CII and ICTU as required.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy will be chairman of the consortium and other Ministers will attend as required.  I wish to stress the flexibility in our approach to both the membership and the operating methods of the new body.  What we are most concerned with is achieving results.</P>
    <P>I would like now to turn to the provisions of the present Bill.  In addition to the proposals previously provided for in the Industrial Development Bill, 1976, the present Bill includes a provision which will extend the shareholding powers of the IDA. Under the Industrial Development Act, 1969, the IDA are empowered to take shares in certain industrial undertakings. Equity participation by the IDA can be an important and valuable part of the overall financial package put together to assist an industrial undertaking, and it can provide the State with a share in profitable new enterprises and thus secure a return on capital invested in industrial development.</P>
    <P>I have found, however, on examination that there are unnecessary restrictions on the IDA's powers in this regard.  Legal opinion obtained by the authority has indicated that on the basis of the existing statutory provisions, the authority could be confident of having power to take minority holdings in existing companies only.  In order to remove the doubt regarding the authority's power to take majority shareholdings and to ensure that it has adequate flexibility <Col N="157" /> to operate successfully in the increasingly sophisticated financial and industiial environment, I propose to extend the authority's shareholding powers to enable it to take shareholdings of up to 100 per cent in suitable industrial undertakings, or in companies participating in the ownership, control or management of suitable industrial undertakings, and to enable it to form or participate with others in the formation of new industrial companies.</P>
    <P>This extension should not be seen as providing the authority with exceptional powers; powers similar to those which the Bill proposes to extend to the authority are already available to Gaeltarra Éireann and other bodies.</P>
    <P>I would expect that these extended powers of participation would be particularly useful to the authority in the implementation of the new enterprise development programme.  With these powers the authority would, if circumstances so warranted, be in a position to set up a company to manufacture a product successfully developed under the programme or become a shareholder in a company being set up for that purpose&mdash;for instance, in cases where the Irish party was for the time being over-burdened with technical production and marketing problems or lacked the professional support or finance to bring the project to an early start-up.</P>
    <P>I regard this initiative as a reasonable and pragmatic extension of existing IDA powers and functions.  Save in exceptional circumstances IDA personnel will not be engaged in the actual day-to-day management of commercial enterprises.</P>
    <P>I would draw attention to the fact that under the terms of the Bill it will be necessary for the authority to seek my prior approval before it takes a majority shareholding in any company. The Bill also provides for a limit of £1 million on the amount which the authority may expend on the purchase or taking of shares in a particular body corporate without prior Government approval.  All the authority's financial incentives are subject to a maximum limit for each individual <Col N="158" /> case, which can be exceeded only with Government approval; this provision brings expenditure on shares into line in this respect.</P>
    <P>In Ireland the volume of new projects promoted by first-time industrialists has been disappointingly small, even though as a country I am sure we have our due proportion of people with the necessary knowledge and skills.  It is clear that in many cases one of the causes of this apparent lack of enterprise has been the inability of the entrepreneur to raise the necessary finance to carry him through the start-up situation.  All too frequently Irish banks will lend only on the security of assets rather than on ability and enterprise.  Accordingly it is proposed in this Bill to provide for the giving of loan guarantees and interest subsidies to first-time industrialists, in respect of loans raised to provide working capital.  The new guarantee facilities will be limited to £150,000 in any one case, but the Government may permit a higher figure.</P>
    <P>I would envisage that this proposal will get a response from a wide spectrum of Irish people, both at home and abroad, who have the qualifications, experience and enterprise to become successful industrialists.  The resulting projects will generally have to be commercially exploitable within a reasonable time span.  They are of course likely to be small initially, but should offer significant longer-term benefits in view of the possibilities for expansion and linkage at a later stage.</P>
    <P>This new enterprise development programme is an experiment.  It will be necessary in each case to assess the ability and commitment of the entrepreneur; in certain instances also the authority may find it necessary to support persons, by consultancy contract, while they are developing a worth-while proposal in its technical details. Assistance towards working capital will be supplemented as appropriate by the existing range of benefits for fixed assets administered by the IDA.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the giving of loan guarantees and interest subsidies in respect of the finance needed for mergers and acquisitions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="159" /> Up to the present the main incentive to help existing industry become more efficient has been the re-equipment grant scheme.  While this has done much to enable Irish firms to modernise, it does nothing to promote planned and orderly restructuring; instead, the existence of excess capacity in industries at a time of competitive pressure from imports is enforcing structural changes involving major costs in terms of redundancies, lost capacity and the need to create substitute employment.</P>
    <P>Our commitment to home industry suggests that the authority should be able to take a positive and constructive part in bringing about desirable and orderly change in certain sectors. The industries most at risk are composed of smaller-scale firms and are, for the most part, not capital-intensive. Restructuring assistance is consequently unlikely to entail an outlay proportionate to its obvious benefits. The Bill would set a limit of £500,000 on the amount of borrowings which the authority could guarantee in any one such case without Government approval.</P>
    <P>In every other European country some form of positive assistance is provided for restructuring.  I am glad to make this contribution to the Irish situation, at the same time recognising that further initiatives may be necessary at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that there is widespread approval in the House of the programme carried out by a number of State bodies to provide development assistance to what is called the Third World.  There is a general will to do what we can in this field within the limits of our resources.</P>
    <P>The IDA is one of the participating bodies and is highly qualified to be of assistance by reason of its extensive expertise in the assessment of projects, promotion of a wide range of industry, construction and management of industrial estates and so on.  In the past, although it had no formal power to do so, the IDA has given briefings as the occasion arose to representatives of developing countries and more recently, in anticipation of this provision, has negotiated for a small number of projects <Col N="160" /> in the field of overseas co-operation. There is a considerable demand for such assistance, both from the developing countries themselves and from international organisations which provide contracts for development projects abroad.</P>
    <P>Such contracts are likely to be the main source of finance for the limited undertakings by the IDA in this area, and IDA funds as such are unlikely to bear any expense arising therefrom, taking one year with another.  In fact, the amount of IDA resources in terms of personnel which can be made available for this work may be more limited than many advocates of development co-operation would like.</P>
    <P>This Bill formally gives the IDA power to engage, with my approval, in development work of this kind on the basis of providing technical and advisory services, but not material or financial assistance.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains a number of provisions designed to tidy up the ceilings on aggregate expenditure set out in the existing legislation.  Financial commitments under the present Bill are brought within the appropriate limits, namely, £400 million for grants of a capital nature, including interest subsidies, and £100 million for loan guarantees.  Expenditures on equity which formerly were not covered by any ceiling are brought within the limit on grants of a capital nature.</P>
    <P>Training grants are recognised in every country as an effective instrument in influencing the location of industry, in up-grading the skills of the population, in bringing forward job creation and as a direct incentive to industrial promotion.  Up to now there has been no limit in money terms on the amount of training grants which could be given to any one undertaking, although of course each application is examined as to what is technically needed for the specific process in question.</P>
    <P>Recently, however, training grants have become larger, due to increases in the scale of projects and promotion of service industries which are intensive in training grant requirement. <Col N="161" /> Accordingly the Bill proposes to bring the amount of training grant which can be approved, without Government permission, into line with that for capital grants generally, namely, £850,000 per case.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation authentication of the authority's seal requires the attendance, sometimes at short notice, of two members of the authority.  As the members of the authority are busy people in their own right, and as there is moreover a substantial volume of these papers, the present system is not easy to work.  As a practical matter the Bill gives the authority power to delegate this function to two of its senior officers.</P>
    <P>On legal advice it is proposed to make clear the purposes for which the authority may borrow temporarily. Such borrowings, I might add, are exceptional and have occurred principally when the amount of money which the IDA has been entitled to draw from the Exchequer has been exhausted, pending further legislation.</P>
    <P>The IDA has, since 1970, given grants of up to 50 per cent of the costs involved in research and development projects, subject to an absolute maximum of £15,000, but the limit of 50 per cent of approved costs will continue to apply.  The new limit is justified in the context of the increased costs of scientific work and the increased scale of projects now being undertaken by native Irish industry and, in many cases also, being delegated to Irish subsidiaries of overseas companies.</P>
    <P>Ireland still stands out as an attractive base for international industry. We can enhance this attractiveness by maintaining competitive incentives, by building up our industrial infrastructure, by continuing to provide a hospitable environment for overseas investment and, particularly, by reducing our rate of inflation.  This last will require the co-operation of all sections of the community and is vitally necessary if we are to combat the unemployment problem.  The magnitude of this problem is widely recognised.  A significant growth in the population and labour force is projected in the years ahead.  The urgent need to absorb those who lost their jobs <Col N="162" /> during the last three years and the long standing problem of structural unemployment compound the need for urgent job creation.</P>
    <P>For all that, it is not a time for despondency or negativism.  The Government have taken positive measures to create employment and additional proposals are at present under examination. The trend in price increases is significantly downward and next year, if all goes well, inflation will be reduced well into single figures.  A good rate of growth is likely to be maintained in industry, with GNP as a whole likely to grow by between 4½ and 5 per cent this year.  There has been an upsurge in private investment, especially in the manufacturing sector, underlining the growth in business confidence.</P>
    <P>The measures contained in the Bill can be seen as further promoting industrial recovery and future development. As such I am confident that they will receive the support of the House.  The IDA has achieved considerable success in the past and has shown itself willing constantly to reappraise its own activities and to respond to the need for change as it arises.  This Bill extends the range of incentives the authority can offer and increases its ability to operate effectively. I accordingly recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>

      <P>The public memory has probably had the experience of a blackboard over which a sponge has been wiped since the early summer, what with the election and the formation of a new Government.  If I might just be bold enough to remind the House, this is the second time that essentially the same Bill has been put before it.  It was introduced on Second Stage in May last by me, deputising for Deputy Keating, Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It progressed some distance. There were three or four speakers from the Opposition benches and when the Minister now says he is glad or proud to do this or that what he is, in fact, doing is taking up where Deputy Keating, now Senator Keating, as Minister for Industry and Commerce left off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" /> Earlier today I mentioned two or three exceptions since the House reassembled on 12th October.  I do not want to make anything of that except to say that it underlines the fact that both sides are interested in industrial development.  When that Bill was introduced in May last Deputy Brennan, who is now Ceann Comhairle, had many things to say about what the Government were doing about industrial development but he had no objection to the Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill is part of a series&mdash;the Principal Act is the 1969 Act&mdash;in regard to the Industrial Development Authority.  The authority goes back not to the second last or third last Taoiseach, not to Mr. Seán Lemass or Mr. de Valera or any other prophet on the other side of the House, but to the first Coalition Government and to the Industrial Development Authority Act of 1950.  Accordingly, everything connected with the authority is of the deepest interest to this party.  We sponsored the emergence of the authority. We have watched it with anxious affection all through its existence and we welcome both in substance and in detail the contents of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the essential points of the Bill somewhat late in his introductory remarks and I shall have something to say about that in a moment.  The main point is that this Bill enables the authority for the first time to assist by guarantee activities it could not formerly assist, notably the merger of enterprises which, but for a merger, might continue in such a manner that one would write off the other or drive the other out of the field. Secondly, it is designed to encourage the setting up in industry of people who formerly did not know much about industry.  Both these objectives are long established and identified.  The Government I served were associated with the drafting of the Bill.  That measure was repeatedly held up while the Minister dealt with other Bills of more immediate importance designed to help the authority out of financial constraints, but intending at all stages, as in the end he did, to produce legislation such as the Bill now before us <Col N="164" /> which would extend the essential nature of the authority's powers.  I did not notice the Minister saying anything about the new functions being given to the authority in regard to assistance to developing countries.  If his speech did contain something about that, I apologise as I must have missed it but there was no great emphasis laid on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I missed it.  That is an important formalisation of what the authority is now being formally given power to do.  Even before this, it had, of course, taken part in operations of a development aid nature but I, and everybody on this side of the House, will be glad to see this part of its function formally expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining parts of the Bill mainly deal with bringing under the existing financial ceiling the various forms of financial risk and activity in which the authority engages.  If that were all the Minister had said I could not, perhaps, sit down because as far as the material in the Bill goes this party is in entire agreement on it.  We were part of a Government which sponsored it and we had got some distance on Second Stage in bringing this virtually identical Bill before the House.  The Minister's speech, however, ranged a good deal wider than the material of the Bill.  I have forgotten at what stage the Chair changed but in case you were not here when the change was signalled by the Minister, I direct your attention to the fact that the Minister said, after he had gone half way through his speech: &ldquo;I would like now to turn to the provisions of the present Bill&rdquo;.  In other words, a considerable part of this speech, apart from a perfunctory mention of the Bill at the outset, was devoted to matters other than matters contained in the Bill.  I hope that, as the Minister was indulged by the House and the Chair in that respect I shall be indulged if, without any notice, I say something of a general kind about some of the matters which the Minister produced under the umbrella of <Col N="165" /> his speech on the Industrial Development Bill.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is wrong to say that what the Minister has done is unprecedented. That is a word that is freely and, perhaps, wrongly used; it may be that there is a precedent for what the Minister has just done but, if so, I think it is a precedent that he would have done well to avoid.  Without any notice, certainly without any notice that reached me he has given the House details of an absolutely major project which has nothing to do with the Industrial Development Authority except that the IDA will form part of it, a very subordinate part, as far as I can see.  He has given quite substantial detail, admittedly with the reservation that he is going to keep an open mind and retain flexibility and so on, of a major new project which, to some extent, figured in his party's election manifesto but which we are now hearing about for the first time in any detail.  He has done that under the cover of a Bill to which it has only very indirect relevance.  Without making too much of a song and dance about it and with all the modesty that may be expected from a very new spokesman in this field I must protest at this being done without notice.  I shall ask the Whip of my party to request that the debate on the matter which the Minister has opened up be not continued until we have had a chance to think about what the Minister has been saying because we are no longer discussing the Industrial Development Bill; what is now under discussion is the ball that the Minister has thrown into the field at no notice, namely, the question of an industrial development consortium.</P>
    <P>That consortium is one which the Minister may or may not envisage&mdash; that is a vital detail he did not give&mdash; as having a statutory basis.  If it has a statutory basis, and I can scarcely imagine it without one, it will be before the House in due course but I must make some protest if the House is expected to debate the Bill that is before it in print by allowing the Minister at no notice to produce quite a detailed statement, the grounds for which were laid in the first half of his <Col N="166" /> speech, in regard to a consortium, the statutory basis for which is not yet before the House.  That is not to be taken as being a preliminary adverse judgment on a consortium.  It is because I am not able and could not be expected to be able on my feet to produce a reasoned and thought-out judgment on it.  I shall ask my party Whip to request from the Government Whip that further debate on this Bill, because of the matter which the Minister has introduced, be deferred after the closing of business this evening until such time as my party get a chance to look at what the Minister has said, absorb it and think about it, and come to a conclusion about it.</P>
    <P>The preparatory matter with which the Minister dealt before coming to provisions of the Bill included some material about the achievements of his own Government.  &ldquo;Already&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the Government has initiated a series of measures in key areas&rdquo; whatever they are &ldquo;which will create over 5,000 new jobs in 1977 and will contribute to the target of 20,000 new jobs in the year to mid-1978.  These measures,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;include significant extensions to the employment incentive scheme, the establishment of an action team on youth unemployment...&rdquo; and other things.  In regard to the first two matters I want to say that the employment incentive scheme which was introduced by the Government in which I served was not an Irish invention; it exists in other European countries at times of recession but it seems to me to be essentially a weapon for use at times of severe recession.  If we build it into our way of doing business, into our relationship between Government and industry in the manner in which food subsidies may easily become builtin in the people's budgetary expectations regarding the way they and their families live, we are taking a very serious step.  I want to make it absolutely clear that not only did I and do I support the employment incentive scheme but before it was ever introduced I inquired about its operation in other countries and wrote to Ministers in my Government urging that it be introduced here.  Please let me not be <Col N="167" /> understood as being in any way against it but I want to warn the Minister because he has mentioned it now&mdash;I shall come back to the theme on a more appropriate occasion&mdash;that anything about the employment incentive scheme should be very cautiously done and always done on the understanding that a scheme such as that must be seen as an emergency scheme.  Perhaps to some extent we are still in an emergency.  We still have an unprecedently high unemployment level.</P>
    <P>Even though the economy is showing very positive indicators and we seem to be pulling out of the recession in some degree, we still have extremely serious problems which will get more serious because of the unfavourable demographic movement which is tending to give us a very large proportion of dependent people compared with wage earners.  Every time an employment incentive scheme is continued or extended it means, essentially, that the State is taking upon itself the role of employer.  It means that the State is becoming the employer of people who are not State servants and the State is encouraging expectations among those people and among others.  Any member of a Government and any member of a watchdog Opposition must be very cautious about that.  We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where the State is the universal employer.</P>
    <P>About ten years ago, in days when Government seemed to have a bit more backbone than they have lately, when Deputy Blaney was Minister for Agriculture, I remember him saying to the farmers in so many words when they were complaining about their low incomes that the Government were not the farmers' employer and that they could not talk to him as if they were employed by him.  I am not a member of Deputy Blaney's fan club but he was talking the naked truth.  Anything to do with an employment or administrative scheme right though it may be in a time of emergency, once the thing becomes settled in, even when the emergency is past, a certain expectation becomes centred in the Government <Col N="168" /> that they will take up the bill for employment in matters that are not State directed, in which the State has no direct control.  I support, and even advocated before this appeared, such a scheme.  I hope that the Minister is not offended when I call this his glib recital of an employment incentive scheme, as though his Government had invented it and as though it were to become a permanent feature of the landscape.  I hope the Minister has the same reservations as I have about this.</P>
    <P>The Action Team on Youth Unemployment so far seems to be no more than the title of an administrative group.  I put down a question to the Minister for Labour in relation to this, which I hope will be answered in the next few sitting days, inquiring into the activities of this action team. By the extreme breadth of its composition it seems to have disabled itself from anything which could be described as action.  It has representatives from no less than nine Government Departments and representatives from other organisations.  Any Government official will tell the Minister that this is a pure recipe for inertia and frustration.  It will get nothing done with that many representatives. It might be called an action team but it will not take any more action than one Minister sitting down and deciding to allocate so much funds to this or that project.  It is a piece of electioneering eyewash which is wasting the time of people who are not in the public service at all and who could be far better employed getting on with their own jobs.  I will not express a final judgment although I am not optimistic about this employment action team, until we see what it does. I will be surprised if it works efficiently. This team was set up on 4th August and its first meeting was at the end of September.  It took seven weeks to arrange a meeting of this action team.  What can one expect from a team that takes seven weeks to meet, let alone produce a job?  If I turn out to be wrong about this I will admit it with more grace than the Minister has ever shown when he was wrong.</P>

The Minister for Economic Planning and Development has taken over this evening the field of the Board of Science and Technology.  I thought that the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, was going to be the man with all the answers, so I originally put down my question about the employment action team to him, but now I find that it has been transferred to the Minister for Labour. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, is willing to take on the Board for Science and Technology but will not take on the employment action team. That fact in itself is significant.</P>

      <P>This employment action team is an entirely new thing and the Minister I believe is wrong in saying that the Minister for Labour is responsible for creating employment.  The Minister for Labour is not responsible for creating employment although his operations have some relevance.  If the Minister were to say in the presence of Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, the Minister for Labour, that his was the prime responsibility for creating employment, I am certain Deputy Fitzgerald would be the first man to contradict him.  It is the job of the Government as a whole.  The Minister for Labour would be involved in relation to industrial relations, it would involve the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy, the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach, as well as the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  The Minister for Labour was saddled with this problem because Deputy O'Donoghue's Department would not answer the question about the employment action team. <Col N="170" /> Although they are full of ideas, plans and promises the question I want answered, namely what is this team doing now, cannot be answered by the man in charge of economic planning and development.  I am referred to the Minister for Labour who I now hear for the first time is responsible for job creation.  I am grateful to the Minister for that information which was certainly not given to the House before.</P>

      <P>The Minister began his speech by mentioning matters which the Minister has already undertaken such as substantial additional numbers to the Garda Siochána.  The truth, as the House knows, is that the Government which I served had already made provision for a very substantial increase in the membership of the Garda Síochána and it is doubtful if that rate of recruitment can be improved or accelerated without dropping the standard, or bringing somewhat into question the standard of recruitment.  Nobody on either side of the House wishes to do that.  These were some of the introductory remarks of the Minister along with a general review of the Government and the work of the Industrial Development Authority.  The Minister then produced some brand new projects in regard to an industrial development consortium.  Before mentioning this consortium the Minister mentioned what he called the establishment of a national development corporation which had been recommended by Deputies on the opposite side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I never particularly supported raising on the Adjournment matters of an industrial dispute. Since I came into this House in <Col N="171" /> 1969 I have never done so.  I regret that on this occasion I feel it necessary to do so in relation to the current post office engineering dispute in Cork in a manner as helpful as possible with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
      <P>I want to discuss this particular dispute. I have no desire whatever to raise the other current disputes in the Department in Dublin, in Letterkenny or, indeed, in my own constituency of Dun Laoghaire as I regard them as being quite separate.  Rather, I shall endeavour to isolate one and see if I can possibly be of help to the Minister and the trade union concerned, the Irish Post Office Engineering Union, in resolving the <i>impasse</i> which has caused widespread disruption, particularly in Cork city, and a great deal of commercial and domestic dislocation.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, basically the dispute in Cork evolves around the use of a premises in Lapps Quay. I know the area well.  I know the old post office engineering depot in Copley Street.  I was born and reared in that area.  I declare my interest; my twin brother happens to be one of those currently involved; he is a post office technician.  Leaving aside family connections, I also have close connections with the Post Office Engineering Union.  I am not raising the matter merely on that basis but rather to see if we can bring about some form of settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister knows, in March 1975, the disc parking system was introduced in Cork city.  That included Copley Street and adjacent areas.  The corporation have been bringing a great deal of pressure&mdash;and I appreciate it &mdash;on the Department to relocate the fleet of trucks and vans, the best part of 40 trucks and, in all, 100 vans, in a more suitable location to prevent road obstructions and parking violations in the overcrowded depot at Copley Street.  Over the years I have been to that area many times and have seen the traffic problem there.  As we well know, Cork is in a state of general traffic chaos.  That particular location, the post office engineering depot, for the postal and engineering fleets involved <Col N="172" /> continuous interruption of traffic.  There has been a continuous flow of Posts and Telegraphs vehicles in and out of that depot awaiting repairs as well.</P>
    <P>Overall, we can accept the need for a new headquarters and garage for Posts and Telegraphs vehicles in Cork.  Not only did those premises cater for the old Copley Street premises but also the general vehicle fleet.  I can recall there being things such as compressors, cable drums and winches parked outside the depot.  This situation has been building up over the past seven or eight years approximately.  It has surprised me&mdash;here I am not in any way blaming the Government; there have been successive Ministers involved&mdash; that, over the past five or six years a more expeditious solution of the evident problem was not brought about. One way or the other, when the decision was taken, the other premises in Lapps Quay were obtained, premises the best part of 100 years old; it was the old Tedcastle coal store.  As the Minister is only too well aware, there have been a number of disputes between the Department and the union concerned regarding the suitability or otherwise of those premises for either a garage or headquarters.</P>
    <P>I know that originally the trade union concerned, both at executive and Cork branch level, were very critical of even the very decision to use those premises. It was an old coal store.  At the time it was taken over it was rat and pigeon infested, full of coal dust and so on. Some effort has been made by the Department to bring it up to the standard one might normally expect for an engineering depot headquarters.  I do not propose to allocate responsibility or blame to any particular individuals in the Department, the union concerned or management at local level.  In Dáil Éireann it would not be particularly helpful to descend to that level.  One way or the other, the <i>impasse</i> obtaining is that staff through their trade union are not prepared to use those premises as a headquarters because they regard them in their current condition entirely unsuitable.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, a strenuous effort has been made under the good <Col N="173" /> auspices of the Employer/Labour Conference and currently under the auspices of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to see if the <i>impasse</i> could be resolved.  I am aware that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has been in touch with the Minister requesting a meeting to discuss this issue.  Admittedly, I have been very much involved in the House today and have had no opportunity of checking the matter but I am not, as yet, aware if arrangements for that meeting have been made.  I know the Minister is an extremely busy person and was away last week.  However, if I recall correctly, the request for that meeting was made some ten or 14 days ago; working on memory I think it was last Friday week.</P>
    <P>There is an urgency about the matter.  There is an urgency for an agreed inspection of those premises. So serious is this dispute developing that I am not unduly perturbed as to the means by which the premises are inspected, whether it be an inspector of the Department of Labour going down with the chairman of the Employer/ Labour Conference and/or inspectors of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;as was suggested&mdash;but that seems to have been rejected. One way or the other, a joint inspection will have to be carried out by the Department and the union.  Any outstanding necessary work to bring the premises into full usable condition as a headquarters has to be set in train.  I shall not arbitrate, in the sense of a parliamentary disputation with the Minister, as to whether or not it should be used as a headquarters.  If the premises are suitable as a headquarters, then they should be used as such.  If they are not suitable, then it is high time the Department took a sharp look at itself, sat down with the union's executive members from Dublin and, if necessary, bring in a Department of Labour inspector.  If necessary he might go down there with the Department's medical officer, check the place, bring it up to standard immediately and then commence to use it as a headquarters.</P>
    <P>There have been suspensions of individual workers for failure to carry out instructions.  Then a further series <Col N="174" /> of instructions arose as well.  The suspensions have not particularly helped the matter.  It is now six weeks since 40 men were suspended by the management. As we know, the national executive of the Post Office Engineering Union, to use the phrase, retaliated some four weeks ago by withdrawing the labour of some 20 technician linesmen and cable jointers.  I understand that the Department have again suspended a further eight technicians at the head post office for not doing work proper to the original 40 suspended men.</P>
    <P>Here we go on the classic post office merry-go-round.  Approximately 4,000 subscribers in and around Cork city are without telephone services for the past four weeks, public telephone kiosks are out of order and there is considerable disruption generally.  This calls for a straightforward decision by the Minister.  He should tell his Departmental staffs that they should go to Cork with the union representatives and with any other individuals suggested. I understand the chairman of the Employer/Labour Conference, Professor Chubb, made a recommendation in his capacity as chairman of the steering committee that the parties should agree to a joint inspection of the premises with an officer of the Industrial Inspectorate of the Department of Labour or any other qualified person agreed between the parties with a view to seeing what changes, if any, were required.  The recommendation was that the premises should be used immediately for whatever purpose an officer or qualified person recommended and suspensions should be lifted simultaneously.</P>
    <P>The Minister without further ado should direct that the suspensions be lifted, that the inspection take place immediately and that agreement be reached on whatever final adaptation is necessary.  There has been a lot of disputation between the Department and the union about the inadequacy or otherwise of toilet facilities, of locker rooms, assembly rooms and whether dining facilities should be provided in Copley Street or in Lapps Quay.  I have not been in the premises at Lapps Quay and I do not want to <Col N="175" /> comment on it but I am sure it is not beyond the wit of the Minister to have this inspection jointly undertaken immediately, to have the suspensions lifted and to have whatever work that remains to be done completed immediately. When this matter is resolved, I presume the premises can be designated as a headquarters.  I know that in the long run the premises may not be regarded by the union as suitable.  I understand the postal side in Cork have told the Department they are not going to use it as a postal headquarters and then the engineering side got it. I do not know if that is the case but it is the kind of allegation that is being made.  One thing is evident; the breakdown in the telephone communications system in Cork will not benefit anybody.</P>
    <P>I am perturbed about the current climate of industrial relations in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Indeed, they have not been good in recent years.  I have strong private views about some of the carry-on.  I can assure the Departmental staffs that my criticism would not necessarily be aimed solely at management but further comment on my part in relation to a sensitive dispute of this kind would not be very productive.  I urge the Minister to deal with this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by taking this opportunity to express to the public in Cork and elsewhere my regret for the inconvenience and hardship caused as a result of industrial action.  I am particularly conscious of the adverse effects on commerce and industry and on the possible danger to jobs in the areas involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The various matters at issue between the union and the Department were considered by the steering committee of <Col N="176" /> the Employer/Labour Conference in August.  The committee issued recommendations on 19th August to the effect that outstanding problems should be processed in accordance with peaceful procedures, that is, those of the civil service conciliation and arbitration scheme, of the departmental grievance procedure or the procedures of the national pay agreement as appropriate, that the union should cease all industrial action and that the Department should lift the suspensions.</P>
    <P>I accepted the recommendations of the steering committee and I undertook publicly that on full restoration of normal work whatever problems the union had would be dealt with speedily and sympathetically.  Unfortunately, there has not been a full resumption of work.  Among other instances are the ones referred to by Deputy Desmond, namely, that the staff at Lapps Quay refused to carry out instructions to return there and they were suspended. On 3rd October the union executive called out on strike the staff engaged on the maintenance of cables, on subscribers' lines and equipment and those engaged on public call offices in Cork.</P>
    <P>Perhaps at this stage I should point out that there were extensive discussions both locally and at headquarters on the use of the Lapps Quay depot as a headquarters before staff were instructed to report there.  The matter was considered last year by the joint committee on staff accommodation in the engineering branch which made certain recommendations in the context of the use of the depot as a headquarters.  These recommendations were accepted and implemented. Following further representations by the union executive, the Department informed them by letter dated 10th May that other improvements would be carried out as the need arose and the staff would be instructed to report to the depot on 30th May.  The staff did so and continued there until directed to leave on 7th June by the union executive.  I should add that the depot is being used essentially as a reporting centre for outdoor staff.  They attend there for a short while each morning and evening and the depot is closed for the rest of the day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="177" /> The Irish Post Office Engineering Union, with the rest of the recognised civil service unions, is a party to the civil service conciliation and arbitration agreement which was made between the Minister for the Public Service and unions and associations representing approximately 45,000 civil servants.  Whatever complaint the IPOEU may wish to make about accommodation at Lapps Quay should be dealt with under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration or the domestic grievances procedures.  The latter were agreed with the Post Office group of unions, including the IPOEU, under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration.  I have already publicly assured the union executive and staff that, when normal work is resumed, any problems they may have will be dealt with speedily and sympathetically.</P>
    <P>As far as the Lapps Quay depot is concerned, the position is that in the discussions following the union executive's announcement that they had accepted the steering committee's <Col N="178" /> recommendations, the executive were informed that a joint inspection of the depot could be arranged promptly following a return of the staff to the depot, and if the union wished to have still further improvements made they would be considered sympathetically.</P>
    <P>I therefore appeal once again to the union to call off the industrial action generally.  As I said, all outstanding matters will be dealt with quickly.  If in the union's view existing procedures are inadequate, that matter can be considered also.  I intend in any event to carry out a full review of staff rules and regulations of the Department in accordance with the Government manifesto.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by saying to Deputy Desmond that I am meeting the representatives of the executive council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions tomorrow in connection with the matter.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 3rd November, 1977.</P>

While the documentation for the Castlerea scheme has been completed, Roscommon County Council will not be in a position to proceed further pending acquisition of the necessary land and water rights at the Longford Springs source.  Objections have been made to the council's proposal in that regard and a public inquiry was held in Castlerea on 26th October, 1977.  I await the report of this inquiry.</P>
