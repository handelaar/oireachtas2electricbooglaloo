      <P>I should like the Minister to elaborate on the general situation about the General Council of Committees of Agriculture.  Is it the Minister's intention to maintain the General Council of Committees of Agriculture indefinitely in its present form?  The Minister should be more precise in telling us how that body will be represented on the council of the new authority.  It is necessary that we know how many people the authority will have from the General Council of Committees of Agriculture, the IFA, the ICMSA, Macra na Feirme and other bodies associated with farming. Will the Minister give us his thoughts on the composition of the council of the authority, with special <Col N="296" /> reference to the section dealing with the General Council of Committees of Agriculture?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what point Deputy Gibbons is making.  This section simply gives statutory recognition to the General Council of Committees of Agriculture by providing that each committee may make annual contributions to the council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any organisation one could name, unless they are grouped together, will get at least one.  Because of the importance of the body concerned we are seeking representation of at least one-third.  The members of that general council controlled the advisory services for many years and own a lot of property.  All their property and authority is being taken from them under this Bill.  In spite of that the Minister can only tell us that at least one representative will be appointed to the new authority.  It is unfair to make such a statement.  The Minister should tell us the number he has in mind.  To give the General Council of Committees of Agriculture one or two representatives on this new authority is an insult to the people who have run the advisory service for many years.  They have been carrying out the educational directive efficiently.  It is not fair that when they are being stripped of all their authority and property the Minister should say they will have at least one representative on the new authority.  Nobody can complain about the way the advisory service has been run by the committees of agriculture and the General Council of Committees of Agriculture consist of representatives of the county committees. The Minister is an ex-member of that general council, as is our spokesman on Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is a reflection on the general council to give them only one or two representatives on the new authority?  Does it not amount to a vote of no confidence in that organisation which has given excellent service down the years?  They should be given eight seats on the new authority.</P>

      <P>When nobody had anything to say on section 42 which concerns the composition of the committees I took it that the Opposition were perfectly happy with the position. The section under discussion is not about the composition; it seeks to give statutory recognition to the General Council of Committees of Agriculture, a body that had not statutory recognition up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the urgency for this Bill especially since we may be making a mistake in relation to it.  I do not recall any other occasion here on which the Committee Stage of a Bill was taken three days in succession thereby denying Deputies the opportunity of studying the Bill's progress.  However, to refer to the section, can the Minister say what is the purpose in giving this body statutory recognition?  Admittedly, we had been seeking such recognition at a time when this body had teeth but that is no longer the position.  Are we not giving statutory recognition but no power?  Perhaps the Minister would tell us the reason for this provision.  I see no point in rushing the Bill through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody is rushing the Bill through.  In relation to the question raised by the Deputy, he should be the last man in the House to ask why the council is being given statutory recognition. This change arises largely from the exhortations of Deputy Callanan while he was chairman of the General Council of Committees of Agriculture. He wanted statutory recognition for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Because we considered that what he was seeking was proper <Col N="298" /> and correct and because we wished to enable the county committees to make these contributions annually to the general council, we decided to propose this change.  It is worth while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Admittedly, we sought a statutory body but having spent two years studying various reports and studying the future of the advisory services we considered that a reconstituted general council with the county committees of agriculture having a composition of public representatives to the extent of 75 per cent would be satisfactory.  The whole idea behind seeking such change was that the reconstituted general council would be the authority but the Bill puts a totally new face on that.  We did not want an authority composed totally of members from the old committees of agriculture.  We recommended a 75/25 per cent composition.  We recommended also that there would be people from the various organisations that have been mentioned here represented also but the point was that the general council would be the authority. Now that body is to be stripped of power or authority.  What advantage is there in giving statutory authority to the council at this stage?</P>

      <P>The section is rather limited but we seem to be going beyond the scope of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section deals with the question of giving statutory authority to the general council and I am questioning the reason for doing this while the council is not to have any power.  I am asking the Minister for an answer to this simple question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are giving them the power to carry out the functions that they perform now.  Deputy Callanan seems to be under a misapprehension because he talks about the composition of the committee although while the section relevant to that question was <Col N="299" /> being debated no objection was raised to the composition proposed.  Everybody seemed to be happy with the situation of a 50/50 representation which is what pertains in Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out no later than last evening why I was not happy with a 50/50 representation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not fair for the Minister to say that nobody raised any objections in so far as the composition is concerned.  I am surprised to hear him say that because we were clear as to what we wanted&mdash;a 75/25 per cent representation.  When the Minister finds himself in a position of having to deal with appeals and programmes, some of which may be very elaborate, he may be very sorry for not leaving a majority public representation on local committees. Indeed, my reference to the composition of the committee is referred to in this morning's papers so it is not correct for the Minister to say that everybody is satisfied in this regard.</P>

On many occasions at Question Time one question has been given as long as a quarter of an hour but very often when I attempt to ask even a second supplementary I am told to resume my seat.  While I accept your ruling, I would like to express the view that continuously you are not fair to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely attempting to answer an incorrect statement made by the Minister.  No doubt there will be amendments tabled for Report Stage in so far as this section is concerned. Is the Minister prepared to say what power is being conferred on the committees by this provision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Callanan has become so agitated about what I said.  I said that section 42 deals with the composition of the committees and that no Deputy raised any question under that section in relation to the composition.  Admittedly, certain views were expressed at other times during the course of the Committee Stage debate so far and when it was not correct to have raised that matter but there was no objection on the appropriate section.  That is simply what I said.  I am aware that there were views but they were not expressed at the correct time.  This is simply giving statutory recognition to the council to carry on the functions it has been carrying on up to the present but it was not a statutory body and it is giving a guarantee of at least one member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was so much talk here at the time that section 42 was through before I realised it.  The amplification is so bad that we cannot hear.  I hope there will be more about this on Report Stage.  The Minister has not answered the question about the authority of this statutory body, which does not seem to have any power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was as a result of Deputy Callanan's pleading, as chairman of the general council, that I made it a statutory body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must know and see that he is depriving the committees of agriculture under section 42 of certain power that they had up to now and will not have any more.  From these weakened committees of agriculture with no real power a general council will be formed which must take on the character of the committees which formed it and because it is formed of helpless, powerless, impotent components the general council itself will be equally impotent.  The Minister knows that. <Col N="302" /> This is a piece of window-dressing and it will be identified as such.  There is an alternative.  If there is to be a committee of agriculture at all, it must be of some use.  I told the Minister yesterday how such a committee might be formed; it is neither difficult nor impossible and it could be truly representative of the industry.  It seems to me that the Minister is shutting his eyes to any such possibility and I would urge him to reconsider.  A window-dressing general council is no good to anybody, to the Minister or to the industry.  We can have a worth-while committee and general council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel compelled to say that Deputy Gibbons, while he was Minister for Agriculture, had an opportunity of putting all these ideas into practice but he did not.  He did not set out to improve the committees. Where an opportunity exists for doing that, as in the case of Limerick, 18 out of 21 are Fianna Fáil people, elected and non-elected.  I do not think that indicates anxiety or concern for improving committees of agriculture.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>At least they are public representatives and they are elected by the people.  This is the important issue and the Minister proposes to select people to both the general council and the county committees.  Such nominees are not answerable to the people; they are political hacks of his own party.  This is not the composition of the general council of the committees of agriculture.  He talks about the situation in Galway and Limerick. What the Minister is suggesting is far worse because these nominees are answerable to nobody.  They are selected to the general council at the whim of the political head of the department which is, for the time being, Deputy Clinton.  What he is saying sounds very hollow indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated here yesterday, section 43 is taking away power from the elected representatives.  This is certainly a sorry day for democracy and I am saddened that the Minister would be party to this.  He is suggesting that <Col N="303" /> this section will remedy the situation but, in fact, it will have the reverse effect.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any valid reason for the inclusion of section 43 (b).  I cannot see what the Minister has in mind.  Section 43 (b) states:</P>
    <P>in the event of that Council ceasing to exist, any association or body that may subsequently be formed which, in the opinion of the Minister, has similar aims and functions.</P>
    <P>This refers only to the opinion of the Minister and not to the opinion of the elected representatives or of the farming organisations.  In other words, if the Minister feels that a body can, in his opinion, properly represent the 27 county committees of agriculture at national level, then he will give them the statutory power.  This is a ridiculous section.  It ill becomes the Minister to have it included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition do not seem to know what they want here because one speaker says he wants statutory recognition while the next speaker says he does not want it, that it is ridiculous and that this section should not be there at all.  Deputy Noonan talks of being saddened by the fact that I am selecting the members of the general council.  I am selecting nobody. The general council will be selected by the committees of agriculture.  If the Deputy is saddened by one thing, I am saddened by another and it is that an ex-president of Macra na Feirme, a farming organisation that has a responsibility to look after agricultural education, should state that they should not be entitled to representation as of right on the committees of agriculture. I think that is a terrible thing for the Deputy to say.  I believe we are doing the correct thing in giving representation to the rural organisations on the county committees.  If there is anxiety and concern as they say about imbalance, it was not raised when we were on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is twisting my words.  I never said that either Macra na Feirme or any other rural organisation should not have <Col N="304" /> representation on the county committees of agriculture and if the Ministers checks the record he will see that I did not say that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister was listening to what I was saying, he would know that.  We are merely suggesting here that as regards county committees of agriculture public representatives should have the controlling voice.  This is what we are saying. The Minister should listen to this.  Of course, rural and farming and educational-farming organisations should have representation on the county committees.  We have always advocated that.  If the Minister was listening to Deputy Gibbons the Deputy said that these bodies should have representation on the county committees.  He has also made a valid suggestion as to how the county committees should be constituted.  I was speaking on paragraph (b) of section 43 and I cannot see the point in having included: &ldquo;which, in the opinion of the Minister...&rdquo;  This is what I stated.  The Minister was not listening to what I was saying and twisted my words.  He should be quite straight and answer the points put to him and not evade the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to give the maximum information to the House. I remind Deputy Noonan that the general council is a voluntary body, set up and supported by county committees of agriculture.  They may decide at some stage that they do not want that sort of body.  We cannot rule that out.  If they decide they want some other sort of body we would like to be able to continue the representation.  If there is objection to that, I do not agree with the objection. That is all I am saying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we made it quite clear that was not our case at all.  It is not creditable that people would want to destroy their only source of representation on the authority. I do not think the subsection is <Col N="305" /> needed at all.  Why should they cease to exist?  I am sorry the Minister lowered himself so as to misrepresent the people on this side of the House. In our recommendation to the general council we recommended 75/25 of rural organisations and we did not, neither I nor anybody else, say that rural organisations should not be on the county committees or should not be represented, if they want to be, directly on this council.  There is a board of 24 and we are only asking for eight out of that.  Everything was taken away from the authority.  What does the Minister think would happen to the general council?  Why should people want to destroy it?  I do not know unless there is a sort of trend to destroy everything at present.  Why should they destroy their only possible means of getting representation on the authority?  We are told the section is there in case some other kind of set-up was put there that would satisfy the Minister doing the same type of job.  Why should that provision be there?</P>

      <P>This provision could be left out and I do not think the Bill would be greatly disimproved but the general council is a voluntary body set up by the decision and with the support of the 27 county committees.  They might decide that some other form of executive organisation would represent them better.  The present thinking is that they will continue as they are; that is Deputy Callanan's thinking and mine, but if they want to change the type of organisation that would head the county committees they are free to do it now and still be represented.  That is all that is being said here.  It will only weaken their position if I take out the provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the annual estimates for the new authority.  I suggest that since the three separate functions of the new authority are separately spelled out in the title of the authority&mdash;educational, advisory and research&mdash;each of the three functions would be better served if the annual estimates were set out under these three heads and a separate estimate made for each of the three functions, an estimate for research, an estimate for education and an estimate for the advisory service.  If this is not done, there will be an inevitable erosion of the functions of one or other of the three by the other two or by the excessive development of one at the expense of the other two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My suggestion would preserve the the integrity of each of the functions of the authority without interfering in any way with the integration the Minister is so keen on getting and of which I disapprove so thoroughly. There should be separate budgets for each of the three functions.  If this <Col N="307" /> is not done, some or all of the functions of the authority will be damaged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal way for the new authority to arrive at an overall estimate would be to have separate estimates of the money required to carry on the various functions and that is how they would arrive at an aggregate.  This Bill states that the board shall prepare, in respect of each financial year, an estimate in such form as the Minister may require. If, in the course of working, it is seen that one sector appears to be neglected and is not getting a fair share of expenditure, then the Minister may see that that is not sufficient and he may require the board to prepare their estimates on the basis of separate calculations for the various sectors.  It should be left to the board to decide how they arrive at their estimates.  If they are seen to be starving any particular sector, the Minister has the power to direct them to prepare their estimates and to ensure that this does not happen.</P>
      <P>This could make for very difficult accounting if it was to be as watertight as Deputy Gibbons wishes it to be.  There could be no interchange of personnel and duties between one group and another.  We want to integrate these groups to provide services for agriculture.  If we continue to isolate them, we will be defeating the object of bringing them together.  That is my objection to accepting Deputy Gibbons's recommendation.</P>

      <P>In my opinion the Minister seems to be contradicting statements he made in this House yesterday and Tuesday.  He was allowing the authority certain responsibilities but now he is involving himself in the day-to-day running of the authority.  He will now have to convey his approval and may amend the estimates if he considers it necessary. If he is selecting a board to run the different sectors, he should give them a free hand.  He should not have to come here and say that certain sectors either research or advisory, should be provided with more finance.  If the board are made up of men of a <Col N="308" /> certain calibre, as the Minister said previously, they should be in a position to decide what is best and the Minister should not have to put his finger in the pie.</P>

      <P>There seems to be a good deal of confusion about this.  I was asked yesterday if anything could be done if the authority found midway through the year that they had not made provision for something which they preferred to substitute for something they were doing.  I said that that was provided for in the Bill, and it is provided for here.  Are we objecting to this?  This, in my view, is flexibility. On the other hand, I am being told that I should not interfere if the board are not doing their job.  I was told yesterday that the sort of board being set up would not do their job.  How are we to ensure functioning if nobody has authority to say that one sector which needs support and more help is being starved?  The Minister is suspect all the way.  I wonder if a Fianna Fáil Minister were here would he be as suspect? Of course he would not.</P>

What I said was that the county committees would prepare these programmes for the educational and advisory work in the committees and that would go to the board and the board would, I assume, then look very hard at them and would accept as much of them as it was possible to accept before they would finalise the programmes they would eventually bring to the Minister when they are looking for money.</P>

The county committee may draw up a very elaborate educational programme and there may be an outcry that too much money is going to research.  None goes at the moment to research.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The part of this section that gives rise to grave disquiet is subsection (3) where reference is made to the maintenance in real terms of the Oireachtas contribution to the authority.  It states that the grant will not be less in real terms than the total amount provided in the financial year preceding the date of establishment of the authority.</P>
      <P>The doctrine propounded by the Minister is one of despair; it is one that is content with the insufficient advisory services we have at the moment. The drafting of this Bill was hamhanded and insensitive.  The dominant purpose was not the provision of better advisory and research services. If it were intended to improve the situation, one would have to envisage improvement of the provision of field staff.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) is serving notice on every young graduate that he had better get out of Ireland as fast as he can.  It is serving notice on young students in the agricultural faculties in universities that there is no use in expecting jobs in the new service.  It is being provided for in law that the minimum will become the maximum, that there will be no progress.  The only guarantee the Minister will give is that in real terms the monetary provision from the Oireachtas will be no worse than it was before the introduction of the scheme.  That is hopelessly unimaginative and it makes clear the sorry fact that the real purpose of this Bill has little to do with the advisory services.  In fact, it may be an economy measure because lurking here and there throughout the Bill are the hands of the Ministers for the Public Service, for Finance and for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should delete this section and replace it with a section that will guarantee a progressive increase in the provision by the Oireachtas for the authority.  With conditions of work improving year by year, as inevitably they must do, the amount of advisory and research work that will be done will diminish in spite of this <Col N="314" /> subsection.  Subsection (3) reveals the despair of the Minister in having expanding advisory and research services. If that were not so, it would not be necessary to include the subsection. On the contrary, it would be desirable to give a guarantee in the Bill that there would be an annual expansion of the services.  If this is not done, young people in the agricultural faculties need not hope for jobs in the Irish service, especially as it will be administered by the board proposed by the Minister.  The section should be condemned out of hand for that reason.</P>

It is a unique provision in legislation in that no such undertaking has ever before been given in any measure brought before the House.  In all the consultations we had with the various agencies that are coming together in this integrated service it was found that they all wanted this. They sought this and they fought hard to get it but the Deputy now tells us it should be thrown out.</P>

      <P>All the agencies sought and looked for this because they considered it was a guarantee that at least they would have in real terms as much money in the future as they have had in the past.  They have been given that guarantee in this section, a guarantee never given before in the history of the State.

      <P>That old chestnut is no good.  The Minister is obviously out of touch.  Most of the time of the advisory officers nowadays is taken up with the farm modernisation scheme. The amount of actual advisory work is considerably less than it was before we entered the EEC.  The quality of the work being done now has suffered because the Minister has failed to provide adequate staff.  He trots out the old ridiculous statistic about there being more graduates in Ireland than anywhere else.  This is playing around with figures.  There is no country in the European Community with such a great dependence on agriculture as Ireland.  In the British context the percentage of farmers in proportion to the total population is 2.3.  Ours is still about 26 per cent, more than ten times as much.  In Luxembourg there are 3,000 farmers and a half dozen graduates would probably serve the lot of them.  Their total population is about 600,000.</P>
      <P>It would have been better if the Minister did not put in that section at all.  He is really saying that the authority will not grow.  He says that it will not shrink but he cannot promise that.  It will shrink because of the spreading work load of the existing staff and their incapacity because of the failure of the Minister to provide money to take on new staff.  The Minister might as well say to the young men leaving the colleges that there is no future for them in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Minister hopes to improve the whole spectrum of the agricultural sector under this Bill but I am sure he realises the amount of applications that have been sent to him even for clerical assistance for advisers. They are bogged down in paper work at the moment under Directive 159, the farm modernisation scheme.  There are only 4 per cent development farmers in my area but their plans are not being serviced.  If a farmer wants to get a grant, no matter what size his farm is, he has to get it through the farm modernisation scheme.  He must be put into a class.  The advisers are unable to look after those schemes at the moment.  They may be able to give some small service to the plans <Col N="316" /> of development farmers in my area because they are so small.  A number of farmers, who are not development farmers, who hope to come up the ladder and are providing buildings, have produced plans and would like to have them serviced and get help from the advisers but they cannot get this.  The advisers have not got the time to do this because they cannot get clerical assistance.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say that we have a lot of advisers but they are bogged down in paper work at the moment. They have got a degree to enable them to do field work but they are prevented from doing this because they have no clerical assistance.  I hope that clerical assistance will be provided for those people so that they will not have to do work which they are not paid to do and which well qualified clerk-typists could do.  We have applied for clerical assistance but we have been refused. I know there is a guarantee in the Bill that we will get what we were getting but everybody knows that what we are getting at the moment is not adequate and is not in line with inflation.  In our area we provided offices and asked for secretarial assistance but we were refused. If we are to put up a scheme for education I hope that that will be part of it so that the advisers can go out and do field work.  There are transitional farmers, who are anxious to work to a plan, who need help at the moment.  The few development farmers who are working to a plan complain that their plans are not being serviced because the advisers are otherwise occupied.  The Minister should ensure that we will not be dependent on the same amount in real terms.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my voice to what Deputy Callanan said.  Does the Minister realise that there is no allowance made in the advisory services at the moment for sanction for any additional staff?  Any counties which have progressive farmers are very slow in providing grants at present.  There are delays of up to six and seven months.  I believe the Minister has not taken into consideration the conditions in every county.  He did not allow any additional staff to <Col N="317" /> counties which have a large number of applications.</P>
      <P>There are delays in the committees of agriculture and the farm development service which are frustrating young farmers.  I know of a farmer who secured an ACC loan to erect a large piggery but he cannot get the officers out to examine the site and advise him on his project.  Money should be provided in such cases to help those farmers who are willing to develop.  We believe, with the introduction of the farm modernisation scheme, additional staff and money would have been provided especially in the counties that wanted to develop.</P>

      <P>Many things have been said which are not correct and I would like to put the record straight.  When I came into office there was a backlog at least twice the size of what is there today.  The backlog for which the county committees' staff are responsible is very short.  It is practically non-existent. They are up to date in most of the counties.  There is some difficulty in the farm development service because we cannot train people to work in the farm development service over-night.</P>
      <P>The difficulty is principally in the farm building sector.  The previous situation was that we had more land reclamation and fewer farm buildings. That situation, with two exceedingly dry years, has changed and the people involved in land reclamation are reluctant to go over to farm buildings, even though they were employed to do both jobs and some of them were trained in both jobs.  I admit that difficulty is there.  New recruits cannot be trained overnight to do this type of work.  I believe that the quality of the service being given by the county committees' staff has improved enormously as a result of their involvement in the EEC schemes and in Directive 159.  They are now being asked at least to stand up and prove that their advice is the correct advice.  They are being asked to plan a farm business and produce a farm plan, admittedly in a very small number of cases.  My great regret is that we are not able to qualify far more people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Callanan spoke about the <Col N="318" /> position in Galway where 3 per cent are qualifying and where 3 per cent only are being planned.  The difficulties confronting advisers in Galway are exaggerated because they have to plan only 3 per cent.  Deputy Callanan was less than factual when he said that they got no extra staff.  I am assured that they have got two extra clerical staff for this work.  Perhaps Deputy Callanan is not aware of that.  It is not an enormous number but the extra load placed on those advisory people in Galway is not enormous either.  The type of work they are doing now is real advisory work; they are going out and being asked to draw up a farm plan or decide whether or not it is necessary to do so.  The advisory service has improved enormously as a result of the EEC schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>

It is somewhat of a surprise to me to learn that there were two people appointed in Galway because we have been seeking them in the district offices.  We have offices all over the county for our staff and we have no clerical assistants in those offices.</P>

That is why we sought clerical assistants in the offices all over the county.  We have <Col N="319" /> a very good structure which, if properly run, could provide a very good service for farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was less than factual in his statement a few minutes ago with regard to the hold-up in the farm development service.  In so far as the farm modernisation scheme is concerned, and more particularly the staff attached to the farm development service, the Minister knows very well that at different times during the year such staff are taken from their work and put doing other types of work in different parts of the country.  I am speaking particularly about the disadvantaged areas and the grants being given there.  I know that staff in Limerick have been taken away for months from their work simply because the Minister refused to sanction the appointment of extra staff to attend to those duties.</P>
      <P>I want to revert to the section itself in so far as it deals with staffing and also the question raised by Deputy Gibbons.  Not alone is the Minister not sanctioning the appointment of extra instructors to the county committees of agriculture but there have been redundancies, and more are threatened, amongst existing agricultural advisers in the county committees.  I wonder does the Minister realise the serious situation that has developed in that respect.  Yet the Minister will give us no guarantee that there will be any increase in staffing; all he will say is that there will be no deterioration.  That is not good enough.  Under the farm modernisation scheme and the various EEC directives instructors are doing very fine work in so far as farmers are now developing a plan and working towards such.  But the Minister has refused consistently to allow the county committees increase their staff.  Not alone has he refused sanction for extra staff but he has also refused sanction for the reappointment of existing staff attached to them.  In my opinion that represents a retrograde step.</P>

Mention was made also of clerical assistants in the county committees and their grading system.  It is a stupid system under which there is no chance of promotion unless a staff member is over 55.  The Minister should examine this grading system.</P>
      <P>In regard to subsection (1) (b) I should like to ask the Minister does this grant include that now being paid to An Foras Talúntais and also the contributions to all the county committees of agriculture by the Department of Agriculture?</P>

      <P>The Minister, when replying to Deputy Callanan and myself, said that they had encountered a problem in regard to special training for land reclamation and farm buildings.  In counties in which a very small area is classified as handicapped the Minister shifted personnel to other counties to do a job which did not require specialised training, such as that of checking herds and tags and which any junior member of the staff of the agricultural division could undertake.  The Minister appears also to place most emphasis on development farmers while the people about whom we are concerned are not the 3 per cent&mdash;about whom he spoke&mdash;but the other 97 per cent whom we hope one day will reach development status.  We are concerned that those people receive attention, advice and aid.</P>

      <P>This section is related to the previous one under which we have been discussing the real meaning of the words &ldquo;real terms&rdquo;.  The Minister will recall that in the previous section this morning I tried to get him to accept the agreement that would provide for separate budgeting for education, advisory and research in order that no one of the three services would be eroded.  I am asking again if the Minister could see his way to give a guarantee that the provision for research would in no way diminish in real terms. Since the Minister is using this as a sheet anchor to prevent this thing from slipping under the waves altogether, we will take him at his word and ask whether he will provide that sheet anchor for agriculture and research as he has provided it in section 48 for the services generally?</P>

      <P>We covered this adequately under the previous section where we were dealing with the maintenance of the real terms value of the present provision and the present provision is over £18 million <Col N="322" /> in the present year and that is not a small sum of money.  Section 49 (d) mentions:</P>
      <P>(d)  the cost of grants to defray the cost of specific programmes of agricultural research or basic veterinary research, specific agricultural research or basic veterinary research and grants to educational institutions,</P>
      <P>I do not know why Opposition Deputies get the impression that anybody wants to curtail the amount of money being provided for research as distinct from the amount of money being provided for education or advisory services.  They are all part of a service for agriculture and any Minister should be as concerned about research as he is about the other services.  I would expect that any responsible board would ensure that an adequate amount of their finances was preserved for the research that is so important to the industry.  I am assured that this is the only legislation that has ever gone through this House that has given any guarantee about moneys to be provided for the future.</P>

I view with some concern the passage of that trial institution which has given such universal satisfaction under its present management into the hands of the board of governors whom we do not know but whose identity we would worry a great deal about.  As the Deputy representing that constituency, I wonder whether the interests of that educational establishment and the students attending it would be best served by passing it over into the legal ownership of this new body whose credentials I am not at all happy about.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned at the new arrangements in relation to staff, particularly where they apply to research staff.  Research staff would be <Col N="328" /> required to be at certain places for long periods.  Take Dr. Michael Walsh and the work he did at Moore Park.  That work went on over a number of years until Dr. Walsh went to other employment.  The nature of the set-up at that time permitted his presence on the Moore Park project for a long period.  His work was recognised by the dairying industry generally, not only in Ireland but in Europe.  Of course he was an outstanding man.  He was able to work in a proper environment, he had total fixity of tenure and could stay there to supervise his work.</P>
      <P>There are other examples of equally distinguished men carrying out similar work, like the people engaged in the sheep breeding project at Creagh in Mayo, like the work at Belclare in County Galway, the machinery centre in Carlow&mdash;all work carried out by members of the institute staff.  Under the provisions of this Bill men like those, engaged in long-term work, conceivably could be shuttled from place to place by the civil service or by the Minister himself to do totally different work.  Such men, as well as needing a proper environment for long-term projects, would need to make domestic arrangements in the parts of the country where their work occurs.  In this section there is provision whereby they could be shuttled about from place to place at the whim of the new authority.</P>
      <P>This also applies to people in the advisory and educational fields.  For instance, Dr. Spain in his time gave remarkably distinguished service in the advisory service, and the fact that he remained within the service in another capacity is purely fortuitous. He might have been taken away from the work in which he was specialising, to his own detriment and to the detriment of his work.  The danger of this insensitive manipulation of staff is expanded and increased in this section. I would prefer to see the section amended, but failing that, I would like to have the very definite assurance of the Minister put on record that in no case will members of the staff of the new authority be shuttled about as if they were counters on a chess board.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Gibbons rightly pointed out, subsection (4) can have very serious consequences for the staff.  The Minister must give certain guarantees to the existing staffs.  I would also hope that, in regard to the county committees of agriculture, the existing right of instructors to remain in a county will be maintained under this Bill and that they will not be liable to transfer in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to what Deputy Noonan has said.  Heretofore labour relations in the county committees of agriculture have been very good, and I would hope the Minister would allay any fears the staff might have regarding their future working conditions and promotional opportunities.  I would also hope there would not be wholesale switching of staff from county to county.  Many of those agricultural instructors have built up a very good working relationship with farmers, and some farmers are almost totally dependent on them for guidance.  I hope those happy relationships will be allowed to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a note here which tells me that the text of this subsection has been taken from subsection (4) of section 43 of the Agriculture Act, 1931, which applied similiar conditions to the staff then transferred from the committees which operated under the old Agriculture and Technical Instruction Act, 1899.  Furthermore, similiar conditions are written into the conditions of service of the staff appointed since the 1931 Act became law. In addition, officers transferred under this subsection by the new authority will no doubt be eligible for the payments available in the civil service in relation to transfer of headquarters. It is also stated that there will be need, and indeed ample time provided, for discussions between the Department and staff associations on acceptable transfer arrangements. When one looks at the transfers that have occurred over the years one finds that unless transfers were absolutely essential and desirable in every way they were not made.  They were transfers, in the main, for the good <Col N="330" /> of the service.  The Department of Agriculture certainly have not been unmindful of the difficulties that were being created for staff that had been transferred, but there must be power to move staff around.  If this power did not exist, proper use could not be made of the available manpower in the service as a whole.  That power is there already.</P>
      <P>If somebody is looking for a guarantee that nobody at any time in the future as long as he lives will be moved from his present position to another position, I could not give such a guarantee.  However, I would be astonished if the attitude of a new board was to kick everybody around from one part of the country to another, when a person who knows a particular area and knows the people there is likely to be able to provide a better service for those people than a newcomer for some considerable time.  I am sure any sensible administration or board will bear that in mind and be very concerned about it.  But I could not give a specific guarantee that Mr. X would never be moved from a particular position, because I do not think the service could work on that basis, and we should not look for that kind of assurance.  No one has a guarantee that he will remain forever where he happens to be as of now, but his conditions will not be worsened.  If it is absolutely necessary to transfer staff, there is compensation, which is recognised and provided for already in the civil service, to deal with that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not allayed my fears on the question I put to him.  The difference is that heretofore instructors were employed by the county committees and had the right to remain in that county if they so desired.  The situation now is that the function of the committees to employ staff is being taken from them, and the instructors will now be the employees of this new board which is being set up by the Minister and about which we know nothing. Notwithstanding what the Minister says about the 1931 Act, I understand that the existing instructors <Col N="331" /> have the right to remain in the county.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's statement that he cannot give a guarantee, but the situation could arise where there would be a board who would kick these men around as they pleased, and this is something I would like to see prevented. If an instructor wants to continue his work in an area within the same county, he should have this right. This brings us back to the question of promotional openings for a man in his own work without his having to go into another type of work, but I do not intend to go into that now.  I would like the Minister to give this guarantee in regard to staff.  Prior to this the staff were employed by the county committees but the power of those committees is now being taken over by this new authority.  As a result, the staff will be employees of the new authority.  Many of those people have expressed fears about their future.  They do not know what will happen.  What the Minister has told the House up to now in relation to this matter has not satisfied me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is relevant to the point raised by Deputy Noonan.  I do not know what type of guarantee the Minister can give the advisers.  While employed by county committees such instructors felt secure and they had the option to apply for posts outside the county where they <Col N="332" /> were working.  However, some of the staff feel that the new authority will make a lot of changes and those changes might not be in their interest or that of the farming community.  I cannot suggest what should be written into the Bill in regard to this but I am anxious to make the Minister aware of the anxiety of some of the staff of county committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 69 provides additional security over and above what is already provided in the Bill. It deals with the courses open to a person who is transferred to ensure he gets fair play.  It also outlines the manner of appeal.  I can give a positive guarantee that nobody, under any circumstances, will be moved from where he is at present.  The functioning of the organisation would be impaired if such a guarantee were to be given in the future.  The staff of the new authority are well safeguarded under the Bill and that is the way I want it.  They carry their rights with them.  If there is to be a disturbance, I hope it will be minimal and that the board will be as concerned about the new employees as the previous employers were in seeing that nobody is wronged because, for example, somebody did not like the colour of their eyes.  I do not wish to comment on specific cases that occurred in the past because where human beings are involved one will always get the odd case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the security of the existing staff, the Minister has not given us an adequate assurance on this question.  Existing instructors employed by county committees have rights to remain in the county where they are employed but if the functions of the county committees are being taken over by the new authority the existing staff automatically have new employers.  The Bill should contain a provision giving the instructors the same right to remain in a county.  We realise the provisions in the Bill but they do not substitute for the lack of the privilege instructors have had up to now.  Existing staff should continue to have the right to remain in a county.  The new committees will not have the power to recruit staff.  This task will be carried out by the authority.  My concern is for the existing staff.  I am anxious to ensure that they will continue to enjoy the rights which are theirs now but which the Minister is not prepared to give them in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to provide for this right.  It would be wrong to do so.  I think the service will work better without such provision. We can all foresee the possibility of the breaching of county boundaries by some of the people in the service.  It is necessary and desirable that there would be such development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a need for specialists and it would be totally wrong to tie them on a county basis or, indeed, tie them to one whole county instead of, say, to parts of two counties.  They could be situated more conveniently so that they could be used in that way.  What the Deputy is suggesting is that we do not change <Col N="334" /> anything because people are apprehensive about change although the change concerned might be much more beneficial for them and might provide more scope for promotion than is available now.  One of the faults of the present service is that it is encompassed in units that are too small with the result that people cannot get the sort of promotion to which they are entitled.</P>

      <P>In regard to the question of specialists, I think the Minister will agree that these people should be employed on the basis of being available to two or three counties especially in cases where there would not be sufficient work for them in the county in which they were based.  However, the number of specialists at present is small so we will need an increase in that area. As has been said, there has always been provision for transfer of staff but we are concerned lest an element of compunction be introduced into this area with the result that, for example, a person could be transferred against his wishes from Galway to Kildare or <i>vice versa</i>.  It is not relevant in this context for the Minister to quote a section of the existing Act because that deals with a different situation, a situation in which the county was the boundary so that there was no authority to transfer people compulsorily from one county to another.  We are talking here of an authority that will be controlling the Twenty-six Counties.  I accept that common sense will prevail but the point is that they will have the right to transfer staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 57 to 61, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  This Act does not apply to&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  dismissals of employees engaged under a contract of employment for a fixed term or for a specified purpose (being a purpose <Col N="339" /> of such a kind that the duration of the contract was limited but was, at the time of its making, incapable of precise ascertainment) where the dismissals occurred only because of the expiry of the term or the cesser of the purpose,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is in accordance with the exceptions permitted in the directive on collective redundancies.  It was represented during the drafting of paragraph (a) that there could be uncertainty in relation to the application of the Bill to some groups such as building operatives, short-term employees, seasonal workers.  We discussed that on Committee Stage and I consider that this new formula here will bring increased clarity to the provision.  It would be impossible to get a single formula which would meet all the diverse interests involved here, all categories of employers, but I am satisfied that this is the best formula we can devise to cater for the varying cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to this amendment.  I raised the question on Committee Stage and I believe that this formula is certainly an improvement on the original paragraph in section 7.  This is an area in which we have seen many difficulties.  The Minister has referred to the building operative situation and the building contract of specified duration.  Our experience has been that nobody can be very sure of the duration of some major contracts. For example, we have seen a statement this morning by the chief executive of one of our very progressive State companies regarding the present situation at a Cork site. There are difficulties here and, obviously, the time schedule of this contract will be lengthened rather than shortened.  Of course, work may be ahead of schedule in some contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment does improve the wording because there was certainly much concern in areas of the building and construction industry, especially in regard to the difficulty about fixed-time contracts.  I have no complaints about this amendment.  It will be one of the areas where difficulties <Col N="340" /> will be encountered as this Bill is seen in operation.  I agree with the Minister that it is difficult to get a completely acceptable formula or set of words to meet the difficult situations which can be encountered in this area from time to time.  By and large, the amendment is an improvement and the fact that we discussed it on Committee Stage possibly helped to get this rewording.  There will need to be a certain amount of flexibility in the operation of the Bill.  There could be difficulties because of the uncertain period that has to be attached to many contracts.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to seasonal work.  I am somewhat concerned about the position of seasonal workers in all the legislation before us.  I did refer to this in the Unfair Dismissals Bill, 1976.  In the sugar beet sector the same seasonal workers are employed year after year for specified periods and are then laid off. There will be difficulties here under the Bill for people in that situation, though the main concern is the fixed-term contract for a period of a year or two years or whatever the time might be.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment and the Bill is improved as a result of its introduction.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, lines 38 and 39, to delete &ldquo;trade union or staff association officials (including shop stewards)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;employees' representatives&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make it quite clear that the proposed consultations required under this section should take place with employees' representatives as defined in section 2.  The latter definition indicates that the term means officials of the trade union or staff association with which it has been the practice of the employer to conduct collective bargaining negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="341" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment indicates a lack of consistency by the Minister in this legislation.  The point he is making is one I have been making all the time.  We are dealing here not with any bodies of people either on the employer or trade union side but with people working with business or industry whose jobs, conditions of work and opportunities may be affected.  This is the most important aspect of legislation affecting these people.  The term &ldquo;employees' representatives&rdquo; signifies to me that in the case of redundancy or forthcoming redundancy the spokesman or representatives of the group of employees concerned will be the people to be consulted, and rightly so, whether they are union or non-union and we must remember that they are entitled to that under the Constitution if they so wish.</P>
      <P>This seems to be a turn-around by the Minister.  I refer to the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Bill, 1976.  I was rather amazed to read an article recently in a weekly magazine where the Minister, to a large extent, and I, to a lesser extent, were criticised. We were the targets of attack because of certain provisions in that Bill which were introduced by the Minister and not criticised by me, although the journalist did quote from my Second Stage speech, this being the only contribution he made in the article.  He referred to the danger of a closed shop situation. I appealed to the Minister in that Bill to open it to the employees of the company rather than to the staff association or trade unions.  Of course, they are entitled in all this legislation to act as spokesmen or representatives of the employees but the people mainly concerned are the employees themselves. During the past two or three years we have seen many cases of hardship, loss of morale and disappointment when firms have closed down and the employees were at a time of life when their opportunities for re-employment were slight.  In that situation it is important that we as legislators have first regard for the people whose lives and conditions are changed as a result of closure and redundancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our first priority is the people who are likely to suffer in the circumstances <Col N="342" /> whoever their representatives are.  That is of less importance than the employees who are the real sufferers.  I am not quite clear why the Minister introduced employees' representatives in the Bill, nor has he explained it in proposing the amendment, but my party and I believe that the employees' representatives are the people to be concerned.  Why there has not been consistency in all this legislation as regards the people rightly concerned who are strong enough to have their own representative whether in a staff association, a trade union or even in neither, I do not know.  It is not the staff association or the trade union officials who will suffer in a redundancy situation; it is the individual or group of individuals who lose their jobs.  I do not intend to oppose what I consider an improvement in the Bill, the introduction of employees' representatives. That is what we are talking about.  We are mainly concerned about the people who can lose in that situation, the employees, and I believe their representatives are the people who should be first consulted since they represent those who are concerned for their own and their families' welfare. To me, this represents a change of heart or a change of face by the Minister in regard to this entire package of social legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 13 provides that within 21 days of the original notification to me of proposed collective redundancies an employer should furnish me with a <Col N="343" /> written report of the progress of negotiation with the employees' representatives. This requirement can be dispensed with as I can elicit all necessary information under section 16 under which I can request an employer to enter into consultations with me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rarely that an employer gets a concession under this package of social legislation.  I have often said that employers have been regarded by this Government as people to be attacked, controlled, restricted and taxed and people to keep records.  The approach of the Government has been one of suspicion regarding any employer.  Concern is being expressed by both sides of industry, by employers and trade unions, that all this legislation taken together could be harmful to employment at a time when unemployment figures are continuing to rise with little improvement being seen and little progress towards the fulfilment of the forecasts of the Minister and his colleagues earlier this year.  Admittedly, here we are talking of employers employing more than 20 people, but even an employer who has 30 or 40 workers is still a very small employer and the amount of extra administration, record keeping and communication being placed on him by all this legislation&mdash;I am speaking from experience&mdash;is inclined to be a deterrent against employment at present.  I do not say the fears are justified; I do not think they are, but I believe there is genuine fear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have the Minister conceding that at least this section is superfluous, was over-taxing employers and was not required because of the powers available under section 16 and particularly since the Minister would already have been notified of redundancies. We are dealing with this measure more than two years since the European Directive was signed by the Minister for Finance and these years have seen many redundancies. This Bill is not designed to prevent redundancies; all it means is that there are now certain stipulations as regards notification and consultation and so on, and there can be no objection to <Col N="344" /> the deletion of this section.  An impression may be created that the Bill will prevent redundancies.  In no way can it do that.</P>
    <P>No employer large or small is anxious to make people redundant. They would prefer to see expansion rather than reduction of employment. One of the things that undoubtedly helped us has been the enthusiasm, the enterprise and ambition of many people in the private sector.  We know the slogan of many Labour Party Members of the Government side, particularly backbenchers, who have now adopted a sort of double role by criticising&mdash;this can be said particularly of the former party general secretary&mdash;private enterprise.  He has been most critical of private enterprise. Private enterprise has contributed handsomely to employment, and it could have contributed far more if the Government had adopted a responsible approach to redundancy at a time when redundancy was at its height.  Let us hope, for the sake of industry and the workers, the young people especially, that the redundancy trend is falling rather than rising.  We have had far too many redundancies already.  I have always said that legislation should be as simple as possible to operate for the individuals affected, in this case the employee and the employer.  If the Minister feels this section is superfluous, in my view its deletion will not be harmful.  The consequential amendment is acceptable.</P>

      <P>I would not agree that any of the proposals under this Bill can be seen in any sense as antimanagement. All these measures have been designed to provide a more constructive legal framework between both sides in industry, management and unions.  It is obvious that for our prosperity and for the recovery of the economy a more constructive relationship should be developed between both sides in industry, and I see the legal framework under this legislation as adding to that development.</P>

      <P>It is imperative that the Opposition spokesman for employment should offer a final comment before this Bill goes to the Seanad.  Under this Bill both sides will have to take certain steps in the event of forthcoming redundancies.  It would be an ideal situation if this Bill were never used.  I believe the Government, who are now beginning to have a rethink about this, recognise the economic advantage of sustaining industries either by direct participation or by meaningful assistance to prevent redundancies.</P>
      <P>Before this legislation was introduced people in every city, town and village had traumatic experiences.  Earlier this week the Minister gave figures in answer to a question which indicated the harm that might have been done by the long delay in introducing this legislation. Immediate steps should be taken by the Department of Industry and Commerce or the Department of Finance in an effort to prevent redundancies taking place or to assist an industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to quote the figures the Minister gave me earlier this week.  They frightened me and should frighten any person concerned about this situation. I asked the Minister to tell me the total amounts of redundancy payments in the Cork area paid out of the redundancy fund.  If the figures for the Cork area are indicative of the trend throughout the country, one can be very concerned about the lack of Government action.  In 1973 the figure was £218,450; in 1974 it was £327,762; in 1975 it had grown threefold and was £979,180, almost £1 million; in 1976 it was £1,306,143.  In other words, from 1973 to 1976 the amount in Cork increased <Col N="346" /> sixfold.  There is no need for me to say to what better use this money could have been put.  It must be remembered that there was also the resultant payments from social welfare, and this came from the same fund.  Therefore, I believe this Government have created hardship and caused disappointment in many homes.</P>
    <P>Deputies are approached by people who have been made redundant, particularly those in the upper age group who have given long and valued service to a company.  Because they are over 45 years of age or even in their early fifties, they go to many interviews with a tremendous handicap&mdash; there are many younger people looking for the same jobs.  Unfortunately for the working people, the time has come when we have an employers' market and there is little hope that all these people can be accommodated.</P>
    <P>About one year ago approximately 1,100 people all over 40 years were looking for senior management positions. Before Christmas that figure had grown to 1,800.  That figure has dropped back to 1,400.  It must be remembered that that big increase was caused mainly by redundancies.</P>
    <P>The Minister said this Bill was not anti-management.  I never suggested it was.  What I did suggest was that it could have harmful effects and be a possible deterrent, through fear to employers.  I am not talking now about this Bill alone&mdash;because I believe this measure is very important &mdash;but about this package of social legislation which we are enacting at a time in our economic life when employment should be in the forefront.  This legislation will be worthless unless the Government take serious cognisance of any forthcoming possible redundancies notified under the terms of this Bill.  In other words, Departments that can do something to aid an industry on the verge of collapse should subsidise it, because I believe it is far cheaper to subsidise than it is to allow a business to die.  However, what is more important is the disruption in the home and the morale shattering experience for so many good people determined to find work and not content to receive something in lieu.  For the vast majority <Col N="347" /> the soul-shattering experience of redundancy has done harm.</P>
    <P>This Bill can be used, provided the Government have the will, to the advantage of those who might be threatened with redundancy.  I hope we will see no more redundancy, but this Government have failed to take steps even when they have had more than ample notice of the trend of events.  No steps were taken to aid industry, steps that could have been and should have been taken.  Had the proper steps been taken jobs would have been saved.  Fortunately, there has been a change of heart but the experience in the meantime has been a costly one.  I maintain the Government owe an apology to every worker who became redundant since the end of 1974 and an explanation as to why this measure was not introduced earlier in order to save jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  The fact that the provisions of this Bill are being applied now is in one way an indictment of the Government and of the condition of employment generally.  The greatest protection one can give a worker is the knowledge that there are so many jobs available employers are actually looking for workers to do them.  Apparently we are now prepared to accept as the norm an abnormal unemployment situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald is quite right in saying that the image created abroad is that this Government are antiemployer and anti-enterprise.  When one looks at the nations of Europe and sees the high standard of living enjoyed by the communities there, one realises the sorry state in which the economy is here.  Most of these nations are approaching full employment because of their almost total commitment to free enterprise.  Like Deputy Fitzgerald, I deplore the rising numbers in redundancy.  This is an effort by the Government to try to <Col N="348" /> protect what is left of our labour force in employment.  It is not designed to expand employment.  Some of the safeguards would be necessary at any time but the majority are necessary now because of the negative attitude of the Government towards employment over the past few years.</P>
    <P>The economy is slowly grinding to a halt.  We will probably have more redundancies and more unemployment. The Government should examine their consciences and their attitude towards free enterprise and initiate a massive attack on unemployment. The best way to protect employment is by creating more jobs. Parts of this Bill are necessary but I would suggest that the Minister might direct his talent and his energies more towards the creation of employment instead of accepting the fact that we are going to have more redundancies and the workforce will go on shrinking. Of course, protection will always be necessary but attack is the best form of defence and the real defence of the worker would be an attack on the unemployment situation.  If more jobs are not created, the figures for redundancies in Cork, as instanced by Deputy Fitzgerald, will be double this time next year.</P>

      <P>Collective redundancies will occur irrespective of whether times are good or bad.  Redundancies will occur in times of prosperity.  Whether redundancies occur because demand is declining or whether they occur for technical reasons, arrangements have to be made to ensure that employers adopt humane procedures for dealing with redundancies in order to minimise hardship.  Under this Bill the employer must enter into prior consultation with the representatives of the employees concerned and these consultations must be commenced at least 30 days before the first dismissal.  The employer must also provide certain information to the employee as to the reasons for the redundancy.  The vast majority of employers already engage in this prior consultation but there have been exceptions.  There have been cases where employees with many years' service have found themselves <Col N="349" /> at the receiving end of a 48-hour notice.  It is to combat this practice in a minority of cases this Bill has been introduced.  I hope to see the widespread development of consultative practice in industry with fewer possibilities in future of dispute action on foot of matters connected with redundancy.</P>

      <P>Deputy FitzGerald reported progress on this Bill.  The Chair draws attention to the fact that amendment No. 4 is consequential on amendment No. 56 and amendments Nos. 57, 58, 59 and 60 are related.  It has already been agreed to take amendments Nos. 4, 56, 57, 58, 59 and 60 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned on the previous occasion we agreed to take this large number of amendments together.  They are consequential on amendment No. 4 which appeared to be a simple amendment on its own.  When we adjourned on that occasion there was a certain amount of confusion in the House regarding both the time we were to conclude and when another item on the Order Paper was resuming.  Therefore, it might be as well to look at amendment No. 4 again.  Amendments Nos. 56, 57, 58, 59 and 60 are being taken together and they refer to the Employment Equality Agency we are establishing.  Amendment No. 56 refers to the agency's power to conduct investigations.  Subsection (3) states:</P>
      <P>An investigation may be conducted by one or more than one member of the Agency delegated by the Agency for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="350" /> I agree entirely that an agency of this kind is needed for this legislation.  I pointed out earlier that the legislation was empty without it.  However, it must be asked if it should not be under the umbrella of the Labour Court or connected with it.  The subsection provides that the agency can delegate one or more persons to carry out an investigation.  On the last occasion we discussed who may be appointed to the agency but there remains the question whether there is a danger that we may be giving powers to the agency to appoint a person who may not have the necessary expertise to conduct investigations.</P>
    <P>In this legislation a number of issues will probably be raised that may not have been contemplated by the Minister when he introduced it.  We are eliminating discrimination, and quite rightly.  We are providing equal opportunities for both sexes and by virtue of this Bill we will also eliminate discrimination between people of the same sex.  Therefore, can we be sure that the person appointed to carry out an investigation is qualified to do so?</P>
    <P>I do not mean any disrespect to the Minister, but for the past two years there has been too much interference with the Labour Court.  It was established under the Industrial Relations Act, 1946 and its independence must never be questioned. There must not be any interference by a Minister.  If we introduce legislation designed to help industrial relations, if we set down guidelines &mdash;this is all we can do&mdash;we must be very careful to ensure the independence of the Labour Court.  The Minister for Labour has interfered with it and this is resented by both sectors of industrial society.  By all means let us give the Labour Court the necessary powers and let us hold the necessary controls but it must be seen to be an independent body acting in the interests of industrial relations.  At the moment our country is strike-ridden; there are many disputes throughout the State involving all kinds of employees.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Employment Equality Agency and the powers proposed to be given to it must be <Col N="351" /> carefully considered.  When I refer to the Minister I am not necessarily referring to the Minister in the House; everyone knows that some time later this year a member from this party will be sitting in his place.  Any Minister must be careful when appointing people to the agency.  At the moment he has power to nominate six members.  Three of those must represent women's organisations and this is quite right.  On the last occasion I made it clear that I do not think the Minister should have the power to nominate six people to the board.  It could be loaded in favour of a Minister who has the power to make such appointments.  There is always the danger that the people appointed may not have the expertise, experience or training to conduct investigations on their own.  Paragraph (4) of amendment 56 states:</P>
    <P>An investigation shall not be conducted in relation to the selection by the local Appointments Commission or the Civil Service Commission of a person for appointment to an office or position.</P>
    <P>Is this putting the public sector in a different situation from the private sector?</P>
    <P>We know that all kinds of anomalies have been created.  We have seen interference by this Minister and his Government; he interfered in the building industry because he did not support the relativity increase being given&mdash; although it had been examined by the Labour Court and was agreed by both sides in the building industry.  What caused it?  It was the anomalies created by increases in the public sector.  What will happen with regard to appointments by the Local Appointments Commission and the Civil Service Commission?  Will these people be above reproach?  Will they be investigated by the agency and, if not, why? The terms of reference for the investigation are set out in amendment No. 57.  Amendment No. 58 will be the new section 34.  Since this Bill was introduced almost one-and-a-half years ago it has been added to to a greater extent than any other legislation.  The additions are enormous, complicated <Col N="352" /> and inter-connected.  The amendment sheet we have before us is a Bill in itself.</P>
    <P>Quite far-reaching powers are being given to the agency in regard to obtaining information to summon witnesses. It is understandable that they be given authority to pay expenses.  However, there is one area which worries me. The offences relating to investigations are outlined.  The amendment, which is basically a new section, deals with the recommendations and reports by agencies.  There is one paragraph in this the meaning of which I fail to grasp.  If I interpret it correctly this agency can more or less conduct a behind closed doors investigation and not refer to some information submitted to them.  I referred earlier to the constitution of this agency and how the Minister of the day has the appointment of six people, which I consider is completely unnecessary.  Paragraph (5) of amendment No. 60 states:</P>
    <P>Any information obtained by the Agency by virtue of the powers conferred on it by section 34&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>This in effect, is amendment No. 58, to which I have been referring.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;as to any organisation of workers or any person or as to the business carried on by any person, which is not available otherwise, shall not be included in a report under this section without the consent of the organisation of workers or the person concerned (unless such non-inclusion would be inconsistent with the duties of the Agency and the object of the report) and any person concerned in any proceedings under this Act shall not disclose any such information without such consent.</P>
    <P>I believe that certain secretive powers of investigation are being given to this agency where they can more or less spy behind closed doors.  I do not believe this is right in our democracy. We have seen how the Government introduced emergency measures less than a year ago.  What guarantee have we that this agency will not go around spying, get information behind closed doors and not mention the source of that information in their reports?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="353" /> I have no amendment down on this on Committee Stage but I believe it is something which the Minister should consider very seriously.  It is not enough for him to say that it is identical with any other Act setting up any other body.  We are talking now about setting up an agency.  We have quite a number of Bills in the social sphere.  The previous Bill extends the powers of the redundancy tribunal to hear cases.  Now we have an equality agency investigating complaints in relation to anti-discrimination. During the debate on the Unfair Dismissals Bill I stated that the experience of this legislation in England was that the investigating bodies were damned by trivial claims, which were now being referred to as &ldquo;the £50 settlement&rdquo;.  Those trivialities should never have been brought before them but for the sake of getting rid of them expeditiously and without causing harm to any of the individuals concerned an amicable settlement was arrived at and they were called &ldquo;the £50 settlement&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we should follow England in any legislation we introduce but we should learn from their mistakes. Let those bodies which we are setting up be compact and simple. We should not give them any powers which appear to my party to be unnecessary. It is not enough for the Minister to say that such a body were introduced in a previous year or decade.  We are now talking about the seventies.  If we are introducing a lot of those tribunals we should introduce them in a simple way and not give them powers that could be abused by appointees of the Minister, who may not be suited or not be qualified in any way except in a political support way.</P>

      <P>It is important, when talking about this agency, that we recognise the need for it, that it should be reasonably broadly based and that we allow for representation from women's organisations.  We already discussed the need for this agency to operate as efficiently as possible, that it should seek to investigate areas of discrimination, where such exist, and that it should be adequately staffed.  From <Col N="354" /> what I understand no objection to the actual idea of the agency has been suggested by members of the Opposition but there are different points of view about the actual composition and the representation of the agency.</P>
      <P>I believe it will be accepted by all who are concerned in this area that if we are to advance the cause of equality in employment it is necessary to have an agency specially charged with that task.  The purpose of this section is that we will have an agency, consisting of a chairman and ten ordinary members.  Deputy Fitzgerald said that this was too large for such an agency.  I believe even he accepts the need for inclusion in the representation of the governing body of as many as possible of the various elements and organisations that exist which are pledged to eliminate discrimination from our society. Obviously we must have on such an agency's governing body union representatives, employer representatives and it is only right that we should have representatives of the women's organisations.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald indicated that he may have some amendments to put down for Report Stage on the actual changes he wishes to see in the functions of this agency.  I do not believe that there is any disagreement between us on the principle of it but he has put forward certain points of difference on the actual composition of the agency.  I look forward with interest to see what those amendments of his wish to institute instead of the arrangements we have here.  If it is possible to meet him on any of the changes he would like to see I shall try to meet him.  So far, with respect to the opinions he has expressed here in relation to the governing body and the reasons for its representation as set out previously in this debate, I have not heard any weighty reasons for alteration.  No doubt we shall hear about these in the course of the discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reiterate Deputy Fitzgerald's concern about the Labour Court when he spoke about the equality agency.  The Labour Court must be sacrosanct and must be preserved <Col N="355" /> with its present powers.  The Labour Court must be preserved with its present powers and must not be in any way inferior to any other agency. Therefore, appointments to the agency &mdash;about which Deputy Fitzgerald spoke&mdash;or to the Labour Court are of great importance to us.  Recently appointments to the Labour Court were criticised by no less a person than the general secretary of my union.  We should examine in great detail the personnel of the equality agency and the powers given them. There should be no interference with the powers or the influence of the Labour Court.  I would feel much happier if the Minister would examine the composition of the equality agency bearing in mind that in no way must its powers be antagonistic to the Labour Court.</P>
      <P>No doubt after 30 years of existence we might take a look at the Labour Court, as the Government are doing, to ascertain whether any improvements or changes are necessary. But, pending the result of such examination, we should be zealous in safeguarding the Labour Court and ensuring that it is not impinged on by any other agency.  If we keep that foremost in our minds then we will be contributing in a constructive way to this Bill.  Otherwise we should have to be very critical indeed.</P>
      <P>One might appeal to the Minister not to pursue the line he took when he made a new appointment to the Labour Court.  Rather he should take a much broader view and endeavour to meet the wishes of the Opposition and those of the trade union movement, as enunciated by the general secretary of the Workers' Union of Ireland when making any such appointments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 2, to delete lines 37 and 38.</P>
      <P>I have given serious consideration to these provisions since the circulation of the Bill.  Observations have been made to me by representative interests that if the equal value concept in the definition of &ldquo;like work&rdquo; were applied in regard to subsections 3 (3), (4) and (5) these subsections could turn out to be difficult to interpret.  The equal value concept is &ldquo;where demands made on each worker are equal, that their work is of equal value&rdquo;.  Obviously entry requirements for a machine operator would demand manual dexterity and mental alertness to a far greater degree than for a packer.  Again, it could be said that conditions of employment which include overtime, shiftwork, short-time, layoffs and redundancies have to be the same in both cases.  Of course, training would also have to be different.</P>
      <P>For those reasons I believe the formula of words now substituted by amendments Nos. 10, 12, and 13 should gain general acceptance.  The definition: &ldquo;work which is not materially different&rdquo; in substitution for &ldquo;like work&rdquo; will mean that the work of the packer and the machine operator will be materially different. Therefore, it will not be regarded as discrimination on grounds of sex where such different occupations are treated differently.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 is a consequential one arising as a result of amendments Nos. 10, 12 and 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The deletion of this definition causes certain eyebrows to be raised.  While accepting entirely the difficulties that could be created under the definition in relation to the <Col N="357" /> 1974 Act, a logical question to ask the Minister now is: in view of his decision in introducing this amendment and talking about persons whose employment is not materially different, then what is the position regarding the 1974 Act?  Does he intend to amend that Act?  Of course that Act was the Equal Pay Act, which has been reneged on completely by the Minister and the Government.</P>
      <P>There will be other sections of the Bill under which we shall refer to the marital status of people and how that cannot in any way hinder their equal opportunity.  Yet at present, in the public sector, it does hinder their equal payment.</P>
      <P>With regard to &ldquo;like work&rdquo;, in view of what the Minister said, in view of the introduction of the amendment, bearing in mind also certain difficulties that could be created using this definition but seeing that the term is used in the 1974 Act, does the Minister now intend to allow that definition to remain in that Act and remove it from this Bill?  It should be remembered that throughout the Minister's and Deputy Dowling's dialogue in the debate on that Act the Minister was at all times saying that he would be introducing further legislation to bolster that Act.  This is the Bill about which he was then speaking.  They are linked very closely.  The Minister must now explain&mdash;if he feels that this is now necessary&mdash;what happens then to the definition in the 1974 Act.</P>

      <P>Of course, equal value work in the 1974 Act deserves equal pay.  But here we are discussing whether equal training is required for different work.  We are dealing with something different here.  I would contest the fact that we have in any way reneged on the obligations of the Equal Pay Act of 1974.  All its provisions are in operation and apply throughout the State.  We are conforming in every respect to the requirements of that Act.</P>

      <P>In answer to the Deputy on whether any change is required <Col N="358" /> in the equal value concept of the 1974 Act, obviously no change is required.  But, where we are speaking here about different jobs requiring different training, then this definition is necessary to meet those particular requirements.  I agree that in this whole area of definition vast confusion reigns. I have always held that this Bill before us&mdash;which goes to the root of inequality in employment, which seeks to make the training for jobs and put the sexes on an equal footing; which seeks to put them on an equal footing in relation to promotion&mdash;is basically much more important than other similar equality legislation.  If the Deputy will understand that this relates to training, and that this is why this change is required, he will see the reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand how the Minister contends that it is in relation to training&mdash;to an extent, of course, it does as anybody is trained for any employment.  In my opinion it relates to exactly the same thing, the work of equal value to which we referred in the 1974 Act.  It is expedient now for the Minister to refer to it as being relevant only to training. I do not agree that that is so.  The consequential amendments Nos. 10, 12 and 13 all refer to section 3 which is subtitled &ldquo;Discrimination by employers prohibited&rdquo;.  I fully sympathise with the Minister in his effort to defend the action which was forced upon him by the Government in reneging on the principles and terms of the Acts as passed by both sides of this House. We will see as we go on how it was an absolute reneging of the commitment under that Act.</P>
      <P>Section 3 (1) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person who is an employer or who obtains under a contract with another person the services of employees of that other person shall not discriminate against an employee or a prospective employee or an employee of that other person in relation to access to employment, conditions of employment (other than remuneration and superannuation), training or experience for or in relation to employment, promotion or regrading in employment or classification <Col N="359" /> of posts in employment.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) reads:</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), a person shall be taken to discriminate against an employee or prospective employee in relation to access to employment if...</P>
    <P>(b)  by specifying, in respect of one person or class of persons entry requirements for employment which are not specified in respect of other persons or classes of persons where both such persons or classes are or would be employed on like work.</P>
    <P>The words &ldquo;where both such persons or classes are or would be employed on like work&rdquo; are amended to &ldquo;where the circumstances in which both such persons or classes would be employed are not materially different&rdquo;.  We are talking about access to employment, not necessarily training for employment. Training can be one aspect of it. It is not good enough for the Minister to say that because this refers to training it is completely different from the other.  It need not necessarily refer to training.  In other words access to employment does not mean that the person has to be trained.  One can move from one job with tremendous experience to another job, and such may be the type of person being recruited.  I can see the many arguments the Minister could logically make on this but there is a vast difference between it and what is denied in the 1974 Act.</P>
    <P>Regarding the section itself we have no objection to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6.</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 39 and 40 to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `non-discrimination notice, means a notice under section 37;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" /> The agency will be empowered to issue a non-discrimination notice if in the course of a formal investigation they find that a person is contravening the Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Bill or the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974.  The purpose of this notice is to bring about an end to discriminatory practice without penalty.  We have something similar under the Factories Acts when an effort was made to improve the situation.  A breach does not in itself carry any penal consequence, and it is our experience that this kind of remedy being available is helpful.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 61 defines the circumstances in which the non-discrimination notice may be served.  It may be served on a person who is unlawfully discriminating.  Amendment No. 62 provides for appeal to the Labour Court against a non-discrimination notice or any requirement of it, and such appeal must be lodged within 42 days of the date of service.  Amendment No. 63 provides that the agency will keep a register of notices which have become final and amendment No. 64 that it will be essential for the agency to follow up findings of general discrimination in order to ensure proper compliance with the legislation in the public interest on behalf of the community as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are referring to the agency and the non-discrimination notice.  I have no objection to amendment 6 but I wish to make a few points regarding the consequential amendments 61, 62, 63 and 64 regarding the powers of the agency.  With regard to amendment 61 I am not happy with the terms as specified of how an investigation should be conducted by this agency.  Amendment 61 reads:</P>
      <P>37.  &mdash;(1)  Where in the course of the conduct of an investigation or after an investigation has been conducted the Agency is satisfied that a person&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  has discriminated or is discriminating,</P>
      <P>(b)  has failed or is failing to comply with an equality clause under section 4,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> (c)  has contravened section 7 (1) or section 8,</P>
    <P>(d)  has engaged in or is engaging in a practice referred to in section 3 (2), or</P>
    <P>(e)  has failed or is failing to comply with an equal pay clause (within the meaning of section 7 of the Act of 1974),</P>
    <P>it may serve a non-discrimination notice on that person.</P>
    <P>Regarding clause (e) will the Minister bring the Minister for Finance, Deputy R. Ryan, before this equality agency as the first person to be interrogated on his lack of commitment on the Equal Pay Act passed by this House?  This equality agency will have to deal with a novel first case when the first person whose malpractice is being investigated will be the Minister for Finance who has reneged on the legislation introduced by this Minister in all good faith in 1974.  This will be the first duty of the equality agency under this section, and non-discriminatory notice will obviously be served on the Minister for Finance and we will have an opportunity of testing out this agency at the very highest level.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see an improvement here on previous methods of notifying people.  The amendment continues:</P>
    <P>(2) (a)  Where the Agency proposes to serve a non-discrimination notice it shall before serving it notify in writing the person on whom it is proposed to serve the notice of its proposal.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say how the notice shall be served.  We had the awful sentence in one of these pieces of social legislation where the notice in particular circumstances could be left at premises.</P>

Will the Minister pursue the availability or otherwise of the site which I think he has in mind beside the new church?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the short-term measures being considered relate to a pre-fab or a chalet.  In view of the large development occurring in the Powerstown parish, would <Col N="366" /> the Minister consider meeting or having his officials meet a small deputation from the area to discuss whether it would be a short-term development or a long-term development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It would probably be both.  There must be long-term planning because of the development in the area but the short-term problem must be solved as well immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, change of residence. Would the Minister or his officials meet a deputation to consider the overall development of the school?  There is a short-term proposal at the moment to put up pre-fab type of buildings there.  It seems to be a waste of money when there is a long-term proposal which can be done.  There is co-operation within the parish to do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Both need to be done. First of all there must be a solution immediately to the short-term problem and then there can be planning for the long term.  I will meet the deputation, or the Department will.  We must gather information from the local authority and others concerned in the matter of getting the necessary accommodation and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would emphasise that money is being spent at the moment which many people feel is a waste because of the long-term proposals. There are children in the parish at the moment, natives of the parish, who are being refused admission. I suggest the Minister would consider a meeting at which he could hear the views&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My Department's annual financial allocation for primary school libraries in County Kildare in the period 1973 to 1976 was as follows: 1973, £2,759; 1974, £3,574; 1975, Nil; 1976, £4,016.</P>

      <P>I have had some requests for permission to import used London-type taxis.  The Motor Vehicles (Registration of Importers) <Col N="375" /> Act, 1968, restricts imports of motor vehicles whether new or used to registered importers who are mainly firms engaged in the assembly industry here.  While I have discretion under the Act to authorise the importation of a motor vehicle by a non-registered person the grant of such facilities is confined to special cases.  These are normally cases involving permanent change of residence.  As the Act was introduced to protect the motor assembly industry I would not be prepared to exercise my discretion by extending such facilities to allow the importation of used taxis by non-registered persons.</P>

You cannot allow imports to take place on a large scale of fully built-up vehicles, for instance, in the taxi field, without endangering jobs in the assembly industry. It is a simple question of choice, one or the other; you cannot have both.</P>

The latest factual information I have on the situation is that contact is being maintained with the Alcan company. The Deputy will understand that they made their position clear in a Press release on 19th December, 1975, when they stated that they would not be able to go ahead as planned because of the situation then obtaining in the world market for the product in question, but that a review of the situation was to take place within 12 to 18 months at that stage.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the number of industries in the north-east regional development area that have closed down since March, 1973; the number of industries in the area with workers on short time; the number of workers involved in each case; the names of the industries in each case; the total of IDA payments to these industries; and his Department's plans for restarting or replacing the industries affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no obligation on any industrial undertaking which either closes down or introduces short-time working, formally to advise my Department or the Industrial Development Authority of such developments. However, every effort is made by the Department and by the Industrial Development Authority to secure the fullest possible information, but the information available is not necessarily comprehensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to the foregoing qualification, I understand from the Industrial Development Authority that they are aware of 27 firms in the north-east region which closed down since 1st January, 1973.  The total employment in these firms, which exclude those with a maximum employment of less than ten people, was 1,539, and the total amount of grants paid by the Industrial Development Authority to these firms is £920,000.  With the permission <Col N="382" /> of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report a list showing the names of the firms in question and the years in which each closed.</P>
    <P>As regards short-time working, I take it the question relates to firms which may at present be working short-time.  The IDA are not aware of any firms in the region which are at present working short-time, but the qualification made at the outset has to be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>As to plans for restarting or replacing the firms which have ceased operations I am informed that the Authority have negotiated replacement projects for ten of the firms referred to; these replacement projects have a full employment potential of 901.  In the other cases the Authority are continuing their efforts to secure suitable replacement industries.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it either wise or fair to continue building advance factories while so many such buildings have been vacant for the past four years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, in most cases the advance factories are being built in locations where there are no other advance factories vacant. They are being built in the light of the needs of specific areas.  In their very recent plans the IDA are contemplating on building larger advance factories than was the case previously. They are concentrating, too, on siting these factories in the larger towns having regard to employment needs. The existence of smaller factories in other parts of the country is not a solution to the problems in the town in which the advance factories are in the process of being built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is missing the point in relation to those factories that have been built already in what we used to regard as undeveloped areas, a description which, unfortunately, now seems to be applied to the whole country.  Is it fair to those areas on the western seaboard in which advance factories have been erected that a choice is now being made available to potential industrialists in regard to areas of larger populations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was endeavouring to make was that the type of factory being built now is different from those built in the past.  As the list I am having circulated will show, the average size of the advance factories being built now is 24,000 square feet.  These factories cater for industries that are of a different type from the ones that would be carried on in the average-size factory to which the Deputy referred.  Consequently, there would be no question of competition.</P>
      <P>I should say that, as I explained on the last occasion on which the Deputy raised this matter, a certain time lag between the building and the filling of an advance factory is likely.  Such a building could not properly be called an advance factory if one knew from the beginning what industry would be carried on there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that given the proper industrial climate such factories can be either sold or let from the drawing boards but that no such climate exists?  Would he agree also, that the proposal to build more of these factories is merely a pre-election gimmick?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there are problems in the world market for industrial exports.  To a large extent these factories are to be filled by people involved in export industries. Obviously there is a problem in conditions in which there is a depression in regard to the demand for industrial goods, but that is not a problem that is within the control of this Government or of any other national government.  I would not accept for one moment the strange implication in the Deputy's question that the building of these factories is related to the general election.  There is a continuing programme on the part of the IDA of building advance factories and in this regard they have available vastly enhanced resources from the Government.</P>

I am sure the Deputy is aware that the biscuit market is a very diverse one and that people may require a certain small amount of a particular type of biscuit which it would not be possible perhaps to manufacture here.  In the interests of specialisation and the economies of scale it may be necessary for Irish manufacturers to concentrate on particular lines.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the volume of imports of (a) wooden manufactured articles and (b) furniture, in each of the years 1975 and 1976; if the significant increase which was apparent in 1976 has had any effect on the Irish joinery industry; and, if so, if he will investigate the possibility that dumping has been taking place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The official import statistics relating to &ldquo;wood and cork manufactures&rdquo; contain a large range of items such as veneer sheets, blockboard, reconstituted wood, wood paving blocks, match splints, and so on which are not produced by the joinery industry.  Imports of &ldquo;builders' woodwork and prefabricated buildings&rdquo; increased from 2.0m. kg., value £1.0m., in 1975 to 2.8m. kg., value £1.5m., in 1976.  Imports of &ldquo;furniture&rdquo; increased from 10.6m. kg., value £8.8m., in 1975 to 13.0m. kg., value £12.0m., in 1976.  On the other hand exports of &ldquo;builders' woodwork and prefabricated buildings&rdquo; increased <Col N="392" /> from 4.0m. kg., value £1.8m., in 1975 to 11.5m. kg., value £4.1m., in 1976. Exports of &ldquo;furniture&rdquo; increased from 5.8m. kg., value £4.4m., in 1975 to 6.5m. kg., value £7.4m., in 1976.  I am told by the Industrial Development Authority that a survey carried out by them indicates that in the wood and furniture sector there had been some increase in employment between the 1st January, 1976, and the 1st January, 1977.  An Coimisiún Dumpála will investigate any complaints of dumping received and I understand that An Coimisiún are at present investigating a complaint in regard to flush doors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather from the Parliamentary Secretary's reply that there had been a 50 per cent increase in imports between 1975 and 1976.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that there is concern in the two major manufacturing units, Cappincur in Tullamore and GWI in Sligo, about the importation of wooden manufactured articles interfering with their business?  Is he aware that the employment potential has been reduced in those areas?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information on the areas referred to by the Deputy but there has been an increase in trade in this area.  While there has been an increase in imports there has also been an equivalent increase in exports.  There has also been a slight increase in employment in this sector as a whole in the past year.  That is not to say that there may not be problems in individual areas and if the Deputy wishes me to pursue the problems of individual firms I will do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will give the reasons for the widening gap between the price of motor vehicles in the United Kingdom and this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Question Nos. 21 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to comment in any detail on the retail price of motor vehicles in other countries. However, relative prices of vehicles in different countries are affected by a number of factors, mainly:</P>
      <P>(a)  the existence or otherwise of full manufacturing facilities within the country;</P>
      <P>(b)  the extent to which a country's needs are met through local assembly of motor vehicles from imported completely knocked down parts;</P>
      <P>(c)  import duties and VAT on fully built up vehicles and on parts:</P>
      <P>(d)  dealer margins; and</P>
      <P>(e)  currency exchange rates and variations therein.</P>
      <P>In so far as there has been in the past year an increase in the margin between prices of vehicles in this country and in the countries of origin other than the United Kingdom a major influencing factor would be changes in currency exchange rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Retail prices in this country are very largely affected by the existence of a motor assembly industry established originally in conditions of industrial protection.  A recent study undertaken by consultants on behalf of the National Prices Commission and commented on in the commission's monthly report&mdash;No. 56&mdash;for November, 1976, has shown that where companies are distributing motor vehicles <Col N="394" /> imported both in &ldquo;fully built-up&rdquo;&mdash; FBU&mdash;and in &ldquo;completely knocked down&rdquo;&mdash;CKD&mdash;conditions the companies in question are in fact incurring financial penalties through assembly here and that it would be more advantageous for them to concentrate on the importation of vehicles fully assembled.  If permitted this would of course result in the disemployment of the workers engaged in the assembly industry.</P>
    <P>The study referred to was the third examination of motor vehicle prices undertaken by the National Prices Commission since December, 1975. In their November, 1976, report the commission have also expressed the view that detailed price control is inappropriate for the motor vehicle assembly industry at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Parliamentary Secretary say that there is an increase in the number assembled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that, I made no statement on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he is aware of the great concern about the price of imported vehicles in this country as compared with the price in the country of origin.  The import price is vastly different from the price of those assembled here but yet, when retailed, the imported cars are sold at the same price as the locally assembled ones.  A tremendous profit is made and nobody has attempted to explain where it goes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Deputy that the NPC has investigated on three occasions the situation in relation to motor cars and they have satisfied themselves that excessive profits are not being made in the manner in which the Deputy feels that they are.  Obviously, there are other factors at work here in relation to the price of motor cars, apart from any profit that might be made by the importer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to find out what the other factors are and the Parliamentary Secretary has not enlightened us.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware of the fact that those of us who are frequently in the North <Col N="395" /> of Ireland can see cars there which cost £2,000 less than the same model here?  What the Parliamentary Secretary has said in his waffling reply does not explain away that huge margin. Unit costs have dropped in the United Kingdom and other countries and they have risen proportionately here.  The gap is widening seriously and a huge profit is being made somewhere by somebody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I put down a question asking the Minister to state the amount being taken by the State in the form of tax, would he be able to give me that information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That information can certainly be given and is undoubtedly true that the rates of excise duty are a factor in determining the price here.  It is a question of priorities as to whether one is to have a low rate of VAT on motor cars and, consequently, higher rates on essential items such as food or, alternatively, to do as the Government have done, to reduce the rates of VAT on essential items and in consequence maintain revenue and place higher rates on items such as motor cars.  It is a question of priorities.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate also that the existence of an assembly industry here does add significantly to the cost of cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the VAT rate on imported cars higher than that on locally assembled cars?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, why should that affect the gap in price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the same firms are retailing both assembled and imported cars.  In fact, one cannot import fully assembled cars without having an assembly operation here.  Obviously, there is a certain amount of intermingling between the prices of the different models.  It is possible that losses made on an assembly operation could be recouped on the sale of the fully built-up model. <Col N="396" /> I cannot say if this is actually occurring but it is a possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to comment on a situation which is causing grave disquiet among hauliers on account of this gap between the price of motor vehicles here and in the United Kingdom.  They are now placed at a very distinct disadvantage as compared with hauliers from the United Kingdom who have free access to carry out work here now and in the future.  Would he care to comment on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that a higher price does create problems for an industry such as the Deputy has referred to.  It is a question of deciding whether one wants to maintain the assembly industry here or whether one wishes to maintain a particular level of indirect taxation on motor vehicles.  If one were to depart from the present policy in relation to those two items, there would be other possibly more undesirable consequences than those to which the Deputy has referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary appreciates that the tax elements which his government are imposing on hauliers here is a contributory factor in placing Irish people at a disadvantage in relation to their English counterparts.  There should be no doubt where his sympathy lies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is quite clear.  If one were to reduce indirect taxation on motor vehicles, one would have to find the revenue somewhere else, perhaps on more essential items in the household budget.  The consequences of that would be far more serious in regard to inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two things I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary. I would ask him to get the NPC to give us a break-down of the cost of motor vehicles and parts and to explain the huge gap.  Nothing the Parliamentary Secretary has said does that. I was quoted £37 as the price of a tyre in Dublin which I could buy for £15 in Enniskillen.  This is the type of thing which we want explained.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="397" /> to ensure that the excessive profits being made on imported fully assembled vehicles will be used to subsidise the local assembly of cars and to bring down the price.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(b) where because of his marital status a person is treated less favourably than another person of the same sex,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to extend the terms of this section from discrimination on grounds of marriage, between persons of the same sex to discrimination on the grounds of marital status between persons of the same sex, so that a woman, regardless of her marital status, married, single or widow, must be treated equally with another person whether the other person is married, single or a widow.

I mentioned earlier that we would come to sections dealing with the marital status of the individual and <Col N="404" /> here we have section 2 reading:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the Act, discrimination shall be taken to occur in any of the following cases...</P>

      <P>We now have the situation, particularly in the public sector, that from the point of view of equal opportunities, equal promotion opportunities, equal training access, equal access to employment, there can be absolutely no discrimination on the ground of sex or marital status but in the more vital Bill, the Equal Pay Bill, discrimination exists and continues to exist with the Minister for Finance, or more properly, the Minister for the Public Service being the principal offender.  In my opinion the Minister must have red ears in introducing this amendment.  While the amendment is acceptable, one must say that the lack of consistency in the legislation is almost laughable and can only be regarded by the public in the light that the Minister is now endeavouring to compensate by way of equal opportunity and access while yet not paying the same rate for the job.  No matter how important conditions, opportunity and access may be&mdash;and they are all very important&mdash;the most important thing for any person married or single is remuneration.</P>

      <P>In page 4, lines 19 to 23, to delete subsection (6).</P>
      <P>I believe subsection (6) as it stands is not realistic.  If we read it and are referring to the section dealing with discrimination by employers being prohibited, I submit that it is not possible to apply the terms of this subsection which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), a person shall be taken to discriminate against an <Col N="408" /> employee if he refuses or deliberately omits to promote that employee to a post for which the employee is qualified in circumstances in which other persons equally qualified are promoted.</P>
    <P>As I read it, that subsection means that if five people are qualified for promotion to a post and if only one is promoted, the other four automatically have a grievance.  Then the employer is the target of an investigation by the equality agency and possibly further action will result.  In other words, it is impossible for an employer to achieve what is hoped for there because he cannot make five positions available.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe that this section, while it forms part of the Bill, is not realistic, cannot be implemented and should not be included because it would be bad legislation and impossible to achieve.</P>

      <P>We have a depressing picture, and the figures are there to support it.  When we come to managerial and senior positions where real decisions are made in Irish industry, the number of women filling such posts is very few indeed.  The Irish Management Institute ran a survey on this recently and came to the conclusion that undoubtedly a good deal of prejudice existed throughout Irish industry against the idea of women filling senior posts even where such were qualified.  This section is so drafted in an effort to ensure that sex as a prejudicial factor in the promotion of people is eliminated as much as possible.</P>
      <P>I take Deputy Fitzgerald's point that this is a difficult area in which to legislate.  There is no question here of having to promote a person where there is no promotional outlet.  If there are ten people eligible for three vacancies it should be possible to make an ordinary judgment on who are the best qualified to fill those posts.  Only where in the opinion of those who examine the subject it is believed that the sex of the applicant was the determining factor in preventing that person being considered for the post, would this section have application.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="409" /> I will undertake to look very carefully at this again between now and Report Stage, because I am not anxious to see something written into legislation that would be difficult to accept.</P>

      <P>While I admit the Minister is being fair in his approach, this is one subsection upon which I must take a stand.  Indeed, it is a reflection on the Minister himself.  It is wide open to the interpretation I have given it and it should not form any part of this Bill.  The subsection means that if there are three promotional opportunities and there are ten applicants the seven who do not get promoted have a justifiable grievance.  That is the position.</P>

Remember, the Labour Court operates here.  A serious omission would be evident were we to delete this particular provision. If there were no such provision discrimination could be practised.

I support equality of opportunity in promotion but I do not support a subsection that creates a ridiculous situation.  I have explained the position.  We accept the principle and that is why we are giving time to examining the Bill in great detail.  This subsection should not be passed by a sensible group of people.  Even a child could see that the subsection should not be passed. The Minister said that the Labour Court or the Employment Equality Agency were there to adjudicate.  Why should we create problems for either organisation?  I move that the question be now put.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is long overdue in Irish society.  At the heart of this legislation is the equality of promotion opportunities throughout <Col N="411" /> industry and without measures to defend this equality of promotion opportunities there would be no heart in the Bill.  Section 3 deals with discrimination by employers.  A person shall be taken to discriminate against an employee if he refuses or deliberately omits to promote that employee to a post for which he is qualified in circumstances where other persons equally qualified are promoted.  I do not think it imposes an excessively onerous obligation on the employer.  It means simply that in future decisions on promotion the employer must exorcise from his or her mind the idea that the sex of the person concerned should be the determining factor that decides if that individual should be promoted as against another.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald is not serving his own commitment to the idea of equality of opportunity when he insists on the deletion of part of a section, dealing with promotion, when he declares his outright opposition to it and when he states that it cannot be realistically worked.  If we were to delete such a section from a Bill which sets out to promote equality in employment and in training we could be fairly accused of taking part in a purely cosmetic exercise in legislation. I heard many delegates to the Deputy's party Ard-Fheis speak at length on the necessity of providing greater equality for women in Irish Industry.</P>

      <P>Just because Deputy Fitzgerald finds himself in such a bad humour it does not mean that discussion in the House should be confined as his humour dictates.  We must discuss the elements of amendments and their merits.  This Bill deals with the promotional opportunities available to women in Irish industry. The Deputy's insistance on deleting a section that protects that right to equality of treatment when it comes to promotion does not serve his frequently stated commitment to the promotion of equality throughout Irish industry.  In that connection I noted that many of the delegates to the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis spoke of the necessity of ensuring that we have such equality of promotion throughout industry.</P>
      <P>I do not think it places an excessively onerous imposition on an employer to ensure that prejudice with regard to the sex of a person concerned does not enter into the granting or withholding of promotional opportunities. Most employers accept in 1977 that the accidental element such as the sex of a person should not be permitted to come in the way of the suitability, qualifications and competence of an employee with regard to promotion.  If the Deputy considers the matter fairly I am sure he will agree that such an obligation will not impair managerial efficiency and will not take away from the powers of managerial grades to promote people. However, it means that legislation of this kind cannot be silent when it comes to the question of promotion opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="413" /> There are depressing statistics on the participation of women throughout Irish industry.  In a work force where we have 26 per cent women, the statistics of women who hold managerial positions do not show a corresponding percentage.  When we move away from the traditional female jobs, we find that only 1 per cent of engineers are women, that only 2 per cent are accountants&mdash;</P>

      <P>The amendment seeks the elimination of a section that is essential to the effectiveness of the Bill before us.  Deputy Fitzgerald says he is equally wedded to the idea that the Bill before the House should be as effective as possible.  He says he is not against the principle of equality of promotion and opportunities.  When we come to the actual wording of the clauses, vital to making that principle a practical, working reality for women in industry, we find that he parts company with the policy he professes to espouse in his criticque of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is absolutely relevant on the Committee Stage of a Bill of this kind that we should discuss the reservations of Deputy Fitzgerald, that we should wonder exactly why he feels it is so necessary to make a stand on the elimination of so vital a subsection of this Bill.  What has Deputy Fitzgerald <Col N="414" /> got against equality of promotion for women in Irish industry?  What is his opposition to that principle?  He says it is unworkable as a principle and that he is not in agreement with it, but he does not advance any realistic arguments.</P>

      <P>I will be delighted to be in the House discussing important and useful legislation.  If it serves to educate Deputy Fitzgerald and to make him more agreeable to the rights of Irish women we will be doing a good day's work.  This will take some time because Deputy Fitzgerald in his opposition to this clause appears to have ideas which certainly do not seem to me to be consonant with the provisions of this Bill.  On the one hand, we cannot get away from the fact that there appears to be a certain prejudice operating against the promotion of women in industry.</P>
      <P>The deletion of subsection (6) sought by Deputy Fitzgerald would seriously weaken the effectiveness of the Bill.  We can say that not alone in industry is there not sufficient participation by women in senior decision making areas but whether we take the public service, trade unions or any area of administration we find that women have the minority number of posts and certainly not commensurate with the number of women serving in the work force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not say in the subsection that an employer must perforce appoint a person to a senior position.  We simply say that a person shall be taken to discriminate against an employee if he refuses&mdash;that is very significant&mdash;or deliberately omits to promote that employee to a post.  He, deliberately, must refuse to consider the promotion <Col N="415" /> of such a person.  It is only in such cases, according to subsection (6) that the employer can be said to act against the section.  It is only in such cases that the Equality of Employment Agency or the Labour Court, which will enter into this matter, can say of an employer that he is guilty of positive discrimination against an employee.</P>
    <P>The subsection goes on to state that the employee must be qualified in circumstances in which other persons equally qualified are promoted.  The aggrieved person must be able to prove that his or her qualifications are equal in every respect to those of the persons already given the promotion outright. All of those are practical items.  If in a promotion outlet these could not be fulfilled, it could be said fairly of the employer that he had people fully qualified to take on the job and that he deliberately omitted to promote a person to a post in which, quite objectively, the qualifications required for the post and the service required for the post&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy claimed disability benefit in respect of incapacity from 26th April to 14th July, 1976, but as no contributions had been received in respect of him in the 1974 contribution year which governed the period of his claim up to 5th June, 1976, he was not entitled to benefit in respect of that period.  Payment was made on his claim from 7th June, 1976.  Inquiries which were made regarding his employment in 1974 disclosed that he had three different employments in that period and contributions were secured in respect of two of these employments, but these were insufficient to qualify him for benefit.  As the third employer could not be located it was not possible to either collect contributions due or confirm the period of employment.  However, as a result of further inquiries, it has been possible to confirm employment for 16 weeks in 1974 and contributions have been credited in respect of these weeks.  As a result the person referred to is qualified for benefit in respect of the period of his claim up to 5th June, 1976, and payment of the amount of benefit due is being made.</P>
