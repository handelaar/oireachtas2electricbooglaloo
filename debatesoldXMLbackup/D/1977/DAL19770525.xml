      <P>I ask the Taoiseach for a little explanation of the sequence of events.  Our Whips Office have interpreted the guillotine motion as follows, and it might be of assistance to the House if the Taoiseach would confirm it: Finance Bill to 1 p.m.; 1 p.m. to 1.30 p.m., the Friendly Societies Bill; 1.30 to 2.30 p.m., the Prisons Bill; 2.30 to 3.30, the resumption of the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill; then the Estimate for the Department of Labour, and the Final Stages of the Finance Bill from 6.30 to 8.30 p.m. The Taoiseach does not have to respond.  I do not expect him to because he has not been very helpful so far.</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1977: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's proposal under the section is to raise the maximum qualifying premium from £1,500 to £2,000, or 15 per cent of relevant earnings, whichever is the lesser, in the case of deductions for premiums paid for persons in self-employment or holding non-pensionable employment. I presume the intention is to make the figure £2,000 or 15 per cent, whichever is the lesser.  The move in this respect is in the right direction as is the move to increase the corresponding limit for qualifying premiums in respect of a spouse or dependant from £500 to £650.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not had time to work out the adjustments which I proposed in regard to people born before 1917 but I presume they are in proportion.  Although the move in this direction is welcome, I want to make the point that the kind of person with whom we are dealing is obliged out of his or her own savings to make provision for retirement, and in effect this section is the only one which represents any assistance from the State in that respect. Having regard to the outrageous inflation with which we have had to grapple in recent years and to the various taxation measures introduced by this Government, the position of self-employed people in particular, and indeed those who are employed but in non-pensionable positions, has been very seriously eroded, and a comparison has to be made between the position of such persons and those in <Col N="1441" /> categories who not only have pensions provided for them but in some cases have what are virtually inflation-proofed pensions.</P>
    <P>We adverted to the problems that arise in this respect in the context of other measures, not least in respect of wealth tax and the other capital taxation measures.  At that time the Minister seemed to me to be less than aware of the real problems arising for persons who are self-employed trying to make provision for their old age. Indeed one of the very distressing aspects of the capital gains tax is that in the case of such persons the business they may have built up throughout their lives and on the sale of which they are relying to provide them with some kind of a reasonable standard in their old age when they cannot continue to work is being subjected to capital gains tax, something I do not believe the general public wanted at any time.  They wanted to see capital gains tax directed at speculators.  Having regard to this situation, it seems to me that while the move is in the right direction the question arises whether the increase provided in the section is adequate.  In this connection it is interesting to note that across the water they raised the corresponding limit this year to £3,000 as against the figure of £2,000 proposed in this section.</P>
    <P>Having regard to all the circumstances, some of which I have outlined, there is a very strong case for increasing the figure considerably beyond the £2,000 provided in this section.  Even at this late stage I would urge the Minister to consider increasing it at least to £2,500, showing, even belatedly, some concern for those who are self-employed and endeavouring to make provision for their old age in very difficult circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister ought consider this aspect&mdash;to use words he is fond of using himself&mdash;in equity. The case made by Deputy Colley is an exceptionally good one.  As I understand it, a senior civil servant, a head of a Department, retiring after this year will qualify for a pension which no businessman could make available for himself at present under something <Col N="1442" /> less than premiums of approximately £3,000 per annum.  I do not think it would be possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Even then one cannot buy it; it is not available commercially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to return to an old issue in this respect debated in the House a couple of years ago in relation to the effect of inflation. Even assuming that a reasonably successful businessman could afford to invest in insurance for retirement at the level of £3,000 per annum, in three years' time, assuming he was retiring then, the value of his pension would have dropped by at the very least one-third. Therefore if one is engaged in enterprise one finds oneself in the unfortunate position that it is virtually impossible to keep abreast with the effects of inflation even through very substantial assurances.</P>
      <P>There is some merit in moving from £1,500 to £2,000.  I expect that very few of us&mdash;certainly not I&mdash;would be in a position to make that sort of contribution. In equity, if one is to afford those engaging in enterprise the possibility of maintaining the standard of living in retirement now being given in the public service, the Minister should reconsider the move from £1,500 to £2,000 and come up to or go beyond the level of the present standard in Britain.  From what this Minister and others have said it would appear they want to encourage enterprise, they want people to engage in the production of goods and the creation of wealth.  In that sense there should be encouragement given to those engaging in risk enterprise so that they can at least provide for their retirement in a reasonable way.  Bearing in mind inflation effects over the next few years the present level of £2,000 will deprive any businessman of the opportunity to provide for his retirement at this level of assurance allowance against tax.</P>

      <P>Like all other requests for reasonable tax, it is easy to make the request but not so easy to grant it because that means one transfers the cost to somebody else.  Here we are speaking of <Col N="1443" /> people who have an income of, say, £13,300, allowing them to set 15 per cent of that aside each year and, in so doing, avoid payment of tax on it. This is quite a considerable amount. The vast majority of people earn incomes much less than that and would not be in a position to set aside&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>While one hears some Deputies suggesting the wringing of the cloth in this section to give every last drop of sympathy for the people concerned&mdash;it is perfectly understandable; I have sympathy and regard for them, that is why I am increasing the figure from £1,500 to £2,000, which is quite a considerable increase, 33? per cent in one year, which more than compensates for the amount of inflation over the last year or so&mdash;the percentage limits of 15 per cent are not being changed.  They automatically increase the amount which can be set off each year because of the linkage between them and whatever is the person's income.  With respect, I think we should let the section go as it is.  It is a significant increase this year and we can have a look at it next year or on some other future occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is a little too glib when asked to do anything which is in any way a relief saying that this is then transferring the burden on to other taxpayers.  I say too glib because, as Deputy Haughey pointed out last night, he is doing precisely this on a major scale in the budget, in this Bill and in some cases has been granting very substantial tax relief to people on very high incomes.  Therefore, on the basis of his argument, he is transferring that burden on to people less able to pay.  I do not think that would be true but that is the argument he is making and it is not good enough.  The real question here is whether the Minister's frequent protestations of equity mean anything at all.  If they do, would he explain how he views the situation as between the kind of self-employed person with whom we are dealing in this section <Col N="1444" /> and a senior member of the public service regarding their treatment relating to their provision for old age, for a pension, leaving aside the whole question of retirement gratuities, which, of course, arise in the case of the public service, speaking only of pensions, because that is what this section is dealing with.  I do not object in any way to the terms that are available to the public service.  On the contrary, I believe it is setting a target which I hope all sections will be able to reach in due course.  In the public service, especially in the upper reaches of the public service, there are provisions for superannuation which are far superior to what is being envisaged here for those who are self-employed.  Would the Minister tell us how he reconciles the two approaches that seem to be involved here which on the face of it appear to discriminate in favour of the public service as against the self-employed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley knows that and yet he has chosen this <Col N="1445" /> occasion to make an attack on the public service without throwing into the balance the many restrictions which apply to people in the public service which prevent them from acquiring opportunities for wealth which are available in the private sector.  I will not go into a long recitation of the advantages which apply in the private sector but which do not apply in the public sector.  They are well known.  People in the public sector are much more restricted and the number who can ever reach anything like what we are talking about here are very few and far between. This year we are providing in the section a very significant relief for people who are earning five figures and upwards.  These people will also enjoy the very significant reductions in the rates of personal taxation, so that their financial positions this year will be better than they were last year or than they have been for many years in the past.  When all this is taken into account any reasonable person would agree that we are striking a very fair balance between the relief which it is appropriate to give to these people and the relief which we also owe to the general body of taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of some significance that the Minister responded in the way he did.  What I said was that the treatment of the senior members of the public service on the one hand as against the corresponding people who are self-employed appeared to be discriminatory and I invited him to comment on this and to explain his thinking on it.  The Minister's response was to say that I was attacking the public service.  The lack of logic involved in the Minister's approach is obvious.  The motivation is a matter for speculation to different people.  I do not want to go into speculation, I am trying to deal with this on a factual basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will not be disputed that, as the Minister said, there are only a small number of people in the public service who would be in a comparable position. Would the Minister agree that there can only be a small number of people in the private sector who would <Col N="1446" /> be at the maximum figure envisaged here?  If that is so, we can ignore the question of numbers in this regard.  I invited the Minister to tell the House his attitude in regard to the apparent discrimination.  It may be that there is no discrimination and that the Minister can point that out.  On the face of it, there is definite discrimination between the public and the private sectors.  I invite the Minister to say whether he agrees that there is such discrimination.  If the Minister does not agree perhaps he would point out why, or on the other hand if there is such discrimination, on what basis can the Minister justify it.  Despite what the Minister tries to say, that does not involve an attack on the public sector. In fact, if there is an attack involved at all it is on the Minister.  I am not attacking the Minister just yet, until I hear what he has to say on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley is attacking the 1967 Income Tax Act and the earlier Acts of 1958, 1959 and 1965.  If there is an element of unfair discrimination this has been in our statutes for 19 years.  There is difference of treatment because the emoluments during employment and the pension arrangements are different.  The few people in the public service who may even remotely come near the figure of income that we are talking about in this section enjoy these higher incomes for a very short time.  As a rule it is only for the last five years or so of their working life, before compulsory retirement, that they enjoy such incomes, whereas in the private sector it is not unusual for such incomes to be enjoyed for a much longer period.  Because of the way in which the Schedule D system operates as against the very strict way in which PAYE operates, it is not unknown for people with particular levels of income under Schedule D to pay a lower amount of tax than people who are on the PAYE system.  When all the calculations are done in trying to ascertain whether or not Mr. Black and Mr. White are being treated in exactly the same way, it will be found that there are pluses and minuses on both sides.  Deputy Colley knows that well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1447" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions in this regard were made in the 1967 Income Tax Act and earlier, but the Minister knows very well that in 1967 the position of even the most senior members of the public service did not compare with the persons who would have been at the maximum level envisaged in this section.  That position has been changed. Furthermore, the Minister knows something at least of the inflation which has operated in recent years which has distorted the whole value of the concession involved in this section.  The comparison that the Minister is trying to make, therefore, is quite spurious. It is true that some persons in the private sector manage to evade paying the full amount of income tax they should pay.  It is not unknown that persons in the public sector who engage in outside activities evade tax on them.  That is no reason for penalising the whole public sector, nor is it any reason, because some persons in the public sector evade their tax liabilities, for penalising the whole private sector.  That argument will not do.  The Minister is trying to tar the whole private sector with the brush of tax evasion.  That will not do.  We are dealing here with persons who are assumed, until it has been proved otherwise, to be paying their full liability for tax.  If they are not doing so they should not be dealt with by a blanket approach to the whole private sector under this section.  They should be dealt with in another way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, the question arises of how such people are dealt with in the private sector.  If you give a little thought to it for a moment and assume a person in the private sector has to make provision for himself and his wife in old age, with no assistance from anywhere else, you realise he would need to be earning over many years a great deal more money than his opposite number in the public sector if he is to make any kind of adequate provision.  We could get into very deep water if we tried to allege that somebody who is earning more in the private sector is thereby so much better off than somebody in the public sector if we do not try to give him <Col N="1448" /> equal treatment in regard to making provision for his old age.</P>
    <P>Of course, this kind of saving, if you like, ought to be encouraged anyway from an overall economic point of view.  I will not pursue that.  What I am concerned with, what I tried to draw attention to, is the fact&mdash;and from what he has said the Minister has not really denied this&mdash;that there is discrimination in the way persons who are self-employed are treated in regard to their provision for old age as against a person employed in the public sector.  I have asked the Minister to try to justify this.  Maybe he has done so, but I do not think he has and I doubt that many persons who are self-employed would think so.  I would also doubt that many persons in the public sector who have any sense of fair play would agree with the Minister's approach to this matter.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister on section 3 if he can confirm that the two definitions with which we are dealing here apply to exactly the same kind of company and that there is no extension in meaning. I will elaborate on that to explain what I mean.  Section 3 amends section 59 of the Finance Act, 1974.  In that section there was reference to a company which, if incorporated in the State, would be a company within the meaning of section 530 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  That section 530 contained the definition of what was normally regarded as a controlled company and companies which came within that definition were those to which subsection (3) applied.  The definition of a close company is long <Col N="1449" /> and complex and it is subject to modification in section 95.</P>
      <P>It is not clear that what is a close company under the Corporation Tax Act is exactly the same as what may be called a controlled company under subsection (6) of section 530 of the Income Tax Act.  If these definitions do not correspond, it is possible that there is not a complete overlap of definition.  An important factor in this is that this proposed amendment in section 3 of this Bill is to take effect from 31st March, 1976.  Consequently, it is important to be sure that no company acting in the belief that it did not come within the provisions of the Finance Act, 1974, will now find itself retrospectively within the definition and will be obliged to provide information which, up to the present, it did not think itself obliged to provide. I would ask the Minister, therefore, to assure the House that what is being substituted does not involve any extension in meaning and that no company will find itself at a disadvantage because of this change.</P>

      <P>This section makes a technical amendment to section 59 of the Finance Act, 1974.  In subsection (3) of that section there is a reference to bodies corporate within the meaning of section 530 (6) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, that is, broadly, private companies under the control of not more than five persons.  Section 530 was repealed by the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, and, therefore, it is necessary to substitute a new reference. The most appropriate one is a reference to close companies within the meaning of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976.  Since that Act which repealed the provision containing the existing reference passed into law on 31st March, 1976, a new reference is being substituted with effect from that date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is part of the exercise to try to treat all taxpayers as far as practicable in a similar way. As we know, PAYE taxpayers are involved in direct payment of tax at the moment of receipt of their income and in equity it was necessary to endeavour to accelerate the date on which tax was payable by other people.  That was the reason for advancing the date of payment of tax by Schedule D <Col N="1451" /> payers and persons paying tax on unearned income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Minister is aware that one of the consequences of this is that people are being obliged to pay a full year's tax on what is supposed to be unearned income before they receive it and in many cases in due course they do not receive the income which they are expected to receive and then they have to go through the procedure involved in trying to recover the money paid.  The big objection is that they are obliged to pay on income which they have not received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the considerations which led me to change the date from 1st July to 1st September, as proposed in this Bill.  Tax will now be payable five months after the commencement of the tax year and interest on the delayed payments is not chargeable unless payments are not made by 1st November, that is, seven months after the commencement of the tax year.  There is a seven month holiday &mdash;if I may use that word&mdash;available to such taxpayers which, of course, is not available to PAYE payers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, I presume the Minister would accept the fact that even with the proposed later date in this section we will still have a situation in which people will be paying tax on income they have not received, in regard to unearned income.  Regarding earned income, the move involved in this section is in the right direction and I suppose we should welcome it, although it highlights the wrongheaded approach by the Minister last year when it was pointed out to him from all sides, not least from this side, that what he was doing was wrong.  He refused to listen.  I suppose the fact that he is now proposing to extend the date for payment is at least a partial acknowledgment of the correctness of the arguments put forward at that time from this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the move but I suggest it does not go far enough because many taxpayers will be obliged to pay four half-yearly instalments of tax in <Col N="1452" /> a period of 18 months.  The case still arises and the Minister is obliged to explain why he feels that he should not grant to such taxpayers the same concession that was granted to PAYE payers and to the public service when they were brought from the deferred payment system on to the PAYE system.  They were given six months' remission of tax.  Indeed, in virtually every case of a change, a six months' remission of tax was granted but it was refused in this case.  We are dealing in the main with the self-employed. There is an onus on the Minister to justify what appears to be discriminatory treatment of those who are self-employed as against the rest of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody knows better than those who have made representations in this area why the request which they make is not a meritorious one.  Those who pay tax on the Schedule D basis are paying tax on a preceding year basis.  Those members of the public in the private sector and those serving in the public sector who received a six months' remission of tax when they were transferred from a preceding year to a current year basis obtained the concession because they were being changed from an advantageous position to one that is less advantageous and which involves a higher amount of tax.  There is no increase in the tax burden of Schedule D payers; the date of payment is being advanced but there is no increase in the burden.  At a time of escalation of incomes it is a very substantial benefit to be allowed to pay one's tax on a preceding year basis rather than on a current year basis. That case was very well made in the media last year when people in the public service were transferred from a preceding year to a current year basis. If the day were to arrive when Schedule D payers paid on a current year rather than a preceding year basis then a case could be made, which I believe could not be refused, for a remission to allow such people to adjust to a current rather than a preceding year basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central):</i> I intend to confine myself to section 4 and point out to the Minister the result of the introduction of this section.  The biggest problem for industrialists and business people over the past two years was that of cash flow.  Many firms had to close down because their borrowings were too <Col N="1455" /> high and that played no small part in putting many people out of work.  The tax here is very seldom liquid cash in the hands of the business community. I doubt if the Minister will understand at this late stage of this Dáil but representations were made to him about the problems this tax would create.  Cash that would normally be ploughed back into the business for expansion purposes or to purchase goods had to be taken out and, operating under a fairly rigid bank control, there were only two options. The cash they had had to be forwarded to the Revenue Commissioners and they had to run down their stocks and the net effect of that would be a certain amount of unemployment.  To survive they had to try to put off the Revenue Commissioners' demands and keep their cash flow.  The Minister could not have picked a worse time to introduce this kind of legislation when cash in every company was at its lowest.  The Confederation of Irish Industry and people engaged in business made representations to the Minister. We made representations on the Finance Bill last year.  We told the Minister what the consequences would be.  The section certainly had a detrimental effect on the cash flow in many companies with consequent unemployment and a cessation to expansion in many industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has seen the light now and that is the only reason he is doing what is proposed here.  Surely he is not telling us now that it is because of complications in accountancy that he is deferring this.  That is not the reason at all.  The fact is this created an impossible burden on certain companies who could not meet their commitments and that is the reason the Minister is forced to bring in this section deferring payment.  One has only to read the reports of companies over the past two or three years about the reduction in retained profits to realise what the situation was.  I do not care what the Minister says about expansion in the majority of companies. They have had to borrow and they have suffered a reduction in retained <Col N="1456" /> profits and it will take them a long time to accumulate sufficient to start expanding again.  The real sufferers are, of course, the thousands of people who are unemployed today because of the fiscal policy of the Minister.  That has been the result of the various Finance Bills introduced by the Minister over the past three or four years.  His negative approach has resulted in a substantial increase in unemployment.  We pointed out time and time again what the consequences of his policy would be.  He is now deferring payment, but the damage has been done.  Confidence will not be regained for a long time.  The only reason for this concession at this late stage is because of the strong representations made to him.  He has had to make other concessions, concessions we demanded if the country was to get moving again.  He is doing this on the eve of a general election and, if he thinks for one moment that industrialists and business people are taking this seriously, he can think again.  It is a step in the right direction but it is a step that should not have been necessary.</P>

He made several comments not relevant to this Finance Bill but they can be quickly dealt with.  The growth in unemployment was less here than anywhere else in Europe.  Recovery is faster here than anywhere else in Europe.  Company profits are better here than anywhere else in Europe. Industrial exports have risen by 52 per cent this year compared with last year.  All this emotional talk from the keeners in Fianna Fáil does not reflect the improvement.  Neither does it relate to the findings of the innumerable objective assessors of the performance of our economy.  It is very interesting.  Week in and week out, month in and month out, we used to hear from the Opposition lengthy quotations from every book or journal dealing with statistics which they could find suggesting everything was wrong with the economy.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the Minister did not accede to the requests for cuts in income tax at the time he should have done so.  He waited until inflation had eroded any benefits that were still there from the previous tax cuts under Fianna Fáil and then made very grudging adjustments. Finally, having studied the Fianna Fáil economic proposals he picked out parts of them including tax cuts but he did not do it adequately.  He did not understand the role of tax cuts in the economic management of our country <Col N="1458" /> in relation to the achievement of competitiveness in industry by the proper combination between tax cuts and pay rises so that one could ensure the standard of living of our workers and, at the same time, the competitiveness of our goods, thereby saving thousands of jobs.  Those jobs should have been saved over the past few years but were lost by the wrong approach by the Minister.  We have here a belated acknowledgment of the correctness of the policies we have been urging for so long on the Minister.  This is not adequate although it is a move in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Usually when the Minister belatedly takes a move which we have been urging on him for a long time one can be sure it is in the right direction but one can be almost as sure that it will not be enough.  In this case if one takes an overall view of the situation one finds that a married man with two children who is earning £2,500 per year would save under this section £57.60 income tax while a married man with two children earning £20,000 per year would save almost £2,000. The Minister would try to justify that by saying that many other people in the top earning bracket were giving up and saying that they had not adequate incentive when they are asked to pay a 77 per cent rate of tax, the latest imposed by the Minister.  The fact is that if this section was supposed to be designed to provide some kind of incentive then it should provide an incentive for people in what might be called the middle-management bracket. It does not do so.  In anything I am saying I am ignoring the position with regard to the combination of tax cuts and the national pay agreement although it is very relevant and the Minister would acknowledge that there is a close connection between the two. The fact is, taking the tax cuts in conjunction with the national pay agreement, most workers are going to have a very definite fall in their standard of living this year.  The Minister said that the combination would give the average industrial worker an increase in take home pay of 10 per cent.  Even the most optimistic preelection estimates of inflation do not put it as low as that.  I believe 13 per <Col N="1459" /> cent is the lowest figure we have got so far but I expect it will go lower before the election.  I doubt if it will go as low as 10 per cent in the next three weeks, though the Minister might be tempted.  I have no doubt that some belated concern for credibility would prevent him going that far.</P>
    <P>If we take 10 per cent as the increase provided in take home pay as a result of this section and the national pay agreement for the average industrial worker and if we take inflation as only 13 per cent this year then there is clearly a fall in the standard of living of the average worker.  There need not be such a fall if the matter was handled properly.  The Minister may talk as much as he likes about how welcome the tax cuts are&mdash;any tax cuts are welcome&mdash;but the reality is that what he is talking about is a cut in the standard of living of most of the workers.  The fact that that cut will only begin to bite later in the year has also a certain electoral significance and is not irrelevant to the date of the timing of the general election.</P>
    <P>I was adverting to the position of people in middle-management and it should be realised that if one takes the position of a married man with two children on a salary of about £7,000 per year the changes produced in this Bill give him about £5 per week apparent increase in take home pay.  This would be so whether he has children or not.  There is effectively, in such a case, no real increase in after-tax income because of the erosion by inflation of the relief proposed to be given.  If we bear in mind that many persons in middle-management are provided with cars to carry out their business and that they will be charged tax under the penal arrangements we were adverting to yesterday, and that the Revenue Commissioners are still trying to catch up on some&mdash;we know they have not caught up on these; they are stretched to the full in relation to this and many other matters&mdash;effectively this year people in income brackets of between £5,000 and £7,000 per year will find that they will be paying more in income tax than they did last year if one combines these two <Col N="1460" /> factors.  Of course, when one throws in the erosion of inflation their position disimproves.  The Minister cannot with any sense of reality claim that in such cases anything he has done will act as an incentive to such people.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to provide an incentive to people at that level he should have another hard look at the provisions he has brought in with regard to benefit in kind from cars supplied for business.  I am not saying that that should not be taxed at all but he should bring in a system which is fairer and less costly to administer. Another thing which the Minister ought to advert to in his consideration of tax cuts is that many people in the income brackets between £4,000 and £8,000 per year are young married couples who are endeavouring to buy their houses on mortgages.  With the price of houses going up as they have been, and the price is continuing to rise, the restriction on income relief to £2,000 has hit that income group very harshly.  If the Minister was serious about providing incentives, he could start by making special provision for interest paid on house mortgages and treat this interest as a separate category.  He would allow income tax relief in full for tax purposes in cases of that kind.  They are the sort of measures that would help people meet the increasing costs with which they are faced&mdash;the increasing cost of housing in particular&mdash;and the diminishing value of money.  They would also enable people anxious to progress to see some results in effective after-tax income as a result of their efforts.</P>
    <P>Another general comment that must be made is that the provisions of this section relate to a tax relief for a married man of about 9 per cent; in the case of a single person, 7 per cent and for a widowed person, 3 per cent. There is no attempt to keep pace with inflation and no differentiation at all between married people with children and those who have no children. I wonder how there could be any justification or attempt at justification from a social point of view for refusing to increase the tax allowances in respect of a child which is £240 at present. <Col N="1461" /> Effectively the same tax relief is being given under this section to a married couple with no children as to a married couple with ten children.  That is hardly a justifiable approach and certainly is not one that can be said to be based on social justice.</P>
    <P>The general approach by the Minister in this regard has been, I believe, defective both from an economic and social point of view.  I know the Minister is going to say that these income tax cuts are widely welcomed.  He need not try to make any argument out of that because we are not arguing with him.  As I said any tax cut is widely welcomed.  These tax cuts are not sufficient or geared to the situation of most married couples.  They do not recognise the difficulties these people are facing trying to bring up their children. They do not keep pace with inflation.</P>
    <P>The sad fact is that any chance of ever restoring the taxpayer to his position as it was under Fianna Fáil seems to have gone because the present Government in the adjustment they have made in income tax since they came into office have not remotely kept pace with inflation.  Therefore, the position of the taxpayer in real terms is considerably worse now in many cases than it was when this Government came into office.  The gap is so great that it is probably unrealistic to think it will ever be restored.</P>
    <P>The Minister instead of&mdash;as I have heard him doing and I suspect he may want to do again&mdash;crowing about his belated conversion to Fianna Fáil policy on tax cuts, ought to be telling us what he intended to do to extend the tax cuts proposed in this section, having regard to the social obligations of taxpayers and of the Minister, and to the economic effect which is being achieved by this and which should be achieved by tax cuts in our present circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want very briefly because the time at our disposal is very limited to support my colleague Deputy Colley in what he said about the level of the burden of taxation.  I want as quickly as I can to rebut totally and completely and to reject the fraudulent claims by the Minister <Col N="1462" /> that the economy is in a good state, is improving, or any of the other things he claims are happening.</P>
      <P>The fact is that the marginal figures which the Minister and his colleagues are fastening on with such pathetic eagerness are nothing more than minor improvements brought about by the swing of the pendulum.  If an economy goes down to a certain level, by the sheer reaction of certain circumstances some improvement must come as companies restock and as individuals undertake expenditures they cannot put off.  As I said, that is the sort of thing which happens inevitably through the swing of the pendulum and that is all that is happening at the moment in our case.</P>
      <P>The deep underlying problems of our economy are as real today as they were 12 months ago.  It is absolutely fraudulent and dishonest of the Minister to endeavour to persuade this House and the country that just because there is a general election in the offing our economy is getting better and all is well.  That is simply not the case.  The Minister asked us to give him a quotation.  I would quote the vice president of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions speaking two days ago.  He said that far from things getting better in the employment field, they are getting worse.  In his estimate, very shortly there will be 120,000 persons unemployed, not 112,000 or 114,000 as we have at the moment.  Let the Minister be honest with the House and with the people and face up to the reality that we are in a catastrophic economic situation and are making no attempts to get to grips with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has destroyed and ruined incentive and enterprise in this country.  He has killed them.  As Minister for Finance he set out with a certain objective in mind.  He got it all wrong.  He misread our situation completely. He set out to be a Minister for taxes.  He set out to be the greatest Minister for taxation this country or any other country had ever seen.  He wanted to have a perfect textbook taxation structure here but, of course, he would never succeed in doing that. In the process he neglected his real job as the Minister for economic development. <Col N="1463" /> Instead of trying to improve the size of the national cake, of trying to create more resources and more income, he concentrated all his efforts on squeezing more and more out of existing income.  The more he did that the more he depressed the level.  He is, historically, a tragedy for this country in the economic sense.</P>
    <P>He may get some satisfaction from the fact that he introduced all sorts of new taxes and he pursued various objectives.  I am not denying he honestly pursued the objective of equity in the tax system.  I am saying that he totally misread our economic situation and our economic needs.</P>
    <P>I have a very simple proposition to put to the Minister in regard to our economic situation.  What we need is a restoration of incentive and enterprise. We want productivity.  The only way to get productivity is by giving people a reward.  We want more people at every level of our society working more effectively and efficiently and producing better and cheaper goods and services.  That is the only way out of our difficulty.  Anything else is only tampering with the situation and not getting to grips with it.</P>
    <P>The way to get productivity is to restore the rewards for work.  The only way that can be done is by substantially reducing the level of personal taxation.  In all the gamut of statistics we have connection with this Bill, in Table 6&mdash;the Minister supplies very informative tables with the budget speech&mdash;he sets out the income tax which will now be payable by a married man with two children.  A man earning £3,500 a year will now pay £497 tax, almost £500.  In this day for a man earning £70 a week to pay £10 in tax is absurd and ridiculous. Until we effect a major change in that sort of situation, we will not get this country moving again.  We will not be able to tackle our fundamental long-term problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is leaving office after four-and-a-half years.  I must say with great regret that he has left our situation in regard to the economy in a pathetically worse state <Col N="1464" /> than he found it.  Any impartial observer would admit that.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out a few moments ago, this is largely due to the obsessive concentration of this Minister for Finance on taxation to the exclusion of everything else.</P>
    <P>We all know the country must be run and the money must be found to run it.  We all want fairness and equity in our taxation system.  I suggest that the Minister has concentrated his efforts, the efforts of the civil servants, the Revenue Commissioners and everyone under his command, on this one aspect of his duties to the exclusion of all others.</P>
    <P>When we come back into office we will have as a major plank in our programme, as a major factor in getting the economy moving again, the restoration of enterprise by rewards for effort.  We will do that by a major and substantial reduction in personal taxation.  My colleague, Deputy Colley, will be outlining our proposals in that regard very shortly.  However we might differ on what particular reductions should be made or on how or where they should be made in fairness to different sections of the community, there is no doubt in my mind or the minds of my colleagues that a major reduction in the level of taxation on personal earned income is what is urgently needed.  We shall not get out of our difficulties until we have that. That is my suggestion to the Minister.</P>

      <P>We have written into our business tax code now a top rate of 45 per cent corporation tax. The Opposition, when in office, indulged in a taxation rate of 58 per cent on business.  A year after we went into office we reduced the top rate of income tax from 80 per cent to 70 per cent.  The reductions of this year are part of a pattern of substantial tax relief and reform which this Government have enacted in the past few years in the teeth of virulent and continuous opposition from the party opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to go into a lengthy dissertation about economic performance because we are dealing with income tax on this section.  But Deputy Haughey has chosen to describe the Irish economy as a very sick one.  I do not know where these stone-age Fianna Fáil men have been for the last few years: they must have been in their caves.  They have never recognised what the Irish people have <Col N="1467" /> obviously recognised that there has been a world economic crisis.  They are not prepared to accept that could have had an impact on our economy. Of course it had an immense impact. But we in Ireland did not suffer as serious a decline as any member of the EEC.  Our rate of recovery is faster than that being achieved in the EEC. Last year we had a growth rate of 3½ per cent; this year it is moving towards 4½ per cent and it would appear that we shall have a 5 per cent growth rate this year, putting us at the top of economic performance in Europe.  This is being acknowledged not merely by objective commentators at home but also by the EEC itself under the OECD which recognise Ireland as <i>Le Monde</i> recently described as &ldquo;the Singapore of Europe&rdquo;, Singapore being the great economic success of Asia.  Europe recognises that Ireland is the greatest economic success of Europe at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unemployment figures are dropping.  With Germany and Holland, Ireland will have a reduction in unemployment this year. These reductions have been taking place and we have about 6,000 fewer unemployed since last summer.  As the main impact of the budget expenditure of £56 million for direct stimulation of employment and the business incentives and tax reductions we have given will have most impact from now on, the unemployment figures will by this summer be down to 95,000 or possibly less.  This is a move in the right direction.  The country is moving in the right direction.  I shudder to think of what would happen if those who have attacked our policies that have achieved this success were ever to achieve their ambition to move the country because clearly they disagree with the direction in which we are moving it; they want to move it in the opposite direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to conclude by coming back to this section dealing with income tax and to quote the remarks <Col N="1468" /> of the then president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland who said of this year's tax reductions:</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan's proposals on taxation are imaginative and politically courageous and have already contributed significantly to a revival of business confidence.</P>
    <P>These are the words of an objective professional accountant and businessman who, in his term of office, has also offered his criticisms of various Government measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is like a condemned man saying a prayer for his executioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was his valedictory address as he handed over office to another.  He was expressing his confidence that the right decisions had been taken.  The reliefs this year would not be possible and the further reliefs, to which in our second term of office we will give effect, would not be possible had it not been for the fact that in the teeth of the most virulent opposition we amended the most antiquated, inequitable and inefficient taxation system which we inherited from our predecessors. I could not find any country where so little was done by way of tax reform in the previous decade as was done in Ireland.  Virtually nothing was done except an odd bit of cosmetic work here and there.  There was nothing of a significant or worth-while nature.  We have done the job; we have succeeded. We have proved our successes by being able to achieve the remarkable improvement in the whole taxation climate which is part and parcel of our budget policy for 1977 and one to which we are committed for several years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am looking forward to the entertainment of Deputy Colley saying how he is virtually going to abolish taxation and spend money right, left and centre.  That is the policy of spendthrifts. It is the kind of thing one expects from a group who have no serious prospect of entering into office because anybody with a serious ambition would never pretend that taxes can be abolished and more money <Col N="1469" /> spent.  That gets a country very quickly into bankruptcy; it happens in a matter of months.  Even in the midst of all our difficulties we never had to go cap in hand to the International Monetary Fund&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What the Deputy has said is true but does he know the reason?  When the Fianna Fáil stone-age men were in their caves the world was going through a recession.  There was a massive transfer of resources from the industrialised world of which we are a part to the OPEC countries to pay for the price of oil which had quintupled in that time.  Fianna Fáil apparently did not know that 75 per cent of the energy of this country has to be produced from imported oil. The Deputies should stop talking this nonsense.  They should stop trying to compare the world economic position of 1973 to 1977; with those halcyon days when they were in power&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When Fianna Fáil were in power they dragged down the economy.  When the world was experiencing economic expansion all we could do was to crawl along after the world. <Col N="1470" /> When the world had an economic recession we did not go into the deep recession the rest of the world experienced. Certainly we had our difficulties and we never tried to conceal them. They were painful and inconvenient and they were very serious for some people but at least we provided, in the teeth of Fianna Fáil opposition, as much relief as could be provided for those who suffered particular problems during those traumatic years for all of the world.  Many of those problems are still with us and they remain with the rest of the world but in the midst of it all we protected Ireland from the worst.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the greatest compliment that can be paid to me is the suggestion that comes from the cavemen of Fianna Fáil that Richie Ryan alone was the man who caused the greatest economic recession in the world since 1973 because that is what they are saying.  They say that nobody except this Government was responsible for the traumatic events the world has experienced in the past few years.  Fianna Fáil should come out of their caves.  They should put on their earphones and hear what is happening in the outside world.</P>

      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): As Deputies Colley and Haughey have pointed out, the fiscal policy of the last four years has discouraged businessmen from investing and we know the consequences. Thousands of people would be employed today but for the policy adopted by the Minister.  All of us welcome a reduction in tax.  As Deputy Haughey has said, it is the one way to instil confidence.  The policy pursued by the Minister in the past four years has undermined that confidence and that is the difference between this party and the Government.  The Government do not know how to create a climate that will encourage industrialists and businessmen to expand their undertakings.  Our future prosperity depends on the ability to generate wealth.  In this way the weaker sections are helped.  That is what we will do in our economic policy.  That is how we will give a reduction in taxation because we will be able to instil confidence among all sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the budget debate the Minister for Finance spoke at length about the great taxation reduction and what they would mean to the average wage earner.  They were part of the package of the national wage agreement.  We know from statements of leaders of trade unions and many workers that their standard of living is 4 per cent or 5 per cent lower than what it was six months ago.  That is what the <Col N="1472" /> taxation package meant to the workers.</P>
    <P>During the negotiations with regard to the national wage agreement the workers did not know that the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce were withholding the report of the National Prices Commission until the package was negotiated. We know the consequences when the report was published about a week after the package was sealed.  The wage earners realised how they had been &ldquo;conned&rdquo; into accepting the taxation measures and they resented it. They realised the Minister for Finance had fooled them with false promises. The same thing will happen one month from now.</P>
    <P>Various Ministers are going around the country making all kinds of promises.  They are trying to create the same kind of climate that existed when the national wage agreement was being negotiated.  If the people are foolish enough to accept these false promises the consequences are that the Minister for Finance will be back in the Dáil next September introducing another budget.  The Government have no plan to provide the necessary money to pay for all the undertakings he is giving now.  The people will have to realise that before they cast their votes in the near future. They need only to think back to February and they can see how they were fooled by the Minister for Finance.  Many promises are being made by various Ministers today.  If they think the people attach any significance to them they are mistaken. The people have already learned their lesson.</P>
    <P>We welcome various taxation measures, as I have already said, but we must remember there are people who pay no income tax.  People with families of six and seven children who are probably paying for their houses did not qualify for any tax relief in the budget.  Any man with an income of £3,000 or £4,000 and with four children did not get any tax relief either.  That man belongs to the lower income group and was not paying tax.  At the same time he had to accept the low terms of the national wage agreement.  I know that certain <Col N="1473" /> sections in the table provided will qualify but there are many thousands of people who will not.  Many people have told me that the reduction in income tax meant nothing to them as they were not paying any income tax because of their low wages and high overheads.  Those people will not thank the Minister for anything contained in the budget.</P>
    <P>There are several aspects of this matter which should be taken into consideration. As Deputy Haughey stated the excessive taxation policy which has been pursued by the Minister for Finance during the past four years has undermined confidence in the country and retarded expansion.  The Minister will certainly be remembered as the Minister for taxation.  The business journals have a different name for him which is not nearly as complimentary as the title given by Deputy Haughey.  The people have been misled in the past but I do not believe they will be misled in the future.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 6, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in this or any other enactment no charge to tax shall be made on any person in respect of any benefit derived by him from the provision of a vehicle where such person is wholly and exclusively employed in the capacity of commercial traveller by the person or organisation supplying the vehicle.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I trust that the fundamental disagreement which exists between the Minister for Finance and myself on economic and taxation policies generally will not have any effect on his consideration of this amendment.  I ask him to consider it seriously on its merits on the grounds of fairness and equity.  I want in this amendment to achieve a situation where a genuine whole-time commercial traveller will <Col N="1474" /> not be taxed on some imaginative benefit which the Revenue Commissioners believe he derives from being provided with a company car.</P>
    <P>We had a discussion yesterday evening about benefits in kind which taxpayers derive from being provided with company motor cars.  I want to indicate to the Minister as clearly as I can that in this amendment I am not concerned with people who really derive benefit from having cars provided by their companies which in effect is an addition to their incomes. I would like on another occasion to argue with the Minister about that whole taxation provision and perhaps persuade him, as Deputy Colley attempted to do, to alter the system, not necessarily change the principle.</P>
    <P>I am concerned in this amendment with a very limited and clearly defined situation.  I am not concerned with the managing director or the general manager who has a large car placed at his disposal by an appreciative company, which in fact amounts to a substantial perquisite in his case. I am concerned solely with commercial travellers, men who are fully occupied by an employer, a company or an individual as commercial travellers. I did not put down this amendment because of any approach from commercial travellers as an organisation.</P>
    <P>This matter was brought to my attention very definitely and very clearly by a constituent of mine who is a commercial traveller.  He is a hard working individual and is married with six children.  He has a moderate income and he received from the Revenue Commissioners an additional assessment going back over four or five years which amounted to £300 or £400.  This was a crushing blow to this man.  He is, like many other people, particularly the white collar category, continually striving to make ends meet.  He has to pay for practically everything for himself and for his family.  He gets very few free services from any organisation.  He is just about able to make ends meet from month to month.</P>
    <P>This extra additional taxation was a crushing hardship inflicted on him <Col N="1475" /> because in the view of the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners he is deriving some tangible benefit from the car provided for him by the company he works for.  That car is an absolute necessity.  He leaves his family early on a Monday morning and travels throughout the country on his company's business and returns home on a Friday night or maybe a Saturday morning.  It is both absurd and ridiculous to suggest that he is deriving some positive benefit by reason of that car being provided for him.</P>
    <P>The commercial traveller has a difficult and tedious sort of life which involves most of the men and women concerned being away from home from Monday to Friday and living during the week in difficult and unsatisfactory conditions around the country.  It is unreal as well as unfair to suggest that they be taxed on some imaginary benefit.  Their companies provide cars so that the travellers can pursue their occupation and carry out the work of the organisations concerned.  I came to this situation as a result of having been made aware of the dilemma of a constituent of mine.  This is a hard-working, family man who is pushed hard to make ends meet in the normal course of events.  Suddenly he has received an assessment for income tax in respect of an imaginary benefit.  He simply does not understand the reasoning behind this.  I endeavoured to explain to him the concept of benefits in kind and he suggested that if it would suit the Revenue Commissioners he would be prepared to leave his car at his company's premises during week-ends, that he would arrive at his office early on Monday morning and get away as quickly as possible if this would prevent the Revenue Commissioners from placing that unfair imposition on him.  I was unable to put across to that man the idea behind these assessments.  I am asking the Minister to look at the situation of this category of persons who do not derive any positive satisfactory benefit from these company cars.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that they have the use of the cars at weekends but people who drive around the country <Col N="1476" /> from Monday to Friday in pursuance of their daily work have no wish to go on long drives on Sundays.  Therefore, so far as the physical use of a car at weekends is concerned, the Minister can be assured that the people we are talking of engage only in the minimal amount of driving in their free time.  I should like the Minister to tell me whether, if a commercial traveller leaves his car at his company's premises during the weekend, the Revenue Commissioners will insist on assessing him for benefits in kind.</P>
    <P>When the person to whom I have referred brought this matter to my attention I decided to investigate further and I asked a number of other commercial travellers with whom I am acquainted what was the situation. They had all had a similar experience and all equally resented these assessments which they do not regard as either just or fair in their case.  One very experienced commercial traveller told me that in most cases the tax-free allowances in respect of his friends on the road have been reduced by between £300 and £600 as a result of this alleged benefit in kind.</P>
    <P>It is absurd to tell an ordinary hard-working commercial traveller that he is deriving £600 worth of benefit simply by having provided a car for use in the pursuance of the business of his organisation.  I asked the Minister not to quote to me the case of the higher-paid executive who derives substantial benefit from his car.  As Deputy Colley has said, we can argue that case some other time on its merits.  Therefore, I ask the Minister not to confuse the issue by dragging in the situation of the managing director with the Mercedes.  This argument is totally restricted to commercial travellers. However, I wish to say a word about the big car in this context. Many commercial travellers by reason of the mileage they do and by reason of the type of goods they carry need big cars.  In the course of his political career the Minister, like the rest of us, travels a fair deal and he knows that if one is doing a lot of what is known as country work there is a major difference, from the point of view of one's performance, capacity, safety and <Col N="1477" /> well-being, between a big car and a small car.  For the commercial traveller who must carry a range of goods either a saloon-type car or a station wagon-type is necessary.  I am making that point so that the Minister will not introduce the big car as a luxury item where the commercial traveller is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am asking him to consider favourably the case I have made and not to give me the argument that if this concession is granted a corresponding burden must be placed on somebody else.  That is an argument that is more apparent than real.  First, it discounts any possibility of revenue buoyancy. As the Minister knows, it is possible for him to make concessions in the tax system without necessarily imposing a corresponding burden on another section. A concession can be taken care of in the general overall increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  This year he is granting concessions to the extent of £50 million and is relying on revenue buoyancy and on the general overall increase in tax revenue to cope with that.  Likewise, he could grant to commercial travellers the limited concession we are seeking without necessarily placing a corresponding burden on some other section.</P>
      <P>I recall the introduction here of the benefit in kind provisions.  I have a clear recollection of the argument that took place at that time when the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Jim Ryan, was quoting instances of companies who supplied yachts on the Mediterranean for their executives.  That was the sort of benefit in kind we were concerned with then&mdash;really significant benefits which were an abuse of the taxation system and which in some cases involved companies providing fully-furnished houses free of charge for their executives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Down through the years this concept of benefit in kind has been refined considerably, but the Minister is pushing it too far.  He has pushed it to the extent that this hard-working, dedicated group of people, whose services <Col N="1478" /> are essential to the commercial life and on the success of whose efforts depends the future of the well-being of a great many of our commercial organisations, are being treated unfairly and unjustly.  There is no point in producing goods if they cannot be sold.  It is the job of the commercial traveller to bring together the produce and the purchaser.  He knows the trade and the country.  He knows which goods will sell in individual areas.  In other words, his is a very skilled profession.  A car is an essential part of the work.  It is grossly unfair to suggest that these men derive some benefit in kind because the car is provided for them by the company and that they should suffer these additional assessments because of this imaginary benefit.  I recommend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>The situation described by Deputy Haughey of a commercial traveller receiving a bill in respect of four years' use of a car does not arise out of any legislation passed by this Government.  That liability could have arisen only out of the tax position which existed before we legislated in 1976.  Under the old code a liability existed to pay tax in respect of a car supplied by a firm who entitled the employee to use it for private purposes.  The only circumstances in which a four years' bill for arrears could have arisen would be if there was non-disclosure by the person in question to the Revenue Commissioners of his having a car.  Deputy Haughey, as an accountant, knows that to be true.  That applies not merely to a person who is the recipient of a car provided by a firm.  The same liability in respect of private use of a car arises indirectly in respect of a professional man or a self-employed business person who uses his private car both for his professional or business work and for his private use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Liability has always been there. There is no change whatsoever in the law in that regard.  What we did here was to try to firm up, in the interest of the taxpayer as well as of ease of administration, the means of assessing the value of a car provided for private use as well as for commercial purposes. <Col N="1479" /> If a car provided for a commercial traveller is left in the firm's premises when the commercial traveller is not working, then no liability or taxation of benefit in kind arises.  If a commercial traveller returns to base on the Friday night and leaves the car on the firm's premises and does not use it until the Monday morning, then a liability to benefit in kind taxation does not arise because there is no element of private use.</P>

      <P>As politicians go about the country they meet these lonely and hard-working men in hotels scattered throughout the length and breadth of the land.  They are unfortunate enough at times to have to be away from their families during the week.  The mere&mdash;I do not use that word in any derogatory way&mdash;difficulties or unpleasant nature of a profession do not entitle a person to a lower rate of tax because of the unsocial, as it is called, nature of a job.  I do not think that Deputy Haughey is suggestting that there should be a lower rate of tax for people because their jobs are less pleasant than the job of another.  Far away hills are always green agus bíonn adharca fada ar na buaibh thar lear.  Somebody else's job probably always looks more attractive than one's own.  I could visualise endless arguments as to what should be the appropriate rate of tax if we are to incorporate a greater easement of the tax burden according to the nature of the occupation.  It is not feasible to provide a tax system of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for the £300 minimum <Col N="1480" /> benefit in kind charge or 15 per cent of the cost of the vehicle is that on average nowadays people work five days a week and if a person has a car assigned to him by a firm he has a car available for private use on two days a week.  The 15 per cent element is a very small percentage when you consider that the car may be used on two days a week.  I agree with Deputy Haughey, again from my own knowledge of commercial travellers and their social habits, that they may have little inclination to go on long drives on Sundays, even to take the family out, which many of them do as an obligation because of the pleasure of being with their families.  They do not do it as a first choice but nevertheless they do it.  Often such a car may be driven by the spouse or other member of the family and not only by the commercial traveller himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Short of policing every car that is issued to a commercial traveller you cannot determine precisely the extent of a person's use. The reason for bringing in some relevant basis last year was that that difficulty existed and endless arguments went on.  Sometimes the arguments went on so long that years of arrears built up.  Maybe that was the case in respect of Deputy Haughey's constituent, that the arguments went on for a considerable time until ultimately the true facts were established and then a considerable amount had to be paid.  Whenever any cases of that kind have been brought to my notice I have happily requested the Revenue Commissioners to extend the period over which any such tax arrears might be paid.  However, the Revenue Commissioners are independent in the exercise of their duty and may, and frequently do, totally ignore representations from a Minister for Finance or from any other source.  It is their duty to be neutral in the operation of the tax code, a duty which they discharge with total integrity.  It is also appropriate that they be humane in their enforcement of the tax law, and invariably they are humane and will give <Col N="1481" /> persons who find themselves with an unexpected bill of arrears some reasonable time to pay.  They are particularly well disposed if the bill for arrears should have arisen due to ignorance or involuntary omission rather than deliberate intent to commit fraud.</P>
      <P>The amendment as suggested by Deputy Haughey would not establish equality of treatment between commercial travellers, because while he is suggesting that no account be taken of the provision of a car to a commercial traveller if the car is provided by a firm, a commercial traveller who bought his own car&mdash;and a very large number of commercial travellers buy their own cars and are agents in their own right&mdash;would find himself involved in tax liability in respect of private use of the car.</P>

      <P>The principle enunciated by Deputy Haughey would be to give a tax exemption to one particular group exclusively and not to others. I do not think that that is an acceptable principle and it would be resented by others.  The particular title, rank or vocation of commercial traveller is not defined in tax law, and it would be very difficult to find a sufficiently tight definition if the privilege sought was <Col N="1482" /> to be confined to commercial travellers.</P>
      <P>The amendment has another serious difficulty.  It asks that this privilege be conferred on people who are wholly and exclusively employed in the capacity of commercial traveller.  That would obviously involve the person being seven days a week, 52 weeks of the year, engaged as a commercial traveller.</P>

The basis for having a charge in respect of benefit in kind is that it is common knowledge that people do not go as far as the Opposition have now suggested I was going; in other words, they do not work seven days a week, 52 weeks of the year, that they do stop working at some time or another, and that when they have stopped working they have available to them an asset which is of immense value.</P>

Quite a large number of commercial travellers who have a car provided by their firm have not merely the car itself, which has immense capital value and saves the commercial traveller having to borrow or acquire a car on hire purchase, all of which eats into his disposable income, but also has the taxation of the car and oftentimes the petrol and the insurance on the car all paid for by the firm.  Are we to say <Col N="1483" /> that these are not benefits in kind, that these are things that it is not worthwhile having&mdash;the taxation, insurance, running costs, repair costs of your car paid for you by somebody else, even if you only use the car on two days a week for the family?  I consider these are immense benefits. Other people are unable to get insurance to cover only two days a week or to tax their cars for only two days a week in respect of their family use of the car.

Let us be fair and not jump on the band wagon that some people would want to set rolling and, in the process of doing it, generate a considerable amount of annoyance and disappointment among others.</P>

Perhaps the reason the petition did not come&mdash;I understand it did not come&mdash;was that those who are seeking the advantage that Deputy Haughey is seeking today is that they did not wish it to be known that so few people were protesting.  We read widely and we know exactly what is going on.  I think it is very significant indeed when only one in 20 sign, that it shows that what we did last year is clearly understood by people to whom it is meant to apply, and quite a number of them are happy now that they no longer have to engage in what they used to have engage in, most complicated accounting, the keeping of Bills and so on in order to sort out whatever would be their tax allowance in respect of the use of a car.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fact and I know it.  There are good arguments why Ministers should have cars like that, but if what the Ministers say here is right then the ultimate end of the logic puts him in a peculiar position.  On Deputy Haughey's amendment, as he rightly points out, there is a difference between those who would be in the perquisite class, which the Minister referred to last night, and these people who are being employed and need a car for their employment and have it under these conditions.  Whether I am right in my suggestion that people dislike to attract attention from certain Departments I will leave to the judgment of the people concerned&mdash;to the commercial travellers, to say which of us is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have come to the figure of £5 million which the Minister gave last night. He was making the point that it was to capture those in the perquisite bracket and he mentioned cars in the price range of £8,000 to £10,000 and by way of breakdown he gave a percentage of between 20 and 25.  That means that of the £5 million, £1.2 million comes from that class and that the remaining £3.8 million comes from others.  In that class, I do not think I <Col N="1486" /> would be far wrong if I said that each such person is assessed at about £1,000 which means in turn that the number involved would be between 1,200 and 1,500.</P>
    <P>What then have we left?  We have £3.8 million out of the £5 million collected from what one might call the working area, the people not in the luxury class.  They would number roughly 7,500.  Deputy Haughey mentioned a figure of 500 in one other class.  All this adds up to the total of 10,000 people contributing £5 million. These figures make me wonder whether in a lot of these proposals the Minister has not been thinking of the weakest in voting power as far as he is concerned. In addition to what Deputy Haughey said, I wonder if there is not a little element of victimisation here because in many other areas expenses and allowances are given which are not available to people in the area I have just been talking about.</P>
    <P>I have not time to develop the argument and before 1 o'clock I should like to make two short points.  As Deputy Haughey has said, this class form an essential part of sales organisations. The Minister does not seem to have adverted to the ESRI study by Professors Geary and Dempsey in their study of schemes for the relief of unemployment in Ireland in which they say that these sales people are an essential part of the manufacturing and other trade products.  Not only do they represent an element of employment themselves but they are a multiplier of employment and of economic activity. The proposals here are just another example of the Government's taxation policy which, despite the Minister's talk about equity, has had the effect of depressing economic activity in all areas.  Though this is, perhaps, a small facet of it, it is symptomatic of the whole approach of the Minister to taxation since he came to office.</P>
    <P>Even though this year's budget provides a heap of reliefs, we must ask what kind of budget will we have next year when we think of the 1976 budget, if the same Minister and Government are there after the election.  Will we have another 1976 budget?  One way to show practical <Col N="1487" /> sympathy and to put our protestations into effect would be to accept the amendment or at least to compromise on it.  It would not be too costly. What the Minister has done is to reject it out of hand through the stratagem of making legal arguments about the wording.</P>

      <P>That the Order of the Dáil of 29th March, 1977, in relation to the Friendly Societies (Amendment) Bill, 1976, be hereby discharged, that the consequential Message to the Seanad be hereby cancelled and that consideration of the Seanad amendments be now resumed.</P>
      <P>Before proceeding to deal with the matters raised when this Bill was discussed here on the last occasion I should like to say first of all why it is the opinion of the Government that this is an urgent measure which should be brought into law quickly.  The Building Societies Act is now law and the supervisory aspects of this Act depend for their exercise on the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  This Bill changes very greatly the qualifications necessary for appointment as registrar from a narrow requirement of being a barrister of ten years standing to a much broader one which will allow people with other expertise to be considered for appointment.  In order that a full appointment can be made and that the Building Societies Act can take full effect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>During the discussion of this Bill on the last occasion when we were dealing with amendments which had been made in the Seanad Deputy O'Malley drew attention to technical defects in the wording of the text of the Bill then before this House.  It should be pointed out that those defects related to the use of the term &ldquo;1976&rdquo; in six places in the Bill where, by virtue of the fact that although the Bill had been introduced in 1976 it was being considered in 1977 and the figures &ldquo;1976&rdquo; should have been substituted for &ldquo;1977&rdquo; in six places in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Another change was necessary to the extent that, instead of using the term &ldquo;Friendly Societies Act, 1936&rdquo; the correct term which should have been used was &ldquo;Registry of Friendly Societies Act, 1936&rdquo;.  As is clear from what I have said, these changes were purely technical in nature and did not in any sense affect the substance of the Bill.  However, when Deputy O'Malley drew the attention of the House to them, there was a lengthy discussion and it was agreed that the Bill as then before the House did contain these technical defects.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle, at column 520 of the Official Report of 29th March, 1977, volume 298, said:</P>
      <P>On the points made by Deputy O'Malley it would seem that the appropriate thing would be to adjourn consideration and send a message to the Seanad in regard to the errors that have been made and send the Bill back to the Seanad for the correction of these errors.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley then said:</P>
      <P>That was my original suggestion and I think it is an excellent one....</P>
      <P>The suggestion was then agreed by the House and a message was sent to the Seanad.  However, on receipt of this message the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad decided on his own initiative&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to give the House the advice.  However, before doing so I shall read the text of Standing Order No. 104 of this House:</P>
      <P>During the progress of a Bill, corrections of a verbal or formal nature may at any time be made in a Bill by the Clerk, under the direction of the Ceann Comhairle...</P>
      <P>In his advice the Attorney General advised at follows:</P>
      <P>In my opinion the matters adverted to by Deputy O'Malley and mentioned in the message to the Seanad which accompanied the minute of the Department of Industry and Commerce dated 6th May, 1977, are demonstrably of a formal nature&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;and the Clerk of the Dáil if so directed by the Ceann Comhairle, could make the apropriate corrections, under the terms of Dáil Standing Order 104...</P>
      <P>The alternative course&mdash;a purported sending of the Bill by the Dáil to the Seanad for the second time&mdash;would, in my opinion, be of extremely doubtful validity in view an the terms of Article 20.1 of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General concludes his advice as follows:</P>
      <P>The House by Resolution, can rescind the earlier message and proceed to complete the consideration of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle can direct the Clerk of the Dáil to make the corrections.</P>
      <P>Essentially what we are proposing here is that in view of the advice of the Attorney General we should rescind the message of 29th March, 1977, bearing in mind that it is possible on the advice of the Attorney General that these corrections, being of a formal nature, can be made by the Clerk on the direction of the Ceann Comhairle in the normal way without the matter being reconsidered by the Seanad and that any further consideration of the Bill by the Seanad would be of doubtful constitutional validity.

      <P>The appropriate and proper procedure in a matter such as this should have been for the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary to make available to the Opposition the advice of the Attorney General.  First of all, it would be a matter of basic courtesy.  That has not been followed. Secondly, if that normal courtesy that should exist is absent in the persons of <Col N="1491" /> the present incumbents of the offices concerned towards this House, then the least those incumbents should do is to read out here the advice of the Attorney General and not selected passages from it.</P>

      <P>In my opinion the matters adverted to by Deputy O'Malley and mentioned in the message to the Seanad which accompanied the minute of the Department of Industry and Commerce dated 6th May, 1977, are demonstrate of a formal nature, and the Clerk of the Dáil, if so directed by the Ceann Comhairle, could make the appropriate corrections, under the terms of Dáil Standing Order 104.</P>
      <P>This piece I did not read before:</P>
      <P>While the Dáil resolved to send a message to the Seanad, it did not purport to send the Bill to the Seanad and consequently the Bill is still in progress in the Dáil (which has not yet finished its consideration of the Seanad's amendments).</P>
      <P>The alternative course&mdash;a purported sending of the Bill by the Dáil to the Seanad for the second time&mdash;would, in my opinion, be of extremely doubtful validity in view of the terms of Article 20.1 of the Constitution.  It is, however, not necessary to attempt this course, and I would so advise the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sufficiently familiar with Parliamentary procedure in this area to offer a view as to the best way of dealing with the Dáil message of 31st March, 1977, to the Seanad.  Unless it be thought inconsistent <Col N="1492" /> with the dignity of either House, I would be disposed to suggest that, should the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach so agree, it be not acted on by the Seanad, or, should it be thought preferable so to do, the Dáil might agree to withdraw the message. These, however, are questions which the Minister might leave to the Houses of the Oireachtas to decide.</P>
    <P>That is signed by an officer of the Attorney General, submitted to him, agreed by him and transmitted to us. There follows then what the Attorney General himself put on the file which reads:</P>
    <P>I agree.  The Minister can advise the Ceann Comhairle of this opinion.  The House, by Resolution, can rescind the earlier message and proceed to complete the consideration of the Bill.  The Ceann Comhairle can direct the Clerk of the Dáil to make the corrections.</P>

      <P>If we had this in front of us it would be easier.  It is difficult to remember all the details, but there are some significant phrases in it, and it is a little disturbing that they should have been concealed in the first instance.  The Attorney General's opinion, apart from the bit he added at the end, is to the effect that consultations should have to be held with the Ceann Comhairle for his agreement to this.  I wonder were these consultations held and if the Ceann Comhairle agreed.  If that agreement was given why was the fact of these consultations being held secretly with the Minister or the Department not disclosed to the Opposition, as in the words of the Attorney General, this is a matter for the House?  I am entitled to inquire from the Chair whether the agreement of the Ceann Comhairle to this was obtained.</P>

      <P>The Attorney General bases his opinion and advice on that.  Today's and yesterday's Order Paper, which contains the guillotine motion, should be looked at.  Towards the end of yesterday's Order Paper there is a section headed &ldquo;Dáil Bills with the Seanad&rdquo;.  The first Bill listed under that heading is the Friendly Societies (Amendment) Bill, 1976.  In today's Order Paper is the very same thing.  How can the Parliamentary Secretary come in here and say that this House is still in possession of this Bill and bring forward in his support the opinion of the Attorney General which is based on the premise that this Bill is still in the Dáil, when in fact the Dáil Order Paper lists it as being a Dáil Bill for the Seanad?

I cannot comment on the inclusion of this under the heading mentioned by the Deputy in the Order Paper today.  I am proposing that the Message of the 29th March be rescinded.  On the basis of the best legal advice available, this will enable us both to consider Seanad amendments and enable the necessary corrections to be made in perfect order by the Clerk at the direction of the Ceann Comhairle.  The Bill will then become law with full validity as to the point mentioned by the Deputy.  As to the inclusion of this matter in the guillotine motion, the reason for this is the urgency of the Bill, the urgency of having a registrar with the appropriate qualifications appointed, so that the provisions of the Building Societies Act, which is already law and in operation, can be given full effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says that he is doing this on the basis of the best legal advice available <Col N="1495" /> to him.  That advice was given in the days when the previous Attorney General held office.  The previous Attorney General gave advice based on the premise that this Bill was still before the Dáil.  I have proved that this Bill is not still before the Dáil.  It is listed in the Dáil Order Paper yesterday and today, and indeed since the 29th March, as being a Dáil Bill with the Seanad.  If the then Attorney General, who gave his opinion, had known the facts, if he had seen the Dáil Order Paper and had seen that this Bill is not before the Dáil as he incorrectly surmised&mdash;presumably because he got incorrect instructions in the matter&mdash;he could not have given the advice he has now given.  If he could not have given that advice we should not be going through this undemocratic, unparliamentary and illegal procedure that we are now going through under the threat of a guillotine which allows us another ten minutes on this most fundamental constitutional matter.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough.  If all of this was fair, honest and above board, as the Parliamentary Secretary seeks to have us believe, why would he not do the normal thing that any normal Minister or Parliamentary Secretary would do in these circumstances, that is, go to the Opposition, show them the opinion, admit that a mess had been made of it, apologise and indicate that he wanted the Bill to be passed before the election and ask for co-operation, which I am sure would be forthcoming?  Instead of that, when that co-operation would probably be readily forthcoming we have a guillotine. We will not even discuss it.  We could not care less whether anyone agrees with it or whether it is right or wrong or whether the Bill is riddled with errors.  We could not care less whether the procedure about taking it to the Seanad and taking it back without the Seanad's consent is right or wrong.  It does not matter a damn; we will send it through anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is just arrogance.  Parliament no longer matters a damn in this country.  It has not mattered for the past four years because the views of <Col N="1496" /> the people and their representatives here are disregarded.  This matter is more important than just the Friendly Societies (Amendment) Bill, 1976. This is an unimportant uncontroversial Bill.  The only reason it got any notoriety at all is because the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his Parliamentary Secretary made an unholy mess of it.  Indeed, there is no precedent for such a series of messes in the last 50-odd years.</P>

Here we have the Dáil Order Paper showing this Bill is with the Seanad.  The Seanad Order Paper also shows it is with the Seanad.

This Bill is now lawfully before the Seanad and this is the proof of it&mdash;the Dáil Order Paper and the Seanad Order Paper&mdash;and there is no provision under our Constitution or the Standing Orders of either House that I am aware of whereby a Bill under consideration by the Seanad can be brought back here and considered by the Dáil without an order being made in the other House to that effect when the Bill had been passed by the other House.  The Seanad did not sit yesterday.  It may be sitting later today but it is not sitting between now and 1.30 p.m. and it has not made the order in regard to the purported legislating that is supposed to go on here now.  This is a charade of democracy and a throwing out of all the rules and Standing Orders and safeguards and precedents built up in this House over more than 50 years in order that Parliament and the democratic system would be protected.</P>

The House should show its disapproval of this kind of surreptitious activity and this effort to conceal the facts.  If it is all so clean and above board as we are led to believe, why has the guillotine to be used?  We have no answer to that.  Why does the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister himself take responsibility for this anti-democratic activity instead of coming to me and showing me the opinion of the Attorney General, which would be the normal practice?  Instead of that they try to force this through under a guillotine motion.  Apparently this House has not the power to stop this happening <Col N="1498" /> but, by God, this House will have the power in a month's time to see this kind of carry-on does not happen again.</P>

      <P>The fact is the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad declined to take the Bill in consequence of the message sent on 29th March pending the receipt of legal advice.  That was his decision.  If the legal advice had been that the proper procedure was that the matter be considered again by the Seanad neither I nor the Minister would have had any objection in the wide world to dealing with it in that manner and coming back again here with the Bill.  But the situation is that the Cathaoirleach, before considering whether he would allow the Bill to be taken, on his own initiative decided to obtain legal advice and it is in consequence of that legal advice, which indicates that the procedure agreed upon by this House on 29th March would be of doubtful constitutional validity, that the matter is now again before this House.  That is what happened. There is no endeavour on our part to do anything irregular or to depart in any way from proper procedure. The situation quite simply is that the procedure now proposed is necessary because of the advice sought and obtained by the Cathaoirleach on his own initiative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The advice sought and obtained is based on the premise that this Bill was still with the Dáil. The Attorney General's opinion states that, since the Bill is still with the Dáil, it should not now be sent to the Seanad.  The Dáil's Order Paper proves that is not so.  The Seanad's Order Paper proves that is not so.  If the position were as the Parliamentary Secretary now seeks to suggest, the Cathaoirleach could not have held the Bill on the Seanad Order Paper because it was open to the Seanad to take the Bill, if it wanted to, when it appeared on the Order Paper.  What the Parliamentary Secretary says is wrong because that advice is based on the premise that the Bill had never left the Dáil.  Since 29th March it is listed on the Order Paper as &ldquo;Dáil Bills with the Seanad&rdquo; and the Parliamentary <Col N="1499" /> Secretary cannot therefore rely on an opinion based on a wrong premise.  The wrong premise is due, of course, to the instructions given to the Attorney General, not by his own staff but from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Had the Attorney General been told that the Bill was not with the Dáil but was listed on the Dáil Order Paper as a Dáil Bill with the Seanad obviously he could not have given the advice he did, because all the rest of that advice impinges on the statement that the Bill had never left the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the whole thing is so pure and innocent as the Parliamentary Secretary alleges I repeat my question: why did he not come, in accordance with normal practice in a matter like this, when a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary makes a mistake, and say &ldquo;Look, we are sorry but there is a mess here and here is a copy of the opinion of the Attorney General and would you agree we will fix all this up with the minimum of fuss and so on because we want to bring the Bill into operation&rdquo; and the answer would inevitably have been &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  But that was not done.  The whole thing is done <Col N="1500" /> surreptitiously.  This Bill is slid into a three-page guillotine motion designed to bring this House to an end.  It is a circumstance which gives rise, and I think properly, to the deepest suspicions.  I want to warn the Chair now that, if this procedure is created here in relation to a matter of little importance, there is nothing to stop it being used in a matter of major importance if that Government are returned to office after the general election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to a few of the matters mentioned in the debate, namely, the question of the maintenance of law and order and the protection of the institutions of State. Fianna Fáil always ensured that the institutions of the State were fully protected as well as protecting the security of individuals.  At the moment there is no law and order.  The decline of law and order in the past three years has brought about the drastic situation we are now experiencing.  It is the responsibility of the Government to protect our democratic institutions and to ensure the freedom of individuals.  At the weekend we had a jackboot attack on democracy by the Taoiseach, who viciously attacked the basic and fundamental freedoms we treasure.  The freedom of the press was threatened.</P>

      <P>Who will fill the prison in the Curragh?  Will it be the press correspondents whom the Taoiseach does not like?  Will it be the pickets or the &ldquo;thicks&rdquo; to whom he referred?  Does the Taoiseach want to deprive individuals who have a basic right to protest of that fundamental freedom that is necessary in a democracy? This has been the jackboot attack from the howling mob at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis last weekend.  On the same day, by accident or design, we <Col N="1503" /> saw a newsreel in an RTE programme showing General O'Duffy addressing a Blueshirt rally at Clonmel.  One wonders what was the connection between the attack on democracy by Fine Gael at their Ard Fheis and the attack on Fianna Fáil by General O'Duffy.</P>

      <P>I hope we still possess freedom of speech in this country but it appears that inside and outside this House people will be denied that basic freedom.  I am speaking on the Bill. I want to know what the Government will do with the empty camp they have in the Curragh.  Will protesters be put into that prison?  Will trade union pickets or the pickets who operated peacefully outside the Ard Fheis last weekend be put into it?  That question must be answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Freedom of speech is basic and fundamental and it is the duty of a Government to protect it.  Will people be impounded into that prison because they do not fall in line with the wishes of the Taoiseach or of Fine Gael? If such people do not yield to Government pressure will they be put into that prison?  I hope that those that <Col N="1504" /> protest against injustice of any kind will not be impounded.  Can the Minister truthfully say that they will not be imprisoned in the detention camp in the Curragh?  From the jackboot attack by the Taoiseach last Saturday and Sunday, I take it we are well on the way to having a serious situation in this State.</P>
    <P>We know that so far as military custody is concerned not so long ago the Taoiseach and the Minister took into their hands the right to appoint senior Army officers.  They have here and elsewhere a very important bearing on the question of military detention. This is a military camp where military detention will be a factor.  Is this a follow-on to the appointment of senior Army officers?  A situation now exists in the State where we have senior Army officers appointed on the say of the Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>There are cities and towns in the country where there are no-go areas, where the police cannot go into them without being attacked. This is the type of law and order we have at the moment.  The aged, the infirm and the young are vulnerable to attack by the boot-boys, the bully boys and the howling mobs.  These howling mobs were told that they could attack blow-outs and blow-ins by blow-ups.  I hope we get a clear indication now what they intend to do with the powers they seek.  I know that people will not tolerate any jackboot activities or any move by any Taoiseach of any Government to take away the rights which were so dearly won.  We have had no law and order in the country for the last few years. This has been pointed out in the House and outside it by various groups throughout the country.  People have appealed again and again for protection against robbery with violence, armed robbery, rape and all the other <Col N="1506" /> hideous crimes but there is no response from the Government.  They have allowed a situation to develop so that it is necessary to imprison people instead of correcting a situation at an early stage.</P>
      <P>I am quite sure that if there were sufficient gardaí they would be able to control the situation and ensure that justice is done.  The sooner this jackboot election campaign is over and the sooner we get back in office the quicker we can bring about a situation where normality is restored and basic rights are protected so that we will not have hysterical outbursts such as we heard last week-end.  I ask again who will be impounded in this camp.  Is it the pickets that were regarded as thicks?  Is it people who have a right in any democracy to make peaceful protest?  Will members of the Press be impounded?  Will members of Fianna Fáil be impounded?  There was a vicious attack on democracy.  We are attending the wake of this Dáil.  It is sad to think that at this stage we have this attack by the Taoiseach.  No doubt his off the cuff statement shows exactly what he thinks.  We must examine the Taoiseach's off the cuff statement because that was a true reflection of what he and the Government think.  Vicious lies were poured out to the nation at that particuler gathering.  The Taoiseach will have to answer why he deliberately lied to the nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>One can understand the emotion and the passion expressed by Deputy Dowling in the light of the fascist diatribe we had from the Taoiseach last week-end.  It was one of the most frighteningly illiberal speeches made by a political leader of this nation in recent years.  One must be appalled at the general tenor of his speech, that if you are not with us you are against us and if you are against us God help you.</P>
      <P>The Bill we are discussing is a monument to the hypocrisy of the Government. The principle of transferring civilian prisoners to military custody is not a good principle.  However, when we saw it as our duty in 1972 to take such action we went ahead but we were denounced vehemently by those defenders of democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the record, it is interesting to note that a number of those who opposed us then are now enshrined in one Government job or another. These people were not heard in 1974 when the present Minister for Justice sought an extension of the original Act.  Neither have they been heard since.  Among those who voted against the measure in 1972 were Deputies Cluskey, O'Connell, O'Donovan, Sherwin, Thornley and Deputy Treacy who is now the Ceann Comhairle. Despite such opposition Deputy O'Malley who is a courageous man by any standards put that Bill through.  He was subjected to the most personalised opposition possible, so much so that one would think he was acting out of spite rather than out of a sense of duty.  He introduced a Bill which was <Col N="1508" /> the collective responsibility of the then Fianna Fáil Government.  Opposition to him at the time was lead ably by the man who is now Minister for Justice and who considered it his duty to denounce the measure in defence of democracy.  Since then the same man has extended the measure and now seeks a further extension of it.  In fairness to him he has done his duty against, perhaps, his better judgement, but in accordance with the advice that he receives on matters of this nature.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to recall, though, that in seeking an extension of the measure in 1974, the Minister was the only one from the other side to speak on the Bill.  He was on his own.  None of the people I have mentioned nor the Tánaiste no more than the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister for Industry and Commerce was to be heard in 1974.  Their liberalism had lapsed. Their socialism was in suspension from the day they were appointed by the Taoiseach.  Having regard to the performance of the Labour Party on that occasion in 1972 and relating it to their general behaviour since 1973 one can only assume that James Connolly turned in his grave many times since then.  What must he think of what is being done in the name of socialism by certain members of the Parliamentary Labour Party?</P>
    <P>In introducing the 1977 Bill the Minister's speech absorbs six columns of the Official Report.  In 1974 his speech involved two columns of the Report but on 23rd May, 1972 he had a lot to say.  It is worth quoting just a little of what he said then.  At that time he was a great liberal, a defender of democracy, but his concern which was presented then as being real would appear to have been unreal.  What he could not take in 1972, he has sought to extend twice since.  As reported in Volume 272 column 85 of the Official Report for the 23rd of May of that year, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The idea of military custody is something that causes apprehension to people living in a democracy.  It is something we should keep at arms length so far as possible; it is something <Col N="1509" /> that must be kept at arms length unless there is a situation of revolution and utter chaos.  We are certainly not in that situation at the moment.  It is reprehensible on the part of the Government to bring in this piece of legislation with this emotive power without indicating that it is entirely a temporary measure.  I expect the Minister to give full and detailed reasons why the powers under the 1877 Act have not been used.</P>
    <P>That was the man in opposition as against the man in power.  There is a choice droplet, too, from the Tánaiste as reported at column 93 of the Official Report for the same day.  It is as follows:</P>
    <P>My objections are against the method by which the civil law is transferred to military control. &ldquo;Military custody&rdquo; has an ominous ring.  There is a suggestion of martial law.  In my opinion military custody could provoke trouble in the country, not that I want to see trouble provoked. If people can be transferred to military custody at the will of the Minister, to say the least of it quite a number of people will be upset.  It has also been suggested that, even though the Curragh might be designated as a prison, supervision should lie in the hands of the Minister for Justice and his agents, whether or not they be governors of prisons.  At least the supervision should be in the hands of the Minister for Justice so that it will appear that if people are deprived of civil liberties the civil law will apply to them.</P>
    <P>We have not heard from the Tánaiste on this subject.  Another great defender of democracy, a man who wears his concern on his sleeve, is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Social Welfare who, stated on 23rd May, 1972, at column 106 of the same volume:</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister is not asking this assembly to pass a Bill which is a departure from normal democratic procedure and institutions on the basis that he cannot spare two senior prison officers?  That is what it <Col N="1510" /> means.  The Minister states that.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>It was my hope, at the time of the transfer, to utilise the detention barracks as a civil prison but, owing to the severe demands on the existing prison staff at the present time and the inevitable delay in recruiting...</P>
    <P>What does that mean?  The Minister says &ldquo;severe demands on the existing prison staff&rdquo;.  What are the &ldquo;severe demands&rdquo; connected with two senior prison officers?  What is the &ldquo;demand&rdquo; about one senior prison officer?  There is none.  I am telling the Minister and the House that unless I get a very satisfactory answer to these questions, I would not feel that I was doing my duty as a democratically-elected representative to this Parliament, and as a believer in democracy, in supporting this Bill.  If I do not get satisfactory answers I will oppose this Bill at all stages.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is cosily enshrined until this evening in the Department.  We have not heard anything from him on this subject since 1972.  On that occasion he was defending democracy but on this occasion he will support this Bill which includes one of the most vicious attacks on democracy, namely the use of the guillotine in circumstances which curtail free speech.  That is what the Parliamentary Secretary is doing on this occasion.  He is voting for a Bill which we vehemently opposed, not only by word but by act when he went through that division lobby in 1972. He is not only supporting something which he found unsupportable in 1972, he is also supporting the curtailing of free speech in this Dáil by the introduction of the guillotine, regardless of what is or is not said on this legislation.</P>
    <P>These lapsed liberals, Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Corish, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Social Welfare, Deputy Keating, Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Cluskey, and Deputy Tully, Minister for Local Government, are <Col N="1511" /> deafening us with their silence.  They were not here in 1974 and they are not here in 1977 to express by their vehemence their abhorrence of a Bill which they bitterly opposed in 1972.  It is a gross hypocrisy on the part of all of them.  Now the Labour branch of the Fine Gael Party, by supporting a guillotine motion, are supporting the curtailment of the democratic right of the Opposition to speak freely in this House.  It is a logical extension of what the Taoiseach said last weekend.  It is a continuity of the statement of the Taoiseach that those who dissent, whether they be the nationally elected Opposition party or other liberals in our society who like to have a say on given subjects, are in danger.  That is what the support of this Bill now by those people who spoke so desperately against it in 1972 implies.  It is a logical extension to the Cosgrave ethic on fasoism in his dissertation on Saturday last.  It was an appalling revelation of what we can expect from this Government if they are to be allowed continue in office for another three or four years.</P>
    <P>We are speaking about the Prisons Bill, 1977, and we are concerned to indicate from the very beginning that we are being consistent in supporting the extension of time sought by the Bill.  We are totally consistent in our support of what the Minister seeks. However, to listen to the Minister and his colleagues and to listen to the Taoiseach and his cronies and placemen, one would imagine that in all the circumstances they have cornered the market on law and security. Fianna Fáil have never been found wanting in that field and never will be. When we saw it our duty to safeguard the institutions of this country we did so against all comers and indeed against the very Minister who now seeks the introduction of this Prisons Bill.  This continual, sickening prating about what they have done to safeguard and secure the institutions of this country makes one's stomach turn.</P>

      <P>Over the years when we were in Government we saw it our duty to take that and any Government charged with ruling in a democratic society have an obligation to ensure that the rule of law prevails on a fair basis and to defend the rule of law against outside or inside attack. One would imagine that it is something peculiar to the Cosgrave Government to have taken this mantle of law and order, as if no other Government did their duty in the same circumstances. What this Government have failed to do&mdash;and this is pertinent to the Bill before us&mdash;is to secure the security of local communities.  There is a very serious breakdown in law and order and in local security in the cities, suburbs and large towns, and there is no gainsaying that.  The facts are available for everybody to study. I hope the people will judge this Government not only on their record of national law and order&mdash;which any Government must uphold when charged by the people to rule the country for a period of time&mdash;but also on their record in relation to break-ins, assaults and all the things that Deputy Dowling was concerned about in his contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Taoiseach's constituency in 1970 there were 173 gardaí.  Lo and behold, in 1977, seven years later there are 181 gardaí, an increase of eight gardaí in seven years.  One cannot be loud enough in praise of the Garda Síochána and the Government who do not support the Garda Síochána, the law enforcement agency, are doing a disservice to the nation, and this Government are doing just that disservice in what is euphemistically described as the Taoiseach's own constituency.  I asked a Parliamentary Question here on 18th May, 1977, in relation to the law and order and local security situation in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire and the Minister made some vague reference to the fact that there will be additional foot patrols on the streets and by-roads of the constituency.  My information is different and I believe that the Minister misled the House in his reply to that question for short-term gain in the impending general election.  The Garda deserve the support of this Dáil <Col N="1513" /> and must get it.  The Minister pooh-poohs my suggestion that the real problem in relation to the breakdown of local security and law and order at local level is the lack of foot patrols. There is nothing as effective as the blue-uniformed presence of the Garda Síochána on the street.</P>

I do not want to be hysterical or to panic.  The solution to the matter is in the hands of the Government-for-the-time-being. When we get back to office after the general election we will solve the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter I thought I might mention.</P>
      <P>There is another matter to which the Attorney General referred, the attitude of Fianna Fáil in Opposition and in Government as against that of the present Government when in Opposition.  One of the most extraordinary things is that the present Attorney General, who, of course, was appointed in the most despicable fashion by the Taoiseach, is acting at present in his former capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and Chief Whip.  I charge the Attorney General with bringing the office of Attorney General into disrepute. Either he is Attorney General or he is Chief Whip and Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and Minister for Defence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>His behaviour at present <Col N="1514" /> shows contempt for the office of the Attorney General and that of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach. However, his attitude personifies the manner of his appointment. When one hears him prating about law and order one can only relate his present behaviour in the office of Attorney General to his own words and his contempt for the office.</P>
      <P>One could cite many quotations from the debate on the Prisons Bill, 1972, and its introduction by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley. However, one of the choicest on that occasion was the remarks of the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs when he said in Volume 272, column 113, of the Official Report of 23rd May, 1972:</P>
      <P>A number of reservations have been expressed from our benches and by other speakers about this legislation, the manner in which it has been introduced and how it stands at the moment.  It was introduced in a mood which is rather dear to this Government, a mood of very belated but frantic haste. The Government are very slow to move but when they move everyone else must move instantly; it is a case of out of the way, minimum discussion, we must get it through, guillotine everything.  I do not think that is the way to deal with a problem of this kind...</P>
      <P>What a choice statement from the lapsed Liberal who will now support the Prisons Bill and the guillotine motion which will bring debate on the subject to an end.  In retrospect it rings very hollow and one might listen to it again:</P>
      <P>I do not think that is the way to deal with a problem of this kind; it is not the way to get people with you; it is overbearing and it is a wrong approach.</P>
      <P>Then we have the statement:</P>
      <P>The Government are very slow to move but when they move everyone else must move instantly; it is a case of out of the way, minimum discussion, we must get it through, guillotine everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He becomes the guillotine everything <Col N="1515" /> Minister in 1977.  History has an odd way of repeating itself.  When the general election is over the people will put the general hyocrisy of the present members of the Government into proper perspective.  I would hope that history would repeat itself on this occasion by ensuring that the present Government meet the fate they deserve.</P>
    <P>Let me make one final comment on the Prisons Bill again relating it to the Taoiseach's speech over the week-end. Not one member of the Parliamentary Labour Party has made an utterance on the type of speech the Taoiseach made which is an appaling commentary on how well they have been bought by the same man, bought, I mean by the trappings of office. Those great Liberals.  Where are they now?  Why did they not make some comment on the liberalism of the Taoiseach's speech at the week-end, this frightening speech that would appear to have this country surrounded by barbed wire?</P>

      <P>They are selective in what they have said and in what they will do.  It is a tragedy that the country is being run by people of that kind.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I might be permitted to quote one further droplet from the former Liberal Minister for Posts and Telegraphs at column 119 of the same debate:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nonetheless, after what has happened in the country and in Mount-joy Prison lately, the authorising of the transfer to military custody of certain categories of prisoners is a lesser evil.  It is a lesser evil because we have a certain category of prisoner who appears, to some extent, to be outside the control of what might be called a normal prison system.  This could have been foreseen.  The Minister could have taken note of what happened at Crumlin Road jail and he could have set out about strenghening the ordinary prison system, which he does <Col N="1516" /> not appear to have done.  The prison system broke down, there was a failure within the area of the Minister's responsibility.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Justice is extending the Bill introduced by the courageous Deputy O'Malley, as Minister for Justice, in 1972.  Effectively, what the Minister is doing is extending the time and operation of a Fianna Fáil Government Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins and others quoted at length statements made in 1972 and referred to the silence of some people in 1974 and 1977.  It is extraordinary the way power corrupts absolutely&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The relationship between teacher/pupil and administrative staff is more favourable in the Dublin VEC area than in any other area in the country.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware of the dispute in Wexford Christian Brothers School between his Department and the ASTI since early this year; the number of days the pupils have been out of school and the hours involved; if he will intervene; and if the necessary moneys will be made available to resolve the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no dispute between the Department of Education and the ASTI in connection with the Christian Brothers School, Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a dispute between the authorities of the school and the <Col N="1526" /> ASTI but I do not consider that it would be helpful towards a solution of the problem if I were to make observations in relation to it at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered the part of this question which refers to the number of days the pupils have been out of this school, nor has he answered the final part of the question.  I understand this question involves money.  Are the Department prepared to provide the necessary money so that the pupils in this school, who have been out for three days per week since Christmas or shortly after Christmas, can resume their studies? Now that the summer holidays are coming, do the Department think they will get away with avoiding a decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy was listening to the answer to the question.  I am sure he is acting in the best interests of his constituents, but I would advise him that what he is doing now may not be helpful to the resolution of this dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accepting this as an answer.  Part of the question I asked has not been answered.  I am interested in the parents and their school-going children in the CBS in Wexford, and I want to know what the Department are going to do about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The dispute, as I said, is not between the Department and the ASTI but between the authorities of the school and the ASTI.  As regards the money there is a very complicated method of assigning money to secondary schools, but it is assigned to Wexford secondary school on exactly the same basis as to all other schools in the country.  It is the division of that money that is in dispute.  On the other part of the Deputy's question, the school was closed for four days.  My Department would not have information on the number of hours being worked by the teachers except that they are working to rule, but the manager has been signing to the effect that they have been working the required quota of hours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This money is payable for special functions within the school, and I understand the same situation has arisen in Tralee.  What does the Department intend to do about it?  If nothing is done there will be a total school strike at the end of this summer. Is it because we are coming up to a holiday period that the Department are going to sit back and do nothing about it?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister seriously telling this House that this dispute is not between the secondary teachers in Wexford and his Department, in view of the fact that we have had a number of conferences in his Department in this connection?  Secondly, is the Minister aware that at the present time and for a number of weeks past all pupils in the secondary school up to intermediate certificate classes have been getting only 40 per cent of their usual hours in education there? Thirdly, is the Minister aware that all the interests in Wexford town, including the management of the school, the teachers concerned and the parents, have met and discussed this problem, have teased it out, and are all satisfied that the solution to the problem lies in the Minister's Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think the Deputy is wrong in that.  I do not think <Col N="1528" /> either of the parties to the dispute would claim it is a dispute with the Department of Education.  I am aware that the early post-primary classes are only getting about 40 per cent tuition. It is the principal's decision that where he has them available only for a limited period he should concentrate on the exam classes.  As regards the discussions which, he says, took place in my Department, of course the Department have an interest in this but the dispute is not with my Department.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is that £261,850 has been sanctioned for sports requirements and there is a further possible £2,500 to be allocated in the sports area, making a total of £264,360.  On the youth side £187,300 is being sanctioned and a probable further £15,000 is to be sanctioned, making a total of £202,300.  For exchange with other countries, which is common to both youth and sport, a sum of £10,200 is set aside.  This gives a grand total of £476,850.  That is set <Col N="1531" /> against the amount of the fund which in January, 1977, was £488,522.18. That leaves an estimated balance of £11,672.18.  There are a number of other applications in the Department which if they were to be met would have to come out of the remaining £11,672.18.  The Deputy will see that taking what has already been allocated and what probably will be allocated, there will be if anything a very small amount available at the end of the financial year to which the amount of money available at the beginning of the year referred.</P>

As a result of the economic growth of this country over the past 12 or 15 months, more finance is now available to the Government for this sort of project in the general youth field than was the case in 1974 or 1975.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already welcomed the policy document but I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary why sufficient emphasis was not placed on the employment of full-time professional youth leaders to train voluntary youth leaders?  Why was emphasis not placed on the importance of having premises available as was pointed out at the time?  Is he aware that Macra na Tuaithe in Cork city are anxious to employ an executive to promote their work?  Why was money not made available in the policy document?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think sufficient resources are being made available for the employment of full-time youth leaders given the general amount of <Col N="1534" /> money available.  The whole idea of employing full-time youth leaders, as outlined in the policy is that they should act as a support to the adult voluntary worker and should not take over responsibility from him.  As regards full-time youth workers, the Deputy will be aware that one of the major proposals in the document is the introduction of an in-service training scheme specifically for full-time youth workers.  As regards the provision of buildings and so on, one of the powers given to vocational education committees under the terms of the proposal is that of providing assistance towards rental costs of a building which might be used by youth organisations and also towards the equipment of such buildings.  This Government have given very dramatic increases, far in excess of increases in the cost of living and well in excess of increases given to some other youth organisations, to Macra na Tuaithe.  We continue to take an interest in their work which is undoubtedly very valuable and discussions continue to take place between Macra na Tuaithe and the Government to see how best their programme can be advanced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that in the comprehensive policy for youth and sport there is provision for the establishment of what is called a sports council.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary acknowledge that the council which I established when we were in Government and which was functioning was disbanded by him three or four years ago?  That being so, does he not acknowledge that coming along now to present to the young people in sports organisations the notion that he is establishing what was established four years ago and which, in fact, he disbanded, is a misrepresentation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision in the policy for a sports council and the council which is being established, as is clearly set out in the document, is very different and much more effective than the one which the Deputy and I both chaired at different times.  The new sports council will have its own secretariat, will be independent in its function, will have its own chairman, not a political chairman and will have a clearly defined task which the other council did not, I think have.  The new council will also have its own budget and will have representatives not only of the Department of Education but of all the Departments of State concerned with sporting affairs so that Government policy within the new council can be co-ordinated in a way that was impossible within the old council.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Gallagher</b> asked the Minister for Education if he will state the increases authorised by his Department for the carriage of fare-paying primary and <Col N="1539" /> post-primary pupils on special school transport services since September, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The fares payable per term by fare-paying pupils on special school buses were increased as follows from April, 1977:</P>
      <P>Primary Pupils: from £2.25 to £3.50 where there is one member of a family travelling, and from £1.50 to £2.50 where there are more than one member of a family travelling.</P>
      <P>Post-primary Pupils: from £3.00 to £4.50 where there is one member of a family travelling and from £2.10 to £3.50 where there are more than one member of a family travelling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>These fares have been fairly static since 1972 or 1973.  There was an increase in September, 1976, and another increase in April, 1977. In view of the number of journeys and the total mileage travelled during a term to which the fares apply, I am sure the Deputy will agree that they are quite low.  For instance, in the case of a primary pupil who is the only member of his family travelling by bus, the fare is 27p per week.  In the case of a primary pupil where there is more than one member of the family travelling by bus the fare is 19p per week. The figures are slightly higher in the case of post-primary pupils where the distances are much longer but when one looks at the distances involved one realises the fares are very reasonable.</P>

      <P>No, that is not the motive.  In any event, Dublin pupils do <Col N="1540" /> not have school buses and, therefore, they do not have the possibility of getting on as concessionary passengers. They have to travel on the normal scheduled services.  Any Dublin Deputy present will be able to vouch for the fact that Dublin children are certainly not getting away with paying 27p per week to travel to school.  The figure would be much higher.

It is the continuous desire of the State agencies, the rescue agencies&mdash;the IDA, Fóir Teoranta and others&mdash;to ensure the survival of firms but it would obviously be self-defeating if it secured the destruction of other firms.

The precise date for commencement of the proposed drilling operations has not yet been determined as detailed seismic work is necessary beforehand so as to select the best drilling location.</P>
      <P>Assessment of drilling results is normally concluded by the operating companies within a few weeks of completion of an exploration well.

I have made it clear, in return for the reward of that particular block, that I want the work carried out very promptly.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce announces the allocation of a drilling block.  It has not been the practice for the Department of Industry and Commerce but for the company concerned to announce the details as the well proceeds and, as the results come in, whether they are good or bad.  There have been more disappointments than successes up to the present.  I do not <Col N="1544" /> propose in this instance to change that practice.  The only time I come into it is the statement that a block has been allocated and that the drilling commitment has been entered into.  I have made clear my desire for promptness and I am absolutely satisfied since I know the detail in which companies are compelled to report to the Geological Survey, that there is no question of holding up information by a company which properly belongs to the public.

      <P>Is the Minister aware of a new committee which has been formed and which perhaps will be of some use to him and to the promoters through the IDA?  This is a new action group.  Will the Minister draw the attention of the IDA to the rather depressing situation in regard to the failure to locate anything of a worth-while nature in Donegal for quite a considerable time, particularly when there is the unfortunate closing down of several useful projects that were giving employment in the past?</P>

      <P>I cannot accept the characterisations of the activity of the IDA in Donegal just made by the Deputy.  I find that in Donegal, in the period from April, 1972, to December, 1976, there were a total of 102 projects with a total fixed investment of more than £40 million.  A total of £17½ million of that was grant commitment from State sources.  That is a very substantial level of public effort with a satisfactory response.  I know that in the Inishowen Peninsula there are specific difficulties for reasons that the Deputy might imagine, partly because of infrastructure, partly because of remoteness but partly because of proximity to the North.  This is an area which is being very vigorously promoted.  I regret the lack of success but I cannot accept that the matter is not being worked on by the IDA as one of the highest priority.</P>

This situation applies not only to the Inishowen peninsula but to the entire county of Donegal which has always had more than its share of difficulties, difficulties that are not recognised by the Minister or any of his agencies.</P>

      <P>Before we adjourned on this amendment I was making a case on the basis of the number of people involved.  Obviously, I could make only a rough guess from the figures available.  However, I do not think there is a large number of people involved.  Having regard to the fact that other types of expenses are allowed in various ways I was going on to say that I support Deputy Haughey in this amendment.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is really anxious to relieve the burden of taxation, he will have an opportunity of so doing.  This would give an earnest of his goodwill in the matter.  I do not wish to repeat what I said about the figure but the Minister should consider sympathetically this question and separate clearly the two categories we are talking of, namely, the category specified here and the category that could be put in the perks class.  What we are talking of here is a necessary incident of employment.  Regarding the Minister's argument on uniformity I pointed out a very blatant exception where the type of employment makes a difference.  If there is an exception in one case I do not see how the argument of principle can apply.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I based my original submissions on the Minister's answers to questions in this area but I should like to be taken as repeating what Deputy Haughey has said.  I support him totally in the amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question at this point.  He has said that if commercial travellers leave their cars at weekends on the premises of their employers, they will not be assessed.  In the case of commercial travellers who take their cars home at week-ends, is it true that the minimum assessment to which they have been subjected is £300?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the position is that if a commercial traveller, in order to be able to get away quickly on a Monday morning, takes his car home at weekends, he will be deemed to have benefit in kind to the extent of £300.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>The reasoning behind Deputy Haughey's amendment is that if a commercial traveller, under these regulations, has a car, he is likely to have added to his taxable income the minimum sum of £300 or up to a maximum, presumably, of about £900, depending on the value of the car.  In effect, this means that if the traveller is a single person he or she will be starting off with no earned income allowance if the car is valued at £4,500, giving a charge to income tax of £675 on that account.  But if the car is even a more expensive one&mdash; and the traveller may not wish to have such an expensive model&mdash;he will be minus the earned income allowance from the word go.  I have described some of the Minister's proposals as being deterrents to enterprise.  This proposal is no exception.  In effect, it is an additional overhead because after a year or so most firms would find it necessary to increase the incomes of their commercial travellers in order to make up for the additional tax imposition on them.  In other words, this is a tax charge by the Minister irrespective of the equity&mdash;to use a word of which he is so fond&mdash;of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speakers on this side of the House <Col N="1565" /> have emphasised that we are not talking about the company executive or the big-time director.  We are talking about the individual who is faced with a choice of either paying the tax or of having no job.  A commercial traveller, because of the nature of his work, must either provide a car for himself or be provided with one by his firm. There is no choice.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the example given by Ministers in the use of State cars.  One could allow that a Minister could say &ldquo;Well, I do not need so large a car&rdquo;, but if the Minister is going to insist on equity then he is landing himself in a situation where if a State car is used for family purposes some form of assessment should be made on the person using it. The amendment, of course, suggests no taxable amount.  That all depends on the value of the car.  Any individual in today's circumstances may acquire a car fairly cheaply and run it on far less than the estimate which is being provided to the Minister.  There may or may not be a charge for the use of the car on Saturdays and Sundays. As has been said on this side of the House, many commercial travellers if they are travelling all the time from Monday to Friday are not too anxious, except from a sense of duty, to take the family out all day on Saturday and Sunday, yet if the traveller is to take the car home and use it even to go to church he is going to be assessed from a minimum of £300 up to about £700 or £800 on his income and that is not equitable.  Whatever argument the Minister may put, I do not think he can put that argument.  He can put the argument that he wants the money and be honest about it but he cannot justify that under equity.  I concede that there probably is some benefit but there are not such a large number of people under this category and in all cases they must use a car if they are to be commercial travellers.  The Minister should be prepared to take a fresh look at the situation which has prompted this amendment from Deputy Haughey.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have in another amendment dealt with the question of benefits in kind in relation to motor <Col N="1566" /> cars.  I do not want to reopen the general aspect of that topic which I have made clear is leading to enormous difficulty not only for the taxpayer but also for the Revenue Commissioners. This amendment is very specific and deals only with commercial travellers, people in respect of whom it cannot be disputed that a car is an essential tool of their trade.  The Minister is right to justify his attitude in this regard.  I was listening carefully to him this morning on it and we have what I can only describe as a classic Richie Ryan dissertation on the minutiae of whether or not such people were getting a benefit in kind from the personal use they might have of such a car at the weekend.  In an endeavour to bolster up the very artificial case which the Minister is arguing he has got himself into a situation which is quite untenable and to which reference has been made by Deputy Brugha with regard to State cars.  It may be argued that State cars have to be used for security purposes but they are also supplied on the clear basis and understanding that their use is not confined to official business, that they are available for the same purposes as one's own car would be available.  The logic of the situation, as Deputy Brugha has pointed out, is quite clear, that if you are to assess people like commercial travellers for the personal benefit they may be alleged to get out of their cars this should apply all round, but it does not.  The Minister who has been arguing the minutiae of this matter conveniently ignored that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The root cause of the trouble is that the Minister's approach on this matter is wrong.  As Deputy Haughey pointed out when this was introduced originally, it was intended to apply to what the average person would regard as unreasonable perks being given to people who in the main were very well paid anyway.  It has now been brought down by the present Minister to the situation where a commercial traveller who drives his car all the week, comes home on Friday sick of driving, puts his car in the garage at home and does not take it out again until Monday morning, is assessed as having the maximum value out of that car or <Col N="1567" /> £300, and the amount could be much larger than that.  This is nonsense, and the Minister must know that there has to be some maintenance of touch with reality in the assessment of taxation. This is losing touch with reality.  I dread to think of the amount of time and money that it is costing the State to pursue claims of this kind and the amount of frustration that is building up among the commercial travellers who are being assessed in this way and are very conscious of the fact that in many cases they are being assessed most unfairly.  The Minister should know by now that that kind of law operated in that way almost inevitably drives people into evasion of tax.  If people think that they are being harassed quite unfairly, then the inevitable reaction is that they will say &ldquo;To hell with the Revenue Commissioners&rdquo; and they will find a way to evade tax.</P>
    <P>As part of his spurious argument the Minister has tried to imply that only 5 per cent of commercial travellers object to this form of assessment.  I, in company with the leader of this party, some time ago received a deputation from the Commercial Travellers' Federation on this very subject.  I understand that the Minister had also received them but I may be wrong in that and it may have been the Revenue Commissioners who received them. Either way there was a substantial deputation representative of commercial travellers all over the country and I can say that they were steamed up about this.  Is the Minister serious in asking us to believe that they were representative of only 5 per cent of the members of the Commercial Travellers' Federation?  Is that what he wants us to believe?  Does he not know that this again is losing touch with reality? Does he not know, if only on general principles, that any commercial traveller, whether he sensed that the system was unfair or not, would be against it if it meant that he was going to pay more tax?  Is that not a natural reaction? The Minister should be under no illusion.  The great bulk of commercial travellers feel a great sense of injustice and grievance about what the Minister has done and they are right. What is happening in general in regard <Col N="1568" /> to the assessment of benefits in kind for motor cars and in particular in relation to commercial travellers is quite indefensible.</P>
    <P>There is no reasonable answer to the case put forward for this amendment. The only answers we have been getting are far removed from reality.  They ignore the facts of the situation, ignore real life and how it is lived.  If you get the situation in which people who have been driving all week can go home and put their car away and say &ldquo;Thank God I do not have to drive that until Monday morning&rdquo;&mdash;and there are such people&mdash;and they are assessed at a minimum of £300, that is an indefensible situation.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to think again and think very seriously, because there is in this area epitomised a number of the injustices which have been created in recent years under the taxation system and, I believe, one of the worst of them in so far as it affects the people concerned.  Of course, as Deputy de Valera said, we are talking about a small number of people.  Perhaps in voting terms they are not going to worry the Minister unduly.  There ought to be a little more consideration given than simply the voting strength of the people concerned. They are being treated inequitably. This House has an obligation to do something about it, but, above all, the Minister, who has it in his power to do something about it, ought to accept this amendment or some reasonable version of it that would make itself more commendable to him.  However, the principle involved in this is absolutely incontrovertible, and I would urge the Minister to recognise that that is so and take at least one step on the road to achieving real equity in taxation, not the alleged and spurious equity which he keeps parading before us.</P>

      <P>Quite a large number of Ministers, perhaps all, have cars of their own which they buy out of after-tax income like the vast majority of citizens, and those are the cars which, in the main, look after whatever family needs there may be.  I think it is better that we should not bring this argument down to tit for tat, but at the same time, if people have been using this debate in order to have a go at Ministers, I would like to say that quite a large number of Deputies in this House, most of them in the Opposition benches, receive generous travelling allowances. They are not taxed on those, although there is quite an element of refund of capital value of cars.  Therefore, there is quite a number of anomalies, but they are not all in relation to the availability of ministerial cars with all the restrictions and drawbacks they may have.</P>

I do not know how realistic Deputies opposite are pretending to be when they suggest that no commercial traveller uses his car for private purposes, or does any Deputy suggest that all commercial travellers are on provincial beats far away from home?  Quite a number of them are on beats which allow them to go home every evening.  I have seen cars of commercial travellers at golf clubs, licensed premises; I have seen them shopping.  The Deputies opposite know that.

      <P>There are innumerable agents and representatives, persons of various descriptions who would inevitably come into the category of commercial traveller if you tried to define one for tax purposes.  It would seem to me to be flying in the face of reality to assume that cars given by firms which include as a perk, indeed as an advertised perk, as a condition of employment, the availability of cars for private use.  Are we to ignore that, to consider that it is not a benefit.  Of course, it is a benefit.  Anybody who has ever financed his own car, paid for the running of it, paid for its insurance and road taxation, petrol and so forth, knows it is a considerable benefit to have the use of a car provided by another.</P>
      <P>What we have done, in fact, is to save people a certain amount of irritating keeping of accounts.  It has worked comparatively smoothly and it did not give rise to the fears which people had last year that the system would not work smoothly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Another aspect of this imposition is a matter of strict justice involving certain people.  The word &ldquo;equity&rdquo; has been pitched around a bit; the Minister likes to use it.  I am thinking of the person who applies for one of these positions which carries what the Minister calls this perk which, as a result of the Minister's direct action, can have the effect of raising his putative income by £300 minimum right up the range as has been said.</P>
      <P>Let us take John Doe who is looking for a job.  He is a good commercial traveller with confidence in himself and he has an offer of two jobs. One job carries a somewhat smaller salary and the other job has this bonus of use of car.  In my part of the country John Doe will look at his situation and will decide, if both jobs are available to him, which is the better for him and no small part in his decision will be played by the actual worth of what the firm are paying or offering.</P>
      <P>Before the Minister laid his cold and clammy hands on the commercial traveller in this enactment the car would be counted and the man could make a decision to take a job on the strength of getting the car with it.  In justice, that man should be allowed to continue to enjoy that car in the same conditions as when he took up the job originally and it is a grave injustice to him to throw in the car as part of his remuneration, seeing that he may have turned down a job which would have been better under the old system of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a grave obligation on the Minister to see to it that the conditions of employment of people who had already taken up the jobs do not deteriorate. The Minister may say this has happened last year and this year and that the turnover of cars is about <Col N="1572" /> the same.  That is no consolation to the man who had a choice and who made the wrong decision not because of his lack of judgment but because the Minister by direct action will punish him in a way he had not been punished before taking the job.</P>
    <P>As I have said, people should not have their conditions of employment changed radically by ministerial action to their disadvantage, but this has happened in a number of cases to my knowledge.  The Minister may argue that form now on the existence of this provision is generally known.  That is a possible though not a total answer to the point made by Deputies Haughey, Colley and de Valera.  I do not think the position of any citizen should be worsened, even if it were only one, and I know there is more than one, through the incorporation of a provision like this in a taxing Bill.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.  The words &ldquo;wholly and exclusively employed&rdquo; are nostalgic.  The people whom we visit in tax offices are always quoting &ldquo;wholly and exclusively&rdquo; and they are not easy to convince about the &ldquo;wholly and exclusively&rdquo; at times. The point was put in the House this morning that the commercial traveller who does not use the car privately should be free from this tax and the Minister said that if a person so convinces the commissioners the car will be free from tax.  However, the provision as it stands punishes people who have made a judgment which they cannot go back on.  If they had had foreknowledge&mdash;foreboding would be a better word&mdash;that we would have the type of Minister for Finance we have and that he would be likely to lay his hands on them, they might have chosen another job, but for the benefit for themselves and their families they chose the job which they thought would remunerate them best, from direct remuneration and perquisites.</P>
    <P>Despite all the hardening of his heart during the past four years and that it is well known the more often you commit a heinous act the easier it becomes and the less humanity remains, I am appealing to the Minister to accept the amendment and <Col N="1573" /> thereby to make the other kind of name for himself in the dying moments of the 20th Dáil.  I thought I saw a softening of complexion a few moments ago, and if more talk from me should push a little more humanity back into a habitation from which it has been excluded I would continue.  I like the man who laughs because it is possible to convince him, and I am sure the Minister could take the wind out of all our sails by saying in a magnificent gesture in this late moment of our lives together that he will accept the amendment, that he has seen the injustice outlined by me and other Deputies in regard to this specific matter. Great men are remembered in their own lifetimes by their achievements, but in the end it is their <i>jeu d'esprit</i> that will make them remembered and I am appealing to the Minister to perform his <i>jeu d'esprit</i> now.

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I sincerely hope that the change Deputy Wilson has asked for will occur, but anybody who has seen the Minister's performance in the past four years will know that he is far removed from the world's realities and I doubt very much that he will accept the amendment.  It is this kind of harshness we have seen in all his financial measures to date and it is this that has completely undermined confidence in the Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey tabled this amendment because the provision it seeks to amend is unjust.  The Minister, without giving any figures to prove it, has stated that a car means an additional income of £6 per week to a commercial traveller.  He is saying &ldquo;You are in the commercial travelling business and we deem that to be private income&rdquo;.  The majority of commercial travellers are not in the high income bracket.  By and large their cars are used in the course of their businesses. Many of them return home, having driven for five days, and are not anxious to resume their driving activities over the weekend.  They prefer to remain at home with their wives and families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1574" /> There are commercial travellers who use their cars exclusively in the course of their business.  It is unjust of the Minister to say to them that they are deemed to have that £300 additional income.  This type of provision is unjust and has destroyed much incentive so badly needed at present.  We know perfectly well that if we want to get the best people in other walks of life we must pay for them.  This section of our community undertake a very responsible task in selling our products and manufactures.</P>
    <P>I believe it short-sighted to include these people in the Bill.  Indeed, over the past four or five years we have had similar sections in Finance Bills with no great significance to the Exchequer. I appreciate fully that the Minister must get revenue, that Departments must be run and various social services financed.  We do not dispute that, but we are critical of the hardship being imposed on a small section of the community.  We know the figure of £300 could be greatly increased. We know it is preferable and safer for the commercial traveller to drive a reasonably sized larger car. But, under this section, if they increase the value of their car, they are penalised.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Wilson requested, I would ask the Minister to have a change of heart in the dying days of this House.  Since the present Minister assumed office we have had repressive legislation, especially in regard to Finance Bills.  For that reason the economy is at present in a depressed state.  This Government's approach has always been a negative one.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider acceptance of Deputy Haughey's amendment.</P>

      <i>The Sunday Times</i> had a very interesting article on the 16th January last on this very issue of company cars, the subtitle of which was: &ldquo;Can you beat the system?&rdquo; The whole tenor of the argument in the article was that more and more companies were issuing their employees with more and more cars because it was a convenient way of beating the system and that this led the Inland Revenue Commissioners in Britain to devise some way of stopping what was clearly becoming an abuse.  The article concerned concluded with these very apt words:</P>
    <P>In the past, more depended on your skill in negotiating with the Inspector, which is a tactful way of saying you are good at telling him the tale.  That factor is henceforth reduced.</P>
    <P>That was the purpose of our amendment in 1976 legislation, to limit the area of argumentation and to remove from people the temptation of telling tales that might cause them to blush if they were not subsequently established.</P>

      <P>The Automobile Association has estimated, and has published here, that the cheapest car on the road, which is not usually one assigned to commercial travellers, costs not less than £1,000 to run annually.  When one considers that two out of every seven days a car is available to a commercial traveller to use privately&mdash;and it is available to him also to use in the evenings if he is not about his commercial business&mdash; one sees that the provisions are very generous.  The fact that there has been such little real complaint is a fair indication that these provisions have been accepted.</P>
      <P>This morning I made a reference to what I believed to be were the beliefs of Deputy Haughey in relation to value-added tax and I undertook, if I could find it, to quote the text. In fairness to Deputy Haughey, I would like now to refer to what I have been able to find so far.  Speaking on the Financial Resolutions on 22nd May, 1973, at column 1647 of Volume 265 of the Official Report Deputy Haughey said:</P>
      <P>Another significant feature in the budget is the change in the VAT structure.  I have given quite a lot of thought to this and I am convinced it is a mistake.  I think it was an unfortunate election promise which had to be redeemed.  It is unfortunate that the promise was made in the first place.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill on 17th July, 1973, at column 1019 of Volume 267 of the Official Report, Deputy Haughey said:</P>
      <P>I believe, and I have said this in my budget speech, that the exemption of food in the VAT structure was a mistake and that time will prove that.  However, it is done now and will come into operation in September and there is not much point in our railing at it from this side of the House except once again to indicate our disapproval of a move which I am afraid was saddled on the Government by the necessity to honour an exuberant election promise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1578" /> It would appear from that that Deputy Haughey was opposed to the removal of value-added tax from food and also opposed to exuberant election promises.</P>

I think it is a pity he is opposed to the removal of value-added tax from food but I am glad to note he does not favour exuberant election promises.

      <P>We have discussed this amendment in considerable detail. We have put our arguments as forcibly as we can.  I should like now to summarise the arguments and make a final plea to the Minister.  Our arguments have not been refuted by the Minister and any impartial listener would certainly come down on our side because we have proved our case pretty conclusively.  The Minister in an attempt to distract attention from what is involved in this amendment went off on a number of side issues. Now this is a very restrictive amendment. We are not talking about benefits in kind in general and the quotations the Minister gave us from what he obviously regards as his bible, <i>The Sunday Times</i> and <i>The News of the World</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;are not relevant. These articles and the Minister's general remarks dealt with benefits in kind in general.  We are not arguing about benefits in kind in general.  We recognise that there has to be some sort of legislation about benefits in kind if there is to be equity in the taxation system.  We are talking about a very restricted category and a very <Col N="1579" /> qualified situation.  We are talking about people who have a car given to them because it is necessary for their business purposes.  They have no choice.  The company makes the car available in order that they will be able to go about their business in the company's interest.  It is not a voluntary decision on their part.</P>
      <P>The Minister kept bringing in other instances but in all those the people voluntarily decided to have a car. What we object to is involuntary acceptance of a car being used to raise an income tax assessment on these people.  The commercial traveller whose company provides him with a car has really no option but to have the car at home with him at the weekend.  The Minister argues that because the car is at his disposal he must be assessed.  That is unfair.  The benefit the man is supposed to derive is imaginary.  It is illusory.</P>
      <P>The Minister has gone a long way to admitting our argument by confessing something none of us knew, namely, that if a commercial traveller leaves the car in the company's premises over the weekend no benefit in kind would issue.  The fact the Minister makes that admission concedes our argument in principle.  What is the difference if the commercial traveller takes the car home and does not use it?  The Minister has brought about a situation where it is mandatory on the Revenue Commissioners to issue an assessment.  The Minister could accept this amendment without in any way affecting the general application of the principle that benefits in kind should be taxed.  This amendment is confined to a clearly defined category of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not follow the Minister's argument when he said my amendment falls because if it were accepted it would apply only to commercial travellers who work seven days a week and 24 hours a day.  I do not think that could be read into it.  The words &ldquo;wholly and exclusively&rdquo; are only used in income tax legislation.  In the amendment they clearly govern the word &ldquo;employ&rdquo; and the amendment is, therefore, applicable to persons wholly and exclusively employed in <Col N="1580" /> the capacity of commercial travellers. They must be working only as commercial travellers and nothing else. The amendment will clearly be restricted to <i>bona fide</i> commercial travellers and to no one else.</P>
    <P>There is no difficulty in defining commercial travellers.  The Revenue Commissioners and the parliamentary draughtsman have defined very accurately and with great clarity much more difficult categories of persons. Indeed, I would undertake to draft a perfectly valid definition of commercial traveller.  Indeed, I do not think they need to be defined.  Normal language would enable the Revenue Commissioners to administer this amendment because the profession of commercial traveller defines itself.  I do not think any difficulty would arise.</P>
    <P>Apart from this, the Minister knows very well that if he is prepared to concede the principle of the amendment there is no difficulty, even across the House now, in adjusting the wording to suit the circumstances.  I think he should agree to the principle because it is a very reasonable proposition, a restricted and guarded one, that we are putting before him.  The Minister must realise that in selecting motor cars in this connection he is creating another anomaly.  There are other types of person who, in the course of their employment, have the use of some particular thing which they can use outside their employment for their own purposes.  These things are not subject to benefit-in-kind provisions. Even as the situation is, it contains anomalies to the detriment of that important and valuable body of persons, commercial travellers.</P>
    <P>I gave the Minister a case of a commercial traveller in my constituency who, through no fault of his own, finds himself confronted with a bill going back over five years&mdash;the assessment goes from 1971 to 1976&mdash;and it is undoubtedly causing this man and his family considerable hardship to have to meet this bill.  The Minister attempted the puerile argument that the person in question must have been concealing the position from the Revenue Commissioners.  He never dreamt that he was under any obligation to pay for any illusory or imaginary <Col N="1581" /> benefit derived from the car at weekends.  He did not think it arose and still does not believe it should arise.  There is no question of attempting to conceal anything.  It is the Revenue Commissioners' or rather the Minister's fault because obviously he gave the commissioners some instruction to get after everybody&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not dispute that. The Minister rebuts arguments I do not make.  When speaking originally I said that Dr. Ryan brought in the benefit in kind legislation when he was Minister for Finance.  I do not dispute that those benefit in kind provisions were there since 1971-72 but at this stage, because the provisions were not implemented, I object to the Revenue Commissioners now going back five or six years and giving him, through no fault of his own, a bill for accummulated arrears of tax on some imaginary income which the man never received. It is bad enough when the Revenue Commissioners, by mistake, omit to send out an assessment and have to go back after a number of years and issue accumulated assessments where there is cash income involved and the person concerned got some income.  Here we have an assessment raised in respect of an imaginary income or benefit.  The man is confronted with a bill for what is, in his circumstances, a large sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister sought to rebut my suggestion that he has concentrated entirely on the taxation function of his office as Minister.  I think it is true, and I fully agree with everything Deputy Fitzpatrick said about this concentration on taxation, this squeezing of the last ounce from every possible source undoubtedly having had a disincentive effect on the community.  This is an example of it here.  I regard this as hounding a section of the community, screwing taxation from them which they are not morally or legally liable to pay.  It is bad taxation and the Minister should recognise that and remedy it because, as Deputy Colley said, this kind of thing gives rise to evasion.  It is difficult to blame people who feel they are being unjustly <Col N="1582" /> hounded for tax that is not due for resorting to evasion.  We all condemn it but it can be understood in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted the head of some professional organisation in support of his budget.  Does he not realise &mdash;again it proves how much out of touch with reality the Minister is&mdash; that the business and professional community are so beaten down and depressed that any little crumb the Minister threw to them this year as a taxation concession would be welcome, since they have been so pilloried, abused by the Minister and his Cabinet who created the impression that they were all rogues and villains whose only aim was to avoid taxation? They have been so used for four years by the Minister that anything he did this year would be greeted with a sigh of relief.  It is like the man waiting to have his head chopped off saying a prayer for the executioner and it is in that light that the Minister should regard those pathetic comments that he read out.</P>
    <P>As regards earned income, the far greater proportion of people are overtaxed and after four years of the Minister's tax regime all incentives and motivation to work better and harder have been wiped out.  The way to restore enterprise and activity, efficiency and productivity in the community is to have a substantial reduction in the burden of taxation on personal earned income.  This is not a great contribution in that regard but it would be some indication that the Minister does more than pay lip service to the idea of incentives.  In the last six months or so, probably because of the election coming up and a need to replenish election coffers, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance began to butter up the business community.  We heard again for the first time after a long bleak period of four years' commendation of the profit motive.  The Taoiseach spoke in favour of profits as being necessary to buttress the economy and provide means whereby development can take place.  The Minister for Finance did likewise.  He went to various functions recently and <Col N="1583" /> addressed business people, industrialists and people in the commercial world and began to utter soothing noises.  He praised them for their energy and enterprise and encouraged them to get moving again.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, we do not hear that kind of talk from other members of the Coalition.  For instance, I think Deputy FitzGerald still regards most businessmen and industrialists as public enemies, not quite subversives but bordering on it.  Although they conceal it, it is the secret ambition of most of the Labour Ministers to have a total socialist, State-controlled economy here and for most of this era while Deputy Ryan has been Minister for Finance they have succeeded in pushing very far in that direction.  We now have one of the most heavily taxed countries in Europe.  We have a State which takes as high a proportion of our GNP as any other country in Europe.  We have gone a fair distance along the socialist road during the term of Deputy Ryan as Minister for Finance.  This last minute, death door repentance and this sudden commendation of private enterprise has emerged only because there is a general election in the offing.</P>
    <P>The Minister certainly strained all the bounds of credibility in some of his remarks about the economy. Listening to him in the early stages of the debate when he spoke about the economy, one would almost believe that everything was marvellous and that we had one of the best economies in the world.  One would almost believe we had demonstrated to the world how to get out of the economic recession.  The Minister kept repeating that we had come out of it better than most and he went to a French newspaper to get some Far East country as a basis to prop up his argument.  We do not want to go to French newspapers, to Singapore, to Hong Kong or to anywhere else.  We want to keep the debate about our economy to Irish circumstances.  We want to look at the economy through Irish eyes and to the conditions that affect us and our fellow-citizens in the Community.  It is a dull, dismal and bleak picture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1584" /> Again, I want to quote to the Minister what the vice-president of the ICTU said the other day.  He flatly contradicted the Minister's optimistic and glowing description of the economy.  From his special, expert and knowledgeable position he said that in his view 120,000 people would be unemployed rather than having a decrease in the number as the Minister is asking us to believe.  The Minister is making a great deal of play about how well the Irish economy is doing in comparison with other economies. That is ludicrous and absurd. Let us face the fact that compared with most of our European partners we are a very under-developed economy. We could increase by up to 10 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to the wishes of the Chair.  I will leave that aspect with a final comment.  If the Minister has a look at the OECD table of economic and social statistics he will see that of the 25 or 26 nations in the OECD Ireland was fifth from the bottom.  We are down there with Greece, Portugal and Turkey, not very different from them with regard to <i>per capita</i> income and the various indicators by which social and economic progress are measured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us not have any more of this nonsense that we are a great economy and that everything in the garden is lovely.  That is not true; it is just deceiving the people.  We have enormous problems facing us.  We have <Col N="1585" /> 115,000 or 120,000 people unemployed &mdash;probably it is more&mdash;and we will have to create 200,000 new jobs in the next three or four years.  We are not getting anywhere near doing that. Even in the context of the general election, I appeal to the Minister to stop making these absurd statements that the Irish economy is marvellous, the best in Europe, and that we overcame the recession better than anyone else because of his magnificent management.</P>
    <P>The amendment is simple.  It is restricted in its scope and it is fully justified by the arguments we have put forward.  We are trying to correct an anomaly, to remedy an injustice. We are trying to get fair play for a small but a not unimportant section of the community.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister&mdash;as Deputy Wilson put it, as, perhaps, his last act as Minister for Finance&mdash;to accept the amendment.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It will be seen from the table to section 6 that it is proposed to increase the allowances in respect of a married man, single person and a widowed person.  As I indicated earlier, the increases are respectively 9 per cent, 7 per cent and 3 per cent. The proposal involved in this amendment is to increase the existing allowances in respect of a dependent child.  There are two categories of dependent children; one is the child under 16 years and not permanently incapacitated or the child of more than 16 years who is in receipt of full-time instruction while the other category is the child who is permanently incapacitated.  It is proposed here to increase the allowances in respect of those categories of children by 10 per cent so as to give the revised allowances as set out in the amendment.  It is proposed also to make a similar proportionate increase in the allowance for a dependent relative.</P>
    <P>I adverted on the first section to the question of a dependent relative.  Consequently, I do not propose to dwell <Col N="1589" /> on it now at any length except to point out that what has been done in this regard is to increase the income qualification but not to increase the actual amount of tax allowance.  In the case of children there is no proposal in the Bill to increase the allowance.  The consequences of this is that such increase as is provided for in the section, an increase which as I indicated earlier is not even keeping pace with inflation, will be the same in respect of a single person or a married person with no children as for a married man with ten children.  Clearly, it will not in any way meet the serious difficulties that are arising for most people but particularly for those with large families or, indeed, for those with a reasonable number of children.  The pressure on the pockets of those persons is becoming such that it is absolutely distressing for some.  Indeed, the mothers of families are breaking down under the strain of trying to meet the situation with which they are being asked cope.  I am not suggesting for a moment that the acceptance of this amendment would make an enormous difference to such people but at this stage anything that would help to ease the burden on families is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position at the moment to give any estimate of what this would involve.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to do so but it is not sufficient answer to say, as he has said in regard to other proposals, that this change would place a burden on other taxpayers. As has been pointed out already, that would not be the case having regard to buoyancy of revenue. But even if it did mean putting a burden on other taxpayers, is there any taxpayer more entitled to relief than the one who is bringing up young children in present circumstances? What case is there for giving the same kind of treatment to a single person or to a married couple with no children as to those with families?  Having regard to the allowance that is being given not going anywhere near meeting inflation, the omission in respect of an allowance for children is all the more serious.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were increasing the allowances in respect of married, single and widowed persons sufficiently to <Col N="1590" /> give them a real increase and in order to enable them to keep ahead of inflation perhaps there could be an argument at this time for not increasing the allowance in respect of children but since he is not doing that the reality is that people are faced with a situation in which such increases as are being given are not keeping pace with inflation.  At the same time those who are trying to rear children&mdash;and those are the ones in greatest need&mdash;are not being given any consideration in regard to their problems.  In effect they are being treated in the same way as single people, married couples or widowed persons with dependent children.  I hope that the logic of the argument in favour of this will commend itself to the Minister and that he will find it possible to accept the amendment.  If, however, he does not find it possible to do so I trust that he will be able to give some convincing reasons for not accepting what is on the face of it a very reasonable amendment which is not seeking anything that could be remotely described as excessive in the circumstances that we are faced with today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot run a country by making a large number of variations in tax allowances throughout a year.  Even giving concessions now has its own complications as it involves amendments of tax-free certificates and so forth with an immense amount of paperwork which confuses the taxpayer just as much as it throws a burden on to the administration.  Therefore, it is only appropriate that a Government should assess what are the feasible reliefs to be given in taxation at budget time and, having done so, then to set about implementing the action necessary to give effect to them.  That is what we have done this year.  I will come to the merits or lack thereof of the proposal in a minute, but I am afraid that enormous administrative problems would be created even if the motion was otherwise all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one very good argument for leaving Fianna Fáil in Opposition, that is that they seem to have some conscience in Opposition or they have <Col N="1591" /> time to think.  They certainly come forward with proposals which would involve taxation relief and enormous expenditure at the same time.  They make an effort to be all things to all men, but I am afraid that the image they present in the long run is of people who have not done their homework, or if they have done it, knowing the results are quite reckless in presenting policies and quite indifferent as to whether or not those policies contain contradictions and inconsistencies. A great deal of what we have heard in this House over the last few years from the Opposition has been full of contradictions and inconsistencies. There have been demands for reduction in Government expenditure leading to reductions in taxation, leading to reduced borrowing, while there have been even more strident demands for increases in expenditure on several fronts.</P>
    <P>The Opposition while in power had an increase in living costs of 82 per cent.  During that period instead of allowing personal income tax and tax-free allowances to keep pace with reductions in the value of money, they left them alone for 11 years and did nothing whatsoever as the cost of living eroded the value of personal tax allowances.  I am taking their whole period in office.  Belatedly they made two small efforts at correcting the imbalance which they had allowed to develop.  They had reductions amounting to 30 per cent as against a cost of living rise of 82 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the Minister's figures right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, my figures are right.  If they are wrong I will be the first to admit it.  I am satisfied now that they are right.  Deputy Colley has come forward with certain suggestions for increased allowances.  If these allowances were to be granted the addition would be not less than £5 million and probably between £5 and £6 million.  Deputy Colley says that revenue buoyancy would look after that.  Revenue buoyancy could well be the most convenient excuse which people will offer for giving concessions <Col N="1592" /> on the one hand or indulging in more expenditure on the other.  But even with an expanding economy such as we have at present there is a limit to revenue buoyancy.  We estimated a great deal of such revenue buoyancy as we are having this year at budget time and it enabled us to give substantial tax concessions, which on a yearly basis are costing £72 million. That is quite an amount of revenue buoyancy or call it what you will.  It is quite a large amount of money from public revenue to leave to people to spend themselves instead of the Government taking it from them.</P>
      <P>Even since the budget we have looked at the revenue figures and in the light of their buoyancy we have reduced the amount we have collected in farm taxation in 1977 by about £17 million.  We have provided additional moneys for food subsidies and the subsidisation of town gas.  We have also increased a number of other Government expenditures.  Therefore revenue buoyancy is substantially committed this year and does not leave room for more Santa Clause presents of the kind that the Opposition can very easily hold out when they have not the responsibility of providing the money to meet them.  Tax concessions cost revenue.  That is revenue foregone, and if Government expenditure is not reduced to correspond with reductions in revenue, then taxation somewhere else has to rise and the burden has to be transferred to others.</P>
      <P>The taxation and national wage agreements of 1977 are combined. Generally speaking, wages do not vary according to the number of children which workers may have.  In devising a package of acceptable tax reductions and wages we have to bear in mind the fact that workers at large would be voting upon what was on offer to them and that they would include people who were single as well at those who were married and had children.  In order to assist families with children we increased what I might call the welfare or post office children's allowances which are not themselves subject to tax so that we catered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have never been.  The Deputy may remember that some years ago there was a temporary adjustment and that people whose incomes were above a certain level would be subject to tax on that portion which was in excess of the appointed level.  That was only a temporary measure but otherwise the allowances were not taxed.  Therefore families had the gross benefit of increases in children's allowances.  Varying in relation to their income, tax rates and so on, they have had reductions in their tax load.  At the lower end the value of the reduction in tax is about 80 per cent.  Some people are paying 86 per cent less tax this year than last year.  Of course, this declines; but the average is 11 or 12 per cent of tax and the wage concessions are very substantial.  We have looked after the families in a sensible way, giving the relief where it would be of most benefit and giving the initial money direct to the mother.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Colley said, the burdens of the mother and the housewife are considerable.  The Government have been anxious to relieve them and that is why we are giving children's allowance and why we have also increased the subsidies that were given in respect of essential foodstuffs, cheese, milk and so forth and also in respect of town gas.  These are significant reliefs to the family budget and we believe, in all the circumstances, that it was the right thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly we will, from year to year, have to look at the personal tax allowances.  One of the greatest complaints often made is that we do not give everybody the same precise percentage increase, but to say that that is wrong is to assume that the tax code is perfect and that there is no need to vary it.  I am satisfied that from time to time one should have variations in increases.  This year the increases given are quite substantial and very costly, as I pointed out, in terms of revenue <Col N="1594" /> foregone, and it would not be justifiable to further increase the amount of revenue which would be lost as a consequence of which some essential services might have to be cut.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister sought to refer in a rather selective way to the record of previous Fianna Fáil Governments, I presume he was referring at least to the period back to 1957 in his calculations.  That being so, I think it is only right that I should point out that he did not make a similar estimation in regard to his own tenure of office, but the undeniable fact is that since the Coalition came to Government, whatever the position of the taxpayer was at that time, and without getting involved in arguments of what might or might not have happened in previous years, it is now worse than it was because inflation has far exceeded the tax cuts granted, even if you include the ones proposed, which, of course, have to operate until the end of the present fiscal year, so that they would be covering a period up to the beginning of April next.  Therefore, the position of taxpayers as taxpayers is now considerably worse in real terms than it was before the Coalition came into office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever about that aspect of the argument, the Minister seemed to be saying that, because the national pay agreement negotiations adverted to pay for individual workers without regard to their family commitments&mdash;he is quite right in saying that&mdash;the Government had increased the child cash allowances.  It is true they did, but I do not think that even the Minister would try to boast about those increases. They were pretty miserly.  For the first child there was no increase at all, and then it was 50p per month after that.  I do not think the Minister would attempt to suggest that that went anywhere near redressing the balance that needs to be redressed.  I am not suggesting that this amendment would go very far in redressing that <Col N="1595" /> balance, but I am saying that any step in that direction is worth while.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear the Minister say that we should not rely on buoyancy of revenue for things like this.  Speaking again from recollection, I think he said he relied for buoyancy on £60 million in his budget calculations. The indications up to now are that the buoyancy is exceeding his expectations. I do not know whether that will continue, but that would appear to be the position at the moment.  He went on to point out the various commitments the Government have taken on since the budget calculations were made: additional food subsidies, a cut-back in revenue from farming taxation, and, more recently, the subsidy for town gas.</P>
    <P>How is it that the Government, not having provided for such things, suddenly find that, despite their provision for revenue buoyancy in the budget, they can now make provision, according to the Minister, for all of these things, apparently, out of further revenue buoyancy, although he did not give details of that, but he cannot find £5 million to £6 million to increase the income tax allowance in respect of children by 10 per cent?  If there is any logic in what the Minister is saying, and assuming the Government have been acting in good faith, it means that in their calculations there has been enough additional revenue going through to meet the various items he mentioned but they cannot go any further; that therefore, apart from the things the Minister mentioned and all the other announcements that were made which will involve a drain on the revenue, there is no possibility of the Government making any further announcement of commitment involving the expenditure of any further money, because the Minister for Finance has told us now that £5 million to £6 million for the purpose of raising the child allowances under the income tax code cannot be found.  The money is not available out of revenue buoyancy because it has already been committed to the things he mentioned such as the cut-back in the revenue expected from taxation, increased food subsidies and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1596" /> I hope the Minister will adhere to that argument in the next few days and if, in fact, he intends to do otherwise, it is dishonest to come in here and tell us that such money cannot be found.  If, on the other hand, his view is that further money could be found but he can think of better ways to spend it, then he should say so.  But he should not tell us that the money simply cannot be found.  If it cannot be found, then we may take it that there will be no further commitment by the Government to further expenditure other than that already announced.</P>
    <P>I must confess to a certain degree of scepticism as to the outcome being no further commitment by the Government. I have a suspicion, too, that my scepticism may be shared by many people even outside the ranks of Fianna Fáil.  If that scepticism is justified, then the Minister is simply misleading the House in what he has said.  What, in effect, he is saying is: &ldquo;I do not care what case there is for this.  I do not care how difficult things are for people at the moment and the fact that a married man with two children on £2,500 a year will be saving a little over £1 a week in tax.  I am going to refuse to find £5 million to £6 million to increase the allowance moderately by 10 per cent, not even keeping up with inflation, in respect of children which the person has to support.&rdquo; It is the Minister's prerogative to make that choice.  I believe myself it is a wrong choice, an anti-social choice.  He should have taken the opportunity he was given in this amendment and I think he was quite wrong not to do so.  We will watch his antics within the next few days with considerable interest in the light of what he has said to us now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point that the co-operation of the employers of the country will be essential if the scheme is to be a success because the moneys we are voting here for the purpose this afternoon will remain unused if they do not recruit the workers even at the attractive rates of premia set out by us, that is, the £20 and £10 rates.  One of the basic purposes of that advertising campaign was to ensure that employers would be aware of the principal features of the scheme, that they would understand the advantages of participation and that they would answer my appeal that they should co-operate in making the scheme a success.  We have defined success for the scheme as the return to work of 11,000 people, 6,000 adults and 5,000 school leavers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the prominence and controversy aroused by the advertising campaign&mdash;although certain features of that campaign could not appeal to most Deputies of the House&mdash;I want to thank members of the Opposition for their assistance in ensuring that it got the prominence I wished it to get and which I believe it was necessary <Col N="1601" /> for it to get if the employers of the country were to be aware of the advantages of participating in the scheme.</P>
    <P>Details of the scheme have been circulated to Deputies so they are aware of them.  I would reiterate that the scheme applies to employers in manufacturing industry and in agriculture, including horticulture.  If an employer in those industries increases his work force over the level in the week commencing 10th January, 1977, he will receive premia, provided he takes on eligible workers.  A premium of £20 per week is paid in respect of the recruitment of a person 20 years of age or over on 1st January, 1977, who has received unemployment benefit or assistance at some time since June, 1974, and who has been on the live register for the four weeks immediately prior to employment under the scheme.  Deputies will recall that under the earlier premium programme premiums were paid only in respect of persons who had received unemployment benefit.  Therefore we have extended the scheme to cover those categories in the employment incentive scheme.</P>
    <P>In the first week of advertising of the scheme we received from manufacturing industry over 485 inquiries from employers&mdash;these inquiries are at present being examined by Department staff&mdash;and over 163 in agriculture because, as Deputies will recall we had extended the scope of the scheme into agriculture, giving us a total, in the first week, of 648 inquiries.</P>
    <P>In the second week of advertising the promotion campaign netted 721 inquiries from manufacturing industry and close on 300 inquiries from agriculture. The total inquiries received from 8th May to 20th May was 1,206 from manufacturing industry and 434 from agriculture, making a total of 1,640 inquiries.  Most reasonable Deputies will accept that, whatever party points may be made about the actual format of the promotion campaign, the campaign has achieved its objective of ensuring that employers are aware of the advantages of the scheme and the importance of their co-operation in the scheme.  We have <Col N="1602" /> to sift these inquiries now, but the campaign has got off to a very good start towards our objective of getting 11,000 people back to work.</P>
    <P>A premium of £20 a week will be paid in respect of a person under 20 years of age on 1st January, 1977, if he has been in receipt of unemployment benefit at some time from June, 1974, and has been on the live register for the four weeks immediately prior to employment under the scheme. It is intended that young people who have lost jobs and redundant apprentices should attract a premium equivalent to that for adult workers. For the first time employers will receive a premium if they recruit school leavers.  It has been argued there is discrimination here as between the school leaver and the adult. Workers under £20 with some work experience will be entitled to the larger premium of £20.  Most Deputies will accept that the wage rate for the youth is lower than that for the adult and the £10 premium represents a not insignificant sum for prospective employers thinking of taking on young workers.</P>
    <P>Crucial to the success of the scheme is the winning of the co-operation of employers, be they manufacturers, agriculturists or horticulturists.  If farmers and horticulturists do not respond the money will remain unused. That is why it is necessary to make all prospective employers aware of the scheme and get their consent to participation in the scheme.  It is a free country and, if people do not wish to participate, no one will be returned to work as a result of this scheme.</P>
    <P>We spent a good deal of time considering the proper description of school leavers who would qualify and we finally decided eligibility would mean that the young person would be under 20 years of age on 1st January, 1977, have left full time education for at least four months, have registered with the National Manpower Service and have had no permanent employment experience.  I was disappointed with our experience of the scheme which preceeded this one.  It was not similar in all respects.  There are certain differences in this scheme in that <Col N="1603" /> we have catered for school leavers and for agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Did not the premium employment programme cover agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Not fully and that is one of the reasons why there had to be a change.  Farmers had to comply with a nine-month period.  That condition does not appear in the new scheme.  The first scheme did include agriculture but the number of inquiries we have received in one day from agriculture interests in regard to this scheme are away beyond the number we received under the old premium employment programme.  There are differences in scope and qualifying provisions and I believe many more farmers will now find it possible to participate in the new scheme.  The qualifications requiring a nine-month minimum employment period was a major obstacle and limited the effectiveness of the scheme in the area of agriculture. We have reduced the period now from nine months to three months. The scheme will operate from 28th February, 1977, to 24th February, 1978.  Employers will be assured of premium for 24 weeks for additional eligible workers recruited during the currency of the scheme.</P>
      <P>In devising the conditions for the new scheme I was conscious of certain criticisms of the earlier scheme made by manufacturing employer interests. The point was made that there was an excessive amount of paperwork before qualification under the scheme could be assured.  I have tried as far as possible to respond to these criticisms and I have reduced the records employers will need to keep to enable them to participate in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date there have been in all 1,700 inquiries.  I do not think anyone will deny the effectiveness of the advertising campaign designed to promote the advantages of the scheme. Some made the point that they were dissatisfied with what they described as personalising the campaign.  I have given the results of the first phase and if the scheme succeeds in putting <Col N="1604" /> 11,000 people back to work I shall be well satisfied with that result.  The scheme is designed to achieve that target.  A reputable advertising agency advised professionally that they considered a personal appeal essential for the success of the campaign in gaining the support of employers and I accepted that professional advice. Listening to some Opposition speakers one gets the impression that they have forgotten the main objective of the project, namely, getting 11,000 people back to work.  Instead of doing all they can to help the scheme they have become obsessed with that particular aspect, the least important aspect from the point of view of the overall moneys voted, £4.1 million.  It is not always possible legitimately to make such a personal appeal.  It is only where it is felt, on the best advice available, that it would assist in getting as much public support for a programme as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite asked if there was any precedent for this in the past. The precedent I mention here is for an advertisement that was not used in the Irish papers but we have a precedent where, presumably on the best advice available from the advertising agency responsible, the Taoiseach of the day accepted the need to have personalised treatment of a change in the country's trading position. I refer to the advertisement under the heading: &ldquo;A message from the Prime Minister of Ireland, Mr. John Lynch&rdquo;, which appeared in newspapers of January 2nd and 3rd, 1973, in Britain and continental counries including journals like the <i>Financial Times, L'Monde, Telegraph of the Netherlands</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I defend the right of the Prime Minister, Mr. John Lynch, as he is described in this personalised advertisement, published in these journals to accept the advice he then got.  The Prime Minister Mr. John Lynch accepted the best advice available to him at that time and allowed his name, signature and photograph to go out in the name of the country in all those journals in those countries.  I hasten to add that this advertisement did not appear in any of the Irish newspapers nor am I suggesting that it did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that he accepted the advice available to him that some personalisation of an entire country was necessary to publicise a change in the trading position of that country.  In the circumstances of the time I think he acted correctly and I think I did the right thing as regards the advice proferred to me by the advertising agency in regard to the promotion of this programme.  Quite rightly, the Deputy says that the serious objective remains, the return of 11,000 people to work.  I do not pretend their return to work would be the the end of the story.  We do not necessarily have anything to exult about in that we are on the way to reducing the present unemployment figure of 100,000 over the next few months but the economy is moving in the right direction.  I suggest that when unemployment is dropping to 112,000 it is a move in the right direction.  When we shall see it drop over the summer months below 110,000, down to 105,000 and below 100,000, while this is not a matter for exulation it gives grounds for satisfaction that the economy is moving in the right direction. I should be the last to suggest that means the country's unemployment problems have been overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1606" /> The great task before us over the next ten years will be the provision of something like 35,000 new, sustainable, productive jobs every year.  We had this debate repeatedly over the early years of this recession and recently when we have been coming out of it and on to a growth path again, and we come back again and again to the failure of the economy to provide sufficient jobs for those seeking them.  We know that failure was masked in the past by the departure of job seekers to Britain.  That substitute for jobs at home will not be with us in future and the great challenge of the next few years is how to provide sufficient jobs for the young people in our growing population at home.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the next few weeks as this topic is debated by public representatives an element of unreality will not creep in.  I trust we shall try to keep this important national debate in true perspective and realise in all humility that the policies pursued up to now, through the 60s and early 70s have failed dismally. To pretend that there is a magic formula to cure unemployment will not fool anybody in that debate. Thirty-five thousand new jobs every year in a free trade environment such as we now as a country exist in, means agreement that costs must be kept down if jobs are to be sustained.  We can no longer hide ourselves in de Valera isolation.  We are in a free trade area in the European Community.  Our goods must compete with foreign goods in the shops of Dublin and the country. If the advantages of being in a free trade area are clear on the agricultural front it might be said they are not equally demonstrable on the industrial front.  The constraints imposed by our membership of the Community do not commit us to think of the easy remedies that were, perhaps, available in the years of protected tariffs.  Extra jobs can only be sustained in a free trade environment if the goods produced are competitive.</P>
    <P>It is clear that those who suggest that I or any other Minister is overcomplacent about the trends in unemployment are making false charges. If I get 11,000 people back to work through the employment incentive <Col N="1607" /> scheme, I shall be happy but I certainly shall not have the illusion that the employment problems are significantly reduced.  I think this programme will materially assist.  The knockers on the unemployment front should look at some concrete, positive things that are being done and this is one of them.  Instead of becoming obsessed by the minor question of how an advertisement campaign is conducted, I would prefer to hear Deputies concerned about unemployment debating what institutional changes we require if sufficient employment is to be provided in the future.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Government have allocated a further £250,000 to the Department of Labour for the assistance of projects designed to increase job opportunities for young people.  With my officials, I have being considering how to use this money to best advantage for young people and the country as a whole.  The employment incentive scheme before us will assist in the recruitment of apprentices, and in the re-employment of redundant persons in manufacturing industries and agriculture but it is evident that quite a number of young people outside manufacturing would not be assisted by this scheme.  Accordingly, as a first stage in the utilisation of these additional funds, I propose to have a scheme drafted to encourage apprentice recruitment in the trades designated by the national training authority not already covered by the employment incentive scheme.  I have decided to have a scheme to encourage apprentice recruitment in AnCO designated trades such as the construction and motor industries not already covered by the employment incentive scheme.  It is my intention that employers in these trades will receive an attractive premium in respect of redundant or unemployed apprentices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We have had more than 1,700 inquiries in the first two weeks of the current campaign and I am confident that we will get the co-operation of the employers in utilising the moneys provided under the scheme thus getting 11,000 people back to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Never has a Minister made such a political football of the unemployment situation and the plight of young people as the Minister for Labour has done in a disgraceful way this afternoon.  We referred to the employment incentive scheme, a scheme that I hope will reach its target this time.  I should like to put a few points on the record first with regard to the scheme, secondly, with regard to unemployment generally and, thirdly, to state that I told him almost two years ago that the premium employment programme would fail to reach its target because of the limitations of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's target was 10,000 jobs and I did not disagree with that. At the same time I said the sky was the limit so far as the target was concerned. There is some significance in the fact that twice in the lifetime of the Dáil two attempts were made to do something about unemployment but both were done within the restrictions of a guillotine motion.  The premium employment programme was introduced during the guillotine programme <Col N="1610" /> of mid-summer, 1975, and this paltry debate on such an important topic is also being conducted within the restrictions of a guillotine motion.  The question must be asked why this is so.  It is simply that the Minister for Labour is ashamed of his own performance and that of the Government in this area.</P>
    <P>Let me disillusion the Minister in case the euphoria of a general election may carry him away.  There is no improvement in the unemployment situation.  On the contrary, it is deteriorating seriously and I can produce figures to prove it.  May I remind him that in 1975 approximately 92,000 people sat for the intermediate, leaving and group certificate examinations. In 1976 approximately 98,000 people sat for the same three examinations, an increase of 6,000.  Next month more than 114,000 people will sit for those examinations, 45,000 sitting for the leaving certificate.  The figures speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a drop in unemployment to the live register since the beginning of the year.  For the sake of accuracy may I point out the correct position?  On 13th May. 1977, there were nearly 113,000 people unemployed, according to the live register, just 1,000 fewer that at the same date last year.  The drop we are talking about is merely a seasonal drop, but because of the forthcoming general election the Minister is trying to convey a different impression to the people.</P>
    <P>Let us compare it with the unemployed figure according to the live register on 11th May, 1973.  If the Minister wants to make political points I am entitled to do the same. The number unemployed at that date was 66,999, a little more than half of the present figure.  Recently on a radio programme Dr. Geary, a distinguished civil servant with long experience in the Central Statistics Office and now connected with the ESRI, was asked a question with regard to this matter.  In view of the fact that the majority of school leavers in the last two or three years have not been included in the live register, he was asked how many more job seekers were there in addition to the 113,000 <Col N="1611" /> referred to.  He said that there were no statistics available and I accept that.  In fact, I have pointed out to this House many times that they should be available.  However, Dr. Geary's answer was 35,000.  Even if we accept his figure&mdash;and as a responsible civil servant I am sure it would be a conservative estimate rather than the reverse&mdash;we are talking about a minimum of 150,000 people unemployed.  To this must be added next month a figure of more than 50,000 young people&mdash;the estimated figure is between 54,000 and 55,000. Many young people are repeating their leaving certificate examination this year simply because of the job situation.</P>
    <P>I want to quote another figure from the ERSI which belies what the Minister has said.  It is the estimate of unemployment in the EEC countries as a percentage of the total workforce. In 1973 our percentage was 7.2, in 1977 it was 14 and the estimate for 1979 is given as 15.8 and for 1980 it is 16.5.  The Minister says we are over the worst of it.  If he does not realise that the problems still exist and the situation continues to deteriorate, it is a good job the Taoiseach has decided to call an end to this Dáil. I wish the employment incentive scheme every success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>They did because they wanted to run from the 50,000 young people who will come on the employment market from the middle of June onwards.  This is why we will have an election at that time and why we are not having an autumn election. The scheme discriminates against young people.  It will take time for that scheme to filter down so that employers can draw £10 on behalf of each of those young people.  Why did the Minister not follow the French scheme which specifically provides for those young people?  Surely they are the people the Government have completely neglected?  They have not given unemployment assistance to girl school leavers.  In fact, very few boys <Col N="1612" /> get it because the means test deprives them of it.  I know of a widow's son who was deprived of unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>We have a headline in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 31st January, 1977, reporting factually from the previous night's jamboree somewhere: &ldquo;O'Leary promises 20,000 jobs by mid-year&rdquo;. This referred to the Minister for Labour.  It stated:</P>
      <P>Unemployment currently running at almost 118,000 should drop below 100,000 by the middle of the year.</P>
      <P>We are five weeks away from the middle of the year and it is a long way away from that 100,000 figure. That was part of the lead up to the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are groups of young people in the country who are positively tackling this problem and who will not gain any benefit under this scheme. The building and service industries have not been included in the scheme. Two years ago I appealed to the Minister to extend the scheme to those industries because it makes for good economics.  If we take the people coming off the live register, who at present number approximately 54,000 in receipt of unemployment benefit, drawing £963,520 per week, the average there is about £20 per person. If we take the scheme operating for a six-months' period the saving to the Exchequer in social welfare payments is approximately £3.1 million.  If 6,000 adults are gone back to work the income from the social welfare stamp, omitting any PAYE contributions, is again £1.1 million over a six-month period for those 6,000 people.  We are talking about a total of £4.2 million. which is exactly what the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Labour spoke about at budget time.  The cost of this scheme is being met by savings and by a direct tax contribution.  I believe there is a profit shown in the scheme if I were able to research the kind of income tax contribution that is there.  I cannot understand why the Minister did not long ago extend this scheme to cover the service and building industries.  It does not matter in what area people are returned to work as long as they are got back to work <Col N="1613" /> and we show good economics from the point of view of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In regard to the advertising campaign I am satisfied that the Minister at last took our advice on the original advertisement he spent so long defending, knowing he was guilty of using it politically to ensure his return to the House from Dublin North Central.  He tried to compare it with something the former Taoiseach did abroad where there was no votes for him.  He did it for the nation's good whereas the Minister for Labour did it for his own good.  He has now changed his point of view and he has a new advertisement which states:</P>
    <P>I will be getting £20 per week for every extra person I employ.</P>
    <P>An employer is shown in the advertisement.</P>
    <P>I believe that private enterprise and young people are deeply concerned about the employment of young people.  I believe one of our national dailies will in the very near future launch a scheme and present prizes to give young people the opportunity of developing their entrepeneurial talents.  I say well done to that newspaper. I compliment them and wish them well with their scheme.  Why are the Government allowing people like that to take the initiative from them and set a headline which they should have set?  It has all been part of a vicious political campaign.  We had it last week in the Mansion House. There were all sorts of declarations of crushing anybody who opposes the present regime.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>While that jamboree was on and despite the promised land of the <Col N="1614" /> Minister for Finance we had our genuine trade union people, as quoted in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 22nd May, saying that before the year's end the official unemployment figure would be 120,000.  I know I have to accept the guillotine which has been drastically imposed for a second time by a Coalition Government on a motion dealing with the creation of employment. I know that you, as an honourable Member of the House, do not like to have to do it.  I will not oppose it. On the two occasions the Minister for Labour introduced an employment programme in the House a guillotine has been imposed by the Taoiseach. who was shown on the front page of today's <i>Irish Times</i> carrying a guillotine. I am convinced that, if the Taoiseach had the opportunity, he would guillotine as quickly the general election campaign.</P>

I can understand their difficulty in this instance, but I understand that in similar instances previously a Bill as amended in Committee was produced at two- or three-minutes' notice by having it printed the night before containing the official amendments.  This was not done.  It is not possible for <Col N="1620" /> us to draft amendments that would be in order, and to allocate allegedly two hours to the Report Stage of this Bill is nothing but a farce, and patently so.

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, at the closing stages of this Dáil I find you in this matter as courteous as you have always been right through the proceedings.  I fully understand the difficulty in which the Minister has placed you, and I do not in any way attribute any blame to you for what is happening here.  I have two legitimate, straightforward and clearcut amendments down to the Bill for the Report Stage.  One of the amendments, amendment No. 2, is of considerable importance and significance. It is something which has been sought by farming organisations and persons interested in the development of our agriculture.  The purpose of my amendment No. 2 would be to ensure that all wages paid by the family, including family wages, are admitted as a deduction for income tax purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Deputy Haughey to be raising amendment No. 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to No. 3 now.  You said you were in a very great difficulty; you only had the writing in front of you and you did <Col N="1622" /> not know what the amendments referred to.  I am trying to be helpful and to explain to you what amendment No. 2 is.  Amendment No. 2, as I say, is designed to ensure that in the new regime which will apply to the taxation of farmers all wages and emoluments paid by a farmer will be admitted as a deduction against the income tax payable.  As the Bill stands at present, wages paid to members of the farmer's family will not be admitted.  People who know the agricultural scene and who know Irish farming have been made very anxious by this provision by the Minister.  They see it as having very serious repercussions on family farming.  The overwhelming majority of our farms are family farms, and it is a vital principle that the wages paid to the members of a farmer's family should be admitted as a deduction.  I do not think it is necessary for me to go to any lengths to outline the repercussions that will follow if the Minister's provisions are accepted without amendment.  The whole impetus which exists at the moment, all the persuasive factors that are there for a farmer to employ his own sons and daughters on his farm, which is what we want him to do, will disappear if the Minister's provisions are accepted.  I want to put that right, and my amendment No. 2 is dedicated to that purpose.</P>
      <P>You have given me latitude in this regard, a Cheann Comhairle, which is much appreciated, and I shall leave amendment No. 2 for the moment. Perhaps while I go on to discuss No. 3 you could be considering whether, in the light of what I have said about amendment No. 2, it can legitimately be regarded as arising out of the Committee Stage proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment No. 3 is equally straightforward.  In this amendment I propose &ldquo;In page 40, to delete paragraph (II) of Part V of the First Schedule&rdquo;.  By the way, the whole of this First Schedule deals with the question of how increases or decreases in the value of stocks in a business are to be treated for income tax purposes. This is something which has become very important and very prominent recently.  The onslaught of <Col N="1623" /> inflation which we have been experiencing over the last two or three years, 18 per cent last year, has caused enormous problems for business in general, but in particular it has caused problems for businesses trying to arrive at what their profits are in any year.  Of course, in trying to determine actual profits the valuation put on stock is of critical importance. Because of inflation we were getting distorted figures for profit in businesses and for tax being levied on those firms on the basis of those distorted profit figures.  The Minister, in an endeavour to meet the situation, brought in this provision for special treatment of the tax arising out of profits made from changes in stock values.</P>

He has not moved his amendment on <Col N="1624" /> the Schedule yet and therefore the whole Bill is still open and Deputy O'Malley's amendment should be in order.  We appreciate the Chair's attitude here.  I do not want to be difficult, but the point I am making is that while the matter was in suspension you very courteously allowed Deputy Haughey to discuss three different amendments more or less as they were.  In the meantime, Deputy O'Malley submitted an amendment. The House was not notified by you until a few minutes ago what was allowed and what was not allowed. Of course your ruling is accepted, but Deputy Haughey had not moved amendment No. 3 at that time.  In fact, nothing has been moved on the Bill yet, and I submit that Deputy O'Malley's amendment, if it is in order, otherwise, is not out of order. I hope I make it reasonably courteous, in full appreciation of the Chair's helpful attitude here this evening.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 40, to delete paragraph 11 of Part V of the First Schedule.</P>
      <P>I hope it is still page 40; it is page 40 anyway of the Bill as initiated; probably a different page now but there you are, that is the way this Minister does his business.  It is no wonder the economy is in the state it is when we have a Minister who cannot put before us a proper printed version of a Finance Bill for consideration.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with vast sums of money here, matters of crucial importance to taxpayers and we do not even know what lines of the Bill we are talking about.  However in the face of these overwhelming difficulties, I shall struggle on.</P>
      <P>In page 40 of the Bill, as initiated, there is a paragraph (11) which I shall read to the House because the purpose of my amendment is to delete this paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(11) Where in any accounting period which ends on or after the 6th day of April, 1975, a company carries on a trade which consists partly of trading operations of any of the classes mentioned in the definition of `trade' in subsection (1) (hereinafter referred to as `qualifying trading operations') and partly of other trading operations the company shall be regarded as carrying on a trade which consists wholly or mainly of qualifying trading operations if, but only if, the total <Col N="1626" /> amount receivable by the company from the sales made in the course of the qualifying trading operations in the accounting period is not less than 75 per cent. of the total amount receivable by the company from all sales made in the course of its trade in the accounting period.&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>In order to understand what I am at here it is necessary for us to go back and take a look at the history of these provisions in regard to stocks.  As I was explaining earlier, in making my submission to the Chair, the inflation we have experienced here during the last few years has played havoc with the normal rules and principles of accountancy.  Because of the rate of inflation we have experienced the profits which normal accountancy principles would show as having been made by certain businesses were grossly inflated and, in many cases, arose entirely out of the inflated valuations of stocks.  Therefore a situation obtained in which companies and businesses were being forced to pay tax on an entirely false basis; they were paying tax on profits which were not real profits at all and which would not be regarded as such in normal times.  But, because of the effects of inflation, these businesses were showing profits and unjustly paying tax on them.  The Minister, under considerable pressure, I understand, from business interests sought to do something about that situation and introduced a series of provisions all of which, in short, were designed to remedy that situation and bring about one in which inflationary increases in the value of stocks would be discounted for profit purposes, which would be the basis of tax assessments.</P>
    <P>These provisions were first introduced by the Minister in the Finance Act, 1976.  They provided for withdrawal of the additional relief granted by that Act.  Now the Minister in the Finance Bill, 1977, before us is substituting a new series of provisions. Being the sort of Minister he is and having the type of approach he has to things, he could not resist the temptation, when bringing these new provisions before us, to introduce a niggardly qualification.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1627" /> The issue with which I am dealing is the situation of trading companies which carry on a mixed business.  The original provisions talked about trading operations of a company carrying on a trade.  A difficulty arose in the case of a business which carried on two different types of trade and which had, therefore, two different types of stocks.  Up to now the situation was that, in so far as one of those companies was concerned, if they had a mixed trade the provision was generally taken to be split 50/50 between the two different types of operations. At this stage the Minister wants to introduce a provision restricting that to 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>In other words, the new provision will mean that the company will qualify for this relief if, but only if, the total amount receivable by the company from sales made in the course of the qualifying trading operations in the accounting period is not less than 75 per cent of the total amount receivable by the company from all sales made in the course of its trading in the accounting period. Up to now, a 50/50 split as between the two types of trade was regarded by most people as allowing the company to qualify, and there is an objection to this increase to 75 per cent.  It is not understood why this should be introduced at this stage, but more important, as I understand the provisions now before us, it will be retrospective to the commencement of the relief.</P>
    <P>That is most undesirable.  It is important in so far as these provisions are concerned that business people should be able to bank on reliefs and concessions being available.  They had proceeded on the basis that up to now 50/50 was regarded as being acceptable. The change is being made retrospectively and that is the greater part of my objection&mdash;the Minister proposes to go back and take relief from some companies.  Retrospective legislation is always unacceptable, particularly in the case of income tax. My amendment is designed to ensure that this qualification will not be implemented and that the situation up to now will prevail.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1628" /> Another aspect of these provisions relates to stocks.  The new provision introduces a clawback.  Certain reliefs were provided on the basis that stocks were inflated because of inflationary pressures, but as I interpret these provisions in the short time at my disposal, the effect will be that as stocks decrease the Minister will attempt to claw back portion of the relief from companies which would be granted it. That is an undesirable situation.  For a start, it brings a certain amount of instability and insecurity because trading organisations should be able to know where they stand.</P>
    <P>If the Minister announces here with a great flourish that he will give certain reliefs, these reliefs should be available to trading companies until such time as the reliefs are terminated, but the Minister should not in any circumstances come along and with subsequent provisions cancel out or take away the reliefs he had purported to give.  Unfortunately, because of the time at my disposal I have been able to frame an amendment to deal only with one aspect, and that is the change in the percentage of trade for qualifying purposes.  I object strongly to the Minister's general approach to the situation where stocks subsequently decrease and to his attempt now to nullify the benefits which he came into the House and purported to give in respect of these matters a considerable time ago.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has presented his arguments on this amendment in a reasonable way and it is my intention to respond in that way.  With the limited time for the debate one must try to comment reasonably so that the time will be used to the best advantage.  Deputy Haughey will not object if I preface my remarks with a brief comment on what he said in regard to his second amendment which, he said, sought to give allowances in respect of members of families employed by farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that would be the objective of the amendment, but under the tax code it will be open to any farmer who has members of his or her own family employed to get full allowance under the ordinary system of taxation in <Col N="1629" /> respect of such labour.

      <P>Some people here advanced the same argument and were surprised at what had happened in the past.  Responsible members of farming organisations expressed the view that the highest percentage of farms on which family members would assist would be 30.  What has happened is that under the notional system 80 per cent had been making claims in respect of family members alleged to have been employed by them.  It seems that there is something here to be looked at very carefully.  I am sure that any person concerned with the proper administration of the tax laws would consider it wrong that we would accept a situation where claims could be made which could not be substantiated, but when claims are made which can be substantiated it is easy to examine them to see that they are properly established.  Nothing is being done in this Bill which would in any way stop anybody who has a family from getting tax allowances.</P>

    <P>As to this particular amendment, deductions in respect of stock relief for accounting periods which end on or before 5th April, 1975, afford an outright remission of tax without any question of the withdrawal of the relief.  The Finance Act, 1976, provided for the extension of stock relief to accounting periods ending on a date in the year to the 5th April, 1976. The Act also provided for the withdrawal of any deduction made as a result of that extension.  This withdrawal was to be achieved by reducing the value of the opening stock for the next accounting period by the amount of the deduction made.  The <Col N="1630" /> withdrawal provisions contained in the 1976 Act are now being replaced by provisions which secure that the deduction which was to be withdrawn will be withdrawn only under certain limited conditions.  They are (1) when stock values actually decrease or (2) when the trader ceases to carry on the trade or to be resident in the State or ceases to be within charge of Irish tax or (3) the deduction was made in respect of an increase in stock value which has been preceded by a decrease in stock value.</P>
    <P>Now, as to accounting periods which end in the year to the 5th April, 1977, stock relief is now being extended to accounting periods which end on a date in the year to the 5th April, 1977.  For corporation tax purposes, the computation of the maximum amount to be deducted in respect of an increase in stock value is being altered. For accounting periods which ended prior to the 6th April, 1976, the deduction was not to exceed the amount of a company's trading income before account was taken of losses and capital allowances.  Where the subsequent deduction of capital allowances created a loss, that loss was at least partly attributable to the deduction in respect of the increase in stock values.  Such losses were available for set off against other profits, or could be utilised to claim repayment of tax which had been deducted from dividends or annual payment, or alternatively, the losses, together with previous losses which had not been relieved because of allowances on stock relief, could be carried forward and be deducted from future trading profits.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly, this use of stock relief cannot be justified.  It is an artificial arrangement indulged in for a purpose far removed from the legitimate purpose the Oireachtas recognised in the original introduction of stock relief and, therefore, for accounting periods which end in the year to the 5th April, 1977, provision is made to secure that the deduction in respect of stock increase is not to exceed the amount of a company's trading income after account is taken of losses and capital allowances.</P>
    <P>The income tax position regarding losses and capital allowances is <Col N="1631" /> slightly different from the corporation tax position.  For income tax purposes, losses and capital allowances are not deducted in computing the amount of trading profits assessable but are set against the amount of the assessment. Where the assessment is itself a reduced amount on account of stock relief, the subsequent setting off of capital allowances could create a loss in respect of which repayment of tax could be claimed.  Again, this use of stock relief is clearly not justified and was never intended by the Oireachtas. Provision is, therefore, made to secure that, when a deduction in respect of stock relief has effect in the year 1977-1978, capital allowances and previous losses may not be carried forward to the year 1978-1979 or any other later year.</P>
    <P>The new provisions relating to the withdrawal of deductions made in computing trading income for accounting periods which end on 5th April, 1976, will apply also to the deductions which are made in computing trading income up to an accounting period which ends in the year to the 5th April, 1977.  The relief has, since its inception, been granted where certain trading operations constituted not less than 75 per cent of all trading operations of a trade.  That is what has happened.  That is the way in which the law has operated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is the kind of case we have in mind.  Where 75 per cent of the activity is in manufacturing, then the relief operates, but if only 51 per cent is engaged in manufacturing and 49 per cent in buying in and reselling, then the relief does not operate.  As I understand it, the effect of the Deputy's amendment would be to give the relief to cases where 51 per cent was engaged in manufacturing and 49 per cent in buying in and reselling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is to be the test?  The test that has applied since <Col N="1632" /> the commencement of stock relief has been 75 per cent.  Deputy Haughey and others are well aware that it is the practice as soon as practicable to give legislative confirmation to practices where the Oireachtas consider these practices to be legitimate and in accordance with what is reasonable and the wishes of Parliament.  That is why I am seeking here to get the approval of the Oireachtas to what I consider to be reasonable.  I will explain why I think it is not only reasonable but also necessary if we are to put manufacturers and traders on an equal footing.  The reason for fixing a test as high as 75 per cent is to avoid conferring an unfair competitive advantage on a company whose sales of goods manufactured by it were merely 51 per cent of its total sales as compared with another company engaged solely in selling the same type of goods which it had bought in.</P>
      <P>If the Revenue Commissioners had not operated the provision as they have which, I may say, was very fairly, or were we now to refuse to endorse this operation, we would be conferring a very considerable advantage, indeed, upon a firm engaged almost as to half its activities in merely buying and reselling and we would be giving that firm an advantage over its competitors.  I do not think that is Deputy Haughey's intention. I trust he will accept there is no element of withdrawing something which was previously there.  There is not.  As operated in the way I have described, it is the desire now to copperfasten that with Oireachtas approval and, on reflection, the Deputy may possibly see not merely the desirability of what we are proposing but, indeed, the necessity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to explain clearly why there would be an advantage to a firm doing merely 51 per cent trading.  The problem which has led to the situation the Minister has described is the problem of inflation, the artificial driving up of the value of stock, leaving firms in the position where they were showing profits in money terms which were really illusory, because while they <Col N="1633" /> might show substantial profit the stock they would require to enable the firm to continue in business could cost anything from 20 per cent to 50 per cent more in price than the same quantity of stock had cost in the previous year. Perhaps one of the ways out of that difficulty for the Minister would have been not to charge tax on profits that were ploughed back into the business.</P>
      <P>This rather confusing paragraph 11 is quite difficult to follow.  Ordinarily, if a firm or business is buying and selling, as the Minister describes it, as against manufacturing it is in a very different situation.  It does not necessarily have to carry the same quantity of stock and if its turnover facilities are good it is not likely to arrive at the liquidation stage in the way manufacturing industries can and have in some cases, because of the additional cost of stock required to maintain such a business.  If what the Minister was saying here is that money was made in the past two years and allowance was made because of the inflationary effect and now the firm is about to cash in on the profit made and liquidate its stock and therefore the Revenue Commissioners want that firm to pay the tax on it&mdash;if that is the position, I would not quarrel with the Minister.  I suspect that may be part of it.</P>
      <P>I think the provisions introduced in the 1956 Act were very useful and necessary and to some extent may have helped to keep firms in business. The nature of the illustration given by the Minister is to some extent theoretical. Being a businessman, I like to know where the Revenue will gain or is likely to lose in terms of money in any transaction rather than a theoretical one that says that because a firm is not doing 75 per cent of its business in a certain way it will be able to benefit, as the Minister described it, in competition with another business.  I should like to hear some practical figures from the Minister if he can give an illustration of what the commissioners have in mind in regard to this paragraph.  I am not satisfied at the moment that the Minister is doing the right thing, but he could convince me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): As regards Deputy Haughey's other amendment, this stock relief provision was first brought in because we could not control inflation&mdash;inflation created to no small extent by legislation introduced by the Minister for Finance, excessive taxation and the other capital taxation introduced.  A situation was brought about in which much of a company's profit was fictitious. We know how stocks were valued <Col N="1636" /> due to the inflationary trend.  I welcomed the provision then and thought it wise.  Companies accepted it in good faith then, but in effect what the Minister has here now is a type of clawback if the stock is reduced.  It is unfair to this section of the community who have gone through a very difficult time in the past three or four years.  If it had not been for that relief provision many of them would be in far more serious difficulties than they are in today.  I concede that, but the introduction of this type of clawback where you have reduction of stock is to some extent a deception in the case of these companies, many of whom are far from being out of the wood despite the glowing picture the Minister gave us this evening regarding the upswing in the economy.  The majority of these companies have serious problems in trying to extend their production if possible and this tax provision coming at this stage will not be an incentive to them.  It was short-sighted of the Minister to use the section to try to extract some of the profits which he thinks they have made.</P>
      <P>We must be practical about the legislation we introduce.  We must ensure that it does not inhibit companies from expanding and taking on more employees. That is the purpose of our exercise today and it will be the purpose of our fiscal legislation one month from now.  We will ensure that proper incentives are given so that companies will expand and provide more employment.</P>
      <P>We have no intention of taking the negative approach adopted by the Minister.  We have seen the consequences of the Minister's legislation in the past four years.  Progress has been halted and considerable damage has been done to our economy.  The amendment is desirable and it should be accepted.  The cost to the Exchequer will be infinitesimal but the encouragement it will give to industrialists will be enormous.  For that reason perhaps the Minister would seriously consider the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that we are at a serious disadvantage in that we did not reach <Col N="1637" /> the Schedule on Committee Stage and a thorough understanding of paragraph 11 is difficult to obtain because of the situation we are in.  Everybody will have sympathy with the Minister and his advisers in the problem of inflation accounting.  The relief that was brought in some years ago was timely and necessary and the Minister deserves credit for what was done then.</P>
      <P>To purchase and maintain stocks in the face of inflation was causing a major problem to industry and it threatened the liquidity of many firms. The Minister met that by bringing in stock relief.  I hope the Minister will accept that as a fair summary.  It was a timely and necessary relief because otherwise the inability to finance the purchase of stocks would have resulted in such liquidity problems that there would probably have been bankruptcies.  The Minister obviated this by adopting the action I have set out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a measure of this nature the Minister's intention was right and proper and his action was timely and necessary, but arising out of the executive decision by the Government a major problem was thrown at the Minister's advisers from the point of view of implementation.  Long ago it was regarded as good manners to talk about the way armies operated but I am afraid it is no longer polite to do so.  The analogy I would make is that the general makes broad decisions which must be implemented but inevitably certain members of the staff have headaches and serious problems in implementing them.  I have been one of the critics of the complications of financial legislation.  It is only fair to say that one would expect that amendments would have to be made from year to year and to that extent I hope we can be understanding. Nevertheless it puts us in the awkward situation that on Report Stage we are discussing the impact of one paragraph where the whole matter has been amended.  Part V starts on page 36 of the Finance Bill, 1977.  It refers to the amendment of provisions relating to relief in respect of increase <Col N="1638" /> in stock values and it extends through pages 37, 38, 39 and 40 with regard to the accounting period.</P>
    <P>One has to go to the root cause to understand why a limit of 75 per cent has to be imposed.  Basically the trouble has arisen from the mixing up of stock values with profits.  We are up against what accountants are debating, namely, the problem of inflation accounting, historical cost accounting and so on and it is inevitable in such a situation that the Minister will run into a problem.  What is involved is a substitution of 75 per cent for the words &ldquo;wholly or mainly&rdquo; although I must confess I find it difficult to understand this. Although the Minister gave a long list of dates it was difficult to follow without having the broader background of the Schedule before us.  I am not faulting the Minister for that but he will appreciate that it is a little difficult to follow.  I take it that I am near to the core of the matter when I say that as far as this is concerned. it is a question of substituting 75 per cent for &ldquo;wholly or mainly&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is defining &ldquo;wholly or mainly&rdquo;.  It is leaving it beyond dispute, but it concerns what has been the practice.  The practice has been to interpret &ldquo;wholly or mainly&rdquo; as 75 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the traps in this type of legislation.  The existing phrase &ldquo;wholly or mainly&rdquo; leaves discretion to the Revenue Commissioners or in particular to the inspector who is dealing with the matter. I am not questioning the practice of the words being a general guide to 75 per cent: I am questioning if it is wise statutorily to define that limit.  I have argued <i>ad nauseum</i> in the House for freedom of discretion to the people making the decisions on assessment. I want to put myself in the position, theoretically, of an inspector or anybody who has to make a number of judgments in succession.  Those people find it a great relief to have a rigid rule to say yes or no.  They do not have to think about the matter.  That is a human temptation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I refer to the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1639" /> I am not speaking about the commissioners but about the whole organisation and in particular their officers who have to implement their policies, who have to make the assessment, and the other branch who have to make the collection.  When I talk about recent times I do not mean that to be taken in any way derogatory because complications have arisen, due to overloading and difficulty in getting the right staff, staff being pinched and all the rest of it.  These are very complicating factors which have made their task very difficult.  It was a characteristic of the Revenue Commissioners until recent times that on individual assessments there were very clear guiding rules and uniform practices testified to by years of successful administration and the body of decisions, many of which were made <i>in camera</i> in the courts.  There were guiding rules right through all of this, but in the individual cases the inspector had the discretion to go a little one way or to adjust. Those inspectors made the reputation of the Revenue Commissioners and gained the confidence of the public.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will allow me to say this objectively even though we are in the last spasms of the 20th Dáil.  I am not implying any undertones of electioneering when I say that one of the difficulties about the Minister's legislation was making things specific.  Every time I spoke on the Minister's legislation I emphasised the need for discretion for the Revenue Commissioners.  I know they did not want all the discretion I wanted to give them, because the job is much easier if there are rigid rules.  If I am to be put in that extreme position and they are put in the other, the balance has to be struck.  There may be a lot of merit in all the Minister's proposals but there is one basic criticism of it. The only bit of Committee work we did today could have touched on the same thing.</P>
    <P>Let us take this specific limit about the measurement of the assessment in regard to benefits in kind, in regard to the cars we were talking about this morning.  That is the same type of thing. We would not have had the difficulty, <Col N="1640" /> the debate we had or the reputation of the Revenue machine would not have suffered if these rigid limits were not there.  Deputies should be very much on their guard about this.  May I say, with the greatest respect, to the public service that, although it may be more convenient to have black and white rules and apply them, humanity is not devised of a set of black and white rules of yes and no.  We are not just computers that are resolved by an electric switch which goes on or off. As the Minister probably knows, a computer works on a scale of two simply because an electric current is on or off.  We do not, as human beings, work that way.  A human problem arises in every one of those cases.  That is why the last thing I can urge on the Minister is that &ldquo;wholly or mainly&rdquo;, supported by a practice that the Revenue Commissioners have found to be applicable, is preferable to putting that down in black and white and making it an invariable rule which is what is involved here.</P>
    <P>On page 7 of the explanatory memorandum it is stated:</P>
    <P>Provision is also made to ensure that the relief allowed under the Finance Act, 1976, and that now being provided, will be calculated by reference to increases in stock values over the previous highest stock value attained since the relief for increases in stock values came into effect.  The relief has since its inception been granted where certain trading operations constituted not less than 75 per cent of all trading operations of a trade and specific provision is made to give statutory basis to this interpretation of the words &ldquo;wholly or mainly&rdquo; in the existing legislation.</P>
    <P>That is a fair and honest description of what is here.  In all fairness to the Minister and his advisers, one would have to go back not only to last year's Act but that of the year before to find out exactly what this section is driving at.</P>
    <P>I have read the explanatory memorandum but let us turn now to paragraph 11 of Part V which reads:</P>
    <P>Where in any accounting period which ends on or after the 6th day <Col N="1641" /> of April, 1975, a company carries on a trade which consists partly of trading operations of any of the classes mentioned in the definition of &ldquo;trade&rdquo; in subsection (1) (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;qualifying trading operations&rdquo;) and partly of other trading operations the company shall be regarded as carrying on a trade which consists wholly or mainly of qualifying trading operations....</P>
    <P>I am puzzled here.  Is the reference to subsection (1) of section 31 which is of the Finance Act, 1975, amended in section 1 here?  The Minister need not worry because I am not going to delve into that.  In fairness to the Minister he has shown us what exactly he is dealing with here but I mention the paragraph as an example of the point I am making.  When one looks at the whole schedule dealing with stock relief and then considers this paragraph one finds it very difficult to get the content of it because all of it is amendment of legislation by reference. The paragraph continues:</P>
    <P>if, but only if, the total amount receivable by the company from sales made in the course of the qualifying trading operations in the accounting period is not less than 75 per cent of the total amount receivable by the company from all sales made in the course of its trade in the accounting period.</P>
    <P>Without the explanatory memorandum and in the absence of continued debate in the House it would be very difficult to get the full perspective. What I am about to say now is being said with some diffidence in that I am not sufficiently informed nor have I heard what I would normally expect to hear in the course of the Finance Bill&mdash;explanations for the sections being elucidated and untangled in the course of Committee Stage.  As this has not been the case, it is possible that I am totally mistaken in what I am about to say.  I consider the background and the reason for the provision to be as follows: the Minister brought in this stock relief and for that I give him full credit; it was <Col N="1642" /> implemented in difficult circumstances by the Department concerned but it turned out to be the worst provision in the 1975 Act.  Before 1975, as the Minister will recall, there was a big question mark as to whether the clawback was to be a permanent relief.  In turn this went back to the impact of inflation.  I wonder whether the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners, when dealing with this type of thing would take the bold step in an effort to ascertain whether it would be possible to make it permanent.  This could be done only by State direction.  At the moment the accountants are trying to do this but they could be in conflict with the provisions of a schedule in the Companies Acts.  After all, the directors of a company, not the accountants, are responsible for the accounts.  The accountants do the auditing.  The accounting profession are trying to evolve a rational scheme that would give a real picture of a company's accounts.  A basic problem in this is the bringing in of stock values to the profit and loss account. The situation is complicated further in that the Revenue Commissioners, and quite rightly, refused in the past to take what might be called the ordinary commercial measures of valuation and profit.  As everybody knows, any company producing accounts show depreciation and all the other provisions and allowances involved before arriving at a profit before taxation.  Taxation is then deducted.  The Revenue Commissioners would never fall for that.  They add back various items in accordance with their code.  They give relief on the profit arrived at but leave out what they will not allow to be added back.</P>
    <P>First, therefore, there is the complication of stock.  Then, there are the duties imposed by the Companies Acts and there are the real duties imposed by the necessity of keeping liquid solvent.  One can see readily the difficulties involved in accounting in individual cases.  I sympathise with the Chair.  I am sure he is beginning to wonder what all this has to do with the subsection.  I assure the House that it has everything to do with the section because in every company with <Col N="1643" /> the sort of background I am talking of there are problems of discretion. There is this new fashion of trying to define specifically in general terms and reduce us all corporately, incorporately and individually to a computer and to the needs of a computer. A computer operates with a switch that goes on and off and the rule is either obeyed or is not obeyed.  This simply cannot be the best thing for business, nor can it be the best thing socially.  Therefore, there is something in Deputy Haughey's amendment that goes very much further than the mere technicality.  It raises the whole question of when discretion should be exercised.  I have strayed from what I wanted to say, which is that this came about as follows.  The Revenue Commissioners had their first experience of this.  The Minister brought in his Bill. The clawback was tentative and that caused the problems of last year.  They were straightened out.  It is understood why the Minister provided the clawback.  Gradually the Revenue Commissioners found that in practice about 75 per cent is the thing to strike at.  I took the case of a 51 per cent manufacturing company which is also dealing in what I might call&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, I am trying to get the name for it.  It is not retailing; it is not manufacturing; we will say &ldquo;other than manufacturing&rdquo;. Here, again, we are going to get into desperate difficulty in following the Minister at &ldquo;bought in&rdquo; and trade out.  At what stage are you a manufacturer? At what stage are you not? If I buy the Minister's Bill from the Stationery Office and the law permits me to put my name and a commentary on it and I pass it on again, the only thing I have done with it is run it through a machine and put a little over-print on it.  Is that article wholly manufactured or is it manufactured at all?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I have rather telescoped what I wanted to say. The Minister will appreciate that discretion is necessary.  I want to show where discretion is necessary here. Assuming that it can be measured&mdash; and that is a big assumption when coming down to practice&mdash;there will still be an element of discretion.  Assuming you have 75 per cent there, then the inspector has to say &ldquo;75 per cent is there. It is hard luck.  If I was able I would fix it and I would give you the benefit. You are the hard case but I have no discretion.  I am sorry&rdquo;.  He may see another case on the 75 per cent and he scratches his head and says &ldquo;the so-and-sos have it and they should be strung up for what they are getting away with&rdquo;.  This is what these rigid things mean.  I am putting it in rather crude terms but it is only by putting it in those terms that one can appreciate what is involved.  It wholly or mainly gives the discretion to the Revenue Commissioners to practise what I have talked about and which has now been obviously established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has come back here today all the time emphasising that he is only giving statutory authority to those established practices.  He is not. He is closing and freezing what is an established practice into something that it is not.  The established practice that the Revenue Commissioners have at the moment is a good guiding rule with the necessary flexibility to meet the individual case, but as soon as this is <Col N="1645" /> enacted with the 75 per cent you are to operate either on one side of the line or on the line and on the line is equally provided for.  I am not accusing the Minister of doing this with any degree of tongue in cheek or not realising the implications or anything like that but when you analyse the situation this is not giving statutory effect to an established practice. If that point alone will not carry, I cannot push it further.</P>
    <P>We are at a sorry stage when we have to leave things in this unsatisfactory situation.  I would be very out of order if I were to say what I know and what I have said on other occasions about the financial business as we do it in this House.  A year ago, on the 21st May, I here made the point that a lot of our financial procedure was a charade and a farce.  I am afraid that is so today and this business proves it but you are not wholly or mainly giving a statutory authority, you are changing the law.</P>

      <P>Before the Deputy concludes I want to answer two questions that were put by Deputy de Valera.  It will not take me a minute. The section is 31 (a) of the Finance Act, 1975.  On the other point I will communicate with the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to Deputy de Valera for that very clear exposition which he has given to the case in favour of my amendment.  I do not think I could have put it better myself.  I am sure you will also forgive me if I say I would have very greatly desired that the last few words which I will say to the 20th Dáil would have been about something more rewarding than company taxation.  Company taxation is undoubtedly a very important matter but it is not one that is entirely appropriate for the closing minutes of the 20th Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many other matters we would prefer to have been talking about at this stage: for instance, the sort of community that is emerging in Ireland today; the fundamental problems that present themselves in that community; the quality of life for <Col N="1646" /> ordinary men and women in that community; the protection of our natural environment; some policy for youth in sport; some programme to provide employment for young people; perhaps, dare one hope, some carefully thought-out, wise political initiative designed to bring peace with justice to the North of Ireland.  These are the sort of things that would have been more appropriate for this final evening.  But the Government have ordained otherwise.  For their own short-term political, electoral ends they have decided to push this Finance Bill through in a completely undemocratic, unparliamentary manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we on the Fifth Stage or on the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the amendment. The Government, as I say, have decided that the closing stages of the 20th Dáil should be devoted to the mundane, dull and unexciting matter of stock relief for trading companies. So be it.  I do not think this will redound to their political or electoral advantage.  In fact, as this major taxation measure of the year is going through the Dáil and bringing important changes in the taxation legislation without being debated or discussed, without even being explained to the House or to the people, I believe the Government have done a serious disservice to this House and to our parliamentary democracy by the tactics they have adopted.  I will say no more about it than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that, in the final stages of his career here as the Minister for Finance, he should be gracious enough to accept this amendment.  It is a reasonable amendment.  It is, as Deputy de Valera pointed out so cogently, designed to retain some flexibility in this stock relief provision.  The Minister knows as well as I do that once a fixed percentage is written into legislation there are always difficulties.  There will be marginal cases, and I do not think the Minister can say that any great difficulties have arisen in the administration of this provision up to now because of the absence of a specific percentage provision.  Therefore I would <Col N="1647" /> appeal to the Minister to accept my amendment and leave the situation as it is, that, in so far as these trading corporations are concerned and their qualification for stock relief, the matter would still be left to the discretion <Col N="1648" /> of the Revenue authorities by the use of the words &ldquo;wholly or mainly&rdquo; instead of the fixed 75 per cent which is proposed in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand.&rdquo;</P>

The height requirement was lowered to 5 ft. 8 ins. in 1972 but this was at a time when it was proving difficult to attract suitable candidates. The Garda authorities were in favour of the restoration effected by the 1977 regulations.

      <P>The guidelines produced by Comhairle na nOspidéal in September, 1973, for the development of the general hospital system in this country, proposed that the general aim should be to organise acute hospital services so that the population served would be within a radius of 30 miles of the hospital centre.  I accepted the Comhairle guidelines as providing a reasonable basis on which decisions could be taken.</P>
      <P>The General Hospital Development Plan which I announced on 21st October, 1975, ensure that, when it is implemented, the vast majority of the population will be within a radius of 30 miles of an acute general hospital. That part of the population which will be somewhat outside the 30-mile radius is estimated at less than 2 per cent of the total population and is mostly confined to the western seaboard.  In the planning of the general hospital requirements for the country, the needs of these areas are taken fully into consideration and adequate provision is made at the nearest general hospital.</P>

      <P>It is expected that approximately 60 dwellings will be provided this year by local authorities under the special subsidy scheme for settlement of itinerant families.  I do <Col N="1556" /> not have information as to the number of houses likely to be allocated to itinerant families in the course of the normal housing programmes of local authorities but the annual rate exceeds 100 and I have asked local authorities to step up their activities in this regard.</P>
      <P>I would hope, therefore, that the total number of dwellings to be provided by local authorities for itinerant families in the year would approach 200.  No figures are available with regard to the plans of private organisations in the matter during 1977.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he has adopted the recommendations contained in the report of the fire service which was laid before the Dáil in July, 1975; and, if so, if he will make a statement on the legislative proposals he has in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>A central recommendation in the report is that an assessment of the strength and adequacy of the fire service should be carried out in each area. In September last, I asked local authorities to conduct such an assessment, extending to all aspects of their fire-fighting and fire prevention programmes, and I provided guidance on how this should be done.  The assessments are of fundamental importance in the opportunity which they provide local authorities to identify any weaknesses there may be and to identify any necessary improvements. They should also provide valuable information bearing on a number of matters on which the working party made recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much stress was laid in the report on the importance of training.  The provision for central training for fire service personnel is being specially examined by a sub-committee of the Local Government Manpower Committee, and an interim recommendation of the group relating to training in the use of breathing apparatus has already been implemented.  A further step has been taken with the publication last November of the draft code of building regulations, which includes <Col N="1557" /> a number of sections on fire safety. A number of further matters the subject of recommendations in the report of the working party, including aspects of staffing and structure and the arrangements for carrying out fire prevention work are under active consideration in consultation with the local authorities.  The provision for financing the ongoing programmes in provision of fire stations and purchase of appliances has been substantially increased since the report.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made, therefore, and continues to be made in regard to these practical issues.  It would not be feasible to finalise proposals for new legislation pending completion of some of the studies mentioned above, but the matter has been receiving consideration in the meantime.</P>
