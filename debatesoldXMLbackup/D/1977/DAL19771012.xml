      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Government have no proposals for the introduction of a new Constitution or for an amendment to the existing Constitution to facilitate divorce.  The possibility of amendments to deal with certain aspects of the law on bail and adoption are under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it from the Taoiseach's reply that this country is going to continue under the 1937 Constitution with all its obvious defects? After all these years it is obvious that it is a very defective Constitution.  In relation to the question concerning divorce, surely the Taoiseach agrees that there is a special case in respect of people who have had Catholic Church annulments and divorce outside the country?  Is the Taoiseach now saying that not only are we not going to get a new Constitution but the existing one will not be amended in respect of this desperately urgent and badly needed provision in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say we were not going to get a new Constitution but at present it is not contemplated to introduce legislation that would enable a new Constitution to be voted upon by the people.  I do not accept at all that the Constitution as it stands is as defective as the Deputy seems to suggest.  It has stood the test of time.  I agree that there are some aspects of it that might require changing and I have indicated at least two aspects where that change is being considered.  In regard to annulment, the Attorney General has submitted to the Law Reform Commission for their examination the report by a former Attorney General, the former <Col N="133" /> Deputy Declan Costello, on the law on annulment to see to what extent it is incompatible with certain practices in Church law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it that the various provisions of this Constitution under Articles 2 and 3 in the view of the Taoiseach should continue to be applicable to the six north-eastern counties and the Protestant minority there, if there should be a united Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will provide an estimate of the total work-force currently without jobs, including those who are not entitled to unemployment benefit and assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. P. Lalor) Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. P. Lalor)">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. P. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The up-to-date and regular statistical information available in the context of unemployment is that provided by the weekly live register totals.  These cover all claimants for unemployment benefit, applicants for unemployment assistance&mdash;excluding smallholders&mdash;and applicants for credited social welfare contributions except those related to trade disputes. The most recent live register total, relating to 30th September, 1977, was 104,859.</P>
      <P>An annual mid-April estimate of the number of persons &ldquo;out of work&rdquo; is prepared within the framework of the annual estimates of the total labour force.  This is obtained by using the live register trends&mdash;excluding persons on systematic short-time working&mdash;to up-date census of population totals for persons &ldquo;out of work&rdquo;.  The classification of a person as &ldquo;out of work&rdquo; in a census is based mainly on the respondent's own assessment of his or her economic circumstances and does not depend on the receipt of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent estimate for the number &ldquo;out of work&rdquo; on this basis is 108,000 for mid-April, 1977.  This does not include persons seeking work for the first time for which the most recent official estimate available is that of 20,000 given by the 1975 Labour Force Survey for May, 1975.  A corresponding estimate will be available <Col N="135" /> in due course from the 1977 Labour Force Survey for which the field work was recently completed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we take it that the correct figure is 104,000, plus about 20,000 people who are not registered, thus bringing the figure to about 130,000?  I should like to know why it was claimed by a Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, before the election that the correct figure was 160,000 and that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions gave a figure as high as 200,000?  Can the Parliamentary Secretary explain the reason for the discrepancy between these figures, given <i>bona fide</i>, I am sure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is incorrect in taking from my reply that the estimated figure at present is 104,000, plus 20,000 because the figure of 20,000, mentioned in the reply, was complied under a Labour Force Survey in 1975.  As I pointed out, a similar survey was carried out this year.  The field work in this was completed recently but the figures are not yet available.  I estimate that the figures arising out of that survey will be far in excess of the 1975 figure of 20,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that the figure has dropped by 50,000 since the Government took office?  The estimate before they took over was 160,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of increasing the rate of <i>ex-gratia</i> pension, payable to widows and children of established civil servants who died or retired prior to 23rd July, 1968, up to the rate of contributory pension payable in respect of officers who serve on or after that date, will be considered in the context of the annual budget.  The current annual cost would be approximately £850,000 for the civil service, together with an additional £1,450,000 for the rest of the public service.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will, I am sure, understand that, while it is true that there was general agreement that such an office should be established, there are certain relatively minor matters on which there might be some differences of view.  He will also recall that an effort was to be made to publicise the report of the committee before final decisions were taken.

With our present high unemployment situation it is necessary to innovate and to provide employment in new areas, and I believe that by co-ordinating all these bodies under one board the Minister would be in a better position to direct operations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>The co-ordination of efforts at industrial development is a function of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  It is his responsibility and we do not contemplate his abdicating that to another board.  If better proposals emerge that will contribute to reducing unemployment, of course we will adopt them. The best way to do this at present is by setting up the industrial development consortium referred to in our election manifesto.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government does not intend to impose any specific <Col N="142" /> charge to replace the revenue from motor vehicle duties on cars affected by the measure in question.  As the Deputy is aware, the basic strategy of the Government is to cut inflation, stimulate demand, employment and output, and improve living standards through implementing the manifesto measures, of which the abolition of motor vehicle duties on cars up to and including 16 h.p. is one.  The implications of this strategy for the public finances are that the enhanced level of economic growth will of itself generate a substantial amount of revenue buoyancy through both the direct and indirect taxes.  This will offset over time the cost of the tax concessions and other elements of the Government's programme which involve an initial charge on the Exchequer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Full relief for bad debts is already provided under Irish VAT law by Regulation 8 of the VAT Regulations, 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, the relief mentioned operates by way of appropriate reduction in a trader's VAT liability to the Revenue in respect of the VAT on bad <Col N="143" /> debts which he has to write off after he has paid to the Revenue the VAT on the goods or services in question.</P>
    <P>Some traders are allowed to account for VAT on the basis of cash receipts. These traders do not, of course, need to make any adjustment since that basis automatically takes account of bad debts.</P>
    <P>While Article 11.C.1 of the EEC Sixth VAT Directive provides for relief for bad debts, it allows member states to derogate from this requirement.  It is not my intention that Ireland should avail of this derogation.  Our existing arrangements will, therefore, continue.</P>

The removal of VAT from provincial newspapers would be attended by considerable technical and other difficulties and would also be affected by EEC constraints.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will furnish a full list of depositors with the Irish Trust Bank who are expected to benefit from the Government's policy of refunding their losses; and the percentage of the total which is to be refunded to sources abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I will take Questions Nos. 26 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>No disbursements have been made to date from State funds in respect of <i>ex gratia</i> payments to directors, share-holders, depositors or other creditors of Irish Trust Bank Ltd.</P>
      <P>While the Government welcomed the Central Bank's proposal to make limited advance payments totalling approximately £1 million to depositors, they decided, for the reasons outlined in my statement of 10th August, that, as an exceptional measure, full payments should be made and requested the bank to arrange for this to be done.  In accordance with this arrangement the Central Bank has made available approximately £2.9 million to the official liquidator to enable him to repay to depositors, with the approval of the High Court, the outstanding balance of their claims as admitted by the court examiner.  Connected depositors, such as directors and major shareholders, and trade creditors will not benefit.  The Central Bank will rank as a creditor in respect of its outlay and will share in any further distributions that may be made by the liquidator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government agreed that the additional cost of £1.9 million approximately, to the extent not recovered <Col N="149" /> from the liquidation, would be recouped to the bank from the Exchequer, subject to the voting of the necessary moneys.  I shall be asking the House to agree to a Supplementary Estimate for this purpose in due course.</P>
    <P>While investigations into individual cases were not made by my Department, I have no information that would imply that the payments were not justified in each case.  In this regard I would point out that the liquidation is being carried out under the supervision of the High Court and moneys received by the liquidator may be distributed only to persons whose claims have been admitted by the court examiner.  In addition, specific arrangements were made to exclude from benefit directors and major shareholders.</P>
    <P>The names and addresses of depositors are not available to my Department. I am informed that 1,045 depositors received payments not exceeding £10,000 and 48 were paid sums in excess of £10,000.</P>
    <P>Approximately 58 per cent of the total was due to depositors with addresses outside the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is most unacceptable to this House to have a situation in which it is proposed to seek approval of payment of public moneys to people, and presumably organisations and trusts, about whom this House cannot be assured, or about whom they have no information?  Would the Minister share my extreme concern that in such a procedure there is no guarantee in regard to the integrity of associations or individuals and whatever connections they might have?  With respect, the Minister has not answered my question.  Would the Minister agree it is important that we know to whom these moneys are being paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have in fact answered the Deputy's question by telling him that the names and addresses of the shareholders are not available to me.  I have also given him, as he requested, the percentage of the total which is to be refunded to sources abroad.  However, <Col N="150" /> I would reiterate that the payments can be made only after the claims have been examined and passed by the examiner acting under the authority of the High Court.  Since I do not know the people concerned I can act only on the basis of those admitted by the examiner.  I have no reason whatever to believe that there is any reason that the recipients of such money should not receive it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, on his part, that is giving a blank cheque in such a situation, that there is no assurance there that the individuals or organisations concerned, for example, may not be associated with organisations that might be engaged in activities which would not be helpful to the State?  I am merely posing a hypothetical situation.  In other words, could the Minister give his personal assurance, on his honour, that anybody who benefits from public funds is of the highest integrity and that there is no illegal or unlawful connection with such payments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards persons in receipt of public funds being of the highest integrity, I am afraid there are many recipients of public funds who could not fall into that category.  Perhaps I might summarise what the Deputy has in mind by saying I am satisfied that no benefit is accruing from these payments to subversive organisations, directly or indirectly, if that is what he is worried about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Accepting that Deputy Colley and his colleagues prior to the election might in good faith have given this undertaking, would the Minister consider it was right to discharge that undertaking in the light of the information which I know is in his Department, and which is also available to the Department of Justice, which certainly indicates that a number of the depositors are not above the taint of suspicion in relation to illegal activities?</P>
      <P>My second question is this: how can the Minister justify this decision in the light of the fact that people are encouraged to put money, at a lower rate of interest than that offered by the Irish Trust Bank, in various deposits in this country because they carry a State guarantee?  Would the Minister not agree that the real effect of his decision now is to indicate to people that they may as well put their money where there is the highest rate and greatest risk because the Fianna Fáil Party, at any time, will buy their votes by using the taxpayers' money instead of doing what they ought, that is, ensuring the safety, sanctity and respect of all deposits in this State which carry a State guarantee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with the first point raised by Deputy Ryan, I was giving himself and his former colleagues in Government credit for the fact that they had taken some steps to ascertain the position in regard to what I might term briefly the danger of subversive interest in these moneys. Perhaps the results of those inquiries had not accrued before Deputy Ryan left office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But they did accrue before any money was paid out and they were quite categorical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the second point, the Deputy of course is misrepresenting the position. It was made perfectly clear that this decision was made as an exceptional matter because this was the first case in which a bank which had been licensed by the Central Bank had got into this kind of difficulty.  As a result we were satisfied from the evidence <Col N="152" /> available to us that many people at home and abroad had invested money in this bank in the <i>bona fide</i> belief that it had the backing of the State when in fact it had not.  As I have already announced that as a consequence, we are taking steps to deal with that matter and to strengthen the legislation.  But it would be very wrong for anybody to assume that they may, without any risk, invest in other forms of investment yielding a high interest and expect to be covered by the State.  I have made it perfectly clear that anybody who does that in future and who expects to be covered will be sadly disappointed.</P>

I am sure the Minister is aware that a number of professional bodies, including insurance companies, have such an arrangement.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is in the form of a tabular statement which I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The figures included in the table for receipts by way of grants and subsidies represent the amounts of money actually received under the various headings during the period in question. They differ in some respects from the figures published in the six monthly Reports to the Oireachtas on Developments in the European Communities (Annex II) which represent the amounts of grants and subsidies approved.  This is because there is normally a time lag between the approval of grants and the date of their payment, with the result that receipts from the Community to date have been somewhat less than the amount of grants approved.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>Ireland's receipts from, and payments to, the European Communities during the period 1st July, 1973 to 30th June, 1977</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The State-sponsored body in question did not provide funds directly to the firm referred to by the Deputy but provided sums totalling £1,215,000 during the past six months&mdash;of which £1,095,000 was provided since 1st July last&mdash;to the group of which the firm in question is part. I understand that a substantial part of the assistance was intended to be devoted to helping the firm in question to continue in operation.</P>
      <P>The first moiety of the assistance, namely £450,000, approved in July last was subject to concessionary terms in relation to payment of interest and repayment of principal and the remainder of the funds was advanced on a short-term basis pending the submission by the group of their proposals for restructuring the group and its management.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position with regard to this group is being examined in greater detail at the moment.  I am sure the Deputy is aware&mdash;because of the location of the firm in question and the fact that he was a member of the former Government&mdash;that while this problem has become very acute recently it did not arise overnight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware it did not arise overnight but I want to know what undertakings were given by the group of companies who received £1,095,000, of which £450,000 was directly for Castleguard Textiles? Further, how is it that now there is a final closure of that company?  I have gone to Castleguard and they have informed me that there is a final closure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there is a final closure.  As far as I am concerned it is a totally unsatisfactory position but there is no action open to the Government that would prevent it. As I have indicated, in July we approved a payment of £450,000 in an effort to avert this result and were informed at the time that it would have this effect.  However, it did not have such effect and I regard the whole position as thoroughly unsatisfactory. There is a major and urgent examination going on at the moment into the whole position of the group in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if the Government have any proposal to reduce interest rates on SDA loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="158" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Exchequer lending rate, on which the rate of interest charged on local authority house loans is based, is a long-term fixed interest rate and should consequently reflect the rate being paid by the Government on long-term securities. The present rate of interest on long-term Government securities is just over 12 per cent and consequently there is, as yet, no economic reason for reducing the Exchequer lending rate of 12 per cent.  I am, however, keeping the matter under review and should long-term rates continue to fall a reduction in the Exchequer lending rate will be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not normal practice that SDA loans run at a lower level than building society loans?  SDA loans were intended for people who are not in a position to get loans from building societies but now they are being penalised because they are paying higher interest rates. The situation is intolerable.  Further, the Minister should be aware that people are holding back because they think, with a certain amount of justification, that these rates will be dropping shortly.  The long-term prospects do not seem too bright.  Interest rates generally are dropping quite rapidly and it surprises me that something similar is not happening with SDA loans, particularly in view of the fact that such loans are generally intended for a certain section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend in the future to reduce the 12½ per cent interest rate on SDA loans, in view of the continuing reduction in interest rates elsewhere? Some people were caught last year by this high interest rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated, this rate is governed not by the short-term interest rates to which Deputy O'Brien has referred but the rate of interest on long-term Government securities, which at present is just over 12 per cent.  It is quite possible that that interest rate will drop.  If it does then certainly the whole question of a reduction in the Exchequer <Col N="159" /> lending rate will be considered.  It is not possible to disregard the level at which the Government can borrow money for the long-term when fixing this rate.  Deputy Mitchell will, I am sure, also be aware that one of the advantages of an SDA loan is that it is at a fixed rate of interest which also affects the Exchequer.  With regard to the Deputy's query I cannot undertake that persons who have already received SDA loans will get a reduction in the interest rate, which I think is what he has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I remind the Minister that there is a precedent for this which affects an area in his constituency?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not look at that precedent and give some hope to people outside his constituency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of that precedent, as I am sure the Deputy knows, since I had a good deal to do with it.  The Deputy will also be aware that there were exceptional circumstances in those cases in which people who qualified, and in some cases had been approved, for SDA loans were in fact obliged to take loans from building societies and other similar institutions. I think that is a different situation from those who were approved for SDA loans and got them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>When was the 12½ per cent interest rate fixed for Government Exchequer loans and when will it be subjected to review?  Has the Minister any dates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It became 12 per cent in January, 1976.  As regards the date on which one could hope for a reduction I cannot give a date for that because, as I have said, I have to see what happens to the cost of long-term borrowing by the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Government consider guaranteeing loans to the building societies to enable the SDA loan borrowers to avail of the lower interest rate as they did when the rates went up?</P>

    <Col N="160" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>A moment ago we adverted to difficulties which arose precisely because in the case of SDA loans the interest rate is fixed whereas in the case of building societies it fluctuates.  I would be very slow to contemplate getting into a situation where what happened the last time could happen again.</P>

      <P>This is the final one.  I am sure the Minister will appreciate that many SDA loans are prohibited as far as incomes in rural Ireland are concerned.  Would the Minister consider introducing a scheme of shared ownership where the State would own half of the house and the tenant could buy the other half?  This would make it more attractive for people to build their own houses.</P>

      <P>In view of the endless discussion this topic has had in this House, the other House and the country, while it may be boring and perhaps funny to a lot of people it is very real to a large number of young couples and another round of discussions will hardly throw much light on the matter.  A decision is required now.  Will the Minister give some indication when this House might be expected to make a decision?  It is simply refusing to grasp the famous nettle that was referred to on an earlier occasion by going off on another round of discussions with people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies know, I met the British Prime Minister, Mr. Callaghan, at 10 Downing Street, London, on 28th September.  The Prime Minister was accompanied by Mr. Mason, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and Mr. Judd, Minister of State at the Foreign Office.  I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>I sought the meeting following the general election last summer, so that we could have exploratory talks on subjects of common interest to our countries, including Northern Ireland, the European Community and bilateral relations generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meeting lasted six hours and covered a wide range of subjects.  At <Col N="224" /> its conclusion, an agreed <i>communiqué</i> was issued, copies of which I have arranged to lay before the House.  I do not intend here to go over ground covered by the <i>communiqué</i>, nor indeed would it be proper for me to go in detail into what we discussed.  I should like, however, to put before the House some of the main points which emerged.</P>
    <P>On Northern Ireland, there has, in the recent past, been what I may describe as the appearance of greater integration with the United Kingdom. Rumours of a pact, or understanding, with certain groups in the House of Commons and the establishment of the Speaker's Conference last July &ldquo;to consider and make recommendations on the number of Parliamentary Constituencies that there should be in Northern Ireland&rdquo; are among the indicators which lent some colour to this belief.</P>
    <P>I obtained a firm assurance from the Prime Minister that there was not a scintilla of a move towards integration. He was emphatic in his view that the British people would not, in fact, agree to such a move.  I was also happy to receive from the Prime Minister the further assurance that it was and remained the policy of the British Government to have devolved government with power-sharing in Northern Ireland and that there would be no devolved government without power-sharing.</P>
    <P>In relation to the long-term approach I made clear my view to the Prime Minister that in the interests of all the people of Ireland and of Anglo-Irish relations generally there was a need to encourage the people of Ireland to come together by consent, by negotiation and under agreed structures.</P>
    <P>Our discussion naturally led to our talking about the operation of direct rule.  The main point I made was that however direct rule operated, it would, if continued over a long period, lead inevitably to a worsening of the situation in Northern Ireland.  The immediate consequences of a political vacuum there might not be grave, but, in the medium or longer term, there <Col N="225" /> could be no real stability and no real progress unless there were a forum in which the people of the North could express themselves and, to whatever extent might be agreed, govern themselves. I stressed the need for political action and the Prime Minister agreed that, if there was a general desire, the British Government would be ready to devolve a range of powers to a locally elected body under arrangements acceptable to both sides of the community. I understand that exploratory discussions will take place shortly to see whether this general desire exists.</P>
    <P>I impressed on the Prime Minister the need for greater economic co-operation between both parts of Ireland.  I have always thought it strange, to say the least, that the two administrations governing this small island have not found it possible to cooperate to a greater extent on economic projects for our mutual benefit.  He welcomed my views in this respect and we agreed that officials of the two Governments would meet in the near future to review the arrangements and opportunities for economic co-operation between our two countries, with particular reference to Northern Ireland.  They will review current and proposed cross-Border studies and identify subjects and areas for further examination, with EEC assistance where appropriate.</P>
    <P>We discussed the present arrangements for security co-operation and both the Prime Minister and I agreed on the importance of this co-operation. The <i>communiqué</i> records the British expression of satisfaction at the degree of co-operation under the present arrangements.  We agreed that, in the general context of further Anglo-Irish meetings, there should be continuing consultation about how this co-operation could be developed and improved as the security situation required it.</P>
    <P>While in London I had the opportunity of meeting the Leader of the Opposition, Mrs. Thatcher.  She was strong in her belief in the need for the United Kingdom Government to make political progress in Northern Ireland, and in her commitment to <Col N="226" /> the concept of participation or partnership by the two parts of the Northern community in government.</P>
    <P>This principle does not offer any threat to the future or to the integrity of any group in Northern Ireland.  It is a truism that the only sound basis for democratic government is the consent of the governed.  Almost by definition this consent cannot be obtained if large and homogeneous minorities are, through the ordinary operation of the law, permanently excluded from government.  The participation of which I speak is a means by which the minority in Northern Ireland can be involved in the administration by which their lives are governed.</P>
    <P>We are interested only in progress by reconciliation. We want for Northern Ireland the stability which only a lasting peace can bring: and all experience shows that a lasting peace can be achieved only through full participation in government by both sections of the Northern community. It is only in that way that the economic evils of poverty and unemployment which have sapped the hope and vigour of generations of men and women can permanently be overcome.  We are ready at all times to discuss with the representatives of any elected party in the North ways by which we can help in attaining this objective&mdash;without commitment on their part and with the greatest of goodwill towards them on ours.</P>
    <P>I cannot over-emphasise the fact that our first priority is to help to establish peace and a basis for progress in Northern Ireland.  This cannot be done by violence&mdash;or by the policies advocated by the men of violence.  The Government will continue, by every means in their power, to apply the law against men who use violence and subversion to attain political ends.</P>
    <P>But simply to campaign against violence is too negative an approach to a fundamental problem.  The violence is a recurring symptom; and you cannot eradicate a disease by attacking the symptoms.  In discussing the issue with Mr. Callaghan, I pointed out the <Col N="227" /> effects which the negative guarantees of his Government are having and I stressed the legitimate aspiration of the vast majority of the Irish people to see this island united in peace, by consent and under agreed structures.  I said that one inference from the results of the last election here was that this wish was as alive and as potent, among the people of this country, as it had ever been.  I remain strong in my belief that it would take nothing from the honour of Britain or from the rights of the majority in Northern Ireland if the British Government were to acknowledge this aspiration and positively to encourage the people of this island to progress together, as a nation of many traditions, each with its own value and entitled to its own respect, in harmony with the people of the United Kingdom, with whom we have such close ties.</P>
    <P>In our discussions of the European Economic Community, we talked of the applications of Greece, Portugal and Spain for membership.  Enlargement of the Community will have the most profound effects.  Politically, enlargement is eminently desirable.  In my view, these political considerations out-weigh the institutional and financial difficulties&mdash;large as these are.  It must be our priority, as a Community, to improve the working and financing of the institutions so that they can stand up to the strains of enlargement without being destroyed.  I do not say this to take in any way from the rights of the applicant countries to membership &mdash;but simply to stress that they themselves could hardly wish to be members of a Community so weakened by accession as to become little more than a loose agglomeration of states.  What the Community would be then would not be the Community they have sought to join.</P>
    <P>In relation to the common agricultural policy, I said that our interest was paramount.  While I am not by any means arguing that the CAP cannot be improved, I think that arguments for improvement based on the proportion the CAP takes of the Community's budget are not well based. The total budget is in fact, only a <Col N="228" /> small proportion&mdash;perhaps .6 per cent &mdash;of the gross national product of the countries of the Community.  It follows that any policy involving worthwhile action must, almost inevitably, absorb a large proportion of the total.  The CAP may produce distortions in the market but, without it, the distortions &mdash;and the vulnerability of Europe&mdash;would  be even greater.  And the effects on social, regional and industrial policies of a stable and prosperous agriculture should not be minimised.</P>
    <P>We also discussed direct elections to the European Parliament.  Mr. Callaghan gave me an indication of how he saw prospects in the United Kingdom.  I reciprocated with an account of how our legislation was developing.  As far as we are concerned, we will be able&mdash; and we fully intend&mdash;to have elections next Summer, if that fits in with the general European approach.</P>
    <P>In discussing fisheries, I emphasised our unique position and the regional aspects of the problem.  As Deputies know, the matter is the subject of more detailed discussions between the Minister for Fisheries and the British Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and other Community Ministers and interests.</P>
    <P>We also discussed the project for the construction of the massive facilities for research into nuclear fusion, known as JET.  I indicated our preference for siting the project in the best location, technically, and where the maximum benefit to the Community as a whole would accrue. Consensus on this issue, if at all possible, is obviously highly desirable.</P>
    <P>We also discussed some aspects of the contributions by the different &ldquo;new&rdquo; member countries of the Community to the Community Budget in the years 1978 and 1979, which will see their transition to the full &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; system of financing.</P>
    <P>Finally, we discussed the economic prospects for our countries particularly in the international context.  We had a useful exchange of views on the likely development of incomes policies and on industrial relations generally.  The Prime Minister indicated his country's <Col N="229" /> willingness to press ahead as soon as possible with the proceedings for the division of the Continental Shelf between the two countries.  It is obviously in the interests of both countries to get this issue settled as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I found the discussions extremely useful.  Of their nature, they could not be expected to produce immediate and dramatic results.  Their purpose was basically exploratory.  It is essential that countries which have so much in common should have an understanding of the basic purposes and intentions of the other.  This, I hope, our talks helped to achieve. Relations between us are good, and it is by developing what we have in common that I think progress can best be attained to the advantage of both peoples.</P>

      <P>Before putting to the House the views of my party on the matters raised by the Taoiseach, I wonder if it would be in order to ask him one question which could help to clarify a point?  The question is why the <i>communiqué</i> omits reference to the view that the objective of peace and stability in Northern Ireland can be achieved only if both sections of the community share power in a system of Government providing for partnership and participation?  Could I ask if the Taoiseach sought such a reference in the <i>communiqué</i> and if not why not?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is highly unusual for the Deputy but since he has asked a question I can give him an answer. Had I put a question on similar lines to my predecessor I would not have been given an answer.  The Deputy knows well that in these discussions many things may be agreed that do not appear in the official <i>communiqué</i>. I need say no more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Taoiseach for an answer which helps me in formulating my remarks. The twin objectives of policy in Northern Ireland are clearly the restoration of peace and the establishment of a system of self-government acceptable to both sections of the community.  These must be our short-term objectives.  The achievement of <Col N="230" /> both has been long delayed.  In the context of what the Taoiseach has just said it is worth considering why they have been long delayed.</P>
      <P>An essential prerequisite for the ending of violence, apart from the enforcement of law and order, is a realisation by the paramilitary bodies that their activities cannot and will not produce the results they desire.  So far as the Loyalist paramilitaries are concerned, the total failure of the British Government to deal early and firmly with the May, 1974, strike encouraged the illusion that action in the streets, intimidation and violence could prevent a political solution being found.  It even encouraged them to believe that these methods could positively force a political solution along the lines they sought, but this illusion was shattered when this year's attempted repetition of the strike was broken.  The illusion of the Loyalist paramilitaries as to the efficacy of their strong-arm methods has also been repeatedly encouraged by the tendency of British political leaders, in Government and in Opposition, to talk of terrorism as if terrorist activities were confined to the IRA, ignoring the fact that the present period of violence in Northern Ireland was started by Loyalist paramilitaries in the late sixties and that, while the bulk of Loyalist paramilitary violence in recent years has been reactive to the IRA, it remains a major threat to peace in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the IRA side, the idea that their methods might secure sympathy or support from elected politicians, or that elected politicians might be brought to the conference table at the point of a gun, has received no support in the Republic since the events of May, 1970.  Since that time the various IRA's have had no grounds for any illusion as to the willingness of any Government here to deal with them or to tolerate them. Unfortunately, this was not true of successive United Kingdom Governments. A Conservative Northern Ireland Secretary met IRA spokes-men personally and also conceded to them special treatment in prison akin to that of prisoners of war, thereby deluding them into thinking that <Col N="231" /> persistence with their campaign would bring that Government to the conference table with them.  His successor authorised his officials to enter into discussions with the political representatives of the Provisional IRA who are not easily distinguishable from members of that organisation.  I believe that these actions have prolonged violence in Northern Ireland by a number of years.  Only since these contacts have apparently been terminated by the present Secretary of State has there been any evidence that the penny has started to drop and that the IRA have begun to realise that they were being led up the garden path and that there will never be negotiations with such a grossly unrepresentative group for political solutions in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>These mistakes on the part of the UK Government, which have served to prolong the agony of Northern Ireland, have had some parallel on the political side and this is the point I want to bring out in relation to the Taoiseach's statement.  A political solution to the Northern Ireland problem that will command the acceptance of both sections of the community there must, in the light of the historic exclusion of the minority from any participation in Government for over half a century, involve for a period the participation of elected representatives of that minority in a system of self-government in Northern Ireland, This truth was recognised first by my own party which, as early as September, 1969, called for a period of what we then described as joint government, several years before this need was recognised in Northern Ireland itself, even by the minority.  Since 1972, when Stormont was abolished, the policy of no devolution without power sharing has been the common ground on which successive Irish and British Governments have stood together.  The success of this stance depended and depends, as in the matter of violence, on its being maintained with vigour and determination throughout so that the intransigent opponents of any sharing of power in government, who have even rejected the chance of controlling 70 per cent of <Col N="232" /> the seats in a devolved Government, be left under no illusion that they would secure devolution on any other terms.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the great mass of Unionists, whose long experience of total control of government and whose deep-seated fears as a minority in the island of Ireland naturally encouraged them to delude themselves as to the chances of recovering such total control, it has been vital throughout that they be not left in any doubt on this issue any more than the IRA or the Loyalist paramilitaries should have been left in any doubt of the possibility of being accepted as negotiating partners in the search for a political solution.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, although less dramatically perhaps, British politicians of both parties, in Government and in Opposition, have at times found it expedient to permit doubts to arise on their determination on this issue of no devolution without power sharing.  The omission of references to power sharing in many utterances of Conservative spokesmen between 1974 and 1976 and the way in which Unionists were received at last year's Conservative Party Conference&mdash;I am not yet in a position to assess how they were received this year&mdash;deluded many Unionists into thinking that a new Conservative Government might drop this principle. On the other side, private discussions between Unionists, Loyalist M.P.'s at Westminster, who, incidentally, have no interest in losing their unique representative role by seeing devolution restored, and the present British Government&mdash;not, I think, the Northern Ireland Secretary&mdash;may also have helped to delude Unionist opinion as to the attitude of the present British Government.  Thus the precondition for success of the policy instituted by the Irish and British Governments five years ago, and carried on since then by successive Governments, of requiring power sharing in any devolved Government, that is, the precondition that it be pursued with fairness and unambiguously, has not been fully met.  Consequently, there has been a long delay in re-establishing self-government.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that the Taoiseach's talks in London must be <Col N="233" /> seen.  The primary aims of the National Coalition Government in their relations with the UK Government were to ensure, as far as possible, that the actions or defaults of that British Government did not give rise to misunderstandings either amongst the paramilitaries about their possible role in a political solution or amongst the Unionists about the possibility of devolution without power sharing.  That is why, when the former Taoiseach, Deputy Liam Cosgrave, met the British Prime Minister on 11th September, 1974, the <i>communiqué</i> recorded that the aim of restoring peace and stability to Northern Ireland on a basis commanding widespread acceptance there can be achieved only if both sections of the Community share power in government.</P>
    <P>That is why the <i>communiqué</i> after the following bilateral meeting between the two Heads of Government on the 1st November of that year re-affirmed this commitment by both heads of Government.  That is why at the next bilateral meeting between the two Heads of Government on the 5th March last year, the <i>communiqué</i> affirmed that an acceptable form of Government could be established&mdash; here I am quoting&mdash;&ldquo;only through both sections of the community agreeing on a system of Government providing for partnership and participation&rdquo;.  That is why at the frequent meetings which I had with successive Northern Ireland Secretaries of State I pressed this point continually and that is why, when a question on this issue was posed to the Northern Ireland Secretary of State on the 28th October last year, after a period of intensive consultation between our Government and the British Government and the principal Opposition party, the reply was given in the House of Commons that no system of government within Northern Ireland would be stable or effective unless both parts of the community acquiesced in that system and were willing to work it.  This meant, the reply continued, a system which would command widespread support throughout the community and in which both majority and minority would participate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="234" /> That is why, finally, in the discussions I had with the Northern Ireland Secretary of State on May 26th last&mdash;less than a month before the general election&mdash;I secured from him agreement that he would continue to make it clear that the basic objective is that of a devolved executive Government based on power sharing and that any interim council that might be established would be without significant executive powers and would be part of a two-stage process leading to self-government with power sharing.</P>
    <P>Against this background the House will understand why my party were concerned that, for the first time, a <i>communiqué</i> issued after a Heads-of-Government  meeting, did not state clearly that a devolved system of government could be established only if both sections shared power in Government.  Instead, the <i>communiqué</i> was confined to stating that it was the policy of the British Government to work towards a devolved system of government in which all sections of the community could participate on a fair basis.</P>
    <P>That is a formula that lends itself to other interpretations as is evidenced by the reaction to it of some Unionists. I can understand the Taoiseach's concern to use the London meeting as a means of de-emphasising or putting in cold storage the October 1975 Fianna Fáil statement about seeking from the UK Government a commitment to withdraw from Northern Ireland.  I am glad for the country's sake that the Taoiseach has succeeded in getting himself off that hook.  If Unionist politicians in Northern Ireland showed equal skill with him in getting off their anti-power sharing hook, we should have made much more progress by now towards a political solution.  However, possibly because of excessive concern with this aspect, it was regrettable that the Taoiseach should have done what we refused to do at every meeting, that is, to lend his name to a <i>communiqué</i> which for the first time seemed to drop the concept of power sharing as being a prerequisite for devolution of power to an Executive in Northern Ireland.  It would be deplorable if this should mislead any <Col N="235" /> Northern Unionist into believing that a return to devolution with majority rule is realistically open to them, especially since for reasons of internal British politics the waters seem already to have been muddied on this point by British Ministers who have been willing to talk in ambiguous terms to Westminster Unionists in order to secure their support in Parliament should the Lib-Lab pact fail.</P>
    <P>The primary thrust of the Taoiseach's visit to London should have been to clarify this issue and to reject out of hand any formulation in the <i>communiqué</i> which might be read or misread as weakening the position we had established and held throughout our four-and-a-quarter years in office in discussions with successive British Governments.</P>
    <P>Frankly, an <i>ex parte</i> statement by the Taoiseach at a press conference or even in this House that he received an assurance from Mr. Callaghan that there would be no devolved government without power sharing is not good enough.  This type of unambiguous language employed in all earlier <i>communiqués</i> but notably absent from this one has perhaps postponed still further the time when Unionist opinion in Northern Ireland faces this reality.</P>
    <P>In this connection I note the willingness of the British Government to explore an interim arrangement involving the devolution of a range of powers to a locally-elected body in accordance with arrangements acceptable to both sides of the community.  Such an arrangement would be the more difficult to achieve to the extent that any doubt subsists as to such an arrangement being only a step on the way to devolution on a power sharing basis. In conjunction with reports of Labour-Loyalist talks at Westminster, the ambiguity in the <i>communiqué</i> has, as the Taoiseach is aware, aroused fears among the minority in Northern Ireland that such an interim arrangement, which could be desirable and a step forward, might merely reinforce the present system of direct rule instead of pointing away from it and towards full devolution on a power sharing basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> So far as economic co-operation is concerned, I should be glad if it transpired that these London talks lead to real progress.  Throughout our period in government we found successive British Governments hesitant and indecisive on this matter.  But I am hopeful from the tone of what the Taoiseach has said that he will be able to make faster progress than we were able to make in this area.  However, this was not due to any lack of effort on our part but perhaps the time is now regarded by the British Government to be more appropriate.</P>
    <P>I note that part of the Taoiseach's statement which refers to the legitimate aspirations of the vast majority of the Irish people to come together by consent, by negotiation and under agreed structures.  I note, too, his suggestion that the British Government should acknowledge this aspiration.  In this connection I trust that in his discussions with the British Government the Taoiseach did not overlook the solid and unprecedented commitment of the previous British Government at Sunningdale to support this concept when the majority of the people of Northern Ireland indicate a wish to become part of a United Ireland and which, as his own reference to agreed structures makes clear, is the only basis on which this Government and the other parties in this House would seek to have effect given to this aspiration.  May I add, however, and I hope without heat or rancour, that I and many of us on this side of the House would be disturbed at the apparent implications contained in the following statement of the Taoiseach:</P>
    <P>One inference from the result of the last General Election here was that the wish to see this island united in peace by consent and under agreed structures was as alive and potent among the people of this country as it has ever been. </P>
    <P>Does this statement carry an implication that the parties on this side of the House who were defeated in the election do not share this wish with the Government party?  Any such implication would be both false and offensive.  Such a suggestion made by the Taoiseach to the British Prime <Col N="237" /> Minister could carry with it a highly dangerous and misleading implication of a lack of support among a large section of the people of this State for a coming together of the Irish people by agreement.  I trust that on reflection the Taoiseach will withdraw this remark which, at best, is open to misrepresentation and is damaging to the interests of the nation.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am glad to note that the Leader of the Opposition in the UK, Mrs. Thatcher, expressed to the Taoiseach her commitment to the concept of participation, of partnership in Government by the two parts of the Northern Ireland community. This is all the more welcome in view of reports in at least one English newspaper on the day following the Taoiseach's discussions with Mrs. Thatcher that she had said she believed power sharing to be no longer a possible objective.</P>
    <P>I note also what the Taoiseach has said regarding the EEC in respect of matters of common interest to both ourselves and Britain, but as further opportunities will arise for discussion of these matters I shall refrain from further comment at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to express a welcome for the continuance of the precedent set during our term in office of bringing matters of this nature before the House for discussion at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The omission of the words &ldquo;power sharing&rdquo; in the <i>communiqué</i> issued after the Downing Street talks is of some significance and has given rise to legitimate concern among very many people on both sides of the Border.  However, I noted that during a press interview after the talks the Taoiseach assured everyone concerned that the question of power sharing had been discussed and accepted fully by the British Prime Minister.  But it still leaves a cloud.  The Taoiseach will appreciate the significance of the absence of an official joint <i>communiqué</i> after a meeting of that nature and of a reassurance at a press conference given by himself in connection with that meeting.  However, <Col N="238" /> assurances given by the Taoiseach were a relief, and we can take it that the principle of power sharing is fully accepted by the British Government. Our unequivocal support for power sharing as a solution was very forcibly put forward by the Taoiseach on behalf of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Another matter that arose in the discussions was the question of integration, and the Taoiseach in his statement to the House rightly said he accepted that integration was not on.  Anyone looking at the present situation would agree that the last thing the British Government would wish for would be a situation such as General de Gaulle found himself in in relation to metropolitan France, as Algeria was regarded to be.  I do not think there is any great danger of integration being pursued.  How detailed were the discussions with regard to what could be termed an interim arrangement&mdash;pending devolved government on a power sharing basis in the North&mdash;on what was referred to as the local elected body and the powers that would be conferred upon it?  If any details of those powers were discussed, if any area of the responsibility that would be given to it was defined, we would like further information because what we have is somewhat vague.  However, vague though it is, it is helpful.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his statement to the House rather down-plays the danger of the political vacuum that exists in the North.  It might be very dangerous not to take full cognisance of the SDLP's views in this respect: that a political vacuum is the most fertile possible ground for the men of violence.  That vacuum should be filled as speedily as possible but, pending devolved government on a power sharing basis, it is necessary to proceed with this elected local body with specific powers as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also referred to cross-Border co-operation on the economic front.  The Labour Party have always advocated that approach, and we welcome and encourage it. But it is necessary that these discussions <Col N="239" /> which are to take place should do so as speedily as possible and that specific areas, not only on economic co-operation but also on social co-operation, should be discussed and the possibility of support from both the Regional Fund and the Social Fund of the EEC should be pursued.</P>
    <P>It is of considerable importance that the Taoiseach did not press Fianna Fáil that there should be a commitment by the British Government to the withdrawal of British troops.  That would be a very significant shift in the policy of Fianna Fáil.  It was a wise and statesman-like decision that he came to in this respect and it may help considerably towards having a common approach to the situation in Northern Ireland, which is a continuing problem.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to EEC matters that were discussed at the meeting.  The question of our fisheries was mentioned, though not very extensively, in the Taoiseach's statement. Due to what this party regard as the gross national irresponsibility of the present Government while in Opposition, which spilled over into the time they took office, our fisheries problem in the EEC has been made considerably more difficult.  Perhaps the Taoiseach in the near future would elaborate a little more on the discussions he had with the British Prime Minister on this issue vital to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The question of the enlargement of the present Community was also discussed. As the Taoiseach said, the political desirability of such enlargement is obvious, and we accept that. We are also anxious that countries be given every consideration in their application for membership of the Community, but there are very definite practical difficulties involved.  Very serious thought would have to be given by the present Government to applications from what are three underdeveloped economies into a Community which is not able, apparently, to cater for the present members of that Community who fall into that category of underdeveloped, such as ourselves, Italy, and indeed Britain.  Unless there <Col N="240" /> is a clear commitment by the Community to ensure that the Regional and Social Funds do the job that they were originally set up to do, there is not much prospect of a continuance of the Community.  If that Community were to be enlarged without very definite steps in this respect being taken, it may collapse under the strain of enlargement, although enlargement is a most desirable thing politically.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to say any more except that this party has at all times advocated as the only possible basis for the solution to the Northern problem an approach for eventual unity of the country based on agreement achieved by non-violent methods. This is my first opportunity as spokesman for the Labour Party on Northern Ireland to speak in this House on this problem.  I assure the Taoiseach and the present Government that, as far as the Labour Party are concerned, as long as the Government's approach is one of reconciliation and a total rejection of violence irrespective of the source, and a commitment to unity based on consent, they will have the support of the Labour Party.  However, I emphasise that we are not prepared ourselves to play party politics with the lives and future of our fellow countrymen.  In view of what happened in 1975 and the desirable change that took place at Downing Street as regards Fianna Fáil policy in this area, we are not prepared to allow any party or any Government, for political purposes, to play fast and loose with the future and the very lives of the people of this island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That it is expedient that the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill, 1976, which has lapsed and which before lapsing stood referred to the Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills be revived and proceeded with at that stage.</P>
      <P>I have available a short explanation which may be of benefit to the House. When the last Dáil was dissolved the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill, 1976, had passed its Second Stage and had been referred to the Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills, but the Committee had not, in fact, met and the Bill lapsed.  The purpose of this motion is to seek the agreement of Dáil Éireann to revive the Bill and to proceed with it at Committee Stage.  If Deputies agree to this motion, the Seanad will be asked to pass a similar motion.  The final step in the process of restoring the Bill to the Order Paper will be a further motion to that effect which must also be agreed by both Houses. When all of these motions have been passed the Bill will stand referred to the new Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills, which will shortly be established.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of the new Deputies in the House I will briefly sketch the outline of this Bill.  Its main purpose is to repeal all existing provisions of the statute law relating to social welfare and to re-enact them in a single measure.  It, therefore, embraces the provisions of more than 60 Acts from the Old Age Pensions Act, 1908 right through to the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1976.  It also includes the provisions of subsidiary legislation&mdash;such as statutory instruments and statutory rules and orders&mdash;where such legislation expressly amends or modifies the statute law.</P>

    <P>The Bill itself is a very substantial piece of legislation and contains some 311 sections and runs to more than 200 <Col N="249" /> pages of print.  It includes the legal provisions covering all the schemes administered by the Department of Social Welfare on both the social insurance and social assistance sides.  It also, of course, covers the many ancillary provisions which relate to the administration of these schemes such as the decisions and appeals machinery, financing, the arrangements for legal proceedings and so on.</P>
    <P>There is one essential aspect of a Consolidation Bill and it is that the Bill cannot provide for any change in the law as it stands.  The former Attorney General has issued the necessary certificate, under Standing Orders, to the effect that this Bill is purely a consolidating measure and as such does not in any way alter the existing law.</P>
    <P>The Bill was introduced because of repeated requests from interested bodies in the public and private sectors who had to have recourse to social welfare legislation.  Because of the large number of Acts and the numerous changes over the years in these Acts, this legislation had become exceedingly complex and difficult to interpret. Similarly, many Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas had called for consolidation of this widely referred to body of legislation and had asked for a more manageable piece of legislation with which to work.  The present Bill does, I think, meet all of these very legitimate requests and it will, I hope, provide all interested individuals with a readable and workable legislative framework.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to mention that the new Bill will, when enacted, be made available in a loose-leaf form which will be capable of being updated after the passage of subsequent legislation. This was done in the case of the Income Tax Acts and it ensures that the process of consolidation becomes a continuing one and obviates the necessity for any further consolidation measures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>An Bord Bainne Co-operative Ltd. are a co-operative society which was, with my full support, set up in 1972 under the Friendly Societies Acts on a voluntary basis by the creamery industry itself to take over the central marketing of dairy products as from 1st February, 1973.  Under European Community legislation the semi-State Bord Bainne, which up to then had acted as the central agency for the marketing of our dairy products, could not because of the way they were constituted, continue to perform this role on our accession to the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The then new co-operative Bord Bainne had no initial assets of their own on the strength of which they might arrange the borrowings necessary for them to conduct the business for which they were established.  The need for such borrowings&mdash;and borrowings on a large scale&mdash;arises mainly from the pattern of our milk production here.  The bulk of our milk, and, therefore, milk products, is produced over a relatively short period each year from April to August while the marketing of these products by <Col N="251" /> the board is conducted on a fairly even basis throughout the year.</P>
    <P>As the board purchase the products from the creameries and other milk processing units on production and must themselves wait for payment until marketing has been completed, expenditure by the board in the months of peak production by far exceeds their income from sales.  This gap between expenditure and income has to be bridged by the short-term borrowing of vast amounts of working capital from banks and other lending institutions each year.  Under The Dairy Produce (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1973, the Minister for Agriculture was with the consent of the Minister for Finance, empowered to guarantee borrowings by the board for the purchase of dairy products up to a maximum of £20 million at any one time.  With the aid of this guarantee the board have been enabled to borrow sums vastly in excess of this amount.</P>
    <P>By 1976, however, both milk production and price of milk and consequently of milk products had increased very substantially.  As a consequence the seasonal gap between the board's outgoings and income had already increased substantially to an extent that the £20 million guarantee was no longer adequate.  Accordingly, my predecessor, with my full support, sought and obtained in the Dairy Produce (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Amendment) Act, 1976, power to increase the maximum amount of the guarantee to £40 million.</P>
    <P>The guarantee provision contained in the 1973 Act was, however, intended as a temporary measure designed to give the then new board an opportunity to build up their assets to the point at which they could operate on their own resources without the need for such State guarantee.  Accordingly, it was provided in that Act that the period over which the guarantee would be available would expire on 31st December, 1977.  The Act of 1973 provided also for the transfer to the Co-operative Bord Bainne of the assets of the semi-State board.  These, however, amounted to no more than about £3 million.  The need for building up their assets sufficiently to enable <Col N="252" /> them to conduct their financial affairs without having recourse to a State guarantee has frequently been impressed on the board.  The board responded initially by doubling, with effect as from 1st January, 1976, the amount of their levy for capital purposes. When they did this, the board at the same time altered the basis of the levy from a fixed rate per gallon of milk to a percentage, 0.6 per cent, of the milk price paid by the creamery.  This alteration of course ensures that increases in the price of milk as well as in its volume are reflected in the amount yielded by the levy.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it is quite clear that the board's own assets, which stood at approximately £6 million at the end of 1976, will be far from being adequate for some time to come.  Therefore, it is proposed in the Bill now before the House to extend the period of the guarantee for a further two years after 31st December, 1977.</P>
    <P>The board, with the general support of the industry, have been doing an excellent job of work on the marketing of our dairy products, a sector vital to our economy, and in this further Bill the Government are continuing to demonstrate their confidence in this work.  I trust, therefore, that the House will readily approve of its terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I welcome this Bill and I concur with the Minister's statement that Bord Bainne are doing an excellent job in the interests of the dairy industry.  It is important that this House and the public at large not resident in farming areas should appreciate the importance to our national economy of the dairy industry and consequently of the work being done by An Bord Bainne for that industry on the export market.  There is a very large employment content in the industry, not merely on farms but also in creameries and processing plants.  As a producer of dairy products we are somewhat more distant from high concentrations of population where these products are sold than are dairy producers and processers on the Continent and in the United Kingdom, <Col N="253" /> where the consuming population forms a larger percentage of the total population. Therefore, a greater effort in marketing is required by a country such as ours which has problems of distance from the market place to overcome.</P>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of complimenting An Bord Bainne on the success they have made of their work since they became a wholly selfsupporting co-operative in 1973 and the support given to them in this work by the various creameries.  The growth of their work can be well illustrated by stating that their turnover in 1976 was £230 million, a 55 per cent increase on their turnover in the previous year, and all the indications are that the turnover this year will be £350 million approximately, which indicates another increase of almost the same magnitude.  The production of milk has been increasing and hence the challenge facing Bord Bainne.  In 1976 no less than 675,000,000 gallons of milk were supplied to our creameries as against 510,000,000 in 1970 and the indications are that the gallonage will be up this year 7 per cent on the 1976 figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extension of the time limit for the guarantee being given by the Minister to loans raised by Bord Bainne is on their own evidence and the evidence of common sense of great importance to them because, as the Minister said, they have to raise very substantial sums in order to carry on their marketing operations.  However, the future of the dairy industry rests on many other factors.  There is the problem of imports of cheese and butter from outside the Community into the European market, and I take this opportunity of urging the Minister to act in the most decisive manner possible to ensure that the terms of Protocol 18 of the Treaty of Accession are adhered to in relation to the importation of New Zealand cheese to the UK market.  The Protocol provides that special arrangements which continue up to 31st December next should not be retained after that date.  Obviously there will be pressure from New Zealand to have a further extension of these special arrangements and it is up to the Minister to ensure <Col N="254" /> that such an extension does not occur. We produce approximately 57,000 tons of cheddar cheese and of that 50,000 is sent to the United Kingdom market where our biggest single non-UK competitor is New Zealand.  The continuance of New Zealand imports obviously creates problems&mdash;indeed, has already created problems&mdash;for the cheese industry here and their discontinuance would provide more opportunities for our cheese producers. I urge the Minister, and will continue to do so between now and 31st December, to take the strongest possible measures to ensure these New Zealand imports do not continue and the terms of the Protocol are adhered to.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the diversification of processed products is of very great importance in a situation in which there is an excess of supply over demand in the milk market in the Community and where the consumer needs to be wooed to consume more milk products and thereby provide employment in our dairy industry.  Obviously new products appealing to new consumer tastes have an important role to play in this context.  The biggest problem is not that of developing these products.  The biggest problem is launching them on the market and creating consumer demand for them. This is the job of the co-operative creameries and Bord Bainne and it is one in which they should get maximum support from the Minister.  It is equally important to have adequate funds made available to An Foras Talúntais for the development of these products and it is for that reason I would urge the Minister to seek the maximum amount of EEC aid towards the operations of An Foras Talúntais in developing these products.  Such diversification would obviously be of benefit not just to this country but to the Community as a whole since an expansion in demand for such products would assist the Community in dealing with its dairy surpluses.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I would urge the Minister to give attention is the development and strengthening of the inspectorate under the various Acts.  It is of considerable importance that dairy products should have the <Col N="255" /> reputation of having been throughly inspected by Government inspectors, independent of the producers, whose word is vouched for by a responsible Minister.  I would urge the Minister to increase the staff in this sector.</P>
    <P>Another very live issue in the industry at the moment is the European Community co-responsibility levy which has been introduced and is applying to all of this country, although I understand there are mountain areas in the Community to which it does not apply.  This is a matter which will be discussed on another occasion but I would urge the Minister to ensure arrangements are made as early as possible to use the proceeds of this levy effectively in expanding the market for dairy products and particularly to ensure that a substantial part of the levy raised throughout the Community is used to develop the market for Irish dairy products because we depend as an economy to a much larger extent on our dairy industry than any other of the nine members of the Community. It is important that the measures used should be measures which have the prospect of creating a long-term, continuing and selfsustaining demand for dairy products rather than measures which merely alleviate a temporary situation and, once withdrawn, leave nothing behind them but a disequilibrium in the market situation.  Use to create a long-term, increased demand for dairy products is the optimum use and I would urge the Minister to ensure that is the way it is used.</P>
    <P>I have one criticism and suggested improvement of the present Bill to offer to the Minister.  It concerns the date to which the Minister's power to give guarantees is being extended. It is being extended only to 31st December, 1979, a very short time from the autumn of 1977.  We know that An Bord Bainne are engaged in a five-year market development plan. It must be very difficult for the board to plan the financial support for this five-year term when they only have certainty as to the provision of a ministerial guarantee for a little over <Col N="256" /> two years from the present time.  I realise that it has been the ambition of both sides of the House to ensure that in the long run An Bord Bainne should be able to stand on their own feet in this matter and the board's efforts, by use of a capital levy, to raise a sufficient capital fund of their own to enable them to be independent in the long run of a ministerial guarantee are to be very much welcomed.</P>
    <P>It is however obvious to me, and probably to An Bord Bainne, that although this levy has been increased since 1976 at present rates of income it will not be sufficient to allow the board to dispense with ministerial guarantees for at least five years from now.  Therefore, I do not understand why the Bill does not provide for the extension of this guarantee at least until 31st December, 1982.  The fact that it is not extended beyond 31st December, 1979, means that An Bord Bainne must rely on short-term finance to a much greater extent than would be healthy for them.  Finance extending for less than 12 months is clearly unsatisfactory for the sort of dairy marketing operation in which An Bord Bainne engage in financing their entire operation.  There is a place for short-term finance but it should not be the only type of finance available to An Bord Bainne.</P>
    <P>For instance, cheddar cheese produced this year, because of the necessity for it to mature, will not be sold until next year and the financing of those stocks must be carried by An Bord Bainne over two marketing years.  Secondly, the board are engaging in investment companies abroad concerned in the distribution of dairy products and the purchase of equity in such companies, I submit, should be financed by long-term finance because the return from such investment will itself be long-term, not short-term. Thirdly, it is a fact that the board never reach the stage at any time of any year in their present operation where they do not need loans from banks.  They have a minimum continuing lending requirement of approximately £30 million.  That being so, it is desirable that this £30 million <Col N="257" /> core of lending requirement should be financed by long-term loans.  The banks prefer it that way and the interest rates are more favourable in the case of long-term loans than they are in the case of short-term loans.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention also to certain defects in the wording of the 1973 Act in relation to the types of guarantee which may be given by the Minister.  I ask him to consider, if not in this legislation&mdash;although it may be possible&mdash;certainly in legislation in the near future, steps to remedy these deficiencies.  There are two defects, first, the use in section 6 (1) and elsewhere in section 6 of the term &ldquo;loan&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;liability&rdquo;. It has been represented to me that certain matters for which the board may wish to obtain the Minister's guarantee could not, under a strict definition of the term, be construed as loans.  Three or four basic situations are covered by this statement. The board, from time to time, have to obtain performance guarantees from the EEC in order to pre-fix export refunds or to pay moneys in advance of certain other actions being completed. In essence, when the board enter into a contract for the provision of dairy products over a period to third countries they do not know what the level of the refunds obtained by the board from the EEC over the full extent of that contract will be. This is because the level of refunds will vary with the movement of currencies and of dairy products and prices over the contract period.  It is desirable for certainty on the part of An Bord Bainne in their operations to be able to prefix the rate of restitution obtained.  This involves them in expense which, I understand, is not covered by the term &ldquo;loan&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>They also have to provide bid bonds to third countries, to which they are offering a tender of supply, that the bid or the tender will not be withdrawn prior to the closure.  Obtaining a bond to this effect from the bank who will act as a third party or a guarantor between the board and the third country wishing to purchase their products is a facility which, strictly speaking, does not come within the term <Col N="258" />&ldquo;loan&rdquo; as envisaged in the 1973 Act.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the obtaining of foreign exchange dealing facilities, which are obviously very important for the board, I understand, does not come within the term, nor do operations involving the use of bills of exchange.  I would urge the Minister to consider carefully between now and Committee Stage whether it would be possible to substitute for the term &ldquo;loan&rdquo; where it appears in section 6 the wider term &ldquo;liability&rdquo; which would include loans as well as the matters I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>There is another phrase in the 1973 Act which could be improved to the benefit of the board and their operations. Section 6 (5) states</P>
    <P>Moneys obtained by the Society on foot of a loan guaranteed under this section shall be used solely by the Society for the acquisition in the course of its ordinary business of dairy produce. </P>
    <P>I understand the use of the phrase &ldquo;acquisition in the course of its ordinary business of dairy produce&rdquo; does not necessarily in all cases cover the sort of expense incurred by Bord Bainne for which a loan might be obtained for which the Minister's guarantee would be appropriate.  In a strict interpretation, it does not cover such things as storage and marketing as distinct from acquisition.  This is a matter to which the Minister perhaps should also give attention.</P>
    <P>There is a third matter to which I should also like to draw the attention of the Minister in respect of section 6 of the Principal Act.  Section 6 (7) provides:</P>
    <P>The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the expiration of every financial year, lay before each House of the Oireachtas a statement setting out with respect to each guarantee under this section given during that year or given at any time before, and in force at, the commencement of that year&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  particulars of the guarantee,</P>
    <P>(b)  in case any payment has been made by the Minister under the guarantee before the end of <Col N="259" /> that year, the amount of the payment and the amount (if any) repaid to the Minister on foot of the payment,</P>
    <P>(c)  the amount of principal covered by the guarantee which was outstanding at the end of that year.</P>
    <P>The requirement is that that information be given in respect of each guarantee and that it be given at the end of each financial year.  My information is that the provisions in respect of putting this information before the Oireachtas and in the Dáil Library have not been complied with fully.  I should like the Minister to give an assurance that they will be complied with fully in future.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a brief reference to guarantees in general.  A guarantee which is the Minister, on behalf of the Government, underwriting a loan obtained usually but not in all cases by State companies, and not in this case a State company, is an undertaking that if that company defaults in the payment of the loan the Minister, on behalf of the Exchequer, will step in and make the repayment.  It is important that there should be monitoring on a long-term and continuing basis of the liability which the Exchequer and the taxpayers are entering into in respect of such guarantees.  At present individual Ministers give or extend guarantees to State bodies under their care, or other bodies under their care.  It is important that adequate central monitoring of the movement of the total liability of the Exchequer in respect of all Departments should be carried out in one place.</P>
    <P>I know it is the function of the Minister for Finance to do this.  It is important that it should be done because there has been a considerable growth in the overall contingent liability of the Exchequer under guarantees in general.  The amount of loans guaranteed by the State in March, 1972, was £267 million.  The amount guaranteed on 31st December, 1976, was £652 million, a very significant growth.  More significant <Col N="260" /> still is the fact that, within that total, there has been a much more rapid growth in the guarantees given by the Minister to loans raised overseas as against loans raised within the State. In 1972 the comparison was £204 million loans raised internally as against £63 million raised externally. The present situation is: £375 million internal loans as against £277 million external loans.  If this trend continues we can expect there will be more external loans guaranteed by the Minister than internal loans.</P>
    <P>Obviously moneys owed outside the State in currencies other than our own and which may be rising in value at a more rapid rate are less desirable, if that is the case, than loans raised internally. Therefore I urge the Minister, in conjunction with his colleagues, to ensure that the development of contingent liabilities under guarantee of the Government is adequately monitored in the years ahead.  I conclude by welcoming this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate Deputy Gibbons on his appointment as Minister for Agriculture. He has a deep knowledge of agriculture and I wish him well.  We in the Labour Party welcome this Bill as do members of the Fine Gael Party. This had to be done at this time.  Time is running out for the guaranteeing of loans to Bord Bainne.  Bord Bainne have been doing a fine job in marketing our dairy produce in EEC countries and throughout the world.  The board were essential when they were established and they have done a very good job.  With rising costs in different markets they must have the necessary finance to cope with the general expansion of our dairy products.</P>
      <P>The dairying industry is one of the few sections where we are showing we have real potential for an increase in productivity and an increase in output in money and material terms. There are many new methods of cheese making and other dairy products and it is essential that Bord Bainne should have the wherewithal to cope with this situation and to continue the good work they have been carrying on in selling dairy produce, especially abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="261" /> The Bill is essential and, consequently, I do not need to say much about it.  While it is intended to introduce a levy to cover the cost to Bord Bainne I believe that will not happen for some time.  I hope our dairy industry will continue to expand but it will not be possible for Bord Bainne to operate without these guarantees. The suggestion by Deputy Bruton that the period be extended to five years should be investigated but that is only a minor complaint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speakers, I welcome the Bill which is here of necessity.  Over the past four or five years Bord Bainne have acted as a great pillar for the milk producers. They supplied the necessary finance to ensure that co-ops paid on time.  With the vast increase in milk production in recent years I doubt if any other organisation could have given such a good service to the agricultural community.  I should like to draw attention to the change in EEC policy.  I do not think the Minister should support any move to encourage the farming community to change from milk to beef, a policy being promoted by the EEC.  We have learned to our detriment what happens when such changes take place.  A lot of money has been invested by the farming community in milking parlours and increasing their milk herds and any move to pay the proceeds of a levy of 0.9p together with a subsidy to those who change from milk to beef should not be supported because in the long term it will only add to the already huge bill for borrowing by our farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Milk production has reached the stage where farmers are getting a return for the money invested.  Bord Bainne should now be engaged in the field of research as well as promoting the sale of dairy products.  In Canada and America research bodies have investigated the possibility of extracting more products from milk.  That research is being financed by the respective Governments.  The Minister should encourage such research here because I believe that in the coming years there will be a huge increase in <Col N="262" /> milk production.  We have heard a lot about &ldquo;milk mountains&rdquo; in Europe but it is worth noting that due to the tremendous work by Bord Bainne we added very little, if any at all, to that mountain.  As a result of the work of the board in the last two years we did not contribute to the &ldquo;milk mountain&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Farmers are now being asked to pay 0.9p per gallon of a levy and it should be remembered that this will amount to a lot of money for those living on uneconomic holdings.  It will amount to £5 per cow or, to a man with 30 cows, approximately £3 per week.  It is a direct tax and that is the way the farming community are looking at it. While in Brussels recently I discussed this matter with officials and their attitude was that the &ldquo;milk mountain&rdquo; must be reduced in the short term. Four years ago there was a lot of talk about a &ldquo;beef mountain&rdquo; but the extraordinary thing is that the &ldquo;beef mountain&rdquo; disappeared overnight. However, as a result of the action taken by the EEC then, many farmers suffered huge losses.  I hope the Minister will ensure that we do not have a massive swing from milk to beef over the next four or five years.</P>
    <P>I agree with the suggestion made by Deputy Bruton that the period of time be increased from two to five years. Any organisation with such huge commitments abroad must have a sufficient period of guarantee.  I can see no risk involved in guaranteeing the board for at least five years.  We must have a system of monitoring such a guarantee and in this regard it is essential that Government representatives work in conjunction with the accounts staff of such an organisation. It is not easy to assess accurately how the accounts stand because the majority of accounts are at least nine months behind in time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the House for the support given to the proposal. I should also like to thank Deputy Bermingham for his personal greeting. In his general welcome for the Bill Deputy Bruton made reference to the EEC situation and the fact that imports of New Zealand cheese will cease at <Col N="263" /> the end of the year.  Our position on that is very simple: that is what the law says and that is the Irish position.  We cannot accept the changing of the protocol which gave this concession at the time of our accession, and that of the United Kingdom, for the strictly limited period ending on 31st December.</P>
      <P>Since the legal position is so clear&mdash;there is no dispute between parties about what our position ought to be&mdash;we should leave the subject there because in my view the continuous agitation of this subject would tend to strengthen the belief that there is possibly some substance in the New Zealand claim that an extension similar to that given at the Dublin Summit should be given in the case of New Zealand butter.  This is regretted.  The general position with regard to butter is that even at the end of the extended period there was still a very large amount of New Zealand butter on the Community market&mdash;speaking from memory 215,000 tons of New Zealand butter were legally saleable within the Community at that time.  The position with our cheese is different and is as I have already stated it.</P>
      <P>The vigour with which Bord Bainne have applied themselves to their allotted task&mdash;being the marketing agent of the dairy industry&mdash;has been commended by Deputy Bruton, Deputy Bermingham and Deputy D'Arcy.  I agree that the commendation they gave Bord Bainne for this performance is well deserved.  I have every confidence that in the coming period the board will continue the active and vigorous selling practices that brought about the position where the Irish contribution to the mountains Deputy D'Arcy referred to is very small indeed.  We have contributed nothing to the butter mountain and a very negligible quantity of skimmed milk powder.  Therefore, the amount of responsibility we had in the creation of these surpluses is quite small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy D'Arcy's conviction that there should not be a feeling on the part of Irish dairy producers that there should be a running <Col N="264" /> down, a restraint or a control of the expansion of the Irish dairy herd.  The cattle industry is the basis of Ireland's wealth and all parties by their contributions to this debate recognise this.</P>
    <P>The existence of reconversion schemes, as they are called, within the EEC might very well apply to some people in our farming community who, for reasons of age, illness or something like that, might want to convert from active dairy farming to the less demanding dry stock farming or calf suckling.  For that reason the scheme should be available.  I accept Deputy D'Arcy's main point that it should not be an item of national policy that we reverse or in any way restrain the development of our dairy industry.  It is worth saying in passing that I have always believed there should be a secondary herd complementary to the dairy herd, as well as the expanding herd to provide a market for the calves coming from the dairy industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton, Deputy D'Arcy and Deputy Bermingham referred to the incidence of the co-responsibility levy which was accepted by the Council of Ministers last April.  I say that in no sense of personal criticism of my predecessor, Deputy Clinton, who resisted this because it was a tax on production for this country which hardly subscribes to the embarrassment of the skimmed milk powder or butter mountains.  Deputy Clinton's protestations at that time were overruled and that is still the position now. The legal and inescapable position is that this levy must be met.  Commissioner Gundelach has not yet informed us of his proposals with regard to the expenditure of the proceeds of the co-responsibility levy.  It will be our wish that we get as big a part of this levy as we are entitled to and that it is spent on the development of new products and the enlargement of the dairy products market.</P>
    <P>Speakers in to-day's short debate made this point and I agree with them. They also made the point that the guarantee being given to Bord Bainne should be extended to five years.  The two years plus guarantee embodied in the Bill was already accepted by the former Government and in my view <Col N="265" /> the guarantee is of very substantial value to Bord Bainne.  The situation can be kept under constant review and there is no intention on the part of this Government, any more than there was on the part of the previous Government, in any way to run out on the dairy industry.  That is not the situation at all.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the requirement to put on the table of the House, as the 1973 Act requires, details of the guarantees backed under this Bill and the other Bills it extends. I want to tell the House that I will undertake to see that this obligation is adhered to.  I again thank the House for the contributions made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Agreement on the Accession of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tomé and Principe to the ACP-EEC Convention of Lomé and the Final Act related to that Agreement, signed on 28 March 1977, copies of which have been laid before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to address myself at this stage to all four motions. Motions Nos. 21, 22 and 23 concern the accession agreements under which three states become parties to the Convention of Lomé which was originally signed on 28 February, 1975, between the European Community its member states and 46 States of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific and Indian Oceans.</P>
      <P>Articles 89 and 90 of the Convention of Lomé set out the conditions under which states may become parties to the convention after it has entered into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 90 of the Convention stipulates that any request for accession to the convention by a state whose economic structure and production are comparable with those of the ACP <Col N="266" /> States shall require approval by the ACP-EEC Council of Ministers, the body responsible for administering the convention.  Such a state may then accede to the convention by concluding an agreement with the European Economic Community.  On 14th July, 1976, the ACP-EEC Council of Ministers approved the requests for accession to the convention from Sao Tomé and Principe, Cape Verde and Papua New Guinea.  Agreements concluded between the Community and these three states were signed subject to ratification, in Brussels on 28th March, 1977.</P>
    <P>Article 89 of the convention provides that a country or territory to which part 4 of the Treaty of Rome applies&mdash;that is overseas countries and territories&mdash;and which becomes independent and requests accession to the convention shall, with the approval of the ACP-EEC Council of Ministers, accede to the convention by depositing an instrument of accession with the Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities.  Such states are not required to conclude agreements with the Community in order to accede to the convention.  Following approval of their accession by the ACP-EEC Council of Ministers on 14th July, 1976, Surinam, the Seychelles and the Comoro State acceded to the convention in accordance with Article 89, on 16th July, 1976, 27th August, 1976 and 10th September, 1976 respectively.</P>
    <P>Dáil approval is necessary to enable three accession agreements concluded in accordance with Article 90 of the convention to be ratified by Ireland. Dáil approval is also necessary in the case of the agreement of 28th March, 1977 amending the Internal Agreement on the Financing and Administration of Community Aid signed on 11th July, 1975 which makes the necessary provision to enable the states which accede under both Articles 89 and 90 to benefit from the financial measures in the convention.</P>
    <P>The Lomé Convention, which came into force 18 months ago, was a decisive step towards a new and more equitable relationship between a number of industrialised and developing countries and has been rightly <Col N="267" /> acclaimed as a model of its kind.  It is the widest agreement that has been negotiated between such countries, both in the areas it covers and in the number of participants, and its relevance and value to developing countries is confirmed by the desire of these states to accede to it.  By introducing a number of new elements into Community/Third World relations it sets an example for regional agreements between industrialised and developing countries.</P>
    <P>The trade provisions of the convention provide duty-free access into the Community, without quotas or quantitative restrictions for all ACP industrial and agricultural products, except for agricultural products that fall under the common agricultural policy for which special arrangements have been made.  The important aspect of this concession is that it does not involve reciprocity on the part of the ACP States.</P>
    <P>The scheme for the stabilisation of export earnings, known as Stabex, is perhaps the most novel feature of the convention.  The purpose of the scheme is to compensate the ACP States in the event of a fall in their export earnings from a number of basic products. Stabex, therefore, makes it possible to forecast and plan on the basis of the earnings which the ACP countries can expect from their exports of these products. 375 million European units of account have been allocated to the scheme for the duration of the convention, divided into five annual instalments of 75 million European units of account or approximately £49 million. The transfers take the form either of interest-free loans, which are repaid by the recipient states when certain conditions have been fulfilled relating to the increase in their export earnings or, in the case of the 24 poorest countries, they take the form of grants.</P>
    <P>For 1975, transfers totalling 73 million European units of account were made to 18 ACP countries, covering nine products.  So far, 31 million units of account have been transferred to 11 ACP States for 1976, covering 13 products, including cocoa, coffee, tea, bananas, cotton and palm oil.</P>
    <P>The industrial co-operation provisions <Col N="268" /> aim at facilitating the industrialisation of the ACP States, in particular through the transfer and adaptation of technology.  Partnership between European and ACP industry in order to promote industrialisation in the ACP States is fostered through the Committee for Industrial Co-operation and the Centre for Industrial Development established under the convention.</P>
    <P>The ACP/EEC Council of Ministers and ACP/EEC Consultative Assembly of Parliamentarians enable the provisions adopted in the Lomé Convention to be managed jointly.  A particularly valuable forum, I believe, is the Consultative Assembly, which enables parliamentarians of the Nine, through their contacts with their colleagues in the ACP States, to bring to their national parliaments, a greater awareness of the problems of the Third World.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that the main purpose of the financial and technical co-operation provisions in the Lomé Convention is to correct structural imbalances in the various economic sectors of the ACP countries and thereby to assist their economic and social development. This is obviously an objective of fundamental importance. A total amount of 3,390 million European units of account or approximately £2,200 million has been provided for this purpose in the European Development Fund established by the convention and from the resources of the European Investment Bank.  The co-operation financed by the fund is mainly in the agriculture, industry and infrastructure sectors.</P>
    <P>The convention gives the ACP States a crucial role in determining the aid to be granted and in administering it. Thus indicative programmes of aid are drawn up by mutual agreement between the Commission and the ACP States and these are later submitted for opinion to the member states.  The ACP States are also closely involved in the appraisal and execution of individual projects within the programmes of aid.  The new role of the beneficiary countries in the aid relationships is highlighted by the fact that from the conception of an aid programme to its ultimate execution it is the ACP State which has the final say <Col N="269" /> on the way its allocation of money is spent.</P>
    <P>The sense of partnership which pervades the Lomé Convention is also evident in the provisions which encourage regional co-operation among ACP States and which seek to lay the foundation for increased inter-developing country trade and co-operation. The convention permits initiatives to be taken to meet needs not always catered for by large aid programmes. One such initiative is the creation of an experimental programme of micro-projects which will benefit small local communities.  In this scheme, which will cost 20 million European units of account, assistance is given to local activities such as the building of small dams, bridges, wells, silos, dispensaries, clinics and so on.</P>
    <P>In effecting the transfer of resources from the Community to the ACP States, which is the primary purpose of the convention, opportunities of a commercial nature arise.  Most of the work associated with development projects under the European Development Fund will be carried out by organisations from the Community member states although every effort will be made, and this is consistent with the philosophy of the EDF, to involve local firms.  To date, three Irish firms of consulting engineers have been awarded contracts from the EDF.  The total value of these contracts amounts to £300,000.  The operation of the EDF is still at a comparatively early stage and this sum represents only a portion of the return which I expect and which I and my Department are making every effort to realise.</P>
    <P>This then is, very briefly, the Convention of Lomé to which Papua New Guinea, Cape Verde and Sao Tomé and Principe are acceding.  The accession agreements which are the subject of the motions before the Dáil are similar in type.  They provide for the application of the provisions of the convention to the three acceding states and set out transitional arrangements and timetables.  Explanatory memoranda have been made available to the Members of the House.</P>
    <P>In regard to Motion No. 22 the <Col N="270" /> Community has drawn up an internal agreement amending the Internal Agreement on the Financing and Administration of Community Aid&mdash;which was signed on 11th July, 1975&mdash; so that the three new states will be in a position to benefit fully from these provisions of the convention, while at the same time ensuring&mdash;in accordance with Articles 89 and 90&mdash;that the advantages presently accruing to the original ACP States will not be adversely affected by the new accessions.</P>
    <P>This amending internal agreement embodies two technical adjustments in the administration of the European Development Fund.  The first results from the fact that three former Overseas Countries and Territories&mdash;Surinam, the Seychelles and the Comoro State&mdash;which were associated with the Lomé Convention have recently become independent and have now acceded to the convention as ACP States.  Consequently the amending internal agreement provides for the transfer of an appropriate amount from the Overseas Countries and Territories sub-head of the European Development Fund to the ACP sub-head. Obviously, this transaction which involves an amount of 31.6 million European units of account does not affect the overall volume of Community aid.  The second change is more substantive and provides for an increase of 22.5 million European units of account in the ACP sub-head to take into account the accessions of Papua New Guinea, Sao Tóme and Principe, and Cape Verde.</P>
    <P>It is intended that this latter amount will be partly offset by a sum of 13 million European units of account which had originally been intended for the French Overseas Departments but which, because of certain subsequent adjustments, was never actually disbursed.  Therefore, the residual amount to be contributed by the member states of the Community is 9.5 million European units of account of which the Irish share, at 0.6 per cent, amounts to 57,000 European units of account or approximately £37,000 at the current value of the unit of account, which is <Col N="271" /> 65p.  While the overall amount for the new ACP states will be committed during the life-time of the Convention &mdash;that is, before 1st March, 1980&mdash;it is expected that the actual expenditure will be spread over a period of five or six years, commencing in 1978.</P>
    <P>The Lomé Convention is significant in that it has shown that, through good-will and co-operation, changes can be made in the present inequitable relationship between the industrialised and developing world.  Debate on the creation of a new international economic order conducted in an atmosphere of confrontation is futile.  It is clear that the process of achieving a more equitable world order depends on the co-operation of all countries.</P>
    <P>We live in a period when the relationship between the industrialised and developing world is under examination. This is not a debate that we can afford to ignore.  It is not enough to say that the problems of the Third World are not of our making.  In a world of increasing interdependence yet one with continuing massive disparities of wealth and living standards there is a moral obligation on all countries to ensure an equitable distribution of the world's resources.</P>
    <P>Aside from the moral obligation to help the underprivileged areas of the world it should be evident that it is in our own interest that a more balanced relationship should emerge.  If the fundamental restructuring of the world economic order which is required is not achieved by dialogue and in agreement, then we are heading for a confrontation which will indeed fundamentally alter the present world order, but at what cost, and to whose benefit? The improvement in the atmosphere surrounding discussion of economic relations between developed and developing countries which has taken place, has enabled some modest progress to be made.  By successfully negotiating and implementing the Lomé Convention, the European Community has set an example in this area in which we can take pride.  In doing so, however, we should not be complacent about the problems that remain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="272" /> Ireland, as a relatively privileged member of the International Economic Community is conscious of its obligation to help to alleviate the problems of the underprivileged of the Third World.  Within the Community, Ireland contributed actively to the elaboration of the Lomé Convention.  We will continue to support and advocate the adoption by the European Community of positive and constructive policies in the field of development co-operation.</P>
    <P>I conclude by welcoming the accession of Sao Tome and Principe, Cape Verde and Papua New Guinea to the Lomé Convention and commend these motions to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>These are motions we support very enthusiastically.</P>
      <P>My remarks will not be in any way a criticism of the motions but rather to use the opportunity to discharge an obligation I believe there is on every Member of this House who knows something about the problem, that is, to enlighten our people, out of self-interest and pity for their fellow beings, to be concerned about the working of the Lomé Convention and active also in improving living standards in poorer parts of the world. Those who engage in this type of debate in international assemblies and domestic parliaments sometimes make the mistake of confusing their people by resorting to jargon easily understood by those working in the system. When they talk about ACP countries, the Third World, the developing countries, the industrialised world, the less developed countries and so on they use terms understood in international fora that do not bring home to ordinary people precisely what they are talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One third of mankind is living on a diet which contains less nutritional matter than the average diet of an Irish domestic pet.  One third of the population of the world is incapable mentally&mdash;because of lack of nutrition and spiritual and mental development &mdash;of thinking beyond daily survival. Their sole ambition is to hold on to life; they have no other ambition because they have never been tempted to look beyond self-survival.  The <Col N="273" /> opportunity which presents itself to us of the better-off countries to help these people is so great that were we to devote all our talents and efforts from now to the day we die we would still have scratched only at the surface. It is easy enough to exhort people to give charity.  However, because of the obligations people have to their families and immediate neighbours, they are less inclined to extend charity far afield.  Often times we hear quoted the saying that charity begins at home.  Let us accept that but see also the opportunities presenting themselves to the better-off people in the world to better themselves by helping others.</P>
    <P>The Minister has drawn attention to the fact that so far the value of contracts which have come to Irish firms under the operation of the Lome Convention is £300,000; that is enjoyed by three firms.  In relation both to EEC and World Bank operations Ireland has not exercised or taken advantage of the quota which is its entitlement. The truth is&mdash;as in many other spheres&mdash;the world does not owe us an obligation to look after us; we have an obligation to look after ourselves.  I am absolutely convinced that we need to be far more active and sophisticated here and, through our agencies abroad, in drawing the attention of Irish entrepreneurs and workers to the great opportunities for them, through the operation of the various international and bilateral arrangements, to help people in the Third World.  There are immense untapped opportunities available to Irish business men, particularly in relation to construction and administration.  When we were in office we took quite a number of significant steps to interest people in Ireland, and semi-state bodies in particular, in the opportunities presenting themselves abroad. There has been a good beginning.  Let us not say for one moment that nothing has been done; a great deal has been done.  We now have in being DEVCO, the organisation of semi-state bodies, concerned about business opportunities which present themselves to help people in the less well-off countries of the world.</P>
    <P>At a recent meeting I attended in <Col N="274" /> Brussels it was pointed out that, as far as the EEC is concerned, they are of the opinion that Ireland could do a great deal more in this field so as to attract more of the business opportunities presenting themselves to us.  This is not a question of depriving the people of the poorer countries of the opportunity to help themselves.  The reality is that millions of people in this world have not even the rudimentary skills necessary to do some of the simplest tasks. As modern life has become highly complex some states that have emerged from colonialism and foreign rule have not got the administrative skills necessary to carry out even some of the most rudimentary forms of government. Here a number of our agencies&mdash;the Irish Management Institute, the Institute of Public Administration and others&mdash;have rendered considerable help and are extending their educational services in developing countries and in Ireland for people from the poorer countries.</P>
    <P>That is but a small beginning.  We have a great opportunity to do more. As we extend our commercial activity and industrial operations, life becomes more complex for us also.  There is an understandable timidity on the part of Irish business people, indeed Irish tradesmen and others, to travel too far or into the unknown.  But the opportunities exist.  What is particularly important for us and our people travelling abroad is that there is total acceptability of Irish operators.</P>
    <P>There are many countries with a colonial past who are highly suspect when they offer aid and assistance or when they endeavour to engage in business dealings with Governments and firms in the Third World.  However, there are very few parts of the world where an Irishman or woman has not got total acceptability.  This is because we have not a colonial past, that for a long time in the past Irish people were seen as the educators, as the renderers of medical aid and as comforters to people in the poorer countries. Wherever oppression has reared its ugly head, as it can too often in this day and age just as it did in the past, Irish people had been very much to the <Col N="275" /> forefront in denouncing and opposing oppressive regimes.</P>
    <P>In the course of my activities as Minister I had the privilege of travelling through quite a number of the OPEC states.  Certainly nowadays they possess immense financial resources but the mere possession of such resources does not mean that they are not undeveloped.  Indeed, many of them have financial resources which they have not the capacity to use because of the comparative and fairly recent ignorance and poverty of their people.  It will take quite a number of decades before some of the OPEC countries for all their wealth will be developed to such an extent that they can look after themselves.</P>
    <P>In the meantime these countries need the skills, the training, the opportunity, the construction corps and others which we can supply to them. I remember well one OPEC country where two welcomes were given to me because when I went to that part of the world I was travelling in two capacities.  I was President of the Finance Council of Europe and I was also Minister for Finance of Ireland. Certainly I was given a warm and hospitable reception as President of the Finance Council but it was nothing to the depth of sincere welcome and total warmth of reception given to me as Irish Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Later that country, as happened with other countries also, chose Ireland out of perhaps more than 100 countries offering services as the country to render them further assistance and to bring skills and services to them.  I asked one of the leaders of these countries when he came to Dublin why he had chosen Ireland as the country to supply these skills when there were many other countries, some of which were more developed and had more resources.  He gave a description of Ireland which some people may not like, but whether we like it or not does not matter so long as other people like us for it.  He said the reason they chose Ireland was that it was a country that was politically stable, religiously conservative, in business <Col N="276" /> dealings totally beyond reproach and in national disposition always friendly. It was an interesting assessment made by somebody who, in common with his colleagues in the developing nations, has the whole world knocking on the door but it is an indication of the acceptability of Irish people and of the services Ireland can render to the world generally.</P>
    <P>I would mildly disagree with one remark made by the Minister.  He spoke about the debate that is going on in relation to the industrialised world helping the Third World.  Yes, the debate is going on, but I think it is a non-debate.  This matter should be beyond debate.  The logic of the situation is crystal clear to anyone who thinks for one moment.  When you consider the millions of people I mentioned earlier not having sufficient to properly sustain them and when you consider that if their purchasing power were doubled or quadrupled they would have to buy more from the industralised world, it is quite clear that the markets of the industrialised world would be expanded greatly if only we in the developed world had the wit to give even as little as 1 per cent of the value of what we produce every year and to transfer it unconditionally to the developing world.  If we did that, the markets for Irish goods and for all the goods of Europe would open and we would be saved from the confrontation, the shame and the agony that will continue as long as the better-off fail to transfer to those who need the money today the resources which they could use.  They could then return to us to purchase the goods and services we can give.</P>
    <P>It is a matter in which we can, as we should, discharge our moral obligation to the less well-off and it also happens to be an opportunity to make considerable progress ourselves by extending the market for our own goods and services.  On this account the Minister may be assured that the motions have the unanimous support of the Fine Gael Party.  In addition, on all other occasions in the future where the benefits of the Lomé Convention seek to be extended he may be assured of our support.  It will be generously given because <Col N="277" /> there are real advantages for everyone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with my colleague in Fine Gael in assuring the Minister of a genuine welcome for this measure.  The Lome Convention was perhaps one of the most enlightened agreements ever entered into between any group of wealthy industrial countries and countries of the Third World.  Indeed, the transfer of resources from the EEC to developing countries to enable them to embark on a policy of economic and social improvement is to be lauded and the Labour Party give the Minister every support in this regard.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has said, when the Lomé Convention came into force a year-and-a-half ago to achieve that more equitable relationship between the industrial countries of the EEC and the 46 developing countries mainly in Africa, the Caribbean and also some of the island countries of the Indian Ocean, it was hailed as a very important piece of international legislation. It is an international agreement that I hope will be followed by other industrial countries outside the EEC.</P>
      <P>The trade provisions of the Lomé Convention are weighted very heavily in favour of the developing countries and this is to be expected.  Naturally there are no reciprocal agreements whereby the 46 countries as they were then would have to repay some of the payments made under the terms of the convention.  In addition, the financial arrangements are weighted heavily in favour of the developing countries and, as the Minister has said, over a period of five years a sum in the region of £160 million will go to improve the economies of these countries.  That works out at about £33 million per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we welcome this transfer of resources, we hope this is only a small beginning in the transfer of resources and the attempt to improve the economies of Third World countries because an amount of £33 million from funds available to EEC countries is a very small figure.  We look forward to an expansion of the credits that will be made available to developing countries <Col N="278" /> and we hope that expansion will take place in the near future, not in the distant future.  We hope there will not be the same kind of delays that were attendant on the expansion of the regional and social funds within the Community itself.</P>
    <P>As both the Minister and Deputy Ryan have said, the benefits are not all in one direction.  As a privileged member of the Community we are deriving benefits from the Lomé Convention and three Irish companies have landed contracts to the extent of £300,000.  This must make our contribution of £37,000 look rather small when profits are made on that type of figure.  I hope that with the expansion of our commercial activities in the ACP countries we will not look on it as a purely commercial enterprise but that we will see that our contributions are also greatly enlarged.  We should not look for financial benefit only.  Our contributions should be given for the purpose for which Lomé was originally intended, improving the economies of the less well off people in the world.</P>
    <P>The Minister underlined the value of the consultative assembly set up between the ACP countries and the EEC to give practical effect to the terms of agreement and to see that those terms are carried out fairly on both sides.  I am one of the delegates from the EEC Parliament to this consultative assembly.  I can assure the Minister that members of the consultative assembly will ensure that their demands are heard loudly in that assembly.  I hope their position will be considered when the Council of Ministers meet to consider their demands.</P>
    <P>There are practical difficulties in the assembly.  There are only nine EEC countries and with the accession of the additional members there are over 50 of the others so that in order to have a proper balance of membership this will require a large number of members from the EEC Parliament or else certain countries of the ACP will need to enter an agreement only to send one or two members from a group in their countries.  I do not think this is acceptable to the ACP.  This means that the assembly is not working to the satisfaction <Col N="279" /> of either side since the membership on one side is out of all proportion to the other.  The debates are thus inclined to be lopsided with a great number of contributions coming from the ACP and with the demands made on the members of the European Parliament, their numbers are even more limited.  That is one difficulty with the assembly.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty which those of us who are members of democratic parliaments are strongly aware of is that many of those countries are not democratic states.  Many of their representatives are from dictatorships.  One wonders if they are speaking for the people of their countries.  This assembly, despite what I have said about it, is performing a useful function.  I hope that we will be able to improve the situation in those countries and bring about a desire for a democratic structure in the countries involved.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Minister of our support when he introduces measures which are designed to increase the amount of aid to the Third World.  The Labour Party look forward to him demanding additional money from the Minister for Finance for aid for Third World countries not just within the African, Caribbean and Indian Ocean areas but in any part of the world where there is deprivation and where we can do useful work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the House for the response which I anticipated we would get to those motions because there is a tripartisanship in the House at this stage.  There must be a continuing tripartisanship in regard to our obligations to developing countries.  In my introductory remarks I went into greater detail than I might have been expected to in explaining the background and the purpose of the Lomé Convention.  I did this particularly for new Deputies who may have an opportunity of seeing how the House discharges its obligations through the European Community and through the Lomé Convention, which was negotiated by the Community with the ACP States.  I hope it will be <Col N="280" /> of benefit to them as a reference to how we discharge our responsibility through Community membership.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Ryan pointed out, our obligations in relation to development aid go further than that.  We have two bilateral aid programmes.  I do not intend to go into any great detail about this.  I want to make a few remarks in clarification of some of the matters which came up.  I appreciated Deputy Kavanagh's comments on the operation of the consultative assembly.  This is one of the advantages of having in our Parliament people who are serving in the European Parliament and through it in an assembly, such as the consultative assembly set up under Lomé.  I have taken note of what Deputy Kavanagh said.  I am sure that he knows when one is dealing with a range of states with such widely different backgrounds, historical traditions and different trends in their administration it is difficult to apply our standards to them.</P>
      <P>The Community has to keep in mind in its relations with the developing countries that we cannot assume that we can impose our democratic standards on the countries with whom we are co-operating.  The basis of the Lomé Convention is co-operation.  They resist judgment by us on them for being less than democratic according to our standards.  This is very much in the mind of the Community at the moment, not in regard to dictating to the states with whom we co-operate but perhaps in Lomé 2, which is due for negotiation in two years' time, we may begin to take it a stage further and try to guarantee what is the concern of all people around the world, the fundamental dignity and right of the individuals in the states to which those loans and aids are being applied. It is a delicate but also very important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be glad to receive further information and suggestions from Deputy Kavanagh and Deputy Nolan who serves with him on the consultative assembly with regard to how we can begin to analyse this problem and how we can solve it.  Ireland is different&mdash;this arises from what Deputy <Col N="281" /> Ryan said&mdash;from the rest of the Community in that we, unlike the rest of the Community states, with the exception of Luxembourg, do not have a colonial past.  We share, therefore, in our history the experiences of many of those countries with whom we are co-operating. We obviously have a degree of goodwill from them towards us. There is, therefore, an obligation on us to use that not alone to our own advantage but to the advantage of the developing states and the Community to which we belong.</P>
    <P>Sometimes regional groups of states tend to look on each other as blocs, such as an African, Asian or European group of nations, and to take a certain view of the others from a long distance.  Those of us within certain regional groups, as we are within the European Community, who have much in common with many of the states of the other regional groups, whether they be African or Asian, have an opportunity and an obligation to reach out and establish the common ground we have so that we can break down the divisions of mistrust that exist between these countries and the developed world.  These divisions are lessening but they are still there.</P>
    <P>I mention in passing that one of the most humbling experiences I have had and ever expect to have was when the Foreign Minister of one of the African states came to me during the course of my recent visit to the United Nations. He sought an interview with me and the only purpose was to thank me and the Irish people and to explain to the people through me what is being done with the assistance we have given.  This is a measure of the goodwill that is there and I could only say to him, as I would to others like him, that we are glad of the opportunity to co-operate with such countries.  The extent to which they find our technical advice helpful is a matter of deep satisfaction to us.</P>
    <P>In that connection, Ireland has another special advantage which I have discussed with Commissioner Cheysson, who is in charge of the development programme in the European Community.  Let us acknowledge <Col N="282" /> that in this terminology we are a developed and wealthy country, as Deputy Ryan has highlighted.  We are none-theless at a stage of intermediate development. We are close enough to the point when we can still remember when development really got under way.  To the extent that this has been achieved in our own lifetime we can see more readily the problems of the developing world, the lack of expertise and of capital resources.  We are in a special position to be able to help those countries who are now experiencing the problems we faced 25 or 30 years ago and Commissioner Cheysson has taken note of this.  Our semi-State agencies played a big role in the development of the Irish economy under whatever Government were in power and they are uniquely placed to make a contribution to the programmes of the developing world. I am glad to say that they are doing just that.</P>
    <P>We can make two unique contributions through our semi-State agencies and through our tradition of personnal service.  Let us recognise the reality that we will never be able to apply huge resources to any great effect in any one country but we can concentrate on some countries, particularly those with the greatest problems, and apply our resources selectively, as we are doing at the moment, and we can offer the services of our personnel either on a voluntary basis or through the semi-State agencies.  We can maximise on the good they can do and the goodwill they can build between us.  This goodwill can be established through us with the European Community and with the African or Pacific states through them.  Obviously this is a two-way thing.  By helping each other we can look forward to greater co-operation and greater benefit in the future.  Deputy Ryan is quite right.  I know he was not taking issue with me on the use of the word &ldquo;debate&rdquo;.  There is no doubt about our interdependence.  This is absolutely accepted.  The western world could not survive as a producer region unless it were to encourage other regions to be effective consumers.  If only for selfish reasons, there is a degree of interdependence. Obviously there is co-operation. <Col N="283" /> At our stage of intermediate development we are expecting to maximise on the opportunity we get from Lomé through consultancy contracts for appropriately qualified firms.</P>
    <P>I will clarify a point for Deputy Kavanagh.  The extra contribution that we will make as a result of the accession of these three countries is £37,000. Our total contribution to Lomé, which may be called up over an eight year period, is of the order of £12.3 million at current exchange rates.  In those terms the amount that has come back to us in consultancy contracts is not excessive.</P>
    <P>One of the problems which Ireland faces is that it is the developing country which decides and selects the consultancy firms from a list supplied by the Commission.  Most of these countries were former colonial states of France, Britain or the Netherlands and because we have no direct historical association with them our consultancy firms do not immediately occur to them as the ones they would engage.  Secondly, we do not have the range of diplomatic representations throughout Africa or the Pacific countries that other countries have. This is something that the Government are determined to overcome by looking at our diplomatic representation throughout this area for reasons of mutual benefit and interest.  I am happy with the assurances from Commissioner Cheysson that they will try to maintain a reasonable quota basis between the countries operating Lomé. We look forward to further opportunities for Irish firms to take part in this process over the next few years.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to where we may go from here.  The next stage is obviously Lomé 2, which will come up for negotiation very soon.  The problem is not just the transfer of resources; it is to do with training people to help themselves and with technological development.  Lomé 2 will have to pay attention to this.  Lomé 1 was unique.  It was a great breakthrough in that it did show a great concern by a group of nations.  It was simply discharging a debt, let us acknowledge it, by paying back what had been enjoyed <Col N="284" /> for hundreds of years.  The next stage is to help these countries, particularly through technological aid, to develop their own resources to meet the new world economic order.  A community of interest must be brought about between Europe and any other group of nations and these states so that they will not see themselves as part of a bargaining group, but rather as part of a community of nations that are interdependent. At the next stage I hope that we will begin to see a further strengthening of that awareness which is well under way as a result of Lomé.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for the response that has been given to this motion and for the fact that I can expect the same kind of response on any similar occasion.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is, briefly, to empower the Minister for Finance to make further capital moneys up to a limit of £350 million available for the development of the telephone service.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the telephone service is broadly of two kinds.  One is expenditure on the day-to-day operation of the service and on the maintenance, upkeep and renewal of existing plant.  This expenditure, which is normally more than balanced by telephone revenues paid into the Exchequer, is met out of moneys voted annually by this House.  The second kind of expenditure is capital spent, or rather invested, on telephone development works such as the provision of new telephone exchanges, trunk routes, underground cables, extension of existing plant and the installation of telephones, for subscribers.  The moneys required for these works are not voted year by year.  They are made available under the authority of Telephone Capital Acts which normally provide for requirements for about five years ahead.</P>
      <P>Telephone Capital Acts do not sanction expenditure; they are enabling Acts empowering the Minister for Finance to make issues out of the Central Fund for telephone development. They also authorise him to borrow for that purpose.  The issues are made to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on foot of annual capital works estimates approved by the Minister for Finance.  Capital and interest are repaid by annuities extending over a period of 25 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Telephone Capital Bill follows 12 previous Bills enacted since 1922 to maintain the flow of capital for telephone development.  Its provisions, apart from the amount of <Col N="286" /> advances provided for, namely, £350 million and some purely drafting amendments, are similar to those of the last Bill, passed in 1973, which provided for advances of £175 million. This latter sum represented the then estimated cost of meeting capital requirements during the period from mid-1973 to mid-1978.  Advances already made under the 1973 Act have amounted to some £158 million.  The balance remaining under the Act will not be sufficient to complete this year's investment programme.  The need for a new Act now, instead of next year, is primarily due to the high rate of inflation experienced since 1973 which have effectively reduced the value of the £175 million to an estimated £126 million in 1973 money terms.</P>
    <P>The £158 million already drawn has been spent as follows:&mdash;subscribers installations and local distribution plant £67 million; new exchange equipment £44 million; trunk system &mdash;circuits and switching equipment £34 million; buildings, sites and miscellaneous £13 million.</P>
    <P>The total number of exchange lines in service was increased by 104,000 during the period.  The local distribution network throughout the country, comprising mostly underground ducting and cabling in built-up areas and overhead cabling elsewhere, was considerably expanded.</P>
    <P>Some 670 telephone kiosks were erected during the period.</P>
    <P>Sixty-three new automatic exchanges were brought into service including those at Castlebar, Cavan, Clonmel, Dungarvan, Fermoy, Monaghan and Thurles in provincial areas.  A number of major exchanges in Dublin including those at Beggars Bush, GPO, Tallaght, Santry, Crown Alley and the new International Telephone Exchange at Marlboro Street were also brought into operation.  Most other automatic exchanges were extended.</P>
    <P>The quantities of equipment installed in automatic exchanges for connecting subscribers' exchange lines were increased by 56 per cent as compared with an increase of 39 per cent in working lines.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> About 10,000 extra trunk circuits were added to the system and additional trunk equipment was provided at numerous centres, the largest installation being a new trunk exchange at Dame Court, Dublin.  International Subscriber Dialling was made available in the Dublin (01) and Shannon areas to some 21 countries, mostly in Western Europe and North America.  Direct dialling was also extended to major cities in Britain from Dublin and the chief provincial centres.  The number of international circuits, not including those to Britain, was increased more than fourfold.</P>
    <P>New telephone buildings and extensions to existing telephone buildings were completed in about 200 centres.</P>
    <P>Because of the integrated nature of the telephone system the full benefits of many schemes already completed will not become evident until complementary works have been carried out. Numerous main and complementary projects are in progress on which heavy expenditure has been incurred but which will not be completed for periods up to some years ahead.</P>
    <P>While much has been done over the years to expand and improve the service, it is clear that much remains to be done.  I need only refer to the long waiting list for telephones and the service difficulties that still exist.  Comparisons of our general state of telephone development with that of our partners in the EEC are still very unfavourable to us.</P>
    <P>The telephone density in Ireland now stands at 15 per 100 of the population. This figure is well below that of France which, with 27 telephones per 100, is the next lowest in this respect in the EEC.</P>
    <P>The percentage of telephones connected to automatic exchanges at 87 per cent appears high but the networks of most of our partners in the EEC are now 100 per cent automatic.  The other exception is France which is over 97 per cent automatic. We still have a large number, over 500, of small manual exchanges serving extensive areas throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to labour the inadequacies and deficiencies in the <Col N="288" /> service.  They are only too evident; commercial and industrial organisations rightly stress that they constitute a hindrance to efficiency and an obstacle to attracting new industry to the country.  They must therefore be remedied with all practicable speed.</P>
    <P>Before I proceed to what is proposed for the coming years, I wish to refer to some general aspects of the service. Telephone service is at present and is likely to remain for a long time ahead the most important form of telecommunication throughout the world because it satisfies a basic need for extension over distance of bothway word-of-mouth  communication between persons. Since it has to provide for this purpose huge numbers of communication channels within and between countries it has become the natural carrier for most of the other forms of telecommunication. A vast worldwide network of telecommunications is developing in which the telephone network is providing the channels for switched and leased lines for such services as television, data links between computers, telecopying and so on.  Some authorities foresee that in the long term electronic mail transmission will become a partial substitute for traditional mail.  In planning national networks it is of course necessary to ensure that they will be suitable to link with high quality installations abroad.  Modern telephone systems must therefore be provided to meet high international specifications and to satisfy growing technological needs often beyond purely telephone requirements.  This brings me to the magnitude of the investment required and to the time necessary to implement a programme of modernisation.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago the capital budget for telephones was £6 million approximately. For the current year it is £57 million and in this Bill we are providing for the probability that £350 million at current prices will be required during the next five years. Expenditure of this magnitude makes the telephone service one of the heaviest users of capital in the State.  The position of our telephone service in this respect is similar to that in other developing and highly-developed countries. In Britain, for instance, the <Col N="289" /> capital budget of the British Post Office for the current year for telecommunications&mdash;mostly telephones&mdash; is more than £1,000 million.</P>
    <P>It may well be asked whether a special all-out drive to solve the telephone problem would remedy our difficulties within a short time.  Unfortunately, the situation does not lend itself to spectacular progress.  Even for the most advanced system such as the Swedish and American, major schemes necessary for large-scale development have to be planned between five and 15 years ahead.  International experience has shown that it is virtually impossible in a democratic state to expand a national telephone service really quickly because of the inescapably long intervals between initial planning and physical completion of large numbers of related works involving site acquisition, buildings, manufacture and installation of plant, training of technical staff and so on.  An outstanding example in this regard has been the modernisation of the French telephone service.  The French PTT Administration began a succession of planned programmes in the 1960s to remedy as quickly as practicable the relatively undeveloped condition of their system. Intensive efforts have been in progress there for more than a decade but despite the advantage of a long engineering tradition and a telecommunications manufacturing industry it is only in the past few years that rapid momentum has been gained.  Investment in telecommunications, excluding broadcasting, in France in the current year is estimated at more than £2,000 million and for the period 1976 to 1980 £15,000 million.  These figures are a further indication of the massive size of the demands which the provision of a modern system makes on available capital.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the programme proposed for the next five years, the following are the main objectives:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Increase the annual rate of connections progressively from about 45,000 at present to 85,000; (2) Raise to 96 per cent the percentage of automatic telephones and provide for progress to full automatic as soon as possible; <Col N="290" /> (3) Further expand and improve the quality of service in order to attract and handle efficiently a high level of increase in traffic; (4) Make advance arrangements for the acquisition of sites, contracts for buildings and manufacture of equipment to provide for continuing progress in the years beyond 1982.</P>
    <P>This programme, which is estimated to cost £350 million, may be considered under the following heads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Subscribers' Installation and Local Network Development; Local Exchange Development; Trunk Development; Buildings; Miscellaneous.</P>
    <P>The amount estimated for the installation of subscribers' Telephones including provision of local underground and overhead plant is £135 million.</P>
    <P>The programme proposed in connection with the 1973 Act envisaged that a target of 460,000 subscribers' lines would be reached in 1978.  It has not been possible to speed the connection rate sufficiently to reach this figure, but on the basis of connection targets for this year and next a figure approaching 420,000 should be reached, leaving a shortfall of about 40,000.  This is roughly the number of applications on the waiting list at present.</P>
    <P>In the past three years effective annual demand has been between 36,000 and 39,000 despite the economic conditions.  This year there has been evidence of a rise in demand and, with recovery of the economy, demand in the years ahead can be expected to increase rapidly.</P>
    <P>Connections on the scale envisaged will bring the total number of exchange lines in service to around 575,000 by 1982 and the number of telephones to 775,000 representing a density of 23 per 100 population.</P>
    <P>To reach these figures it will be necessary to expand the subscriber underground and overhead plant network throughout the country very extensively. In doing so provision will be made for further rapid growth in the <Col N="291" /> years immediately following the current programme period.</P>
    <P>For local exchange development, the amount estimated is £70 million.  In order to meet demand for new subscribers' lines, 22 new automatic exchanges will be provided in the Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick automatic exchange areas and the equipment in virtually all other automatic exchange areas will be extended.</P>
    <P>It is planned to convert 270 manual exchanges to automatic working.  This includes provision of a major automanual exchange at Letterkenny&mdash;at present in progress&mdash;which will complete the planned number of automanual centres.  Some 330,000 extra automatic exchange line terminations will be installed in automatic exchanges.</P>
    <P>For trunk development the amount estimated is £110 million.  The capacity of the trunk network will be greatly increased and large-scale extensions will be made to the trunk system serving most major centres including Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Wexford, Navan, Portlaoise, Carlow, Cavan, Ceannanus Mór, Drogheda, Mullingar, Sligo and Athlone. In total it is planned to bring more than 22,000 additional trunk circuits into service.  A number of major new trunk routes will be provided. These will include a microwave link to Britain over the Irish Sea between the Dublin and the Welsh mountains.  New microwave systems will also serve the Waterford, Enniscorthy, Arklow, Wicklow, Sligo, Castlebar, Ballinrobe, Tuam, Galway and Letterkenny areas.  The capacity of the western co-axial cable will be increased from 960 circuits to 2,700 circuits and new trunk cables will be provided to serve Manorhamilton, Edenderry, Belmullet, Kanturk, Achill, Killybegs, Clones, Baltinglass, Midleton, Macroom, Bantry, Dingle, Athboy, Gort, Scariff, Banagher and Bridgend.  Major extensions of trunk exchanges will be carried out at key centres in the network including Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Sligo, Dundalk, Drogheda, Tralee, Athlone, Mullingar, Portlaoise, Naas and Wicklow.  The buildings <Col N="292" /> for some of these are being erected at present.</P>
    <P>Automatic dialling facilities to Belfast, London, Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester areas, which have recently been made available in Dublin and certain large provincial centres, will be extended progressively to all automatic exchanges during the next 12 months.  Further extensions will be made as quickly as they can be arranged with the British Post Office.</P>
    <P>In the course of the next two years subscribers in eight large provincial centres will be provided with the facility for dialling calls direct to most European and North American countries. The facility will be extended progressively to other centres as quickly as practicable.</P>
    <P>International telephone call traffic has continued to grow rapidly in recent years.  In order to cater for further growth of calls, substantial additions to the international exchange equipment will be made.</P>
    <P>The sum estimated for buildings is £28 million.  The availability of adequate accommodation in good time is a basic essential for rapid development of the telephone service. Difficulties in acquiring sites and in having buildings erected quickly have in the past been a main cause of slowing telephone development.</P>
    <P>The provision of new buildings or extensions of existing buildings to house telephone equipment and/or staff are already in hand or planned at more than 260 centres.  Major new buildings will be provided in the Dublin 01 Area at Ballyboden, Clondalkin, Dolphin's Barn, Lucan, Palmerstown, Sandyford, and Terenure. Outside Dublin the centres will include Athlone, Carrick-on-Shannon, Donegal, Drogheda, Ennis, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, Navan, Cork, Sligo, Tralee, Tuam, Waterford and Westport.  The new automanual exchange and District Telecommunications Headquarters building being erected at Churchfield, Cork, will be the biggest telecommunications building project yet undertaken in the State.</P>
    <P>For miscellaneous items the amount estimated is £7 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="293" /> A small number of STD coinboxes have been in experimental use in selected public call offices in Dublin and provincial areas for some time with satisfactory results.  During the next five years it is planned to replace existing boxes with STD boxes on an extensive scale, commencing with the public boxes which are most used for trunk calls.</P>
    <P>There are at present more than 35,000 coinbox telephones in the country, including about 3,000 public telephones&mdash;kiosks and call offices&mdash;which account for 35 per cent of all operator controlled trunk calls.  As the telephone system moves towards fully automatic working, replacement of the existing coinbox&mdash;which requires the assistance of an operator for trunk calls&mdash;becomes of increasing importance in order that the benefits of automatic working to users can be secured fully.</P>
    <P>Policy in regard to kiosks has been that they are provided only where they are considered likely to pay their way and existing facilities are regarded as not meeting reasonable need for public telephone facilities.  This policy still applies in urban areas.  In 1969, it was decided to undertake a programme for providing subsidised kiosks in rural areas by replacing call office telephones in rural post offices by outdoor kiosks with 24-hour service.  All but about 350 of the 2,000 odd call office telephones in rural post offices have been replaced by kiosks.  With few exceptions, the stage has now been reached where kiosks provided in replacement of the remaining call offices would be unlikely to pay their way even with a very substantial subsidy.</P>
    <P>A scheme whereby local authorities may have kiosks provided at their request under guarantee against loss in areas where the Department considers them unlikely to pay their way is also in operation.  About 100 kiosks have been provided under this scheme, mainly in areas where there is no post office and accordingly no public telephone. I am having an examination made of the present arrangements for <Col N="294" /> providing rural kiosks to see whether they can be improved.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to convert the larger Government manual private branch exchanges to automatic working.  This will improve the service given and reduce operating costs.</P>
    <P>Growth in the volume of international call traffic will warrant provision of a satellite earth station during the next decade.  A site and radio interference study to identify technically suitable locations has been commissioned. It is expected that some costs of providing the station will be incurred in the period of the proposed programme.</P>
    <P>The feasibility of introducing a mobile public radio telephone service enabling calls to be dialled between vehicles and the public telephone system is being examined both from the technical viewpoint and in relation to the likely extent of demand for such a service.  While the main emphasis in use of resources must be on meeting more basic needs, it is hoped within the next programme period to commence arrangements for the introduction of a mobile radio telephone service.</P>
    <P>As previously mentioned, the telephone network provides the transmission channels for various other services, such as data transmission, telex, television and facsimile transmission.  At present an extensive programme is in progress for replacement and extension of microwave links for television; and the use of microwave links for special purposes such as offshore communications is likely to increase considerably in future years.  Equipment for data transmission &mdash; between computers &mdash; over telephone lines is supplied by the Department on a rental basis; the demand for this service is expected to grow rapidly with the accelerated development of multiple access computer networks.</P>
    <P>At present the most modern switching equipment in widespread use among telephone administrations is the electro-mechanical crossbar common control type.  About 75 per cent of automatic switching equipment in this country is crossbar, the remainder <Col N="295" /> being the older Strowger (step-by-step) equipment.  In recent years the advanced manufacturing countries have made much progress in the design and production of electronic exchanges.  It is clear that these will be the exchanges of the future.  They are most compact, require less maintenance and offer the possibility of giving subscribers a wider range of facilities. Although many electronic exchanges are already in use abroad, there is not yet clear evidence which designs will prove most satisfactory.  It is likely that within the next few years an electronic exchange will be purchased on a trial basis for use in this country.  However, a first requirement here, as elsewhere, is that the electronic exchange shall interwork with the electro-mechanical exchanges already in service.  A feature of telephone systems everywhere, and especially in the most highly developed countries, is that investment is so enormous that no administration will scrap its existing equipment in favour of new designs even if substantially more attractive.  An instance of this is that Strowger type exchange equipment which the Department discontinued purchasing&mdash;except for extension of existing exchanges&mdash;in 1962 is still in use throughout the world, and in Britain forms 80 per cent of the network.</P>
    <P>Turning to the general financial position of the telephone service, I would like initially to emphasise that despite losses in recent years the service is basically a remunerative one. Over a period investment in the telephone system is fully paid for by the users of the service.  Moreover, an appreciable part of the capital invested comes from within the service.  Of the £350 million required for the next programme it is estimated that £120 million will be financed by depreciation provisions.  Over the past few years the telephone service has secured loans amounting to over £50 million from the European Investment Bank.  More recently grants from the European Regional Development Fund of over £6 million have been approved for telephone projects.</P>
    <P>For almost 40 years until the 1971-72 <Col N="296" /> financial year the telephone service operated at a profit.  The period of the 1973 Act has been one of exceptional difficulty for the finances of the service, due to the concurrent incidence of high inflation, high interest rates and economic recession.  The first two of these factors combined to raise the cost of the service sharply and the third depressed growth of traffic and prevented the higher costs being offset by the additional revenue the traffic would have brought.  A programme of rapid expansion in a capital intensive service such as telephones normally results in fall-off in profit or even in temporary loss.  Plant and equipment for the needs of an enlarged system have to be provided some time in advance of being brought into use and to that extent a burden is imposed on the revenue of the service.  Under stable conditions profit would recover within a relatively short period of time with the growth in traffic.</P>
    <P>Costs increased overall by almost 150 per cent from £34.4 million in 1973-74 to an estimated £85.6 million in 1977, some £34 million of the increase being attributable to the effects of inflation. Telephone charges were increased in the same period but because of the difficult economic conditions growth of call traffic was below normal levels. The loss for the current year after deduction of interest and depreciation charges is estimated at £7.6 million.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the service will revert to its traditional profit-earning position within the period of the programme proposed.  Call traffic will grow more rapidly with the return of more favourable economic conditions.  Moreover, the more rapid addition of subscriber lines, as well as yielding extra revenue from connection and rental charges, will increase call revenue. Another important benefit of the programme is the substantial extra employment it will generate.  The telephone service gives employment at present in the Department to 13,000 people and indirectly to about 2,000 employed by contractors who erect exchange buildings, manufacture and install equipment, supply and lay ducts and cables, and so on.  It is estimated that the new programme will give rise <Col N="297" /> to a total of about 7,000 extra jobs overall.  A high proportion of the jobs will be on skilled or semi-skilled work by graduates, technicians, tradesmen and other staff.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, as this is my first opportunity to do so, I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Minister for Tourism and Transport.  I have no doubt that he will be as efficient a Minister as he was while he was a member of the Government prior to the formation of the Coalition Government.  I got nothing but courtesy and help from him at Question Time or by way of general debate.  At Question Time he was not reluctant to give the fullest information he could when asked by way of parliamentary question.  I assure him that as far as I am concerned, while I will be incisive in the question I will put to him, I will give him the utmost help and co-operation that I can.  There cannot be much controversy about Posts and Telegraphs and particularly on the difficulties and problems we have in regard to the installation of telephones.</P>
      <P>We welcome the introduction of this Bill.  As the Minister has explained, and as described on the Order Paper, it is a Bill which was introduced by the former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and which is now being accepted and, we hope, will be implemented by the Government.  The Bill is quite a short one with three or four sections which merely refer to the amounts that are to be devoted to capital development for telephones. The Minister has given a good deal of information in a fairly long speech and the House should be grateful for the detailed proposals put forward.  It is difficult to absorb them having heard or read them for the first time, and I have no doubt that Deputies from the various areas will be questioning him on progress or lack of progress in respect of the areas that are to be developed in the telephone service and the other things that are to be done as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note the Minister's comment that as a result of this Bill and the expenditure <Col N="298" /> mentioned there will be an additional 7,000 new jobs.  I trust the Minister and the Government will not take credit for that and regard it as part of their job-creation programme. This is a measure that was introduced by the last Government and was associated with the creation of jobs as well.  While this job creation is to be welcomed very much, I hope the technicians who will be required will be available and will be trained to do this job if they are not already trained. The former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was subject to much questioning by the then Opposition on the lack of progress.  However, the Minister, Deputy Faulkner, has acknowledged in his speech, although not in a specific way, that much progress was made during the period 1973 to 1974, and these proposals also came from the former Minister.  People generally do not appreciate the amount of money that must go into the telephone service.  Many people are impatient that they do not get telephones on demand.  I am sure there is a priority list and that Deputies know it in broad terms, but it would be useful if much more publicity were given to the priority list so that people would understand where they are in the queue for applications for telephones.</P>
    <P>We are not at the top of the league as far as telephones per 100 of the population are concerned, but it greatly taxes the resources of a developing country like ours to have to provide that sort of money, whether it comes from borrowing or from some other source.  This, as the Minister said, is a telephone age as far as communications are concerned, and it will continue so for a long time to come.  Therefore, we should be prepared to make financial sacrifices in order to see that the money is provided for telephones.  It is important to people in industry, commerce and trade, many of whom have been seeking phones or extra phones which cannot be supplied, with consequent disruption of their businesses.  I suppose as far as priority is concerned they would be in the front line with professional people, especially the medical profession.  The Minister has been kind enough to give us the details <Col N="299" /> in regard to the £350 million to be spent over the next five years.  It is an ambitious and a very commendable programme and one that will have the support not alone of this House but of the public.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that a condition for the establishment of a kiosk in any area is that the telephone kiosk should pay for itself.  That has been the policy of Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs ever since I came into this House, and that is not today or yesterday. There is another aspect to this, particularly in new housing areas. While a kiosk may not be able to pay its way, it is a social amenity that is very much required in these areas.  In many provincial towns and some of the smaller cities people have to walk long distances to have a telephone available to them.  The Minister might &mdash;and perhaps he and his Department do&mdash;take into consideration factors such as I have mentioned and decide that while a kiosk might not be able to pay for itself it should be provided as a social service in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the situation which is not debatable here tonight, that is, vandalism.  Most of us have travelled abroad, and it is amazing to me that the kiosks in many other countries are absolutely undamaged and in the same condition as when they were first built.  Unfortunately in this country it seems to be some sort of occupation to not alone break the telephones and the other equipment in the kiosk but break the windows as well.  Repairing these kiosks must entail a huge bill for the Department.  It would be interesting to discover the cost of the damage done to these kiosks over a given period.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this is a matter for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs or not, but in some statements after the issue of their manifesto&mdash;whether it was in the manifesto or not I do not remember&mdash;Fianna Fáil promised that phones would be provided for pensioners who were living alone.  That is very laudable. The full cost of the telephone would not be paid; the proposal was that the rental of the telephone be paid, which <Col N="300" /> is a very good contribution indeed. Perhaps the Minister has some information about the timing of this proposal and whether it is to be concentrated in a particular area or applied to the whole country.  He might let us know what the bill for this social amenity to these deserving people will be.</P>
    <P>There is not much more I can say about these proposals, because they are the proposals of the last Government. We endorse them, and the Labour Party will support the Minister in his efforts to ensure that the programme he has announced will be effected during the period while he is Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to belabour the inadequacies and inefficiencies of the telephone service.  Neither do I wish to bore the House with a litany of the defects, and of the complaints and requests being received by Deputies. Like the Minister, I prefer to avail myself of this opportunity to recall the vital importance of an effective, efficient and modern communications network in a small country like this on the periphery of Europe, which is still undeveloped and where there are vast <Col N="301" /> problems such as unemployment.  The lifeblood of our economy depends on our export trade.</P>
    <P>The Minister's introductory speech brings home to us in a very dramatic manner the remarkable story of the growth and development of the telephone service here since the State was founded.  The Minister very generously, though perhaps indirectly, referred to the remarkable development since the last Telephone Bill was introduced in 1973.  He mentioned that the financial provisions of the 1973 Act have now been proved to have been inadequate because of the insidious inflationary spiral that has hit us and that, therefore, new financial provisions are necessary.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, between 1973 and today, as the Minister has indicated, remarkable progress has been made in improving the telephone service through the installation of new, more sophisticated, equipment.  It is only right that I should avail of this opportunity to give credit where it is due and to pay tribute to my former colleague, Dr. Cruise-O'Brien, who was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs during that period and who devoted such considerable time and energy to the provision of the necessary finance and to its expenditure.  We find that the total number of exchange lines in service was increased by 104,000 and that 670 telephone kiosks were erected. Most significant of all has been the fact that 63 new automatic exchanges were brought into service at such places as Castlebar, Clonmel, Dungarvan, Fermoy, Monaghan, Thurles and other areas.</P>
    <P>In the 16 years I have been in the House I have heard various Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs refer to the importance of communications, to the importance of an efficient telephone service to the whole life of the nation. I recall in particular the distinguished former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and former President of Ireland, the late Erskine Childers, and his particular feeling for technological subjects, particularly telecommunications. Successive Governments have made efforts to ensure that we would have a modern and efficient telephone <Col N="302" /> service.  It is something that is easier said than done because there is no magic formula which will give us a modern telephone service in a short space of time.</P>
    <P>Tonight the Minister pointed out that the provision of a sophisticated telephone network is a long-term process. Long-term planning is essential and I sincerely hope that the Minister, being equipped through the machinery of this Bill with the finance to implement the five-year programme he announced, will pay particular attention to forward planning.  I am pleased that he is conscious of the need for such planning.  The acquisition of sites, the erection of buildings and the installation of sophisticated equipment, are by their very nature long-term projects.  At a time when the new Government have committed themselves to the solution of unemployment, when a new Department of Economic Planning and Development has been established with a Minister given special responsibility for the functions of that Department, special attention must be focussed on the need for a first class telephone service. Failure to take the necessary steps to provide a modern communications network means that any such programme of national economic development is doomed.</P>
    <P>The Minister shared the privilege with me of spending a number of years in charge of Roinn na Gaeltachta. Just as I did, the Minister during that period endeavoured to promote economic development to provide employment in those regions, and he should, therefore, be conscious of the vital importance of a proper telephone service in the remote regions.  In the past four years I tried to persuade industrialists to establish themselves in Gaeltacht regions.  Having brought industrialists from abroad and having gone to the expense of providing factories for them, we found they were unable to get telephone connections at the proper time and this caused considerable frustration and annoyance and did not help to sell those regions to potential industrial employers. I recall being on a promotional tour of Germany three years ago.  One industrialist whom we <Col N="303" /> signed up at that time subsequently located an industry in Donegal and it was several months afterwards before the telephone service was connected to his factory.  If we are serious about economic planning at national as well as regional level we must ensure that we will have an effective communications network.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this Bill is vitally important from the point of view of the creation of additional employment. The Minister referred to the new jobs which will be generated through the implementation of this programme.  He mentioned something like 7,000.  It is of paramount importance that the equipment and goods&mdash;they are, I think, referred to as stores&mdash;should be manufactured, built and assembled at home.  I do not expect the Minister to be able to tell me now but I would like him by way of letter or otherwise later to inform me what percentage of the total equipment used in telecommunications is manufactured here.  Has there been progress in the manufacture of this equipment?  I am aware that a number of highly technological modern industries have been established here and some of these are engaged in manufacturing telecommunications equipment.  It would contribute towards the creation of new employment if special efforts were made to ensure that the greater part of the equipment required will be manufactured here.  There is one major telecommunications industry, of which the Minister will be aware from his time as Parliamentary Secretary, with a factory in Dublin, another in Donegal and a third in Inishmore which manufactures telecommunications equpiment used by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It also has a substantial export business to 14 or 15 different countries.  I hope the Minister will ensure that in the expenditure of this huge sum emphasis will be laid on creating new employment directly and indirectly.  Above all, special efforts must be made to ensure that the greater part of the equipment will be manufactured here.</P>
    <P>The Bill outlines the progress that has been made and the programme <Col N="304" /> for the next five years.  He referred to increasing the annual rate of connection progressively from 45,000 to 85,000.  This is an ambitious target and I sincerely hope it will be achieved.  He also referred to raising to 96 per cent the percentage of automatic telephones and the hope that progress towards full automation will take place as soon as possible.  He referred to expanding the service.  May I suggest that the real difficulty arises in subsection (4), making advance arrangements for the acquisition of sites, contracts for buildings and manufacture of equipment to provide for continuing progress in the years beyond 1982.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the utilisation of the telephone network in computer data and so forth.  I have seen this in operation and it is quite fascinating. He talks about the growth in the volume of international traffic and says that this will warrant the provision of an earth station during the next decade.  There is talk about mobile radio and television services and the application of electronics to the streamlining of our telephone system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  The importance of developing our communications system cannot be overemphasised. We are a small exporting country very largely dependent on building up communications with people outside and there is obviously a need to develop a network which will serve the country.  This Bill provides for the expenditure of £350 million over the next five years.  By comparison with our EEC partners we are in a very bad position.  The lowest telephone density in France, for example, is twice <Col N="305" /> what we have here.  We must bend our energies to developing our communications service to the point at which it will enhance our prospects of getting further industrial development here as well as maintaining what we already have.  Doubling the annual rate of connection is a laudable target.  We find ourselves daily being approached by people who are anxious to obtain the telephone service and so we wish the Minister well in his aim.</P>
      <P>There is one difficulty.  I am aware of small business people or small industrialists who have experienced quite extraordinary frustration in their efforts to obtain telephones.  I understand that they must have eight or ten people employed before they can obtain a telephone service. This seems to me to be too high a number because most of these people would not have that number employed initially and would not have any prospect of achieving that number unless they could obtain a telephone service.  I would like the Minister to look into that to see if the regulation is too harsh.  We are trying to encourage initiative and provide the best incentive possible to people to provide jobs.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that such people are not handicapped in the way I think they are at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's statement said that the capacity of the trunk network would be greatly increased and that large scale extensions would be made to the trunk systems serving most major centres including Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Wexford, Galway, Navan, Portlaoise and so on.  I mention this because five years ago I was assured here that the automatic exchange for Roscrea would become a reality within two or three years.  Over the past 12 months certain developments have taken place in Roscrea towards the building up of the network for the automatic system and it was envisaged that it would be operating by the middle of next year.  Recently it was discovered that the Portlaoise network would not now be able to cope with the enlarged operation which would evolve from the Roscrea development. As a consequence engineering work, <Col N="306" /> which may take up to two years, has to be considered for the Portlaoise plan.  I mention this so as to assist the Minister in whatever investigations have to be carried out so that other towns anticipating provision of automatic exchanges, whose business and industrial organisations have been pointing out the deficiencies of the existing system and saying that the prospects of getting new industries have been frustrated in some way by the inadequacies of the system, would not be in the position of having developed an exchange to the point which has now been reached in Roscrea and of being told then that the automatic system cannot operate because the existing facilities cannot absorb the extra automatic exchange and that they will have to wait a further two or three years.</P>
    <P>I know that the telephonists, the administrative and engineering staff in Roscrea, with an outdated system, have been doing great work and they are disappointed at the report which recently came from the Department indicating that extra work must be carried out in Portlaoise.  This is regrettable. While it is naturally included in the list of centres where the trunk network and other extensions have to be provided, it is still regrettable and the delay will cause great hardship to business people in Roscrea and its environs.</P>
    <P>I am not certain that the practice over the past couple of years of transferring to the county councils the task of providing telephone kiosks in rural areas where there is no post office is working advantageously.  The report indicates that about 100 of these kiosks have been provided but that is quite a small number when one takes the whole country into account.  Many counties have provided no telephones under this system.  The Minister should reconsider this to see if any isolated areas without sub-post offices could have this communication service laid on which is so essential particularly in outlying areas where people may require medical, veterinary or other services many miles distant from them. In recent times, particularly in some built-up areas, a number of telephone <Col N="307" /> kiosks have suffered through vandalism and when one tries to avail of them one often finds the instrument is out of order, windows or doors are broken, coin boxes damaged and so on.  Could the Minister consider some way of combatting this perhaps by having a coin slot door system or some underground coin box which would make it less easy for vandals to destroy this service when it is so badly needed in certain areas.  We cannot afford to have such services vandalised and some effective steps must be taken to discourage or eliminate vandalism.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him well.  I hope the aims set out in this programme over the next five years will double the rate of connection and increase the number of automatic exchanges by nearly 100 per cent so that we can compare favourably with our EEC partners.  The fact that we will be able to employ an extra 7,000 people in the development of this service is welcome. Following that development other business and other developments will follow.  Therefore, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Progress to date and the problems facing us have been very clearly outlined in the Minister's statement.  As a new Deputy, I was surprised at the number of people with problems regarding delay in connection with telephones.  In passing, I can say that any inquiries or representations to the Minister or his Department are handled with the greatest courtesy, but that does not take from the problem of having 40,000 on the waiting list. Taking only representations from my own constituency, it seems very probable that a large proportion of those on the waiting list must be from rural areas.  If the Minister had any figures in that regard I should be interested to know the relative proportions on the waiting list as between town and country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rural areas need more and better lines of communication and their absence affects inevitably not only development of these areas and the establishment of industry but also the way <Col N="308" /> of life there.  It must be regarded as essential in the establishment of industry today, small or large&mdash;and small industry must not be overlooked&mdash;to have a proper telephone system and have telephones available for installation readily.  Lack of telephones must be restricting industrial development in rural areas.  In life on the farm today, with the huge amount of capital involved and the need to have communication access to marts, vets and so on, telephones are becoming more and more important.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from industry, agriculture and tourism in the remote areas, the whole way of life in the country could be improved for many people by the provision of a better telephone system.  I would suggest to the Minister, in so far as it is possible in the development of the telephone system, that a greater emphasis might be laid on dealing with people on the waiting list in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Another factor referred to earlier by Deputy Corish was the very good scheme announced in relation to the payment of the rental for certain old age pensioners.  It occurs to me that somebody who has not got a telephone cannot take advantage of this scheme. There are many pressures on the Minister but I wonder whether he might consider giving a certain priority to old age pensioners living alone who have applied for a telephone.  I know many of these people, some of them in poor health and, if they had a telephone which would allow them comparatively instant communication with their relatives, the doctor, the priest, and so on, it would be a great comfort to them in their old age.</P>
    <P>I suppose it all boils down to a problem of money.  I have one suggestion which may be of help to the Minister.  Some people might be prepared to pay a ground rent in addition to the rental.  I wonder whether priority could be given to them without taking anybody off the waiting list and by having additional people employed. There may be some people to whom a telephone is an essential who may be willing to pay perhaps quite a substantial sum of money, or a ground rent, to obtain priority.  This might be <Col N="309" /> a way of providing extra money, thereby extra employment and thereby dealing with this problem.  The system I have in mind is something on the lines of the ESB system.  When the ESB undertake a rural scheme, generally there is no capital charge, but where a single line has to be laid on there may be a capital charge or a ground rent.  The Minister might consider whether something of that order might go some way towards the solution of this problem,</P>
    <P>I also want to refer the Minister to the question of public telephone kiosks.  The Minister said they are provided where they are considered likely to pay their way.  That is the policy in the urban areas.  I wonder whether the provision of public telephone kiosks should be related solely to economics.  There may be new housing estates in urban areas from which a huge amount of revenue might not be generated, but in which there might not be any private telephones. Special consideration should be given to areas such as those.  The fact that the expected revenue would not be quite sufficient to cover the cost should not be a complete bar.  The Minister might bear this in mind in future policy in this regard.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the scheme whereby the local authorities may provide public kiosks.  I agree with the previous speaker that it appears this has not been so successful, with the result that demands in many rural areas have not been met. The fact that this scheme is in existence may be used in the future as an answer to these demands without meeting the needs.  Where people are living in areas remote from the telephone service, the Minister should look at this from a social point of view rather than from a completely economic point of view.  If the local authorities, obviously safeguarding their funds, are not willing, as apparently they have not been over-willing, to expend their money or give guarantees in this regard, the Department should consider the social necessity apart altogether from the economics of the situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="310" /> Generally, the Bill seems to be going along the right lines.  It is a question of how fast we can go.  I appreciate the Minister's difficulties.  I hope he will bear my remarks in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I also congratulate him on bringing in this Bill. I congratulate him, too, on doing what I expected from him.  Any credit due to the previous Minister was given to him.  It is typical of the Minister not to make a political football out of our telephone service.</P>
      <P>The telephone service is a very sore point in my area.  I put down questions to the previous Minister and he admitted the number of telephones provided in the west seemed to be lagging behind the number in any other area.  I should like somebody to tell me where the biggest proportion of telephones outstanding is.  Day in and day out in rural areas, people are coming to us looking for telephones. I agree with speakers who said we have come a long way.  Five years ago there were not the same number of people looking for telephones as there are today Nowadays business people and farmers need a telephone. People tell me they applied for a telephone three or four years ago and they still have not got one.</P>
      <P>I would not compliment anybody on spending money on our telephone service, If we are to modernise this State and keep in line with our partners in the EEC, and get industry into the country, we must have an adequate telephone service.  Gort in my area lost two factories, and an inadequate telephone service is one of our biggest obstacles in getting new industry. It might be wrong to refer to a backward part of Ireland.  We are not backward in the real sense of the word but we are geographically remote from the centre of communications, Dublin. We are a good distance away from the capital.  We need good communications, we need good roads, and we need a good telephone service.  Without those we cannot hope to get industry to come into these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="311" /> With regard to the need for telephone kiosks in rural areas, I do not agree with the system of selection operated by the Department.  At present a public telephone in a rural post office must be used quite often before officials of the Department will sanction the erection of a kiosk outside the office.  In this regard it should be remembered that rural post offices often form part of a local shop.  The public telephone is located there with the result that people are not anxious to hold a private conversation over that telephone.  Many people must travel up to a mile from the post office to avail of a private subscriber's telephone.  I agree with the previous speaker who expressed the view that it was not the duty of the county councils to subsidise the provision of telephone kiosks.  The social aspect should be borne in mind by the Department.  This problem should not be considered purely from the economic point of view.  It is socially desirable that all areas in rural Ireland have a proper telephone service.</P>
    <P>I would be obliged if the Minister would tell the House if people in rural Ireland must wait longer to have a telephone installed than those living in urban areas.  A friend of mine in this city told me that he was waiting two years before his telephone was installed but many people in rural areas must wait up to four years before they get a telephone.  Is it true that two years is the usual waiting period in urban areas?  It is vitally important that the telephone service be improved.  I lauded any improvements that took place in recent years in this service and I shall continue to do so.  I never make political statements here and I deal with legislation objectively.  I am aware that the demand for telephones has increased in recent years and for this reason I hope that the five year programme outlined by the Minister is carried out.  It is an ambitious programme but it is my wish that at the end of this Dáil we will not be saying that people who applied for a telephone five years previously had not been connected</P>
    <P>I hope that in five years time industrialists <Col N="312" /> will not be put off because the telephone service in any area is not up to date.  When industrialists inquire about facilities in an area and are told that the telephone service is not automatic they have second thoughts about starting an industry there.  Quite a number of areas are still operated by manual exchanges and I hope they will be replaced within the next five years. It is my wish that the telephone service will be 100 per cent automatic in that time.  I wish the Minister luck in his ambitious programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardFilgate" hpid="Mr. Filgate Mr. Filgate">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Filgate</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with other Deputies I should like to congratulate the Minister on the way he introduced this Bill.  Since I was elected the biggest problem that has confronted me is the telephone service.  Four or five years ago 9,000 or 10,000 people were on the waiting list for telephones but that number has jumped to more than 40,000.  Firstly, that is an indication of the demand for the service and, secondly, of our backward step into history.  The Minister is seeking to rectify that position.  He told us that he would not enumerate the problems involved and none of us would like to do that but some matters must be highlighted. The first problem relates to the absence of telephone kiosks in rural areas.  We must not allow the people of rural Ireland to be forgotten.  While some Members express the view that local authorities should not be asked to provide this service, I feel that most local authorities would be pleased to help the people of rural areas.  Many rural areas have been built up in the last ten years but those living there have no means of contacting a priest, a doctor or an ambulance.  The Department should see to it that such areas are given the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another problem in relation to the telephone service concerns the system whereby a coinbox is connected to a telephone in a private house.  Even though one pays a higher rental charge than the private subscriber, this is not a full service.  One cannot, for instance, put a call through to America.  One can make calls to Great Britain but to make a call to the United States one must go to a private phone.  I hope the Minister will investigate this matter.  I <Col N="313" /> assure the Minister of my co-operation in his efforts to bring this programme to fruition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. The Minister's proposal, an excellent one, should be copied by other Departments. It is important that Departments plan in advance.  The spending of £350 million is a formidable undertaking.  When exchanges are commissioned I recommend that installations be streamlined in order to cut down overheads.  Every effort should be made to make available lines productive as soon as possible after an exchange has been completed. There are many other ways in which economies can be effected, particularly in rural areas.  On occasions crews travel up to three miles from their base to instal one telephone but bypass applicants who live on the route. Because there is a rotation system these people may have to wait a further two or three years before they get a telephone connection.  Economies could be made and the service should be streamlined.  Where there is an abundance of connections available in an exchange I do not know why people who have made applications should not be connected.</P>
      <P>In this day and age farmers should have telephones because farming is one of our most important industries. One speaker said that there have to be so many people on a payroll before a business gets recognition.  What about the small shopkeeper or somebody who starts a small business?  He is prepared to pay for the telephone and should be given every consideration because he is contributing to the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with other speakers who said there should be more telephone kiosks not alone in the rural areas but also in built up areas.  In areas where sub-post offices have been closed no alternative public telephone facilities have been provided.  At the planning stage of a housing estate provision should be made for the installation of public telephones.  If the estate is finished responsibility for providing public telephones will fall between two <Col N="314" /> stools&mdash;the county council and the Department.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Department to coordinate efforts with county councils, corporations and the ESB in the laying of trunk lines.  If one service digs up a road to make repairs another service should not dig up the same part of the road.  I compliment the Minister on his foresight and wish him luck in this enterprise.</P>

      <P>Is main liom fáilte a chur roimh an Bhille seo a chuireann £350 milliúin ar fáil chun feabhas a chur ar an seirbhís telefóin.  Is tábhachtach an Bille é ó thaobh tráchtála, turasóireachta agus cúrsaí sóisialta.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh gach rath ar an Aire agus ar an obair thábhachtach seo atá le déanamh aige.</P>
      <P>Most of what I wanted to say on this Bill has already been said but as the points are important it is no harm to emphasise them.  This Bill is important from the point of view of industry, tourism and from the social point of view.  We all welcome this very big injection of capital into the telephone service.  We must admit that this service is one of the lifelines of the country which has badly needed an overhaul.  We have had many complaints from industrialists and people living in tourist areas because of the bad service.  With this injection of capital over the next five years I hope many of the headaches which have beset us will be cured.</P>
      <P>Many people referred to isolated areas.  We all welcome the fact that in future old age pensioners will no longer have to pay telephone rental charges. A telephone is vitally important for these people.  It will help them to keep in touch with their families, the local doctor, the local nurse and so on.  Many of us hope that rural areas will get more attention than they did in the past.  It should be remembered that the people in rural areas are taxpayers&mdash; as are the people in the built-up areas &mdash;and need this service.  The telephone is no longer a luxury and that should be remembered when improvements get under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies mentioned the long delay in installing telephones.  As <Col N="315" /> Deputy Callanan and others said, it often takes two, three or even four years to have a telephone installed. With this injection of capital I hope that grievance will be removed.</P>
    <P>It must also be remembered that as an island we are much more dependent on the telephone service than inland countries, especially when we want to keep in touch with the industrialists in England and the Continent who are flocking to our shores.  I am glad to note that our cross-channel and continental services have greatly improved. One Deputy had a grievance about the telephone service to America.  I do not make any calls to that country but as we have American industrialists here it is important that our telephone service to that country be improved.</P>
    <P>I was heartened to note from the end of the Minister's speech that this overhaul will create jobs.  When certain services are overhauled, they can lead to redundancies but, as I said, we are all heartened that jobs will be created in this case.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil mórán eile le rá agam.  Gúim rath Dé ar obair an Aire.  Is mian liom, leis, fáilte a chur roimhe agus aon rud a thugann sé faoi deineann sé go maith é.  Tá a fhios agam go ndéanfaidh sé &ldquo;job&rdquo; chomh maith anois agus a dhein sé nuair a bhí sé in a Aire Oideachais.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join with other speakers in extending a welcome to this Bill which will enable the Minister to tackle the enormous task which lies ahead of him, that is, the task of providing a telephone service for the growing number of applications he has to contend with from day to day.  The fact that we have a continuing increase in the number of telephone applications is an indication of the people's determination to change with the modern society in which we live.  This capital allocation will go some of the way towards meeting the demand for the telephone service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The growing importance of that service is a clear indication of people's total dependence on it as a means of communication.  It can be classified as a social amenity for the aged, for the sick or for invalids.  It can also be <Col N="316" /> classified as a life-line for modern industrial development.  It is in this field that I think the greatest need for the telephone service can be found.</P>
    <P>It was heartening to hear every speaker extend a welcome for this legislation and appealing for a speed up of the telephone service networks throughout the country.  Greater emphasis will have to be laid on providing a better service for the rural community.  Because of the high cost of motor transportation and other means of communication, the telephone service is the most economical means of communication for these people.</P>
    <P>The farmer has discovered that the telephone is important to his business because farming is no longer a way of life but a highly competitive profession and the farming community must keep pace with the new and changing situation in which they live. The availability of a telephone service is also important to the aged and the sick so that they can easily contact a doctor or the clergy when the need arises.  All these factors demonstrate the importance of the telephone service.</P>
    <P>Nobody has mentioned the possibility of relocating the telephone exchange areas.  The Mullingar exchange caters for part of County Meath, part of Offaly and part of Kildare with the result that the staff in Mullingar must travel by truck each day to get out to the areas where work must be carried out.  On average they spend about two or three hours a day going to and from work.  The Department cannot get the best possible service from the staff when they have to spend so much time travelling.  The exchanges should be relocated so as to ensure a better return for the time and capital spent. The men do not feel that they are fully employed sitting in trucks coming to and going from work and the need for change has been mentioned to me by them.  This is an area where I feel efficiency can be improved.  The telephone service is not purely a social service but is a service which will pay for itself and will generate capital over the years and <Col N="317" /> every possible effort should be made to increase its efficiency.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and his staff to make a special effort to install as many telephones as possible in the coming years.  I realise the problems that will arise; I realise that the exchanges must be provided and equipment must be purchased.  I re-echo the statements made earlier in regard to the utilisation of the maximum amount of home-made materials. Telephone receivers are being manufactured here and I ask the Minister why more of them are not being made available?  In view of the determination of the Government to create as many jobs as possible and to combat unemployment this area should be explored with a view to using more Irish manufactured equipment.  The use of Irish made materials is important in relation to job creation; it helps to create wealth and to retain capital, thereby generating more industrial activity.  I again ask the Minister to expedite the work and go some way towards relieving the huge volume of telephone applications we have on hands at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and I wish him the very best of luck in this very onerous office.  The telephone system as we know it has never been in such a mess as it is at the moment.  The service is inadequate to cope with the stresses under which it is being put at the moment.  It is extremely urgent that we not only expand the telephone system to extend the life line of the country but that we take immediate steps to improve the existing service which is deplorable.  One has only to try to make telephone calls from this House to experience difficulties.  We are as badly affected here as elsewhere. In Celbridge there are 40 lines catering for about 600 telephones.  That is ridiculously overloading the lines. There is no point in having telephones in houses if there are no lines to support them.  There is a new housing estate off Clogher Road called Rutland Grove; consisting of 118 houses, housing 350 or 400 people, with no telephone. <Col N="318" /> There are old and young people living there and telephone facilities are urgently required, in order to contact doctors, ambulances and so on.  Requests for telephones have been met with the reply that there is no cable, but the people in the area find it difficult to understand why the builder has his telephone there, if they cannot have one.  They were told that the builder had an overhead line.  I suggest that it would be giving a very good public service if, pending the provision of sufficient cable to enable telephones to be put in, the Minister would arrange for an overhead line to be provided to a telephone kiosk.</P>
      <P>I do not have to tell the Minister or other Members of the House about the rate of vandalism to telephone kiosks.  It is an absolute disgrace and there seems to be nothing we can do to curb this problem.  The Minister should ask his officials to concentrate on some form of vandal proof telephone, if necessary a telephone without a cord leading from the instrument. In similar estates where there is a kiosk nearby which has been the subject of vandalism people have no access to the Garda, ambulance or other services unless they have recourse to some house with a telephone which may be some distance away. When, for example, Dublin Corporation open up a senior citizens' area&mdash; such as some of the very fine chalets they have provided&mdash;it is very important that telephones be provided simultaneously. Perhaps the Minister would examine this very important social aspect of the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The poor telephone service, particularly in rural areas, constitutes one of the most frustrating quandaries in which industries have found themselves. Not so long ago a well-known foreign industry based in, I think, Sligo, had very serious problems with telephones.  They manufacture weighing scales and have a lot of international business dealings.  They found the necessity of going through the exchange a great frustration to them and could not carry on their business at the rate they needed.  A chewing gum factory in Kilcock experienced similar difficulties in recent <Col N="319" /> years.  Before there was an automatic exchange it could take all morning to get three or four calls.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that provision is being made for many more automatic exchanges in an endeavour to bring the level to 90 per cent within the next five years, if I have correctly interpreted the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>The high cost of telephones must be borne in mind also.  Though many people are anxious to obtain telephones they are concerned at the increases in the rental charges in recent years which have been a great shock to them.  Before the general election &mdash;when the last Government were in office&mdash;I asked how many people had requested that their telephones be disconnected and I think the figure given me was somewhere in the region of 600 last year.  I then asked the former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and later the former Tánaiste about the provision of telephones for certain social welfare categories.  I was delighted that that was included in our election manifesto&mdash;that non-contributory old age pensioners normally exempt from a television licence fee and in receipt of an electricity allowance also will have no rental to pay for their telephones.  This is an excellent move much welcomed.  The fact that there are 40,000 people awaiting telephones, willing to pay very large connection fees does not necessarily constitute approval of their high cost. In certain instances we must realise that telephones form part of a social service and a way of life and to view them purely from a profitability aspect would be a mistake.</P>
    <P>The large increase in revenue accruing to the telephone account is accounted for by the number of new subscribers and the high cost of postage resulting in a situation in which more people now use the telephone instead of posting a letter which has almost priced itself out of the market. Therefore, the false impression can be gleaned that it does not matter how much is charged for a telephone: do not worry, there are plenty of people who want one if you do not. <Col N="320" /> That would be a wrong philosophy. I hope the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary will do everything possible to control the cost element because it has a very positive effect on the cost of living.  Certainly in the past ten to 15 years a telephone has not been a luxury.  I should like to see everybody having a telephone but one must be conscious that there have been disconnections because some people found themselves unable to afford it any longer.  Indeed, the Minister might well examine that aspect in conjunction with the Department of Social Welfare, in circumstances in which somebody may be forced to fore-go a telephone because of his inability to pay.  I am thinking of people who are disabled, whose only link it is with the outside world but whose income may be just above the eligibility limit for free rental.</P>
    <P>The Minister might scrutinise also the amount of deposit required for installation, again bearing in mind the applicant's means.  Let us always show heart in our dealings and in the way in which we progress.  Let us not forget that it is a means of helping people to improve their way of life.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that this provision will result in an extra 7,000 jobs spread over the period of expansion. Indeed, it will be of great encouragement to young graduates who at present have nothing very much to look forward to and to which they may be able to apply their newly-acquired skills.  Perhaps the Minister would take a hard look at the question of providing overhead lines in new housing estates until such time as cables can be provided.  I wish the Minister luck in his onerous task.  I know he will tackle it with the same integrity as he showed in all the other positions he has held in Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of this debate it is understandable that particular emphasis should be placed on the modern problems of the telephone service experienced in particular by Deputies seeking to have telephones connected or who, in representing their constituents, have particular cases in mind where the existing service is inadequate.  I am sure the Minister <Col N="321" /> will welcome such views.  On this occasion the airing of this aspect of the problem is appropriate.</P>
      <P>In a sense the aims of this Bill are longterm in regard to the specific problems mentioned.  Indeed, I hope it will have an influence in bringing about a quick improvement in the efficiency of the service.  At the same time we should not lose sight of the fact that what this Bill does is enable moneys to be supplied for capital purposes of the telephone service; it is not actually voting the moneys.  It empowers the Minister for Finance to provide these moneys for the capital development of the telephone service.  It might be no harm to recollect that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;in so far as communications and the main part of their business are concerned, telephones, postage and so on&mdash;although a full State service, are the nearest thing in a way to the concept we have developed of a semi-State body.  In these areas the Department have been ruled by the policy that they should be an economically viable service, as are the electricity services or any other semi-State service with which we are familiar.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has pointed out, the Department up to recently have succeeded very well but obviously they were not able to accumulate the capital resources necessary for the expansion that will be required in the future.  To that extent they remained rather like a semi-State body, depending very much on the State for capital funds.  However, they should be able to provide from their own resources some contribution towards this heading to justify the expenditure involved. This should be possible if matters are run efficiently and generally, speaking, this policy has been operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mention that because there has been much emphasis in this debate on the social service aspect of the telephone service.  Admittedly that exists and for instance, the case for having a telephone available in case of emergency is very good but in so far as we treat the service and the expenditure involved merely from the point of view of a social service in the last analysis we are going back to the taxpayer <Col N="322" /> to finance it.  Where a service can be made economic that should be done.  The more this happens the more efficient will be that service.  In recent years we have had far too much experience of the State providing services which the taxpayers have had to finance.  Perhaps one of the factors that was a major influence on political development in the past year was the realisation by the public that what a Government gave had to be paid for by the taxpayer, whether immediately or in the long term.</P>
    <P>It is all the more important that the telephone service should be planned and geared to continue the policy of paying for itself because a considerable portion of the users of the service will be commercial.  Many speakers mentioned the necessity of having telephone services for new industries.  That is all very important but if you have to supply such services at a loss to get an industry established you are taking from the value of that industry.  I do not think we should press the point too much that the telephone service should be considered a social service.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the inability to build up reserves for capital expenditure may have had an influence on the slow development of our telephone service but to attribute the present position solely to that would be doing a grave injustice to the Minister and his Department.  Some 15 or 20 years ago it would have been very difficult to see the rapid expansion in communications, particularly in automatic communications.  Even the kind of equipment being used has changed and is still evolving.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the matter of electronic systems replacing the mechanical-electrical systems that have mainly been used up to now.  This is an inevitable development.  As the Minister has pointed out, the development of computers has been much more rapid than was foreseen a number of years ago.  The fact remains that while we were unable to develop our system on foreseeable lines at any time during the past ten years, there has been a magnification of the demand on these communications <Col N="323" /> and on our resources far beyond what was expected.  These two factors together mean that there is a considerable backlog to be faced.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the provision requested here is not unrealistic.  The question is, whether having provided the facility for the Minister for Finance to provide these capital sums will a corresponding ability be there to translate it into practical effect by providing the service that is required now and in the foreseeable future?  Obviously the answer cannot come simply by sitting around the table or debating the matter here on one occasion.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that there has been a major survey carried out on the needs that exist and there must be a programme and plan for development. It is to implement that plan that these moneys are needed.  I assume this is so, but we should all realise that you cannot change plans and complicated programmes of this nature in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner in order to meet every case.  Some cases can be solved quickly &mdash;I am thinking of the provision of individual telephones&mdash;simply because they fit in with the stage of development at the time.  There may be other more socially desirable cases that will have to wait because one cannot develop a coherent plan in a chip-chop way.  It may be necessary to wait until a certain stage before a particular connection can be made.  It is very often assumed that the passing of a Bill in the House or the approval of something means that something will be done. That is not the case, particularly in a matter like this.</P>
    <P>I assume that there is a planned programme already being put into action and being developed for future implementation.  That plan cannot be changed at every instance.  It has to go on in a logical manner.  The only way to remedy the situation speedily is to stick to the programme and to go through it as fast as possible.  Changes cause delay.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with the Opposition Deputies who complimented the Minister on his record and also on the informative nature of his opening speech on the Bill.  It certainly <Col N="324" /> helps one to form a judgment.  It would be a useless exercise to go further into the technical nature of the matter at this stage.  I would like the Minister to confirm that it is not just today we are thinking of in the development of this service, that it is an on-going process and that he has ready a programme for which he will call on the Minister for Finance for the money required to implement it.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the vandalism which was spoken about in regard to kiosks and the system as a whole. This type of vandalism is inhibiting economic development, improvement in standards of living and in economic standards generally for the community. It also destroys local services.  Every Deputy, particularly those representing constituencies in Dublin, can give specific cases of going into telephone kiosks and not being able to use the telephone.  Sometimes the telephone is gone or the coin box is jammed.  The only way we can get over this problem is by the co-operation of the public. Every piece of equipment in telephone kiosks which is damaged by vandals represents a loss to the community which will have to be paid either directly by the taxpayer or in more indirect ways.</P>
    <P>We have a social problem in this vandalism of telephone kiosks.  It is desirable to have telephone kiosks at certain points in built-up areas and in rural areas.  It is of social importance to see to it that when they are put in those places they remain workable.</P>
    <P>I could talk about the development of electronic systems, computers and the exchange of computer programmes, but I believe that matter is more relevant to the Minister's Estimate than to this debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that this programme will increase employment opportunities and furnish more jobs. This is very welcome but it will do this in the same way as a building project supplies jobs.  The continuation of employment in the building industry projects, each finishing in a short time. It is the same in relation to the telephone programme.  As far as I can see most of the jobs will be in the implementation of this capital development <Col N="325" /> plan.  I believe there should be a flattening out to a figure below the maximum where the capital expansion is slowed down because arrears have been eliminated.  Then the jobs provided during the development stage have to be compensated for by employment elsewhere.</P>
    <P>One would like to say to the Minister that this employment must be found within his own service but unfortunately in modern complex economic conditions that is not always the way things work out. We are going to put in automatic exchanges.  More and more automated systems mean that the machine is doing the job and fewer people are required to run these systems.  This problem is not confined to the telephone services; it is something we have to face in the economy as a whole.  I merely mention now that the adjustment in employment here, while satisfactory in the short term, may leave longer-term problems.  The machine is taking over what the man was previously doing.  I should like to ask the Minister when considering his long-term programme to ensure that this aspect of the ultimate employment situation in the Post Office services will be studied and, if necessary, referred back to a more central agency.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, during the past three or four years there was a very strong tendency in industry and services to try to get efficiency and profitability by using mechanical electronic equipment and perhaps incentive schemes to reduce the actual employment content. While possibly economically justifiable, in itself it is socially very undesirable. We are therefore left with a problem which goes far beyond the Minister's bailiwick, the problem of what I might call economic profitability in the accepted conventional sense on the one hand and of keeping human being in gainful employment on the other hand.  That is a problem of our time and there seems to be conflict here.  I know this is not for the Minister alone but I do suggest that at this early stage the Minister should consider the implications of the permanent employment content in this <Col N="326" /> area of his responsibility in relation to economic viability.  For everybody who is interested in these matters, this is one of the most vital and difficult problems of our time.  It is a problem for Governments, for those managing and directing industries, for trade unions and for all individuals.  It can only be solved by co-ordination and by foresight.  I would say to the Minister that it is right and highly desirable that he should embark on the implementation of this programme which will provide economic activity and jobs and therefore render a social service as well as providing an economic benefit.</P>
    <P>A survey should be undertaken now as to what the employment content would be when ultimate targets are achieved and a steady state is reached, by which I mean a state after a phase of accelerated development.  This should not be left to the time when it may appear as a problem.</P>
    <P>We can confidently look forward to this contribution from the Minister's Department to providing employment in the immediate future and perhaps for some time to come.  In the long term this type of development will raise, as it does in other areas, the question of economic viability and efficiency as against the social requirements of the community.  Be that as it may, the Minister has embarked on something that is well worthwhile.  He will have a very interesting number of years before him in its implementation and I know that he will be very forthcoming in the House with information and will be very glad to seek the co-operation of the House and of the public in this development.  For all these reasons we are agreed that this is a measure to be adopted and pressed ahead as fast as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is welcomed by everybody on this side of the House.  It is an important Bill in that it helps to develop our telephone services.  During the past 30 to 40 years progress in the telephone services has not been all it should have been. The Minister points out that there has been considerable progress since 1973. That is correct.  Prior to 1973 people were not sufficiently conscious of the <Col N="327" /> need to develop these services.  Nowadays we are much more aware of this need.  In the past people did not demand the kind of communication service that is needed today in industrial, agricultural and social life.  The number of telephones per head of population is the lowest in the EEC. There is a serious backlog of telephone installations.</P>
      <P>The Minister's predeccessor made considerable progress in regard to the telephone service.  A sum of £158 million has been spent in developing the service since 1973 as follows: £67 million for subscribers' installations and local distribution plant; £44 million for new exchange equipment; £34 million for trunk systems circuits and switching equipment; £13 million for building sites and miscellaneous items.  The number of exchange lines increased by 104,000 during the same period.  This is important progress.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's good intentions in regard to the further development of the telephone service. In this Bill the Minister is seeking a further sum of £350 million.  In his speech the Minister posed the question of the desirability of an all-out drive to solve the telephone problem. I urge that an all-out effort be made. The Minister does not realise that there is an urgent need for telephone installations in rural Ireland.  It is heartbreaking for people who are on the waiting list for connection for three or four years, which is not unusual. A great number of people in all areas have approached me for help in regard to the installation of telephones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, his Parliamentary Secretary and every member of the Department should try to understand the importance of improving our telephone service.  In Laois-Offaly there is a limited number of telephone exchanges and the majority are still using manual exchanges.  I have great respect for the people employed in these exchanges but the service is unbelievably slow.  At present you have a better chance of getting through to Iceland than you have of getting through to parts of Offaly.  It is also <Col N="328" /> impossible to get through to some parts of South Laois.  Most of the workers in these exchanges are on a seven-day week and are doing their best to provide a service, but the equipment they are using is out of date.</P>
    <P>Industrial development in the midlands and elsewhere is being stifled by our poor telephone service.  On entering a town an industrialist inquires about the number of people available for employment, water and sewerage facilities, transport facilities and the telephone service.  In my experience the telephone service in rural Ireland is inadequate.  For this reason I welcome the Bill but I believe that a sense of urgency is needed if we are to come into line with other European countries.</P>
    <P>For this reason it is absolutely essential that we make an all-out drive to solve this problem.  We must have a telephone service that is comparable with that which exists in the other European countries if our industrialists are to compete successfully.  A good telephone service is essential, too, for the development of our agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The initial capital expenditure in providing a full telephone service is sizeable and will be a heavy commitment so far as central funds are concerned, but once it has been developed adequately the telephone service should not only pay for itself but show a profit.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement to the effect that he hopes to increase the number of connections in the years ahead by approximately 40,000, but I have reservations as to whether his hopes will be fulfilled.  The situation in this regard between ourselves and other countries is not satisfactory and must be improved.</P>
    <P>Several speakers have referred to the question of telephone kiosks with particular reference to the damage that is caused continually throughout the country both to the kiosks and to the apparatus.  It is tragic that there are people who behave so irresponsibly. The idea of siting kiosks as near as possible to post offices seems to lessen the chances of damage of this kind. <Col N="329" /> The Department's policy of making local authorities responsible for losses incurred in regard to the provision of telephone kiosks in rural areas has met with some success, but on the whole local authorities have been reluctant to undertake very much responsibility in this regard.  It is the view of some county councillors that such losses should be borne by the Department, and I agree with that viewpoint.</P>
    <P>It should be the responsibility of the Department to provide kiosks in isolated areas in which, although there may not be big populations, telephones are essential.  Any losses incurred in the provision of services in such areas should also be the responsibility of the Department.  One can understand the reluctance on the part of local authorities to undertake such responsibility.</P>
    <P>The whole spectrum of telephone services is one that must be expanded in every way possible in the years ahead.  In regard to installations, priority is given to spiritual and medical services.  After these services priority should be given to those industrialists who may wish to begin production here.  Very often a person starting a business may have to wait quite a while for a telephone.  Some priority should be given, too, to the person endeavouring to start a business on a very small scale, who may be employing only three or four people. They are not listed for priority service by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. I would hope that in any business where people are to be employed the Minister would give priority in the provision of telephones because any move that can help to create employment should get priority.  The telephones would be paying for themselves in that the people employed would be paying income tax and stamping cards and so on, all of which is most desirable.</P>
    <P>I will go a step further and suggest that industries should also get some type of help from the Minister's Department for a period.  This may not come exactly within the ambit of his Department but I hope he will consider instances where help such as alleviation of installation fees and of charges for a limited period might be <Col N="330" /> given.  With the large increase in the cost of telephone services the telephone bill for some industries can be very heavy.  One firm, not a very big firm, sent me their telephone account recently and I was amazed to find that it came to something in the region of £25,000.  It is a fantastic amount of money to be paid by a very good firm which is expanding&mdash;not too fast but still expanding.  These people wrote to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs hoping that the Department would be able to give some assistance. As far as I am aware no assistance can be given at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department employs a large number of people; 13,000 people are employed in the telephone service and the Department also give employment to approximately 2,000 people as contractors who erect telephone buildings, manufacture and install the equipment, supply and lay cables and so on.  One firm is manufacturing such equipment in my constituency. The Minister in his brief did not set out the amount of imported telephone equipment, such as lines, poles, wires, and also telephone directories used by the telephone department.</P>
    <P>In the near future I will put down a question to the Minister and give him some opportunity to go in detail into some of these points.  I am certain his reply will be interesting.  The Minister was recently appointed to this Department.  I hope he will consider availing of every opportunity of using equipment manufactured in Ireland by Irish people for use on our Irish telephone service.  Irish workers have the necessary expertise to provide all of this equipment.  I am certain that we have the necessary raw materials and I see no reason why we should not be able to supply at least 95 per cent if not the remaining 5 per cent. We should ensure that the moneys spent by the Minister's Department on equipment should be spent on equipment produced here.  This will provide much-needed employment and will be of benefit to the country.  Those are the main points I want to make in regard to the telephone service.</P>
    <P>On a local level I ask the Minister to see if it would be possible to have <Col N="331" /> a number of telephone exchanges in my constituency improved upon.  He has set out in his statement a number of exchanges that are going to become automatic.  He has dealt with them in considerable detail.  Some places he has not mentioned are Birr, Ferbane, Belmount and Shannonbridge, all of which are awaiting the development of the automatic telephone exchange in Birr.  Within the last few days I received a letter from the Minister in which he stated that it will be a minimum of three years before the Birr exchange will become automatic.  I hope he will make an effort to ensure that the telephone service for the Birr area will become automatic.</P>
    <P>The Minister deals with the capacity of the western co-axial cable and states that it will be increased from 960 circuits to 2,700 circuits and that new trunk cables will be provided to serve Manorhamilton, Edenderry and some other areas.  Perhaps, when the Minister is concluding he will be in a position to elaborate on what he means regarding Edenderry which again has a manual service at the moment.  This is an industrial town where the telephone service is not all it should be. Tullamore on the one side and Portlaoise on the other each have an automatic service.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell us when we may expect the telephone service in Edenderry to be improved upon.  I have received numerous representations from people employed in Edenderry, people engaged in industry, agriculture and other walks of life who feel that the telephone service there is inadequate.</P>
    <P>Again it will probably be quite some time before Rathdowney and Borris-in-Ossory become automatic. They may have to wait for the Roscrea exchange to be developed.  I do not ask the Minister to give me a full verbal reply on all these questions but I would ask his Department to supply in the not too distant future some detailed, up-to-date information on these points.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister every success. There are many people like myself who have hard words to say about his Department.  However, speed in communication is all-important in the era <Col N="332" /> we are living in.  From the very beginning we have lagged behind in our approach to the telephone service.  An intensive drive should be made to remedy this situation.  If our telephone service can be improved it will have beneficial effects throughout the community. This Bill is a step in the right direction, a direction in which I hope the Department will continue over the years that lie ahead.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús is main liom mo chomhgháirdeas a chur in iúl don Aire as ucht a cheapadh mar Aire.  Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go geal leis agus go dtiocfaidh feabhas san mheán cumarsáide seo, an teileafón. Ba mhaith liom chomh maith deaghuí a sheoladh chuig an Rúnaí Parlaiminte go néireoidh go geal leis sin freisin.</P>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary on their respective appointments to this Department.  I wish them well and hope that vast improvements in this communication network will occur during their term of office.  Everyone is aware of the poor quality of the telephone service.  One is frustrated by the alternation of sound and silence in the system in which one seems to be linked up with limbo.  Let us hope that such frustrations will be eliminated.  There are frustrations for people trying to make relatively simple contact with neighbours and greater frustrations for business men who are unable to meet orders or to obtain information on the latest prices for goods, and for whom time and the ability to communicate speedily might make the difference between getting an order and losing it. I appreciate that the problems involved cannot be solved overnight.  It is frightening to think that the £175 million provided under the previous enabling Act was not sufficient to complete the investment programme and that inflation eroded £49 million of this money.  It shows how important it is for the Government to tackle and try to eradicate inflation.  If inflation had been brought under control within the past couple of years there would have been a saving of £49 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another problem somewhat akin to inflation is that of vandalism.  Vast <Col N="333" /> sums of money must be spent on repairs necessitated by vandalism, and the citizen has to foot the bill.  I would like to think the Department would actually engage in studying the feasibility of providing a new type of kiosk which would be less vulnerable to vandalism.  If only the vandals could be enlightened there would be substantial savings which could be devoted to very necessary capital development programmes such as this. I would like to know if any comparison has been made with other countries as to the extent to which they suffer from such vandalism.</P>
    <P>One can only hope that this Bill, which provides for capital up to a limit of £350 million, will benefit the telephone service to the maximum extent, that not much of the sum provided will be eroded by inflation and that there will also be a certain amount of saving through the curtailment or eradication of vandalism.</P>
    <P>With reference to new estates, people move into their new homes and see that the house is wired for a telephone. They know that the cabling within the estate is complete and believe that when this internal cable is connected to the main cable going back to the exchange all will be well. Then it is discovered that there is not sufficient equipment to take up gaps in the exchange and there is frustration among those people who have moved out of their normal social circles because they cannot keep in touch with their friends or relatives.</P>
    <P>Delays of this kind are even more frustrating for self-employed people. Now that the construction industry is being prepared to get off the ground again many people engaged in haulage and other back-up services for the construction industry are looking for telephones so that they can conduct their businesses properly.  Such people have approached me saying they are losing valuable business because of lack of telephones.  I hope the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary will do everything possible to help those people without whom the construction industry will not be able to recommence operations properly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="334" /> On the matter of kiosks throughout the country, quite a number have been erected under the guarantee system, the local authorities underwriting any losses incurred.  I was always against that system because I did not think it right that ratepayers should have been asked to meet such bills but, on the other hand, we cannot get away from the desirability of having kiosks available in rural areas. Now, with rates on private dwellings being abolished I wonder if there will be reconsideration of the guarantee system.  In Wicklow quite a few kiosks were provided under this system and I understand that altogether local authorities paid the losses in respect of 100 kiosks.  Now that local councils will no longer be able to participate in this scheme I wonder will councillors have increased requests for more kiosks.</P>
    <P>In the Bray area it is very difficult to get telephone connections.  We see signs of progress along the main Dublin-Bray road.  When the Shankill exchange comes into operation lines will become available and this will be a comfort to people in new estates in the vioinity.  I hope these connections will be available soon.  Arklow is an area where, despite many representations, it is almost impossible to get a new telephone.  I hope something will be done quickly for this growing town which has been the location of many new industries in the last decade.  I understand that there are only one or two spare lines available in that area and that they are being kept in reserve.</P>
    <P>This afternoon the Parliamentary Secretary met a deputation to discuss the situation in Baltinglass.  We understand we must wait for certain developments in Portlaoise and we are told the wait might be as long as three years.  I urge the Minister to see if something could not be done more quickly to get a better service in that important area.  The Parliamentary Secretary suggested that there will be some extra trunks and an extra switchboard in Baltinglass.  This may ease the pressure and tide us over until we get contact with the automatic system, and for that reason I hope the work in Portlaoise will be speeded up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> There have been some jokes about the impossibility of dialling Wicklow town from Dublin on a sunny day. Apparently the sun rays interfers with the microwaves and we have been told the trouble arises in regard to the beam from Howth.  We hope that some improvements will be made in that connection because the &ldquo;bleeps&rdquo; on that line are intolerable in sunny weather.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that there is no short-term solution to the problem of new telephones, that an all-out drive would have to be made.  It makes sad reading on page 3 of the Minister's brief to see that the telephone density in Ireland stands at only 15 per 100 of the population, and that figure is well below that of France which, with 27 telephones per 100 is the lowest in the EEC.  It is disappointing to find us so far below France in this respect.</P>
    <P>I would like to see statistics for each of our EEC partners.  Our prestige is important but if the figure is known industrialists might be reluctant to come here because time, ease of communication, speed and efficiency are of the essence in any industry.  Hopefully we will move from the bottom of the league by making improvements.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the programme for the next five years.  The annual rate of connections will be increased progressively from around 45,000 to 85,000.  I sincerely hope this target can be achieved.  We know the necessary effort will be forthcoming from the Minister and his staff.  A figure of 96 per cent automatic telephones would be a great improvement putting us well on the way towards the full 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>Quality of service is very important. There are people clamouring for the service while others who have the service are grossly dissatisfied with it. This underlines the urgency for and need of telecommunication.  Sometimes it is easier to talk to someone in faraway places than it is to a neighbour half a mile or a mile away.  Very often when one makes a call one finds oneself at the receiving end of possibly two or three conversations.  I was happy to read to-day that it is possible for an industrialist to get a direct link <Col N="336" /> in many cases through an automatic exchange than it is if the area is not connected to direct dialling.  That, at least, enables the industrialist to carry on business reasonably effectively.</P>
    <P>Forward planning is vitally important in this area.  Like other speakers, I hope every effort will be made to use home-manufactured equipment.  The breakdown of the proposed expenditure of £350 million shows that £135 million will be allocated to subscriber installations and local network development. Hopefully the target of 85,000 connections will be reached. Local exchange development is allocated £70 million; trunk development £110; buildings £28 million and miscellaneous £7 million.</P>
    <P>People find it difficult to accept that they cannot have connection despite the fact that there is a line and pole adjacent.  If the pole does not happen to have a spare or two on it there can, of course, be no connection. People find the situation inexplicably frustrating.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the difficulties with communal lines.  The exchange says these are due to crossed lines.  I suppose if callers hung up the lines might be cleared but the tendency is to hang on in the hope of getting connection. There are many problems involved and I wish the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary well in trying to sort things out.</P>
    <P>A vast sum is involved here but there is the possibility of recoupment over a period if a good service is provided. The investment also holds out the prospect of job opportunities for skilled and semi-skilled workers, graduate technicians, tradesmen and others. The Minister mentioned a figure of 7,000.  From the point of view of the economy generally this will be a healthy and progressive step.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister, his Parliamentatry Secretary, his staff and all others involved will be able to bring about the necessary improvements.  If success is not achieved it will not be for lack of effort by the Minister.  I have the highest regard for him, He, above all others, will put his shoulder to the wheel to ensure success, and so will his Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary and wish them a very happy time in office.  They have a difficult job and have to meet many demands. I should like to draw attention to major towns, particularly industrial towns. Perhaps I shall be excused if I refer to my own county.  There is great need for the automatic system in Limerick where we have Abbeyfeale, Newcastle-west and Rathkeale, all industrial towns.  Industrialists cannot work efficiently without an automatic service and this should be provided, and industrial towns should, as far as possible, get priority.</P>
      <P>We have many individual applications for telephone installations.  It may be sad to say but it is essential nowadays&mdash;I hope the Minister thinks on the same lines&mdash;that where old people live alone, if at all possible and if the cost is within reason, they should get telephones, which would be great company and protection.  With so many robberies and so much violence nowadays it would be wise to give priority to people living alone.  I deplore the vandalism of today.  We see telephone kiosks robbed and wrecked throughout the country, a very unwelcome sight.  If the Post Office authorities could clear the money from the kiosks around six o'clock in the evening it might be a good idea. In that way the potential robber or vandal would not wreck the kiosk because it would become known that it would not be worthwhile.  Like the previous speaker I am inclined to advocate a different type of kiosk.  At present it is easy to wreck the kiosk and get money and this offers perhaps too much temptation, particularly to the younger generation, teenagers anxious to get easy money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often wondered why there is so much delay in providing kiosks. Adare village near me is at present without a telephone kiosk.  There was one there up to a year ago but as a result of some reconstruction work it <Col N="338" /> was removed at that time and never replaced.  Local residents must rely on the kindness and generosity of people with private phones in cases of emergency.  This may be an exceptional case but I should like the Minister to note it and if possible have that telephone replaced.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the operators, who deserve the greatest credit.  People are very often unreasonable at night and make calls at a very late hour, but the operators are courteous and helpful even though they may be part-time workers who have already done a day's work.</P>
    <P>A worrying aspect of using the telephone I find is that sometimes when you replace the receiver after making a call and take it up again a few minutes later you find you are still connected, apparently not cut off.  I have reported this on a number of occasions to Limerick exchange and they have looked into it but I am still not happy about it.  Other people have also mentioned this matter to me. When you get the bill you are inclined to believe that there is really something wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary on their appointment. Perhaps we should rather commiserate with them because of the tasks which face them in trying to carry out this capital programme and convince people that there is some good reason why they cannot have a telephone installed. Probably Mr. Bell when he invented the telephone, did not know what he was starting but no doubt in a land of free enterprise such as the US he regarded it as primarily a business instrument which would help industry and commerce, reduce travelling and generally increase commercial activity.  That is still the main purpose of the telephone but we find that it also has a social aspect.  For many people who live alone the telephone is a lifeline.  Even to have it in the house, although it may never be used for emergency purposes, gives them great confidence and it is well worth investing many millions of £'s in the service on that score alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="339" /> I wish the Minister could produce some reply which Deputies could send to people who write to them every day asking why they cannot have a telephone installed.  When we consider the tremendous capital cost mentioned by the Minister and realise the good job being done, we also realise that the huge task confronting us will eventually be accomplished.  Can we do it as quickly as possible?  The Minister spoke of the effect of inflation on our capital moneys and we appreciate this. We should not be despondent.  We should allocate more money until we ensure that each worthwhile application has been dealt with.</P>
    <P>Many aspects of this capital programme are mentioned in the Bill. There is the employment aspect, the social aspect and the purely commercial aspect.  So far as I know, we import all the telephone apparatus to be installed. Could we possibly manufacture most of it here?  In our drive to provide more employment we cannot ignore any aspect.  We are spending £350 million on telephone expansion.  I do not know what the ratio is between labour and cost.  This is industrial development which yields good employment and the employment of experts. We should examine the programme to find out how much of the apparatus could be manufactured at home.  In Sweden they owe quite a lot of their prosperity to the fact that they specialised in the manufacture of telephone appartaus.  Most of our telephone apparatus comes from that country. There is no reason why we cannot try to emulate them by putting some of our resources into the manufacture of telephone apparatus.</P>
    <P>At one time the telephone was a status symbol.  It has now become part of our lives and today life without the telephone would be almost impossible. Therefore, it is proper that the Government should give this matter such a high priority in their economic and social planning.  It is the intention of the Government to provide telephones so far as possible for people who are living alone.  This is a very laudable objective and ambition.  We must face the fact that this will mean putting a strain on other sectors in <Col N="340" /> which the telephones are also being sought.</P>
    <P>The Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary and his staff, must decide which should be given the highest priority.  Should it be the person living alone who will regard it as his lifeline in case of emergency, or should it be the business man who says: &ldquo;The very fact that I have not got an adequate telephone service is inhibiting the expansion of my firm and there-fore I cannot give more employment&rdquo;? The Minister is facing a difficult task and it will not be easy to satisfy the great demand.  The Minister is committed to this joint expansion of the service.  At the moment, people are very cynical about this service. Members of the House who try to telephone, especially in the afternoon, get the weirdest results.  It is quite easy to get a wrong number or to get crossed lines.  I often feel this is intended to bring home to Members of the House the terrible shortcomings in our telephone service.</P>
    <P>People say glibly that we have the worst telephone service in Europe but, when one tries to make a telephone call in Europe, one is very often frustrated. Probably no country in the world has a perfect telephone service. Most countries in Europe have more telephones per head of the population than we have.  In some countries the service seems to be better than ours. We cannot relax our efforts to provide more telephones until we have dealt with the present waiting list.  The demand will increase each month and each year because the more affluent our society becomes the greater the demand for telephones will be.  The more we develop our economic, industrial and commercial arms the more the demand will increase.</P>
    <P>While £350 million is a hefty sum, as the Minister rightly remarked, inflation will reduce that figure by quite a large amount.  We will be saddled with increased taxation for many years to meet our telephone capital programme.  This will be money well spent.  The vast majority of people will agree with this.  If we cannot supply all the applicants with telephones, the Minister should try to <Col N="341" /> provide more public telephone kiosks so that, in every neighbourhood, householders can have access to a public telephone at least.  We hear a great deal about vandalism of telephone kiosks but I think the position is improving.  In one neighbourhood I know of, when a telephone kiosk was installed, local people were encouraged to keep an eye on it and so far that kiosk has not been damaged.  As an emergency measure the Minister might consider increasing the number of public telephone kiosks to be provided.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me this opportunity of raising this matter on the adjournment.  I congratulate the Minister for Justice on his appointment and wish him well in what I know, even from this remove, to be a very challenging post.  I hope the cause of justice will be well served under his stewardship.  For a number of months we have heard of allegations of maltreatment by the Garda Síochána of persons arrested under the Emergency Powers Act and the Offences Against the State Act.  The allegations have come from a wide range of sources, including Amnesty International which submitted a report on the subject to the Government.  While this report has not been published in full a summary of it has been.  It is clear from that summary that Amnesty International are concerned.  Similar allegations were made by members of the legal profession, including a lawyer who acted on behalf of the Government at the recent Strasbourg hearing concerning Northern Ireland.  Allegations were also made by journalists. Indeed, the Minister for Justice, when in Opposition, felt the allegations were serious enough to warrant a public inquiry.</P>
      <P>I should like to quote the following from the Official Report, Volume 296, column 1770:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="342" /> Mr. G. Collins: Would the Minister not agree that because of the allegations that are being made, and being made in increasing numbers, the best way and the only way to clear the good name of the Garda would be to have a public inquiry, judicial or otherwise, into the allegations? </P>
    <P>Further it appears that the Taoiseach, when Leader of the Opposition, called for the setting up of an independent tribunal to look into the allegations following the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis in February, 1977.  Later that month the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party supported the demands for an independent inquiry.  During this period public concern had been raised about the possible infringement of the civil and human rights of arrested persons and about the possibility that some members of the Garda Síochána were directly involved in such infringements. Public concern has been raised again to such a level that a full, independent inquiry is essential in the interests of the Garda Síochána and in the interests of ensuring that those who may have committed the infringements are subjected to the full rigour of the law.</P>
    <P>I should like to add that I am not condemning this Minister, or members of the Government, for the action taken but I wonder why such Members who were so vociferous when in Opposition in demanding a full public inquiry have not done so now that it is in their power to hold such an inquiry.  What they propose doing falls far short of what should be done.  The measures adopted by the Government are inadequate because they do not provide in any meaningful way for the full investigation into the allegations that have been made about ill-treatment in the past.  This is grossly unfair to those who allege they have been maltreated and to the good reputation of the Garda Síochana.</P>
    <P>Public concern has been raised to such a level in relation to this matter that justice must not only be done but be seen to be done.  I have no doubt that the Minister will say that he has assigned one or more senior Garda officers to investigate individual complaints and to report directly to <Col N="343" /> the Director of Public Prosecutions. This has been presented as being sufficient but, in fact, it is not.  As the Irish Council for Civil Liberties point out, this response is totally inadequate because no matter how impartial the investigations may be they will not appear as such in the eyes of the public.  They will not assuage the suspicion that has now arisen.  For this reason the Labour Party call on the Minister to widen the terms of reference of the special committee to enable them investigate individual cases of ill-treatment and report publicly thereon.  The Minister may suggest that a special committee could not investigate cases where the persons concerned will not co-operate or where there are cases pending before our courts.  He made those points in the statement issued when he announced the setting up of the special committee. That is not a real objection to my proposal because the special committee would, obviously, only investigate those cases where the complainant wished an investigation to be carried out.  Cases already before the courts would be treated as <i>sub judice</i>.</P>
    <P>Another criticism is in relation to future safeguards.  The recommendation in relation to future safeguards will be a vital aspect of the committee's work. Its importance cannot be over-stressed but I doubt if the committee can do their work effectively in this regard. They cannot fully investigate what happened in the past.  For the future I should like to state that it is in the interests of citizens and of the Garda Síochána that a permanent independent complaints tribunal which can investigate all allegations of ill-treatment by the Garda Síochána should be set up.  This is the practice in most democracies and it is a good one.  Such a tribunal would prove to be the most effective deterrent against events of the kind which have been alleged.  It would uphold the good reputation justly enjoyed by the vast majority of the members of the Garda Síochána and the high standards they uphold often in the face of extreme provocation.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference given to the special committee are, at best, vague <Col N="344" /> on the question of whether the committee have power to examine the desirability of such a tribunal and the appropriate way of setting it up.  The terms of reference of the committee should be extended to put beyond all possible doubt that one of their primary tasks will be to examine the appropriate way in which such a tribunal might be established.  The position of my party in relation to this matter is clear.  At our last annual conference it was resolved that we seek the establishment of an independent tribunal and that the findings of such a tribunal be publicly reported. In repeating the position of my party I want to ask the Minister, and the Government, to reconsider the terms of reference given to the committee so as to give effect to my proposal.  It is incumbent on the parliaments of every civilised society to guarantee the safe custody and good treatment of suspects and prisoners in the custody of the law.  In this connection I recommend to the Minister that early consideration be given to the adoption by this Parliament of the guidelines laid down by the International Commission of Jurists in Geneva and in the UN Draft Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners.</P>
    <P>While we do not condone acts of violence and murder by anybody and while we affirm strongly that all perpetrators of such must be brought speedily before the law we affirm also that all suspects and prisoners in the custody of the law have a civil and human right to safe treatment.  I believe the Minister will serve the interest of justice, assuage any fears that exist in the community and will put right the public concern that exists if he extends the terms of reference of the committee to enable them investigate individual complaints and report publicly thereon.  Secondly, he should ask them to advise on the most appropriate manner in which an independent appeals tribunal can be established. I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the points I have raised.  I propose to give the rest of my time to the Fine Gael spokesman on the Department of Justice, Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>

      <P>I join with Deputy Desmond in congratulating Deputy Collins on his appointment as Minister for Justice.  I wish him well in this office.  I thank Deputy Desmond for affording me the opportunity to speak on this matter.  The situation is that neither I nor any member of my party have yet seen a copy of the report of Amnesty International.  As I understand it the special committee announced by the Minister is the response of the Fianna Fáil Government to this report.  In a statement issued by the Minister he indicated, in general, the work the special committee will do and he mentioned, in addition, the names of the people who will form the special committee.  As I see it, he neglected to cover the more important area as to how exactly this committee would work.  There seems to be many procedural points which need clarification in relation to this special committee.  Will this be a judicial committee or will they have powers of sworn inquiry?  I do not know even the broad basis on which this committee will operate.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I am seeking clarification as to the powers of this committee. It appears that they could operate in a number of ways.  They could merely issue a notice that they wished to receive written submissions.  On the other hand, they may hear evidence. If they do, the question is, can they insist on calling witnesses; can they <i>subpoena</i> witnesses?  If they do, can they insist on the attendance of those witnesses?  Can they insist on the production of the documents?  This raises the point that if anybody is appearing before the committee, will he be entitled to legal representation?  Will he be entitled to legal aid in the event of his being entitled to legal representation? These are some of the broad areas that concern my party and myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other question occur to me.  In the event of witnesses being called, what constitutional and legal safeguards will be available to them?  As I see it, the special committee is set up for a specific purpose and in response to a specific situation.  In those circumstances, one can envisage that if there <Col N="346" /> is any substance to allegations that have been made, the persons against whom those allegations have been made, may be called before the committee. This raises further questions. Will these persons be required to answer questions put by the committee? If they answer questions which may incriminate them, can that evidence be used in criminal or civil proceedings before the courts?</P>
    <P>My questions are directed to the fact that there was virtually no information forthcoming on the Minister's statement as to how this committee would operate.  It is very difficult to judge how effective any such committee might be without having complete and detailed information as to the powers of the committee and how they will operate.  While the Minister has suggested what the committee might do, he has not shown how they will do this.  He suggested that they may deal with allegations in general, that they may study the Amnesty Report and that they may seek and obtain further information from Amnesty and then they can, apart altogether from these allegations, suggest safeguards as to future situations.</P>
    <P>This committee is separate from the other matter which was raised at the same time by the Minister, that is, the appointment of a senior Garda officer to the Director of Public Prosecutions to deal with specific allegations. Here again, I am not quite sure where the borderline will be.  As I see it, the special committee will deal with allegations in general.  Allegations in general are the sum of specific allegations. This point again poses considerable difficulty for me in envisaging how this committee might operate. I cannot see how a committee can examine allegations in general without going into the particular.  If they are to go into the particular, they must obtain evidence of particular allegations.  This raises the question of how that evidence can be obtained.</P>
    <P>The Minister should clearly indicate at this stage the entire range and scope envisaged to be the activities of this special committee, how they will operate, exactly what powers they will <Col N="347" /> have, how people appearing before them will be dealt with from the point of view of representation and legal safeguards. Apart from the fact that he should also deal with the other points raised by him in his statement last Friday, he should clearly delineate the boundary of responsibility as between the special committee and the special Garda officer working through the DPP dealing with specific allegations.</P>
    <P>In the main the Minister's statement on this question appears to have been completely unsatisfactory from the point of view of giving anybody any specific idea as to how all these various areas will be covered.  My party feel it is absolutely essential that full and detailed particulars and information be furnished to the House on these points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government considered a report from Amnesty concerning allegations of serious ill-treatment of suspects by members of the Garda Síochána in certain cases where the suspects were being detained under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, or under section 2 of the 1976 Emergency Powers Act.  Having considered the statement the Government decided to deal with the matter in two ways.</P>
      <P>Firstly, as regards the future, to appoint a committee to consider the situation arising from serious allegations and to make recommendations as to whether, and if so what, additional safeguards are necessary for the protection against ill-treatment of persons in Garda custody and for the protection of member of the Garda Síochána against unfounded allegations of such ill-treatment.  Secondly, as regards past events, to make special arrangements whereby such allegations from identifiable persons can be speedily investigated and submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions who is by law the authority in whom is vested the duty to decide if the evidence is sufficient to justify a prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are the bones of the Government decision and I readily accept that there is a great deal of flesh to be put on them.  In the limited time available to me, I will try to deal with <Col N="348" /> the points raised by Deputy E. Desmond, spokesman for the Labour Party and Deputy O'Keeffe, spokesman for the Fine Gael Party.  I thank the speakers from the Labour and Fine Gael Parties for their kind remarks on my appointment as Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss as to how to solve the dilemma of the spokesman for the Labour Party.  I cannot accept everything she said as being as accurate as it should be.  I do not accept that for a number of months now brutality allegations have been made, nor does Amnesty contend that is so.  It is recognised that there is no question of allegations or accusations of brutality occurring for some considerable time. At the time allegations were made in relation to brutality, the Labour Party were part of the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Desmond made a good effort to embarrass me with what I said in this House as recorded in Volumn 296, column 1770 of the Official Report.  I do not deny what I said but I would point out to Deputy Mrs. Desmond that when I said that the Press were coming up daily with accusations of ill-treatment of persons in custody.  I am not aware of what happened at the Labour Party Conference last year.  I had other things to be concerned with at that time, but I accept that what Deputy Mrs. Desmond says is true and that the Labour Party Conference resolved to demand a full independent inquiry into these allegations.  It is a pity that the Labour Party, who were seemingly the people that the Labour Party Conference were talking to did not exercise their political strength at that time and see to it that they be heard. They could have done something about it when they were in Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Desmond says that a full independent inquiry is essential, that the measures that we have taken as a Government are grossly unfair and that the Director of Public Prosecutions' Office is not sufficient to institute investigations into any allegations which are made at present. I do not accept that, nor do I believe that the Fine Gael Party accept it. If my recollection is correct, when <Col N="349" /> Deputy O'Keeffe spoke on the radio last Sunday, he welcomed on behalf of his party the establishment of this committee and said that it was the only course open to the Government to follow.  I accept that it is the only course that can be followed and that is the course the Government are following.</P>
    <P>Although it has no connection, the setting up of a complaints tribunal, as requested by Deputy Mrs. Desmond, could be confused with this.  The question of a permanent complaints tribunal to investigate complaints against the Garda is a matter requiring careful consideration, and this will have to be examined fully in due course. This will take some time to evaluate, and I would certainly not deem it necessary on this occasion.  It is not being ruled out, but it has nothing to do with what is going on at present.</P>
    <P>In relation to the questions raised by Deputy O'Keeffe on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, the committee will decide on its own procedures.  It can invite interested parties to make submissions either in writing or orally but it will not have powers to compel witnesses to attend or give evidence.  It will not investigate specific complains or allegations. It will be looking, as the Deputy said, at the general situation.  The accusations or allegations that have been made are of a serious criminal nature, and because they are of a criminal nature, if a decision is to be made as to whether they are true or <Col N="350" /> not, it is the courts that will decide whether or not they stand up.  This should be clearly understood.  From what I gather, the argument that what the Government are doing is the proper course, is accepted at least generally by the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>As far as I and my Cabinet colleagues are concerned there is absolutely no question that the Garda Síochána as a force is under any sort of cloud.  My Government has nothing but the greatest respect for and confidence in the force.  That respect and confidence are tinged with concern for the dangers to which many of them are subjected in the course of their daily tasks.  The force can be assured that they will continue to receive all the necessary support from me to enable them to continue serving the community in the future as they have done so loyally and well in the past.  The great majority of gardaí will agree with the action which the Government have announced in relation to the Amnesty allegations and they will be more anxious than most to see that if any malpractices have occurred in the past &mdash;I am not passing judgement as to whether they did or not&mdash;they will not be allowed to occur again.  As long as I am Minister for Justice, I assure this House and the country at large, that there will be no room for allegations of such a criminal nature to be made.</P>

    <P>The number of applicants was 1,180.  The scheme was advertised in the national daily newspapers and also on radio and television.  The graduates were called for interview in the colleges of education during the period 6th-16th September, 1977.  The interview <Col N="165" /> boards comprised representatives of my Department and of the college authorities.  The purpose of the interview was to decide as to their general suitability and to test the adequacy of their standard in oral Irish.</P>
    <P>A total of 398 graduates attended the introductory courses which were held in Limerick and Carysfort colleges of education in the last week of September, 1977.  The attendance of the Limerick course was 214 and that at Carysfort 184.</P>

    <P>NOTES</P>
    <P>1.  The total cost of allowing rates as a credit against tax payable would be between £10 and £11 million.  However, rates are already allowed as a deduction in computing taxable income at a cost of some £4 million.  The net additional cost would therefore be about £7 million.</P>
    <P>2.  It is not possible to estimate the amount of rates relating to farm dwellings as valuation lists do not distinguish between agricultural dwellings and other dwellings.</P>
    <P>3.  The cost of £10 million would apply only in the year of change.  Thereafter, a full year's tax would be payable each year.</P>
    <P>4.  The Government's election commitment is that the notional basis of assessment should be provided as an option so that before a farmer is assessed to tax he would have a choice of either the accounts basis or the notional basis. Under the Finance Act 1977 farmers are initially compulsorily assessed on a notional basis but may appeal on the basis of accounts.  Since the difference between the two schemes arises out of the timing of the option, the Government's proposal to allow an initial <Col N="177" /> option has no ultimate cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>If, in 1977/78, all farmers had been compulsorily assessed on the notional basis with no appeal to accounts, the gain to the Exchequer would have been roughly £6 million.  Such a scheme would, however, involve some farmers being asked to pay tax on profits they had not earned.  Because of this factor it was always accepted that any scheme using a notional basis would also provide an option for assessment on an accounts basis.</P>
    <P>5.  The receipts from capital acquisitions tax and the information available to date are not sufficient to enable an estimate to be made of the cost to the Exchequer in a full year of the abolition of this tax on farm land which is transferred from father to son.  It will be appreciated that the nature of this tax <Col N="178" /> is such that the receipts can vary from year to year, being dependent on the number and value of gifts and inheritances in a given year.</P>

    <P>NOTES:</P>
    <P>(a)  The 1971 Census of Population indicated that there were 174,332 households with at least one farmer.  No later figure is available but it is assumed that, in continuation of the downward trend, there has been a decline in farmer numbers.</P>
    <P>(b)  In many cases there are appeals against assessments and until these are finally settled it cannot be said how many of those assessed will be found not to be liable to tax.  The central records kept do not distinguish between liable and non-liable cases and therefore it is not possible to say how many actually paid income tax without examining each individual case assessed.  It is unlikely, however, that the number will be significantly lower than the number shown in column (2).</P>

    <P>(1)  <i>Central Government Aid</i></P>
    <P>The figures for aid from the Central Government are taken from the tables on State Expenditure in relation to agriculture given in the annual Current Budget Tables.</P>
    <P>(2)  <i>Local Authorities Aid</i></P>
    <P>The data have been taken from the publication entitled &ldquo;Local Authority Estimates, 1977 with Provisional Outturn figures for 1976&rdquo; which has been laid before each house of the Oireachtas and published in mid-June 1977.  The figure for 1975 has been calculated in the same manner as those for 1976 and 1977.</P>
    <P>(3)  <i>EEC Aid</i></P>
    <P>The figures for EEC aid include refunds and accession compensatory amounts on exports, production refunds and various aids and premiums as well as incidental expenses in connection with intervention purchases.  They also take account of monetary compensatory amounts (MCA's) which were charged on Irish exports of agricultural produce and paid on Irish agricultural imports, and the UK and Italian monetary import subsidies which have been payable by Ireland since May 1976.  The latter are the main reasons for the substantial increase in the figure for 1977.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture (a) the net cost in a full year of the establishment of a full new medium sized sheep fattening unit in each of the western counties (b) the net cost to the Exchequer in a full year of an increase of 20 per cent in the staffing for the national disease eradication programme and the payment of full compensation to all farmers for any losses (c) the net cost to the Exchequer in a full year of a subsidy of 3 per cent for all loans to all development farmers, and (d) the net cost to the Exchequer in a full year of the introduction of a uniform rate of grants on capital investment at 40 per cent for land improvements, 20 per cent for farm buildings and fixed equipment and a 10 per cent grant on capital investment made by development farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) The current estimated capital cost (excluding working capital) of a modern type lamb fattening unit of 2,000 lamb capacity would be of the order of £60,000.  If a unit of this type and size were to attract a grant of the rate of 30 per cent the cost to the Exchequer would thus be about £18,000.  (b) The annual cost of staffing the bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication schemes at present is estimated at £2.8 million.  An increase of 20 per cent in this staffing would accordingly cost £0.56 million in a full year.  These figures are in <Col N="193" /> respect of salaries of staff employed by my Department on the two schemes and do not include the cost of travelling, subsistence, overtime, accommodation, stationery, and so on.  The net cost to the Exchequer of payment of full compensation to all farmers would be about £16 million, if compensation were based on current average market values, less estimated receipts from salvage.  (c) As information on borrowings by individual farmers is not available, it is not possible to indicate the precise cost.  Assuming that about a quarter of the capital required for fixed investment is borrowed the cost of a 3 per cent interest subsidy to existing development farmers is estimated to be of the order of £0.25 million per year.  The net cost to the Exchequer would, however, depend on whether the interest subsidy was additional to existing capital grants or was wholly or partly in lieu thereof.  (d) Since the majority of farmers are currently eligible for grants at the rate of 50 per cent for land improvement and 30 per cent for farm buildings, introduction of the alternative system quoted would not be likely to involve additional cost to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Registrar of Building Societies that there are at present 20 building societies on the register and that the returns forwarded to him by each society in respect of the year ended 31st December, 1976, show that their office premises at that date were valued at £6,343,858 and their overheads&mdash;namely, staff costs, advertising and office expenses&mdash;amounted to £4,604,444.  By the total operating surplus, I am assuming the question to refer to the surplus of societies after payment of any interest, dividend or bonus to shareholders&mdash;in other words the sum which is available for payment of income tax and transfers to reserves.  This surplus totalled £8,996,364 in 1976.</P>

      <P>The cost to the Exchequer of the subsidy must be affected by adjustments made from time to time in the interest rate payable on ordinary home loans advanced by building societies.  On the basis of an interest rate of 10½ per cent, the cost is estimated to be at the rate of £45,000 a year.  This cost would, however, be offset to some extent by a reduction in income tax relief available to the borrowers.  The subsidy will diminish progressively as the loans are repaid.</P>
