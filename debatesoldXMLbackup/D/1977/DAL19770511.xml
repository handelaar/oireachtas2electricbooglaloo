      <P>On the Order of Business yesterday, I asked your permission Sir, to raise a matter of public and urgent importance, the question of the insertion of an advertisement personalising the Minister for Labour in the offer of public funds to certain employers who would give employment under certain conditions. You ruled the questions I submitted as Private Notice Questions out of order on the grounds of either (1) they were not urgent or (2) they were not of sufficient public importance, or perhaps both.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt about the public importance of what I alleged to be a gross misuse of public funds.  On the question of urgency I argued that it would be possible that a similar advertisement would appear probably today, tomorrow and every day until next Sunday.  The advertisement has appeared in all four daily newspapers today, the three Dublin dailies and <i>The Cork Examiner.</i> In the light of that and of the obvious urgency of the situation and of the acknowledged public importance of the matter, would you now admit that these two would be taken in today's Special Notice Questions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>The first major conclusion that may be drawn from the discussions on this Finance Bill and the effects on the economy of previous Bills is the conclusion that seems to be drawn by the Central Bank, and certainly by us on this side of the House, that, despite extraordinarily high borrowing over the past four years or more by this Government, little or no change has taken place in the level of unemployment.  The national debt has been increased by a little over two and a half times the debt at the beginning of 1973.  This in effect means that the national debt during this year will come to something in the region of £4 billion, that is to say that where all previous Governments from 1922 to 1973 in the servicing of infrastructure area created an overall debt of approximately £1? billion or £1,350 million, the present Government in the following four years have added over £2,500 million to that debt.  Where the servicing of that debt annually is now in or around £400,000,000 per year this Government are responsible for something not very short of £300,000,000 per annum in the annual service of debt.  I cite that because of the conclusion arrived at earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the principal justification for the extraordinary gamble in which this Government have been engaged over the past four years has been the endeavour to achieve one of <Col N="575" /> the original 14 points put forward by the two Coalition Parties early in 1973, the reduction of unemployment under a programme of planned economic development.  The result that we now see is a level of debt far in excess of what a small State like this can afford. At the same time there is little or no progress in the overall aim put forward by the Government.</P>
    <P>The General Review for 1977 of the Central Bank says, and I quote from page 7:</P>
    <P>The outturn in 1976 and the prospects for 1977 indicate that the economy is recovering from the recession of earlier years.  Very little progress has, however, been made in solving the related problems of inflation and unemployment.</P>
    <P>Apart from the disastrous effects of uncontrolled inflation this is the most important critical analysis of this Government's performance.  In that period of a little over four years prices of goods are virtually 100 per cent, or just approaching it, higher than the general level of prices when the Coalition Government took office.</P>
    <P>I referred to the proposals put forward in the famous 14 points of the Coalition.  Point 3 was headed &ldquo;Stopping the Price Rise&rdquo;.  It said that the immediate economic aims of the new Government would be to stabilise prices, halt redundancies and reduce unemployment under a programme of planned economic development. It went on to say that it was essential to control prices if these important economic aims were to be realised and that the Government would, therefore, immediately introduce strict price control.  The Government can really be criticised in relation to those three aims in point 3. Comment on the results we are facing today is not necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about creating more jobs without fuelling inflation as if the past four years had never happened, as if inflation had not been fuelled in a significant measure by the Government's financial policy.  Almost as if it were an election item, the Minister went on to say that the Government <Col N="576" /> anticipated that over the next few months unemployment will fall below 100,000 for the first time in two and a half years.  The Minister must really mean that in the short time before the leaving certificate examinations end because as we know once the school examinations have ended the number of people seeking employment, which will not be available, will be not far short of 40 per cent of the existing level of unemployment as recorded.  This very large number of young people coming on the labour market will have little prospect of a job and they cannot have much confidence in this Government's ability to cope with the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach recently got great cover out of his forecast of the reduced level of inflation to 13 per cent.  One can almost smell an election.  This forecast, if it should prove to be anywhere near right, will probably be influenced by a number of factors.  The economists believe that one of the factors that might help is the recent drop in interest rates introduced by the Bank of England for its own reasons, the reduced rate being partially followed by the Irish banking system.  That fall in inflation, if it takes place, may also be helped by a number of other factors such as some tax remedies, some effort made by the Minister to encourage enterprise, having discouraged it over a period of years during which we pointed out the dangers of the discouragement of enterprise in which the Government were engaged.  The Minister has now introduced some measures of relief long after they were needed, and in the opinion of many, because the Government must face an election and put forward some sort of programme to the public.</P>
    <P>Deputy Halligan in his eagerness to defend the Minister postulates his new principle that no small country has influence over its own rate of inflation, that it must follow the currency to which it is attached.  I agree that Deputy Halligan is partly right but if the argument is to be put forward, that our close connection with the £ is the cause of all our difficulties, then why have we a higher level of inflation <Col N="577" /> than Britain?  Whose fault is that? What is being quite obviously overlooked in the theory of our close association with a neighbouring country is the much more important question of motivation of the community towards creating a better economic state of affairs.  That sort of motivation must begin with the example set by the political leadership in Government. This Government failed the people when it lost its head over the oil crisis, when over a period the Arabs imposed an increase of 12p per gallon and the Government over the same period imposed an additional 35p in tax.  Was this following Britain's lead or was it taking the easy road by cashing in on the oil crisis to evade the consequences of over-borrowing and over-expenditure?</P>
    <P>Some Government Deputies do themselves little credit if they close their eyes to the easy way out policies of the National Coalition.  Apart from the generating of inflation through over-expenditure, the Government's high taxes on petrol, a tax imposed on a transport industry very unlike that in Britain and in very different social circumstances, played a part in increasing the level of unemployment, increasing wage demands with their consequential additional inflationary effect in the follow-up increases in the price of all goods and services.</P>
    <P>The sorry situation of the doubling of prices, the escalation of wages and other costs, arose to a considerable degree from the Government's lack of lead in those earlier years.  In his references to taxation the Minister said he wished to sketch the changes &ldquo;lest eaten bread be forgotten&rdquo;.  He went on to suggest that the taxes were fairer than those under the previous regime and much fairer to the typical manager and worker whose performance was crucial to the future of the country.  I would not suggest that the tax system of the previous regime was perfect.  We all in our own way had criticisms to make from time to time but I wonder if the Minister is really serious when he made the statement I have just referred to.  Even a cursory glance at the statistical table issued in connection with the budget indicates that the beneficiaries <Col N="578" /> from tax changes other than in the company area lie in the small and more privileged £8,500 to £20,000 per annum class of our society.  One can see from that table that allowing for earned income and so far as the vast bulk of tax paying earners were concerned not only was the eaten bread soon forgotten but they found that with reliefs ranging from £1 to £3 per week they had to pay for the bread having eaten it in rapidly increasing costs, the costs of foodstuffs, transport, postal charges, fuel and telephone charges and other items.</P>
    <P>In other words, the increases, following on the budget reliefs and excluding the minority of higher paid categories, outweighed the tax reliefs.  The budget really was not good news after all when one came to think about it and experienced the effects of the increases.</P>
    <P>When the Minister spoke of a major programme of taxation which he has introduced and included in it the ending of death duties he did not mention their replacement by capital gains and gift taxes, the effect of which we have not properly seen yet but which, almost, though not quite, create an as-you-were situation.  Certainly, in the tax area the value so far of some of these new taxes in my opinion has been completely outweighed by the disincentive effect caused by some of the taxes. For example, in the returns for the first four months of this year one finds that corporation taxes showed an increase of £36 million against the first four months of last year and that value-added tax showed a rise of £28 million for the same period as against last year.  The item appearing against capital taxes shows that the Exchequer gained £1 million in the first four months of this year as against £1½ million in the first four months of last year.  The point I am pressing here is the disincentive effect of some tax measures introduced by the Minister especially having regard to the fact that other countries, presumed to be in a better situation than ourselves and also being governed at the time by Labour governments, such as Britain and Australia, abandoned those kind of taxes for the present.  That is what we recommended some years ago to <Col N="579" /> the Minister, not having any fixed ideas against fair taxation.  The important aspect as far as we were concerned was the effect on enterprise, the effect on incentive and the benefit that can be obtained from a good incentive policy and I do not think the Government's capital gains tax at a fixed rate of 26 per cent, whether that 26 per cent is levied on a hard worked business run for a lifetime or on the area which Fianna Fáil favour, the speculator's fast profit through buying and selling property at the expense, perhaps, of some less able individual, could possibly be regarded as a fairer tax.</P>
    <P>One is driven to wonder what the effect of this tax will be in some years' time, particularly if the Government maintain their inflationary record and do not allow for the effects of inflation in assessing tax.  Despite the blunders of his earlier tax Bills, which were avoided by other Governments, it is encouraging to find the Minister saying the Government must be concerned to encourage development anywhere it can increase employment and add to the produced wealth of the nation.  During the debates on some of the tax Bills, the Opposition said similar things so often that the Minister must have got them off by heart.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the building industry the Minister referred to the stamp duty relief on office buildings. Nowhere can I find in his provisions any hope for young couples who do not qualify for SDA or local authority houses.  Surely the Minister must know that, if you are in the 22-year-old to 30-year-old bracket and you are not in the category that can qualify you for public housing, you have little or no hope of being able to acquire a home unless you are in the minority to which I referred earlier, the privileged level of £8,500 to £20,000.  I wonder when will the Minister wake up to the fact that inflation, for which he and his Government have a considerable responsibility, has closed the door on the young middle classes so far as house purchase is concerned.  It may create a situation similar to that <Col N="580" /> in the past when their only hope lay in emigration to solve their financial problems and to seek better opportunities elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Even if the Minister is unaware of the plight of young people who cannot cope with the inflated costs of housing, he ought to take note of recent economic comments on the construction industry.  I refer to an article in a paper on Monday last headed &ldquo;Outlook remains fairly bleak&rdquo;.  In the course of the article the commentator says:</P>
    <P>Unemployment in the industry continues at a very high level with a reputed 25,000 building workers unemployed. Figures published by the Central Statistics Office last week show that the number of building workers in the private sector unemployed during February was 13% above the average unemployment level in 1975.</P>
    <P>These figures seem certain to increase, as firms in the sector continue to lay off workers.</P>
    <P>On Friday one firm announced that it was going to make 250 workers, general and administrative, redundant over the next month while redundancies were also announced by other firms on the same day.  That firm attributed the redundancies to the continuing depressed state of demand for building materials, and the fact that it could foresee no improvement in the level of building activity in the future.  The firm said that the depressed level of demand was evident both in the public and private sectors, though it had been perticularly hard hit &ldquo;by the severe cut-back in road expenditure in the past two years&rdquo;.  Further on the statement indicates that increases already this year suggest that the level of prices in that sector has already increased by 15 per cent.  So much for an inflation rate of 13 per cent, if housing prices are already up by 15 per cent in the first four months of this year.  The Minister's financial policy as represented in this and previous Bills does not measure up to what our community <Col N="581" /> needs, although I would acknowledge that the latest effort represents some improvement in the area of encouraging incentives.</P>
    <P>One of the great dangers which lies in an Opposition revealing their ideas about the economy, as Fianna Fáil did last autumn in their emergency economic package then published, is that the Government may latch on to some of the ideas, perhaps, because the Opposition have created a favourable climate.  If, as in the present case, the Government are merely trying to get away from the consequences of their own bad management, and they use some good ideas, but lack the overall confidence which the Opposition would have in their own thinking, they may just succeed in putting the economy in a worse situation than if the Opposition had remained silent.  The danger I see is that good ideas can work once but frequently not a second time, and we as a community may run out of options to restore the economy in the way Fianna Fáil proposed in their published economic package.</P>
    <P>One of the most questionable things which has occurred this year is the effect the imminence of a general election appears to have had on members of the Government over the past few weeks.  The instance mentioned by our party leader this morning of the Minister for Labour publishing his name and photograph in the Press at the taxpayers' expense is one example of how anxious Ministers have become and, I would suggest, a most unpleasant example.  In the past few weeks we have heard so much good news that the unfortunate elector who has to decide who the next Government should be may think everything in the garden is rosy.  Presumably that is the intention behind some of the recent statements.</P>
    <P>Factories seem to be about to spring up all over the country.  The Taoiseach says the inflation rate will fall.  The Tánaiste is forecasting thousands of jobs.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce talked in the United States about £90 million fresh capital for the establishment of new industry.  We know that even if things go well and the firms concerned go ahead with their plans in most cases it is unlikely that jobs will be provided before the <Col N="582" /> early eighties.  Never mind, it sounds good so long as the voters can be influenced just this once.  One can sense the atmosphere of people saying to themselves &ldquo;Let us think up all the bright promises before we have to go to the country&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>However, in the final analysis it is the people who must decide.  There is no easy way for an economy, not with promises or rosy pictures to it.  The people must be offered a fresh start and this can only be provided by a political leadership that has confidence in its ability, as we have on this side of the House.  The motivating force of confidence and a belief in the community's will to master the economy is the spirit that exists here and which appears to be sadly lacking on the Government's side.  The people will have to make their choice when the opportunity presents itself, as it will in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise the frustration of the Opposition.  It was quite evident in the last few minutes of Deputy Brugha's speech when he referred to the Government and certain Ministers making statements about industry and job creation.  He said we were making promises because it was nearing election time in an effort to fool people.  It is not possible to fool people because they have commonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present situation is due to the recession of the last three years which has affected the western world.  We are coming out of the recession slowly and, consequently, jobs will be coming on stream.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce who has been abroad on promotional tours has come back with good news.  We are told that there will be a substantial investment which will lead to greater job creation.  One does not indulge in election gimmicks with that kind of news.  Our problem is that of unemployment and it is the responsibility of the Government to do something about it.  That is what the budget has been about.  We want to create the right climate to encourage the business world into further investment. The tax reforms this year are a typical example of the intention of the Government to ensure that business is <Col N="583" /> not impeded.  The reduction in corporation tax is a positive step and reports from the various business organisations indicate that there is an up-turn in the economy.  That is very encouraging.</P>
    <P>We must create between 30,000 and 40,000 new jobs each year to meet the needs of our people.  That will be a mammoth task.  It will take courage on the part of the Government.  The one thing that can be said about this Government is that they are united and strong and have a sense of purpose. Deputy Brugha said that his party were an Opposition of ideas and unity and he said in government they would have the will to do the job. The Deputy is not fooling anybody on that score.  All of us know the divisions that exist on the far side of the House; the Members there are Haughey men, Colley men, Lynch men or something else.  That kind of situation will not create any kind of confidence.  The people are not slow to realise the score when they consider the alternative to this Government.  There is no doubt that Fianna Fáil are totally divided and cannot give any sense of leadership at present.</P>
    <P>When the people are given the opportunity to vote they will quite clearly return the present Government to office.  They realise that this Government came into office when things were bad throughout the world.  We weathered the storm fairly well although I accept that unemployment has risen.  Even if we did not have the recession we would have had unemployment problems because during the years our industries were overprotected; they were allowed to run down, they did not re-equip and they could not compete.  In addition to that existing problem of unemployment we also had to cope with the recession and this was a double-edged sword against the Government.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances so far as possible the Government cushioned the people against the worst effects of the recession by giving good social welfare benefits.  It was only right that the least well-off section should have been protected against the cold winds of recession.  The Government's record on social welfare can be <Col N="584" /> examined closely and it will stand up to that examination.  I do not believe that giving social welfare is the only thing that a Government should do but I believe that in the particular situation in which we found ourselves the Government had the courage to make the right decisions.</P>
    <P>I believe that we will have to have a mixed type of enterprise board to look after job creation.  All the financial institutions and the Government should be brought together to ensure that there is absolute cohesion through the business world and in conjunction with the Government.  The day has gone when the Government wave a magic wand and everything is put right.  All sections of the community must play effective roles within society to ensure that we attain our aim of full employment.  The Government can make certain incentives available but unless industry and the agricultural community avail of them they do not achieve very much.  I am always a bit wary of boards because once they are set up they tend to get bigger and do not necessarily achieve much beyond that.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should look at the idea of setting up a State enterprise board to look after job creation. Former Coalition Governments set up boards and semi-State bodies to deal with industry and these have proved very effective and have stood the test of time.  We should look at the situation now to see how we can get all these agencies together to ensure that all our efforts are in the right direction.  I am confident that given another four years to get on with the job that benefits will start to accure from now on.</P>
    <P>There has been a slight recession in the building industry which, basically, has been on the side of office development. Most other businesses took a knock during the recession.  Now that there have been concessions in relation to stamp duty I believe that office development will improve.  When developers see an up-turn in commercial development they will get back into office development which will bring the building industry back into full production.</P>
    <P>The Government's record in relation to house building is first class.  They <Col N="585" /> were committed to a programme of roughly 25,000 houses a year and that has been maintained.  Large sums of money have been allocated to house building over the last four years.  In Dublin city this year £25 million is to be spent on local authority housing. That does not take into account the SDA loans and grants.  The money which is still flowing into building societies is also playing an active part in the industry and is an indication of the confidence in the country.</P>
    <P>The Government did not have an office building commitment.  There has been a downturn in this side of the development because of the recession. I believe, now that we are coming out of it, that this side of the industry will also develop.  There seem to be misleading statements coming from the various building federations about a down-turn of this development.  They should realise the amount of money the Government have pumped into the building industry and they should examine the facts before they start to make false statements.</P>
    <P>The taxation changes in the budget are only a follow on to what the Government have been attempting to do since they came to office.  The Minister for Finance has worked tremendously hard to try to get some semblance of workability within the tax code.  He has also introduced a new form of taxation, wealth tax, capital gains tax and inheritance tax.  He did that under great opposition.  Now that it has been done I do not see the same opposition or business or wealth flying out of the country.</P>
    <P>It is important that a nation has a proper tax system and ensures that there is equity.  Under the former system the people under PAYE paid their full share of taxation.  The Minister for Finance ensured that the net was widened and that all forms of tax avoidance are stopped as far as possible. The returns prove how successful he has been in getting in tax.  We can then set out about paying better social welfare payments and have greater creation of jobs and more money invested.</P>
    <P>It took courage to tax the farming <Col N="586" /> community for the first time.  The political thing would be to have left it alone.  The honest thing was to ensure that everybody paid his way.  All sections of society benefit from all the Government services.  Health, education and social welfare are paid for out of taxation.  I believe that we all have a duty to make our contribution and I have no doubt that the farming community feel the same way.  Nobody likes paying tax.  It tends to create problems when certain people are taxed for the first time but I believe the farming community have accepted this.</P>
    <P>The Minister has shown courage in the attitude he adopted.  He has not acted in a party political way.  Indeed, it would not be right for him to act in such a way.  We are here to govern and to give leadership.  This Government and our Taoiseach have given the leadership that is necessary and I am convinced that when the people go to the polls again, they will return us to office on the basis of our record which speaks for itself.  We hear much talk of inflation and of price rises but the basic fact remains that living standards have improved during our time in office.  This is no mean achievement when one has regard to the various factors with which we have had to contend. With our re-election for a further term at least, the people can look forward to prosperity in the eighties and nineties.  The potential for development is great.  We now have a worthwhile mining industry and, hopefully, there will be further gas finds.  These considerations coupled with the developments in our agricultural industry augur well for a bright future.  Ours is a small nation but our impact on Europe is significant.  Our Ministers have fought hard abroad for the best deals possible for us.  At all times they are prepared to play an effective role within the EEC and within the arena of world politics generally.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this year's budget can be regarded as a springboard for our entire economy.  The potential is there but we must harness it to the best possible advantage.  That is why I say that we must have effective overall planning.  I am confident <Col N="587" /> that the course being taken by the Government will produce the 30,000 to 40,000 jobs that are necessary to keep our people at work.  It is noteworthy that there has been virtually no emigration since we came to office.  That is a factor in our unemployment figures being so high.  I was always of the opinion that the best of our people emigrated, the ones with flair and drive who wished to move on to other places.  However, the tendency now is for them to stay at home, thereby giving us the benefit of their qualities.</P>
    <P>Although not necessarily related to the Finance Bill, the whole area of education is worth mentioning at this stage.  Our entire education system needs re-structuring in order to equip people to meet the needs of this technological age.  We must place greater emphasis on technical education as opposed to academic achievements. This is an area in which money would be well spent because if we are to develop our potential to the full we must have ready the trained personnel to take up the slack when the jobs become available: otherwise, we shall miss the boat.  We must have expertise at all levels but it is in the sphere of education that we must begin.</P>
    <P>I am happy with the present state of the nation.  We are moving in the right direction.  From reading the various business and finance columns in newspapers and magazines, it is obvious that there is a positive upturn in the economy.  This improvement has resulted from the policies adopted in this year's budget, especially in the area of tax reform.  Overall, tax reforms have been opposed down through the years but in the future people will realise how correct the Minister has been in the policies he has adopted in this regard.  The extra revenue that will be available to the Exchequer will allow us to develop further our resources and it is only by developing our resources that we will create the level of employment that is necessary.  These, then, are some of the reasons for my looking forward to this Government being returned to office.  During the coming four years they will have the opportunity of <Col N="588" /> bringing to fruition their efforts of the past four years.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay a special tribute to the Minister for Finance who, since his appointment, has had to contend with criticism from practically every organisation.  He has been hard working and diligent in carrying out his duties and the results of his efforts will be seen in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>The Minister's speech this year on the Finance Bill was very different from the sort of speech we are accustomed to on the Finance Bill each year.  I have just been pondering how different the situation would be if the script had been written during the first year in office of the Government. We must concern ourselves seriously with the element of political chicanery that prevails throughout the whole effort of manipulation by the Government of government business.  I cannot refer to their policy since they do not have one.  The Minister's speech was the most blatant piece of effrontery on the political side that this House has ever been subjected to. Indeed, the first nine pages are nothing short of jingoistic soapbox oratory more suitable to the hustings. The speech actually finished with an appeal to the electorate.  This is the most serious Bill that comes before this House in that it is supposed to indicate what the Government are doing and what the effect will be of the budgetary proposals.  It is supposed to point the way to what the Government will do in the future based on what they have been doing in the past.</P>

    <P>Yesterday's performance was a sorrowful one and, divorced from its political content, the speech leaves a great deal of room for serious thought in regard to the future.  If the speech were being drafted for the Minister in the first year of a new Government's life it would be a very different speech from what it was in the last year of this Government's life virtually on the eve of an election.  Everybody is concerned about what the future holds. There has been a good deal of speculation in the last few weeks, <i>Old Moore Almanac</i> type of predictions about the jobs that will be created and what may <Col N="589" /> happen.  We are now hoping that the change in world conditions will rub off to the extent here that we will benefit.</P>
    <P>What have we done in the past to prepare for the better upturn in the economy now predicted?  That is a position we have to consider seriously. Undoubtedly the improvement in world conditions is bound to have some effect here if the stage is set to take full advantage of the improvement. But is it?  Money to be channelled into investment for job creation is the keynote.  Will we have money to use for that purpose?  If we have, how will it be used?  There is no indication in all the political talk to which we have been listening and in the assurances that have been given that that will happen.  We know that £1 out of every £5 collected in revenue will go to service debt built up by borrowing in the last few years of mismanagement. We know that our balance of payments is in a fairly serious condition. We are certain that if there is an improvement in economic conditions this balance of payments will come under serious pressure, pressure to the extent that we could have a really serious balance of payments problem because nothing has been done by the Minister to protect our current balance of payments position.  We are now in a position where any improvement in world economic conditions is not likely to take effect here as rapidly as it should or could were the proper policies operated.</P>
    <P>Looking at the Minister's speech one notices he takes credit for certain things which have not yet happened and, if they do happen, will not be due to any action by the Government.  The opening theme deals with the way in which our taxation system has been reformed.  This is laughable because the position now is that everybody pays more tax than he paid before. The Minister boasts that he has widened the base of taxation.  He has spread the taxation net so far, in other words, that even old age pensioners have been paying tax and, in shame, the Minister had to take some steps to obviate the need for old age pensioners to pay tax.  What happened was that <Col N="590" /> in the budget to which this Bill gives effect certain adjustments were made to cope with inflation.  The 20 per cent inflation in the past year, the 100 per cent inflation since the Minister took office, has thrown things completely out of gear and it is absolutely necessary that there should be downward adjustments to meet that situation. The inflationary spiral has engulfed more people in taxation and has left those who were subject to taxation in the past paying much more than would be justifiable in normal circumstances. The Minister, after four years of serious inflation, has now repented for reasons which are fairly obvious and has made some effort to repair the damage he has already done.</P>
    <P>One reference in his speech to what he has been doing this year is laughable. He refers to domestic inflation and he says: &ldquo;We are still unfortunately influenced by imported inflation&rdquo;&mdash;this is what all our trouble was blamed on in the past&mdash;&ldquo;but domestic inflationary influences on incomes and fiscal fronts are now under better control.  In two deliberate ways the Government are this year making a contribution to easing the rate of inflation.&rdquo;  I have frequently asked here why the Minister or any member of the Government has never apologised for not taking action to control domestic inflation in the past. If the Deputy who has just spoken is not content with the speech he has just made I think he could do better than engage the Minister for Finance in distraction.  If the Minister is not prepared to listen to what is going on in this House, he should get out and let somebody else sit in his place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pointing out that the Minister has not once come in to this House to apologise to the people or explain why the action he takes in this Bill was not taken in every other budget he piloted through the House in the past four years and, God knows, there were quite a number of them.  This is referred to as the sixth budget but in fact it must be about the twenty-sixth.  We have now engendered a system of extracting the proverbial blood from a stone by imposing taxes in the interim period between budgets. The most serious imposition of taxes in which the Minister took part was that implemented by statutory order which went through this House in four or five minutes.  Those were the budgets which really took effect.</P>
      <P>For a number of years we have been sick listening to the Minister and other Government members stating that due to factors beyond their control this, that or the other was happening. But the Government, when they came near the end of their term of office, suddenly discovered there were a lot of things they could do.  They began then unwinding the serious imposition of taxes which had fuelled inflation, crippled employment and made it impossible for the industrialist to exist.  Why does the Minister not explain why the action he is taking now was not taken in a previous budget?  It has been pointed out frequently, and must again, that 25 per cent of the increase in the cost of living last year was due to budgetary action.  The Minister's imposition of taxes was responsible for 25 per cent of the increase in the consumer price index last year.  Why?  The answer is obvious to everybody, and I shall come to that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we are being given some relief. When we issued our policy document in September last on how to deal with the economic emergency in the short-term we spelled out a number of important things we proposed.  But the <Col N="592" /> Minister for Finance, the following day, cynically criticised the taking of any such action and said it was impracticable. One of our proposals was the immediate provision of money for the relief of unemployment.  One of the many others we made was the removal of rates from private dwellings. These proposals were criticised as being impracticable and not justified. Yet the Minister, in this budget, saw fit to copy&mdash;even to a small degree&mdash;the exact proposals made in that paper.  While he did not see fit to abolish rates on private dwellings, he did abolish one quarter, the half of the second moiety.  That enabled the Government to send round a leaflet to every ratepayer telling him of the gift he would receive with the payment of the second moiety of his rates.  It is all part of the political campaign for which public money is being used every day and which will continue unless the Committee of Public Accounts take serious action&mdash;as it is their duty to do&mdash;to check the misappropriaion of moneys now rampant in what is one of the biggest exercises of political corruption this country has experienced for a long time.  It may not stop there, when one sees&mdash;as has been pointed out recently&mdash;a Minister having his photograph and facsimile of his signature published in the Press bearing the caption: &ldquo;I'll pay you £20 per week for every extra person you employ&rdquo;.  No doubt the Minister for Finance will follow up with his photograph and signature, saying &ldquo;I am reducing corporation tax by £10&rdquo;.  Big deal.  Having scourged people for the past four years, they should feel good getting a little easement now.</P>
    <P>Is that the type of Government the country deserves?  Is that the type of Government the people went out to elect in 1973?  Was that the type of Government they expected when they supported the two parties now forming the Coalition?  They had something to guide them then.  Going before the people that time the Coalition were somewhat different from previous occasions; they came together before the election and drafted a policy document. On the two previous occasions they did not do that.  They came together <Col N="593" /> after the election.  On the last occasion they came together beforehand and agreed on the policy points on which they could work together, pledging themselves to the manifesto they published.  Therefore the people, when they did support them, had some guidance.  In the coming election they will be judged on the basis of how they honoured or dishonoured that pledge.  I would strongly recommend to the people on this occasion that their main criterion should be an assessment of past performance.  &ldquo;We will stop the price rise.&rdquo;  That was one of the 14 points and another was &ldquo;We will stabilise the cost of living and reduce unemployment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister yesterday was boasting that unemployment could be well below the 100,000 mark this summer. That is a marvellous thing to boast about but we must remember that they said they would reduce unemployment and stop the price rise.  Our people have become so stunned by the continuous increases in prices that they, like the Government, throw up their hands in despair.  We all know of the many items that increased in price recently but many other things one must purchase have increased a great deal more in the last four years.  One does not know whether one is paying ten times the price charged in 1973 or not.  Apparently, nobody cares and nobody is paying the slightest attention.</P>
    <P>The Minister uttered serious words when he was on the threshold of a wage agreement last December.  He gave us all a solemn warning then and told us that it would be unwise for anyone to assume as certain the tax cuts which the Government wanted to give in the 1977 budget.  He said the tax cuts would be possible only if there was pay restraint and that despite improvement in the economy and the budgetary position in 1976 there were still many difficulties in the nation's financial position.  The Minister said that while the gap between tax revenue and necessary expenditure remained unacceptably wide it would be lunacy to try to widen it by even more foreign borrowing.  He said that if pay rates rise too fast and too high more tax, not less, would have to be <Col N="594" /> collected to meet a swollen public sector pay bill.  The Minister also said that facts were facts, even if unpopularity was the reward for stating them. This is not a time for unpopularity. That was all right in trying to get the workers to accept an element of pay restraint.  The Minister was facing up to the realities of this situation then but it is a different ball game now.  We are now on the platform and the Minister is appealing to the electorate.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech yesterday, most of which could be described as an election speech, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>Taxpayers would be well advised in their own interests to be distrustful of those who would freely spend money which only the taxpayer can supply.</P>
    <P>The taxpayer has been supplying money <i>ad lib</i> over the last four years and if he was distrustful he had good reason to be.  He has got his belly full of tax imposition during that time and he has every right to be distrustful. The Minister went on with this final appeal before he jumped off the election platform:</P>
    <P>If electors support grandiose expenditure proposals, they will only have themselves to blame if tax rates rise again to pay for them. This course does not commend itself to this Government who want to see the tax concessions of the 1977 budget retained and improved upon.  A careful balance will therefore have to be maintained to preserve a sensible level of public expenditure and a tolerable level of taxation.</P>
    <P>There was no applause after that but there would have been had the Minister been at a crossroads.  The people have not merely been scourged with new taxes and consequential increases in prices but they have witnessed those taxes being imposed to pay public sector incomes.  They witnessed money being borrowed in millions to be used for purposes other than productive development.  They realise that no effort was made to channel money collected in taxes or borrowed into <Col N="595" /> productive development to protect existing employment let alone to create new employment.  They are told now that the position has changed dramatically&mdash;to use the Minister's own word&mdash;and this will all happen now.  There is a change of heart and the advice given to the Minister by this side of the House frequently and by those who were in a position to advise him that he was moving in a wrong direction is now being accepted.</P>
    <P>The Minister knew he was moving in the wrong direction but he had to look over his shoulder and ensure that those sitting behind him were kept happy or otherwise the show would have broken up and we would again have two separate parties.  That is why the country has been suffering the evils we have experienced in the last four years.  It is only now, for the purpose of trying to buy another period in office, that an effort is being made to ease the damage done in the past. A lot of money is required if we are to have productive development.  We expect the main growth area to be manufacturing industry and that growth requires three things which were expressed last night on television by the world famous economist, Mr. Galbraith.  When asked about the hopes for this country he said that if prices and incomes could be restrained and the competitiveness of our goods protected certain progress could be made.  One did not need to be the author of uncertainty to make that statement.</P>
    <P>One of the questions of last year's leaving certificate examination dealt with the same point in a different way. It is elementary.  Why did the Minister not practise that in the years past? When the greatest possible restraint is required in relation to prices and incomes and the competitiveness in production required protection why was it not applied?  Why did we go on borrowing and taxing to pay for unproductive things?  Nobody will answer that question but everybody really knows that the reason is the conflict of political philosophy and opinion, the dichotomy in a Government comprised of two diametrically <Col N="596" /> opposed ideologies.  That is the reason why we have not had the type of policy that would be needed to ensure that the inflationary period&mdash;which was undoubtedly world-wide&mdash;would least affect the economy and that we could minimise its effect.</P>
    <P>No member of the Government ever gets up to talk without starting off by saying &ldquo;Due to this terrible world recession such as has never been experienced before, we have been coming through a difficult time and we are now emerging from it due to the excellent way the Government have handled the situation.&rdquo;  We are sick and tried of listening to that.  This imported inflation&mdash;and exported inflation also plays a part&mdash;is being over-played and exaggerated.  The Government are really making excuses for their failure to handle the situation as it should have been handled.  If we import raw materials which have gone up in price, naturally that increase will be reflected in the manufactured goods.  If we export goods for sale to markets where they obtain a high price, naturally the price in the home market will be higher too.  We refer to that as exported inflation. These two inflations do play a part but the extent to which domestic inflation affects the situation would have diminished by now had it been properly handled.  Our unemployment figures should be less than half of what they are present.  If Fianna Fáil had continued in power, prices would have increased by one-third of what the increase was and in some cases not at all over that period.  The Government's excuse about the increase in the price of oil has been blown sky-high because the Arabs put 12p on to the price of oil, whereas our own Minister put 35p on.  If it was a serious imposition by the Arabs to increase the price of energy in this country, then the Minister made sure that he did twice as well&mdash;more than twice in fact.  Why?</P>
    <P>In the Government, with an ultrasocialist mix, does anybody realise that at present motoring is rapidly becoming confined exclusively to the wealthier people?  Can any workingman afford to pay the increased tax on a motor car with the huge increases in insurance, if he is lucky enough to get it?  The <Col N="597" /> price of his driving licence is increased and there is even an increased fee for the boy or girl who applies for a driving test.  There is a desperate disparity between the prices of our motor vehicles and those of other countries. We import the assembled cars and we sell them at approximately £2,000 each dearer than do the countries from which we import them.  We were boasting that in our improving standard of living the motor car was becoming the commonplace mode of conveyance for our workingclass people and for everybody. People had a right to expect that.  Now while many people are hanging on to ownership of a car, the cost per week to keep a 10 or 12 hp car on the road, taking into consideration depreciation, original cost, petrol, tax and insurance, is about £30 per week. Can any workingman afford that?</P>
    <P>The same applies to other things. We had reached the stage in an improved standard of living where central heating was becoming the norm and an ordinary amenity enjoyed by everybody.  The Minister saw an opportunity for this beautiful reform of taxation in the oil for central heating.  The poorer people who were beginning to enjoy central heating were left shivering but the wealthier people continue to enjoy it.  These matters are the outcome of bungling and pursuing a day-to-day line in the management of the country's affairs without any agreed plan, policy or programme.  Speaking the other day on the IDA Bill, I mentioned this and I want to go over the ground again.</P>
    <P>On television last night Mr. Galbraith said that no Government can go anywhere without a programme and a policy.  We must have the guidelines, and it is no answer to say that we had the first, second and third programmes for social and economic development in the past and that we did not always realise the targets set.  Certainly we did not.  These targets may be surpassed, they may not be reached or we may be blown completely off course but it is essential to know what we are trying to do and where we are going.  It is essential for private enterprise to know what the Government have planned <Col N="598" /> and what their intentions are and what the future is likely to hold.  Nobody can improve the economy who does not know what the policy of the Government is or what the programme is likely to be.  That would be government by hit and miss, trial and error, hoping that tomorrow will bring something.</P>
    <P>I quoted Mr. Galbraith.  I was interested when he pointed out last night that to control inflation and manage an economy were much easier in a small country than in a large country. I totally agree because the components are easily available.  One has not the same home market but that is not an essential element to planning and programming. It is essential for manufacturing industry to test the market where there is quantity control and quality control and so on.  We need a small home market but the main hope for this country is exports.  If we are to expand we must export.  Exports must be protected by ensuring their competitiveness in the markets in which they are sold.  In the past the weakness of sterling gave us an advantage in the non-sterling countries.  The advantage has eroded by increased unit costs at home.  It is not an exaggeration to say that nobody paid any attention to this.  No effort was made to protect unit costs and the overall problem of incomes and prices restraint was not tackled.  The Government allowed the economy to run amok.  Now the Government are boasting about the extent of social welfare payments most of which are taken up by the extending unemployment queue.  The old age pensioner could buy more for £6.50 in 1973 than he can now buy for the £12.  We have got nowhere.  The great improvements in social welfare payments promised by both parties which should have accrued as a result of our entry to the EEC as a result of our not having to meet agricultural subsidies are now eroded.  Instead of social welfare recipients being better off than they were in 1973 they are worse off.  Hardware and other household items which are not included in the consumer index calculation, which must be purchased, have increased outrageously. <Col N="599" /> A pair of shoes that an old age pensioner could buy for £5 in 1973 now costs £16 or £17 and the 4p stamp now costs 10p.</P>
    <P>We are told that the Bill before us is towards an amelioration of the serious tax problem we have created. We are told that it is a tremendous example of tax reform.  The Minister has extended tax to everybody and everybody is paying more now than ever before.  We had wealth tax, capital gains tax, acquisition tax and every type of tax that could be thought of and the Minister boasted that he abolished estate duty.  I credit the Revenue people with the most resourceful minds in the country.  Each time a new tax is imposed they say that it is for one's benefit, that only a few people will be hit and that it is not worth talking about but every time the net widens.</P>
    <P>Only farmers with £100 valuation are to be taxed.  When speaking on the budget in relation to farmers' tax, I said it was only a matter of time until every farmer in Ireland would be accountable for his entire operation during the year.  That situation is not far away.  There was some misunderstanding in relation to farmers' taxation where farmers engaged in a profession or trade would be included in the tax net.  In the western seaboard area 95 per cent of farmers have non-economic holdings and they seek to supplement their incomes by seeking employment off the land.  The Minister will point out that the tax applies only in relation to a profession or trade but how many small farmers operating a few acres in Donegal, Mayo or Leitrim are tradesmen who occasionally go out and build a shed or a byre for a neighbour or a house or who may be plasterers occasionally when work permits?  This type of person will be discouraged.  He will be compelled to keep accounts and he will be taxable on any income from the land.  This will apply if any member of his household is likewise engaged.  This is a disincentive to off-farm employment.  At the moment it does not apply to a person paying PAYE.  Like every other tax, it always <Col N="600" /> applied from the £50 valuation limit. That has been removed.  How easily can it be removed from the trade and profession types so that it will be applicable to every taxpayer?  It was a step in the wrong direction and I seriously warn the Minister to get off that course.  These people are the salt of the earth, the base of our culture, and they have suffered the brunt of our toughest years of recession more than any other class in our society.  Let us not be too quick to jump on the lower echelon of the farming community.</P>
    <P>We hear nothing but good news these days&mdash;every time the Minister opens his mouth he has good news. The rate of price increases is reported in a restrained way.  Price increases are now left as the third or fourth item in the news.  There is only passing reference to the fact that the Minister has sanctioned price increases for such and such items.  The newspapers now publish only such things as the Minister's supposed handouts.  Large advertisements appear in the provincial newspapers about all the social welfare benefits.  These notices cost thousands of pounds and they are supposed to by by way of providing information. There is one bit of information that people do not get, information that is essential for them to have.  It is that if UK pensioners here get an increase in their pensions their Irish old age pensions will be correspondingly decreased. This is particularly severe in the traditional emigration counties. The small print in pension books contains the information that any change in means must be reported, but very few people are able to read that. People who received increases in their UK pensions and who did not report it for six or seven months because they were not aware they had to, found that they received no Irish pension for several months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to leave it because it is sickening.  We have been told there is a turn in the economic tide.  If we are to take advantage <Col N="601" /> of any such improvement we should have been preparing for it at least two years ago.  Will we now be in a position to take full advantage of the expected improvement?  Because of Government mismanagement we will not.  We are facing the crippling burden of servicing borrowed money to the extraordinary figure of £1 in every £5. In addition, unless we are very careful we will be faced with a serious balance of payments deficit.  We have not been creating more jobs or more production and consequently when the economy gains momentum we will not be prepared for it or produce any rapid development which would enable us to take advantage of an upturn in the economies of other countries.  This is largely because of the millstone of debt put around our necks by the Coalition's mismanagement which has fuelled the fires of inflation and thrown the whole economy out of gear.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the handouts he has been able to give.  At best, that is only small compensation for his past deeds, for the burdens he himself has laid on the people.  No matter how much rhetoric the Government may indulge in they cannot much longer escape the opprobrium of the people. Soon they will have to deal with an electorate who are sufficiently intelligent to analyse the situation.  They will not any longer be satisfied with such promises as those contained in the 14-point programme put before them in February, 1973.  As the saying goes &ldquo;Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me&rdquo;.  The electorate will have no cause to be ashamed this time.  They will not accept any of the rosy predictions being flung at them.  They will pass judgement on the stewardship of a Government who have so badly mismanaged the affairs of the country that it will take the new Fianna Fáil Government some time to repair them and bring the country back, as we had to do before, on to the road to progress and real expansion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by taking up one of the points made by Deputy Brennan in regard to the opening sentences in the Minister's <Col N="602" /> introductory speech.  The Minister referred to this, his sixth Finance Bill. He said quite correctly that this was not the sixth budget he had introduced, or the sixth Finance Bill.  We have had one budget after another by sleight of hand, by trick-o'-the-loopery as Deputy Colley, our spokesman on Finance, has referred to on many occasions, by probably the most infamous Minister for Finance since the foundation of the State.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is not parliamentary, I will put it in another way&mdash; the most inefficient Minister for Finance since the foundation of the State.  History will judge the accuracy of that.  The Minister said statistics indicate that the rate of inflation will be reduced.  We all received the annual report of the Bank of Ireland this morning.  It predicted a rate of inflation of 14 per cent for this year.  I would not consider that far below the figure predicted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce who said it would be below 15 per cent.  This table states that these figures were prepared in February of this year, long before the numerous increases in prices which must now number over 100 were granted by the Prices Commission.</P>
      <P>For example, we had an increase in telephone charges which was phenomenal. The black and white television licence went up from 1st April of this year from £16 to £18.50.  The colour television licence has been increased from £27 to £31 as from 1st April, an increase of £4.  It may be said that television is a luxury item but many old people who are not of pensionable age have nothing else to rely on and some people do not qualify for a free television licence because they are not living on their own.  Television is very important to many people.  There is not a murmur.  People are so numb that the Government take their silence for acceptance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not entirely agree with one statement made by my colleague, Deputy Brennan.  He said we were on the eve of an election.  I am one of the <Col N="603" /> few people in this House who believe the election will not come for a while. It may depend on what the next figures are likely to be.  I predict in this House on 11th May, 1977, that the figure of 14 per cent predicted in this report is wrong and that it will be over 15 per cent and most likely closer to the 18 per cent we had last year.  I do not want to be a Jeremiah but I know the feelings of the public about the cost of living, and the way prices have increased. Virtually all the benefits in the budget have been wiped out with very few exceptions.  One exception are those people who have an income of £10,000 or more and who got tax reliefs.  Under that figure, any concessions given have been wiped out.  When I said the Taoiseach would get an extra £38 a week because of the tax relief I was wrong.  I thought he was getting £20,000 but I believe it is approximately £15,000 and he will get an increase of £30 a week only, the poor man.  That will upset the man who was to get only £1 or £2 or £3 a week but that has been wiped out. The report of the marvellous concession which is circulating around the country at the moment about a 25 per cent rates relief&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about taxation measures and reliefs.  The Minister talked about the reliefs he gave but I want to talk about one of the reliefs he says he has given but which he has not given, that is, the 25 per cent rates relief on private dwellings. Due to the withdrawal of subsidies by the Government, Dublin Corporation's increase in rates is in excess of 25 per cent.  There is no benefit whatever over last year to the hard-pressed ratepayer.  When we talk about the total abolition of rates on private dwellings it means something because there will be no rates on private dwellings.  There is no difference between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Labour advertising <Col N="604" /> himself except that the corporation did not put the Minister's picture on the rates demand.</P>
      <P>Petrol has increased in price.  I asked the Minister how much revenue was received from the Exchequer through excise duty, VAT, and so on.  The Exchequer pays out £30 million in subsidies to CIE every year and I wanted to know how much they were receiving back.  I was told that information would not be given because it was not the policy to divulge the private affairs of a company.  I never realised that CIE were a private company.  I thought they were a State-owned company. This is disgraceful.  I would be very interested to get that information and I intend to get those figures.</P>
      <P>The increase in bus fares is crippling people with young children going to school.  People travelling short journeys have to subsidise those travelling long journeys.  There is a feeling of injustice in society.  Our inflation which is the worst in Europe and will continue to be the worst in Europe is generated by a Government who have no understanding of economics.  As I said last week, when the Arabs increased the price of a gallon of petrol by 12p, the Minister increased it by 35p.  No doubt he will get his whack out of the latest increase of 1p or 2p per gallon in some cases, so the price has increased by about 36p per gallon since 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been maintaining, and I continue to maintain, that one of the best ways to reduce inflation is to reduce the cost of distribution, to reduce the cost of people getting to work.  If the Government would reduce the price of fuel and the crippling motor tax they imposed, this would work down through companies whose overheads would be reduced and, as a result, the cost of delivery would be reduced and the cost of travellers going round the country and various other items would be lower.  Frequently we hear comparisons between the cost of items here as opposed to somewhere else in Europe.  It is never stated that wage levels are higher in those countries. The price of a television licence here is much higher than it is in Britian. The price of stamps is higher here than in Britain.  There is murder going <Col N="605" /> on over there because the price of first class post has gone up to 9p and second class post to 7p, whereas ours is 10p and has been for quite some time.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies who have big offices and give a great deal of employment have to heat their offices and pay heavily for the oil.  They have to pay their employees more wages to enable them to keep up as best they can with the cost of living.  All these things have been generated by direct Government action.  The people will indict and have indicted the Government. It is hard to believe that a Government who were in Opposition for so long, and who have been in Government for such a few years, could have lost touch with the people so quickly.  I am really astonished.  No amount of flag waving by them about the things they have done will change that.  Having heard that the recession is over and we are on our way back to recovery, we read last week that one in five of our people is on the poverty line.  That is the figure that has come from a very minor survey but many more people are below the poverty line and this includes people in income brackets where nobody would suspect this would be the case. A tribute must be paid to the banks who have kept many people afloat who would otherwise have sunk.  I am referring to individuals as well as many business.  If it were not for the banks&mdash;and I appreciate my own bank manager's kindness to me&mdash;many people would not be able to keep going.</P>
    <P>As I stated, the estimate of the Bank of Ireland in February was 14 per cent for inflation this year but I am certain they would like to reappraise that figure in view of the many increases that have occurred.  I would be glad if some intrepid reporter would see if there is a possibility of getting a statement from the Central Bank to see if they have any reason to review their estimate.</P>

      <P>In the budget there was provision for payment of £20 to an employer in a manufacturing industry to take on an additional worker and there was provision for payment of £10 with regard to taking on school leavers. That is discriminatory and it could put school leavers at a grave disadvantage because, naturally, a manufacturer will opt to take on the person for whom he will get the larger subsidy. It has been argued that the employer will have to pay more wages to the man over 21 years rather than to a younger person but that is not the case. It has also been said that the person aged over 21 has certain skills that the school leaver does not possess but it should be remembered that the latter has worked hard under tremendous pressure to get his examination with good honours.  The school leaver is being discriminated against and our party are against that.  This has been stated by our spokesman on Labour, Deputy Fitzgerald.  It would be interesting to know how much the advertisements I refer to cost per square inch and how many square inches were taken up by the picture of the Minister for Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a lot about the injection of £50 million into the building industry.  Fianna Fáil have said that to get employment going again an injection of £100 million is necessary. We were the first Opposition in the history of the State to put forward concrete proposals and among them was the proposal to inject £100 million into the building industry.  The Government made provision for only half of that amount and it is not enough to generate the kind of employment we need.  The drop in cement sales was mentioned here last week.  That is evidence of the fact that the building industry is in decline.  We only know by certain barometers whether an industry is <Col N="607" /> thriving.  Cement sales are decreasing and Roadstone have let go 250 men. It must be clear that all is not as well in the building industry as the Government would like us to believe.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary is here because when I last spoke on the budget he was present.  At that time I referred to the iniquitous way the farmers were being taxed and, knowing I was a city Deputy, he asked me if I was against taxing farmers.  I told him I was not, that neither were the farmers themselves against it as long as it was done in an equitable manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Deputy the question not because he was a city Deputy but because I wanted to know the policy of his party on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Our policy is quite clear and has been stated on many occasions.  The interesting thing was that the Government changed part of the system so that instead of having to pay the entire amount in September the farmers were told they could pay it in two parts.  That went a long way towards alleviating much of the concern felt by them.  City people believe that farmers should pay their fair share of tax and farmers also hold this view.  However, everyone expects it to be equitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases in the budget were granted to sectors that did not use all the money allocated to them.  Increases were given to the IDA who fell below what they were expected to do last year.  I am not sure of the figure but, for the sake of argument, say they were allocated £20 million of which they spent only £10 million.  Therefore, the Government allocated them £30 million this year.  Let us say RTE were allocated £3 million and spent that amount.  They were given only another £3 million.  Our national debt is being repaid at the rate of £800 per minute as Deputy Colley put it very graphically.  This money is being spent foolishly.  I, like many thousands of people throughout the country, received <Col N="608" /> a most unusual document from the income tax people this year.  It was an assessment of income based on an agency which set out income of £500 and a consultancy income of £200, a total of £700 at 35p.  I have not had those agencies for years.  I went into the inspector of taxes and asked him what this was.  He told me not to mind that, that it was a mistake. I told him I was a full-time politician for many years and I gave up those agencies long ago.  The implication behind this was that people who were chancing their arms and not declaring their income would pay.  The Government would be better employed if they spent more time&mdash;I know the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me&mdash;chasing the chancers who are collecting dole and working in small industries.</P>
    <P>I expect to receive 38 names from a man in a small industry in Dublin who is trying to stay open against competition from other people in small industries who are employing people who collect the dole.  The owners of those industries are only paying those people small wages and are not stamping their cards.  This man is in consultation with another man in a similar small industry who can also produce names.  I have told him that as soon as he can produce those names I will be very happy to bring him into the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare so that he can lay the names on his desk.</P>
    <P>The Government should come down heavily on those people.  There is nothing that incenses people who pay taxes as much as people who draw the dole and work in very good jobs as well on the QT.  People in this country are very reluctant to tell on those people but it is getting to the stage now where the message is coming through.  The Government should have more inspectors going around to small factories and places of business asking to see the cards of the people employed in them.  They could get a small group of people to go into those factories as ordinary employees and they would see what is going on.</P>
    <P>People are taxed to the hilt and there is no incentive to work any more.  When people work they pay <Col N="609" /> most of their wages in taxes.  They pay sufficient money in what is deducted from their wages in income tax but they also pay on their relaxation and their motor cars.  When the Minister for Local Government was in Opposition he was very fond of talking about the small man in the country who drives a car.  He does not talk about him now.  The price of motor cars in this country is an absolute disgrace in comparison with other countries. Motoring is dearer in this country than anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P>We had a recent increase of 16 per cent in the price of butane gas.  I no longer hear an outcry when the latest price increases are announced by the Government on the recommendation of the Prices Commission.  Those people have to work within the rules laid down.  They make recommendations and it is up to the Government to sanction them.  It might be an idea to put down a question now asking how many applications for price increases are at present before the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I am quite sure that the figure is staggering. Perhaps we will have a general election sooner than I think.  Life is getting very hard.  Deputy Brennan spoke about the sixth budget but that is just a laugh because every week we have a mini-budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister referring to the cost of the public service said:</P>
    <P>Taking our whole period of Government it will be seen that the various tax changes which we have made form a logical pattern whose objective is to obtain a fair contribution from all classes in society to the cost of running the State while, at the same time, providing the maximum encouragement for enterprise.  We pledge ourselves to maintain this objective.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of public servants being well paid.  We want to get the best of our young people into the public service. The public service should pay as well if not better than industry.  We can only afford a good public service if we have the people who produce the wherewithal to pay for that public service. I have no ambition to drive a Rolls Royce.  If I wanted to drive one, <Col N="610" /> I would have to earn the money to drive it.  It is the same with the public service.  If we want a first-class public service, it has to be earned.  The only way that can be done is by creating the employment and the incentives.</P>
    <P>We have a private enterprise economy.  Private enterprise is the backbone of our well-being Despite what the great economists like Deputy Halligan have to say about this, he now agrees with the marriage between private enterprise and the public service. We agree that State enterprises are good but they must be examined at certain intervals to see if they are still serving the purpose for which they were originally set up.  We must encourage small business people to develop and increase.</P>
    <P>Last week I suggested that the IDA should consult with youth organisations and bring recommendations to the Minister, that they should allow the youth organisations to introduce small grant-aided schemes.  Youth organisations do not have the capital to start those schemes.  It would be well worth following this up.  One could say cynically that it suits us, now that we are in Opposition, to have more people unemployed but we are not like that. We are a very constructive Opposition. We are much more constructive than the Government when they were in Opposition.  That is easily understandable because they did not have the experience of Government we had. People were a little taken aback by the quietness of this Opposition as compared with the others.  I am sure after the next election we will have a much more responsible Opposition from what will then become again the Fine Gael and Labour parties.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that our economic position is very relevant to this debate and he went on to say that:</P>
    <P>Statistical data which has become available since budget time confirm that the momentum of economic recovery is improving.</P>
    <P>He said that the latest surveys from the CII and the ESRI show an expectation of continuing growth.  I would not regard the use of the word &ldquo;expectation&rdquo; there as being an indication even of optimism.  Perhaps, however, there <Col N="611" /> are no longer such expectations having regard to the increases which have been permitted since budget day.  In referring to the question of solving our problems the Minister said that we would have to implement uniquely Irish solutions.  I agree entirely.  We should explore this possibility by consulting in the first place with the various youth organisations in an effort to ascertain the best ways of creating employment for our young people.  These organisations have premises that are vacant during the day but each of which could be used to train two or three young people in the various skills and crafts.</P>
    <P>Referring to section 7 of the Finance Bill the Minister said, in relation to tax allowances and with particular reference to those in receipt of pensions, that the levels at which the limits are fixed will also allow many pensioners to have some amount of other income without attracting a tax liability.  Under successive Fianna Fáil governments we always looked forward at budget time to hearing of the number of people who, as a result of the measures being taken, were being put outside the tax net.  There is nothing in the budget this year to give us that information.  Only the other day I had the case of a school warden, that is, a lollipop man as these people are known, whose income from that activity amounts to about £630 per year and who was also in receipt of a contributory old age pension.  His tax assessment for the year was about £93. I have sent a communication to the income tax office to the effect that there must be a misunderstanding as this liability would seem to be very harsh in the circumstances.  It is wrong to take tax from an old age pensioner who wishes to be occupied for a few hours each day.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with most of the points that were concerning me but I would have liked the Minister to have been here to hear my comment on the lack of finance for the Garda, a matter that has been referred to repeatedly in this House.  In my constituency which happens also to be the Minister's constituency, there is a meeting arranged for Thursday next at 8 p.m.  The Minister <Col N="612" /> is invited to attend but I shall be surprised if he is there to face the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill may be the last Finance Bill to be introduced by this Government.  Indeed, it might be regarded as their last will and testament in that the legacy they are leaving is one of a sense of frustration and of a lack of confidence in the whole democratic structure.  The Chair will have noted that I am the third successive speaker from this side.  We can only assume that even the people on the Government side realise how farcical it is to be endeavouring to discuss this Bill with any element of the type of solemnity that was given in the past to the discussion of such measures.  Of course, those were the times when we had one budget and one Finance Bill annually but that day has gone because at intervals we are subjected to <Col N="613" /> instant budgets to deal with specific items.  For instance, we had the measures which allowed the Minister increase petrol prices by 35p a gallon while the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was allowed to increase postal charges.  These increases were in addition to the many price increases recommended by the National Prices Commission.  In saying that, I am not being critical of the commission who are trying to carry out their task as best they can but like King Canute trying to turn back the waves, they cannot effect the impossible.  While inflation is rampant, there are bound to be price increases.  In such circumstances can people be blamed for becoming cynical about the whole working of democracy?</P>
      <P>There is a kind of funereal atmosphere about the House.  The commentators may say that this is due to the impending election.  Any politician will be conscious of a forthcoming election; otherwise, he would not be in politics.  However, there is more than that involved.  It is a case of the people losing faith in a Government that have failed miserably in relation to the control of prices.  The Minister boasts that this year's budget did not impose any extra direct taxation.  Of course, he forgets about VAT on all sorts of items and, when one takes the price increases and pays VAT at 6¾ per cent or 12 per cent, naturally one has to pay more percentagewise on the higher prices.</P>
      <P>The Minister has increased indirect taxation and people are aware of that. When he comes to reply will he tell us if he can hold out any hope for the householder and the married couple with children that prices will be kept to some norm of sanity?  At the moment price increases are insane. This Finance Bill will benefit the single person at the expense of the married and the higher income groups at the expense of the lower income group. Despite what the Minister says about pensioners, they will be taxed on their old age pensions if they have another pension from their employment.  One can imagine what a nightmare it must be for pensioners facing the prospect of having to pay tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="614" /> This Finance Bill is not even marking time until the election because since the budget any benefits in the budget have been eroded by the ever-spiralling inflation.  I agree with the Taoiseach that we may import some inflation but we create more of it ourselves.  It is very easy to blame imported inflation but we cannot excuse the Government in the realm of price inflation and unemployment.  The Minister said that next year unemployment will have fallen to below 100,000. Good heavens, what a prospect for a country of a little over 3,000,000 people.  The Minister spoke of the figure dropping below 100,000 with a kind of sense of achievement.  Apparently he thinks that below that figure all will be well for the economy and the national well being.</P>
    <P>This perverted thinking is one of the reasons why this Government have failed so badly.  They have not yet realised what it means for a man to be unemployed with no hope of a job.  There are people who left school four years ago in the first year of the Coalition Government and they have not yet succeeded in getting jobs. These people will inevitably drift and become unemployed ultimately. During the 1930s in England George Orwell wrote <i>The Road to Wigan Pier</i> in which he described England at that time without hope and the disillusionment in English homes.  We are reaching a similar state here.  Most people want to work.  Those who abuse the dole system are a minority.  The vast majority who are unemployed would jump at the chance of gainful employment.  Apparently the Government think that a figure of something under 100,000 unemployed is not an unhealthy situation.  If we are going to retain our democratic state, the Government must elevate their thinking and up their sights towards the creation of a society where we will be able to guarantee to our people a living in their own land.  This instrument will not achieve that.  It will, in fact, do the very opposite.</P>
    <P>The Minister may boast that things are improving.  He may wait Micawber-like hoping something will turn up like the conference of the eight nations <Col N="615" /> last week.  That is not good enough. One can point to West Germany as a country that has done great things and has a very low unemployment rate. There the people realised that hard work was part of the recipe for prosperity. It is very hard for us to tell people here they must work harder when they see their brothers and sisters unemployed.  The unemployed cannot work harder because they have nothing to work harder at.  If the Government are really serious and if this great marriage between the socialist philosophy of the Labour Party and the capitalist-free enterprise philosophy of the Fine Gael Party has been so successful, then we should see much greater progress.  My belief is that they are still arguing over alleged ideals, like the State development authority, on which the Labour Party puts such great stress but on which the Taoiseach, the head of the Government, is not so very keen.  The creation of such a development authority may sound well in an election manifesto but I can tell the Minister that people are very cynical about it because they recall the 14 points issued at the time of the last general election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sanctioned a loan of £828,000 to finance the construction of phase 1 of stage 1 of this scheme which consists of the new treatment works at Oberstown, Naas, and other works.  I have also approved the acceptance of tenders for the mechanical plant needed.  Tenders for the civil works should shortly be submitted to my Department.  There are no proposals for a further stage of this scheme before my Department.</P>

      <P>No doubt the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that detailed programmes and estimated costs for the Upper and Lower Liffey Valley schemes, were submitted to his Department on 13th July, 1973, and that stage 1, phase 2 would bring in Droichead Nua, Sallins and Clane where a huge number of planning applications are held up because of the inability of the present sewerage system to cope with extra houses.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary not feel that it would be money well spent to allow this go ahead and give immediate employment in the area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The revised estimated cost of phase 1 is £828,000&mdash; May, 1976 prices&mdash;and a loan for this amount was sanctioned on 30th November, 1976.  Tenders for the mechanical treatment plant and sludge pressing were approved on 1st April, 1977 in sums of £55,592 and £151,469 respectively.

      <P>I am aware of the importance of contract E which is designed to serve a large rural area from the Mid-Kildare water supply scheme and I hope very shortly to be in a position to convey a decision on the documents which are before my Department.  In view of the need to conserve capital for the water and sewerage schemes of highest priority, I cannot say when I will be in a position to convey a decision to the local authority on the documents for contract D which are also under consideration in my Department.  This contract is for the construction of a reservoir but I understand that the servicing of the area could continue for a considerable period and that the reservoir is not an immediate requirement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>

The people there may think that because time may be running out for the Minister that promise will not be kept.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite correct&mdash;it was applied for in October, 1975, but there was a question of providing accommodation in the fire station for civil defence training and that has complicated matters.  The two Departments have been trying to get something worked out.  It is a question of grants as between the Department of Defence and the local authority and also of the size of the accommodation to be allocated for civil defence training.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware of the success of the operation of installing a fireplace and chimney in the centrally heated houses in Finglas South, Dublin; and if he will introduce a scheme whereby all tenants will be provided with this vital service without any initial financial outlay on their part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the installation of a fireplace and chimney in a centrally heated corporation house in Finglas South has been successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the second part of the question, it is possible in certain <Col N="623" /> circumstances for this type of work to be carried out without any initial financial outlay on the part of tenants. It is open to tenants to apply for the special reconstruction grants which the Minister introduced in October, 1974, in respect of the installation of a fireplace or solid fuel burning appliance in a house without these appliances. Subject to the consent of the local authority and to the rateable valuation limits of up to £20, the combined State and supplementary grants amount to two-thirds of the approved cost of work or £400 per house, whichever is the lesser.  Work done on a co-operative basis is reckonable for grant purposes.</P>
    <P>A local authority may make a reconstruction loan to a tenant to enable him to meet his share of the cost of the work.  Unsecured loans of up to £200 may be made.  There is no statutory limit on the amount of a secured loan.  It is not necessary for a local authority to seek a down payment by the borrower.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary accept that the fact that no such loans have been applied for <Col N="624" /> even though these people are concerned that they have not got fireplaces and chimneys would indicate that there is some ambiguity about the information he has given me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not.  There are 8,000 such houses in the country without fireplaces and the cost of installing fireplaces and chimneys in all of them would be between £7 million and £8 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to circulate the details of the pension scheme in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the second part of the question the position is that, heretofore, up to two years' pensionable service in the Defence Forces during the Emergency could be reckoned under the scheme.  All pensionable service <Col N="626" /> with the Defence Forces may now be reckoned, unless a pension is already payable in respect of such service or the service was terminated by dismissal. A deduction of an appropriate sum in respect of any gratuity paid under the Defence Forces pensions schemes will be made from the retiring lump sum or death gratuity under the pension scheme.  Detailed arrangements for the implementation of the foregoing are presently being considered.</P>
    <P>In principle, reckonable local authority service will also be reckoned under the scheme.  Arrangements to implement this are being considered as part of a general examination of the question of transferring pension rights in the public sector, presently being undertaken.  The position of previous service with semi-State bodies is being considered in this context as well.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Details of non-contributory pension scheme for non-established State employees.</i>
    </P>
    <P>1.  <i>General.</i>  The scheme applies to a person (other than an established civil servant or a person engaged under a contract for service or remunerated by way of fees or commission) who is directly employed in a full-time personal capacity by a Department or Office of State.</P>
    <P>2.  <i>Pensionable service.</i>  All service, completed years plus odd days, between the ages of 16 and 67 (and in future the minimum age at which social welfare contributory old age pension becomes payable) remunerated from moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Service includes any period, not exceeding one year, during which an employee is in receipt of benefits under the Social Welfare Occupational Injuries Acts as a result of injury caused by accident in the course of his employment.  Holders of military service pensions or service (1917-1921) medals, which are held to have been duly awarded, may reckon actual service up to age 75.</P>
    <P>3.  <i>Attainment of pension.</i>  An employee must have at least five years' pensionable service and have attained age 65.  To qualify for <Col N="627" /> pension before age 65 retirement must be due to ill-health or redundancy.</P>
    <P>4.  <i>Calculation of retirement benefits.</i><i>Pension</i> 1/80 × annual pay on last day of pensionable service (including pensionable allowances) less twice the annual equivalent of the maximum personal rate of contributory old age pension payable on last day of pensionable service to a man with no adult dependant or qualified children × service (Maximum 40 years).  <i>Lump sum</i> 3/80 × annual pay on last day of pensionable service × service (maximum 40 years).</P>
    <P>In the case of an employee who has not been in the same grade or whose pay has changed during the last three years of pensionable service (excluding general pay revision) average pay is taken except in cases of ill-health, retirement or death in service provided he has sufficient potential service to age 65 to avoid averaging.</P>
    <P>5.  <i>Ill-health retirement.</i>  Additions to actual service are provided by doubling service between five and ten years and where service exceeds ten years it is increased to 20 years or, if better, increased by six years and 243 days, subject to enhanced service not exceeding what could be reckoned by age 65.</P>
    <P>6.  <i>Referendum.</i>  Pension and lump sum are payable on the basis of service accrued to the date of discharge but payment of pension does not commence until weekly payments under the Redundancy Payments Acts cease or until employee attains 65 (or is earlier incapacitated for work on health grounds) whichever is the later.  Lump sum under the scheme is not reduced by the amount of lump sum payable under the said Acts.</P>
    <P>7.  <i>Death gratuity.</i>  No qualifying service is required and the gratuity is a year's pay or, if better, the lump sum which would be payable if employee retired on ill-health on date of death.</P>
    <P>If a former employee dies after retirement and the total receivable by him by way of pension and lump sum is less than a year's pay a gratuity equal to the deficiency is payable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> 8.  <i>Re-employment</i></P>
    <P>(a) <i>Before retiring age:</i> Pension is cancelled and previous pensionable service is reckoned in calculating subsequent awards under the scheme.  Any lump sum or death gratuity subsequently payable is reduced by the amount of the lump sum paid on initial retirement.</P>
    <P>(b)  <i>After retiring age:</i> If pay on re-employment plus pension exceeds the current equivalent from time to time of salary at retirement, pension is reduced by the excess.  The above does not apply where re-employment is not in a Department or Office of State.</P>
    <P>9.  <i>Preservation of benefits.</i>  On voluntary resignation after at least five years pensionable service pension and lump sum based on actual service will be preserved (and uprating in line with increases in public service pensions) until retirement age if pension rights cannot be transferred to other employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to countries which are not member states of the European Community. Ireland is a party to the Convention done at London on 9th March, 1964, and under the Convention Spain, being a country whose vessels habitually fished off Ireland, is permitted to fish in certain areas immediately outside the six mile belt. The areas in which Spanish vessels may fish are from Bloody Foreland, County Donegal, to Rinrawros Point, Aran Island, County Donegal, and from Carrickakin, Achill Island, County Mayo, to The Rogue, Mine Head, County Waterford.</P>
      <P>The European Commission, on behalf of the Community, is negotiating a framework agreement on fisheries with Spain which it is intended will replace the London Convention as far as Spanish fishing vessels are concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we have not had such arrangements.  The only non-member state with whom there is an arrangement, and this is of an international character, is Spain.  The Community, of course, has entered into negotiations with certain countries and pending the outcome of these negotiations has, in respect of the Soviet Union, for example, prescribed certain fishing arrangements at a considerable distance from our shores.  These negotiations with these countries have not yet reached a conclusion.  We have indicated that our consent to agreements being entered into for reciprocal fishing arrangements with other countries outside the Community is dependent on agreement being reached on an internal regime satisfactory to us.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no bilateral agreements applying in this area because it is a Community question. The Community, pending the negotiation of agreements on behalf of the whole Community, has some arrangements current for reciprocal fishing of an interim tempory character in the interim period before negotiations are concluded.  These include arrangements which are unilateral decisions of the Community communicated to the parties concerned, in respect of, for example, the Soviet Union, permitting them to catch a certain amount of fish, a small fraction of what was previously caught, in certain areas, but none of which is within 50 miles of our coast and most of which is more than 100 miles from our coast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what the Deputy has in mind about Spain.  The arrangement with Spain is one of long standing which is now being reviewed by the Community.  In the interim period before that review is completed and agreement reached with Spain, the Community have indicated the quantities of fish which Spain may catch in Community waters, including some waters off our coast. With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question about advising people of what steps will be taken, the normal practice internationally is, I understand, that if a new arrangement is entered into and if a country is found to be offending, a courteous warning is given in respect of the implementation of that new arrangement, or new control mechanism, before you actually proceed to arrest the vessel concerned.</P>

The position in this matter as explained in reply to Question No. 26 on 9th February, 1977, is that it is anticipated that suitable arrangements may be made in conjunction with AnCO for the phased introduction of the scheme on the basis of the Department of Education having responsibility for the educational content and of AnCO being responsible for the training content of the programme during the first year of the apprentice course.  Formal arrangements are being made for the co-ordination of development planning in these matters and provision will, of course, be made for consultation with vocational education committees.  It is not anticipated that this scheme will be implemented in such a way as to cause redundancy among teachers in regional technical colleges.</P>

      <P>My Department's investigation of this matter is proceeding and I will advise the Deputy of the result as soon as possible.  I can say the preliminary indications are that the information as conveyed by the Deputy is not true.  The vocational school is in a position to take all applicants.  They have not refused anybody.  A number of the other schools will be taking all the pupils who apply, and most of them will be taking the vast majority who apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assured that in this area selection is based on examinations in some cases and also if the children have brothers or sisters in the school there is a rather natural desire on the part of parents to keep families together and there is a willingness on the part of the schools to accede to that desire.

    <Title>Private Notice Question.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition gave notice in the House this morning that in view of the continued publication of certain advertisements he wished to repeat the two questions which I had refused yesterday to accept on private notice. Discussions and arrangements between Ministers which, of course, involve the collective responsibility of the Government, are not matters for which they are officially responsible to the Dáil.  In accordance with the Standing Orders and precedents questions on these matters are not admissible.  One of the questions by the Leader of the Opposition asks whether the Taoiseach &ldquo;authorised or approved&rdquo; the advertisements in question.  Clearly this question falls within the category mentioned above and is out of order on ordinary notice not to speak of &ldquo;on private notice&rdquo; for which it also would fail on the ground that it was merely seeking information on a past event.</P>
      <P>The other question seeks information as to whether a certain form of Press advertisement is now Government policy and does not carry in its text the element of urgency which by long standing practice is required of a question to qualify it for private notice.  The Leader of the Opposition has, however, in his statement in the House today introduced an element of urgency in as much as he has made an allegation of a continuing misuse of public funds.  Notwithstanding that the question is not in due form and that I have some doubt that the information available fulfils the urgency requirement of the Standing Order, I am giving the Deputy the benefit of the doubt and am permitting him to ask the Question now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge your action of yesterday as being wrong and not properly based.  I do not accept the qualifications that you have put on that acknowledgment today nor do I accept the thesis of what you <Col N="654" /> have just said, that arrangements between Ministers are not subject to questioning in the House, either in Private Notice Question form or in ordinary form.  However, that is another day's work.  The Question you have allowed&mdash;again I fail to see how it can be allowed without any qualification on your part&mdash;is as follows:</P>
      <P>To ask the Taoiseach if it is now Government policy to insert in newspapers on behalf of Government Departments at public expense the personalised form of advertisement which appeared in the Sunday and evening newspapers of 8th and 9th May, 1977 respectively portraying the photograph of the Minister for Labour and a facsimile of his signature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly) John Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, Sir, to answer the question on behalf of the Taoiseach.  I am sorry the Taoiseach is not here.  I should explain to the House that at the moment he is addressing the Confederation of Irish Industry in response to a long standing invitation and agreement to do so.</P>
      <P>The advertisement referred to by the Deputy was published on the strong recommendation of an advertising agency as being necessary to ensure the full utilisation of the employment incentive scheme.  The Taoiseach is satisfied that advertising of this nature may be necessary in particular circumstances.  In this case it is an appeal to employers to get as many people back to work as soon as possible and the strength and impact of the advertising campaign is designed to achieve this objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary accept that this is a departure from normal practice, that when Government Departments see fit to advertise matters of this nature it is done over the signature of the secretary, the permanent head of the Department rather than the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not accept that.  I refer the Deputy, perhaps when I get away from the contentious atmosphere of politics in this State, <Col N="655" /> to a precedent which I am sure he will recognise as a respectable one. I have come across an advertisement taken from <i>The Economist</i> of May, 1974, which shows a large photograph of Mr. John Hume, at that time a Minister in Northern Ireland, doing a very similar job to that now being done by the Minister for Labour here, trying to induce, by an advertising campaign which personalised him, foreign industrialists to invest in Northern Ireland.  I also do not accept that the addition of a Minister's name to a statement, even if it is an invitation or whatever it may be, on the part of a department, is improper and that the secretary's name should be substituted.  If that were the case, the former Government would have to explain how over 500,000 booklets costing, in the prices of 1969, almost £30,000 were delivered into the letter-boxes of every household in the country before the general election of that year and how that booklet, which purports to be instructive, in regard to the changes made in the educational system, was personalised by the facsimile signature of Brian Lenihan, at that time Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that this is not abnormal practice?  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the other day circularised every telephone subscriber along similar lines and no objection has been taken to that form.  May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if the personalised form in the advertisement, to which he has just referred, that of Mr. John Hume, who apparently inserted that advertisement in <i>The Economist</i> as Minister for Industry in the Northern Ireland Executive, is the only precedent of that nature he can quote?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that your permission for asking this question was communicated to the Government shortly before 1 o'clock today at a time when the Taoiseach had already left.  The time available to the Taoiseach's staff and to myself to answer the question and, in particular, to deal with supplementaries which we <Col N="656" /> might have foreseen, was accordingly very limited.  I undertake, if the Leader of the Opposition wishes to press the matter, to find other precedents.  As a matter of principle, quite apart from precedent, I would not accept that it is necessarily to be ruled out that a Minister's photograph or facsimile signature should accompany an advertising campaign.  I can conceive that, as in this case, there would be solid technical reasons of an advertising publicistic kind which might recommend that approach.  I understand from the Minister's people that the particular campaign which is going on at the moment and which Deputy Lynch is trying to torpedo has produced very promising results so far.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that this is a nefariously political method of trying to publicise a particular Minister and, in the wake of that publication, publicise the Government as well for political purposes.  May I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, contrary to notice being given only this morning of my intention to raise this matter by way of Private Notice Question, I gave my notice of intention yesterday morning?  May I suggest to him that it is, as I alleged yesterday, a misuse of public funds for the Minister to purport to promise to pay personally to employers certain employment premiums if they give employment to people?</P>

      <P>I want to clear up, first of all, a misunderstanding in the Deputy's mind.  Of course, the Deputy raised this matter yesterday.  I heard him myself.  I said it was not until a few minutes before 1 o'clock that the consent of the Ceann Comhairle to the raising of this matter in this form now was communicated to us.  That is the reason which I offer for not having a longer string of precedents, perhaps even more respectable ones, with which to answer the Leader of <Col N="657" /> the Opposition.  In regard to the second point, of course, it is open to the Leader of the Opposition to allege that the form in which this matter is presented is designed also to secure publicity or favourable reaction from the public for a particular Minister or for the Government in which he works. That is inseparable from a Minister's work and the party which the Leader of the Opposition leads have made as much use of that in their time as anyone possibly could have.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary had examples of the allegation he has just made that we as a party and as a Government had made use of funds in this way, I am sure we would have an indication of what they are as of now but the Parliamentary Secretary apparently failed to dig any of them up.  I am repeating my allegation that this is a misuse of public funds.  It is an attempt to personalise the Minister for Labour by projecting his photograph and a facsimile of his signature, by projecting what appears to be a promise to pay personally a specified sum of money to certain employers under certain conditions. That is a gross misuse of public funds. It is a matter which, ultimately, we as a party will bring to the attention either of the Committee of Public Accounts or of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I refuse absolutely to accept in any way or to any extent Deputy Lynch's allegation that this was a misuse of public funds.  I trust the Deputy will not pretend that it is a misuse of public funds to advertise the scheme concerned.  From the latest information that I was able to receive I can tell the Deputy that the total cost of the series of advertisements for the scheme is about £20,000 which represents only a very small fraction of the overall cost of the scheme which is in the region of £4 million.  Surely the Leader of the Opposition would not argue that if the personalised element were missing, the advertisements would be a perfectly proper use of public funds.  If the addition of the personalised element makes the advertisement more effective surely <Col N="658" /> the public funds are being even better spent.</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1977: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking before the break, I was referring to the fact that in addition to the various defects in the Minister's brief there were some trite and rather odd statements.  For instance, in regard to the economic summit of last week the Minister spoke of the stubbornness with which unemployment in most countries is persisting even with the ending of the recession.  I see no sign of the recession ending here although there are indications of its coming to an end in central Europe.  The Minister then went on to make a rather odd statement when he said that eight leaders were present at the summit since Europe as such was present even if our French friends <Col N="659" /> preferred to pretend otherwise.  Why must the Minister use the Finance Bill for the purpose of insulting the French nation?  Is not such conduct symptomatic of the insanity that prevails on the other side of the House? Undoubtedly I would be ruled out of order in the event of my attempting to discuss French politics and rightly so.</P>
      <P>Further on in the brief there is some gratuitous advice aimed, perhaps, at would-be voters.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>Taxpayers would be well advised in their own interests to be distrustful of those who would freely spend money which only the taxpayer can supply.</P>
      <P>What a master of economics the Minister has proved himself to be.  He continued:</P>
      <P>If electors support grandiose expenditure proposals, they will have only themselves to blame if tax rates rise again to pay for them. This course does not commend itself to this Government who want to see the tax concessions of the 1977 budget retained and improved upon.</P>
      <P>We must realise that any benefits bestowed on us by the budget have been eroded since then as a result of recent price increases.  The Government have shown themselves to be totally inept in regard to price control. The Minister's inclusion in his brief of a reference to the French Government may have been for the purpose of diverting attention from the real issues but the people generally who must manage on diminishing incomes will not be fooled by such tactics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stress these points to indicate that there is no serious attempt on the part of the Government to hold prices even at present levels, to curb inflation or to promote employment.  The Minister has said that by next year unemployment will be below the 100,000 mark.  As he does not say how much lower it will be, we may take it that to his way of thinking an unemployment figure of 100,000 is acceptable. That figure is not acceptable to anybody who wishes to see our society prosper because it represents much too high a proportion of our entire population. Then, there are those people who <Col N="660" /> have not been able to obtain any employment yet.  During the past three years we have had 50,000 people leaving the various stages of education each year and only a tiny percentage of whom have been able to obtain employment.  In addition there are the single girls who are not registered as being unemployed because they do not qualify for social welfare payments.  Taking these factors into consideration one realises that the real figure is between 130,000 and 140,000 unemployed.  The Government are so complacent as to consider a figure of 100,000 as being acceptable.</P>
    <P>If only the Government would get their priorities right there is one area of economic activity whereby they could improve substantially the employment situation.  I refer to the construction industry and to the need for injecting more capital into that industry. Recent figures show that there are 26,000 people unemployed in the construction industry at a time when the housing waiting list, at least in Dublin and in the larger cities, is increasing. This situation is the epitome of a sick society.  There are thousands of young couples as well as older people who cannot get proper accommodation. If we put to work in the construction industry even half the number who are on the unemployment register we could increase substantially the number of dwellings that are so badly needed but the Government have not provided sufficient moneys by way of housing grants which would enable young couples to buy homes for themselves.</P>
    <P>We have pointed out <i>ad nauseum</i> from this side that the lowest price in this city for a new house is around £9,000.  Yet, under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act we offer a loan of £4,500 which means buyers have to find another £4,500 to pay the price of the house, to say nothing of legal fees and their having to buy furniture.  The fact is young couples cannot buy houses.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out that the Government have not got their priorities right because, if they had, housing would have top priority.  More money is needed for the unemployed, not for the purpose of dole but for the purpose of injecting money into the construction industry, an industry which can provide at least 26,000 jobs. That would result in people buying houses.  If the construction industry is doing well the whole economy is doing well because the effects are far-reaching in ancillary industries.  Demand is created.  Sales of houses are down by 32 per cent and that means that those engaged in the cement industry may find themselves unemployed.  A large firm in Dublin last week announced it would have to lay off 200 workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tragedy is the Minister for Finance seems to think everything is doing well.  He is looking at life through rose coloured spectacles.  The man in the street, the young married couple and the old age pensioner cannot indulge in the luxury of wearing <Col N="662" /> rose coloured spectacles.  They have to face the harsh realities.  Every day it is getting harder for them to live. As I said earlier, the higher income group will do better under this Bill than the lower income group and the single man will do better than the married man.  Despite section 7 pensioners will still be taxed on their meagre pensions.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare told us honestly and candidly that we have 250,000 people on the verge of the bread line.  We know many old people who have almost given up the ghost trying to cope with the cost of living. We know thousands who are not having proper nourishment because they cannot afford to buy it.  We know thousands who cannot afford to buy the drugs and medicines they require because they are too expensive.  If anyone thinks I am painting a pessimistic picture I quote the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare.  I take it he was using official statistics when he mentioned 250,000 people on the poverty line.</P>
    <P>There is no encouragement in this Bill.  Not so long ago we raised here the case of child care centres.  Bannerlines in the newspapers told us that thousands of children might have to be thrown on the streets because the centres could not carry on.  I made representations to the Minister for Health in one particular case and, to his credit, he provided money to keep the centre going and to carry out necessary repairs.  What about the other centres which may not have been so fortunate?  While this is not the place to go into the reasons why these centres are in such a parlous state because of lack of money, it is only fair&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>In one instance, yes, and it would be wrong if I did not admit that.  We are honest and objective on this side of the House.  I shall not delay on this but people should realise that the present crisis in these centres has been brought about because the religious orders who have carried on this noble work for so many years now find themselves inhibited because of lack of numbers and they have to employ lay personnel and pay them top wages, and rightly so, to do the work.  The cynics who deride the religious orders and their work might give their attention to that point.</P>
      <P>We have just heard the Leader of the Opposition speaking about the advertisement the Minister for Labour published in the newspapers, the Minister says in order to encourage employers to employ people.  I regard the whole thing as most dishonest.  It is a typical example of low practices in high places that this sort of thing should happen at the expense of the taxpayer.  On the comic side, it reminds me of the advertisement where the fellow says: &ldquo;You too can have a body like mine.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I just mention it in passing.  I do not want the Minister for Labour playing ball at the expense of the taxpayers.  Is it the Minister's intention to promote employment or to promote his own image?  I will leave that to the unemployed to answer and they will answer it at the right time.</P>
      <P>The Government have been slated by many people for their lack of a youth policy.  That is because the money is not there for it. Then we have the case of people who leave third level education and who cannot get jobs. We must ask ourselves: have the Government really studied this problem of youth unemployment?  I was at a competition yesterday morning amongst 900 school children and looking at those youngsters&mdash;of course all of them would not be leaving school this year&mdash;I wondered how many of them would find jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="664" /> When the Government first came into power with their 14-point plan they promised great things, full employment, price stability and so on, all of which have gone by the board. The Government are now breeding hard cynicism amongst the youth which will affect the democratic ideal of State in the future.  These young people are hardly likely to believe politicians when the promises of this Government have been so crudely abandoned or forgotten.  Instead of building a faith in democracy, the Government in order to cover up their ineptitude are destroying this belief. If we want to build the type of society we should like to have in the future, we have to take our youth into our confidence and demonstrate to them that at least we are trying to build up such a society in which they will be guaranteed, as far as possible, a living in their own country.</P>
    <P>We hear also in places outside whispers from the Government seeming to suggest that the unemployment figures are unreal.  The implication is that a lot of these people could be employed if they so desired.  The Chief Whip of the Labour Party recently in this House read out from the Dublin evening papers the number of construction industry jobs advertised. One is very glad to see such advertisements in the Press.  But if it were put to him, as I put it to him, suppose all of these jobs were accepted now, what effect would it have on the unemployment register, or the employment register for that matter, what would be his reply?  I counted those advertisements in one paper and, at the very outside, there were about 100 jobs going.  Suppose they had been accepted the following morning, even assuming that the following day another 100 appeared, there would still be a long way to go to reducing the unemployment figure to any extent.  As I have pointed out, in the construction industry the number of unemployed people is increasing while the number of dwellings being completed decreases. Therefore, the situation obtaining is that of more people being unemployed in the construction industry, less dwellings being built and the housing waiting list growing longer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="665" /> I hope that soon, when people are given an opportunity of adjudicating on that type of Government, they will deal harshly with them for having promised so much and done so little. It may well be said of us that we tend to criticise continuously and offer no concrete solutions.  I have stressed to the House, and to my colleagues here, that if the Government are serious they must examine the situation of the construction industry and ascertain what part of it is ailing most.  We can illustrate that to them.  Probably the clash between the Fine Gael and Labour Parties on how it should be rectified is responsible for the delay in something concrete being done.  I do not think the Labour Party are serious any longer about socialism nor do I think their type of socialism would ever be very effective.  When one is young, anyway, there is an attraction to socialism.  As somebody said: he who is not a socialist at 20 has no heart and he who is a socialist at 40 has no head.  It may be that the older party Fine Gael, have weaned the Labour Party off their socialism, not completely of course because had they gone one way or the other we might have had an indication of some definite policy on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>The latest development is the establishment of a State Development Authority.  Labour Party speakers on this are so naïve as to be almost pitiful because in it they see the solution to all our ills.  The Fine Gael wing of the Government are not so enthusiastic but seem somewhat bored with the whole thing.  Therefore, nothing is done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

      <P>We are like the hawks and the doves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say that is a true analogy.  I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary would say that Fine Gael are the hawks and Labour the doves.  Certainly the Labour Party have become very mute.  If they are going right&mdash; I mean right in politics&mdash;that may be true.  I do not know whether or not they are; in fact I do not know where they are going.  However, the point is <Col N="666" /> that, as a result of this clash between Fine Gael and Labour, or this transition period of the Labour Party, those who are suffering are the men in the construction industry, all 26,000 of them.</P>
      <P>There is a more serious aspect of that matter also.  The number of apprentices being taken on in trade generally has fallen dramatically. Despite the tremendous efforts of AnCO&mdash;who do a wonderful job with the resources at their disposal&mdash;fewer apprentices are being taken on.  As a result, in three or four years time there will be a colossal shortage and apprentices who at that stage should have finished their third or fourth year will not even have started.  Their only hope is that, by then, a Fianna Fáil Government will be back in power and will endeavour to remedy the sins of the Coalition.  This amounts to a very serious problem for the parents of such boys and girls who are worried sick about their childrens' employment prospects.</P>
      <P>The Government have fallen down completely on this most important aspect of our whole economy and future.  Unless we can show that we can provide for our youth there are people around today who will take them into their organisations and abuse them, not for the common good, but rather to cause disruption within the State.  When we look at the six north-eastern counties today and grieve about their state one wonders do the Government give any thought to the time when we shall have to think not alone of the youth of the Twenty-six Counties but of the Six Counties also, if tomorrow we were called upon to help in a real way because the boys and girls of the North have less hope even than our youth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government at the beginning of their regime were called the Government of all talents.  The talents are not very conspicuous; they may be latent.  I am going to produce some figures which may cause the Taoiseach to reshuffle his Cabinet in the hope of doing better than the present Cabinet are doing, which will not be very difficult. Time is running out for the Government and if they do not tackle the <Col N="667" /> evil of unemployment, this may be serious for them.  They may say &ldquo;After all, we did increase unemployment benefits&rdquo; but that gives a wrong picture.  If the benefits were increased, we must remember that inflation has eroded them and the people will no longer tolerate that erosion of their incomes.  The vast majority of the unemployed want to work, to get back to their jobs in factories, offices, shops and on building sites.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that in Europe things are getting better, and OK if they are getting better in Europe we are bound to improve later on.  It is always later on that things are going to happen.  To suggest that we can rely on the European economy and that the spin-off will benefit us is an unworthy suggestion.  The Irish people want to be there helping this revival but too many are becoming disillusioned. If there is a malaise, as there is at the moment, it started with the Government promising so much and performing so little.  Ministers who have been abroad can come back and say that the Japanese and the Americans are not going to give us any jobs. I am glad to hear this.  When some of the more socialist Ministers were on this side of the House they threw up their hands and said whenever we mentioned foreign investment that we were victims of international capitalism. They realise now that we need investment and are prepared to welcome it.  If we cannot generate sufficient moneys to keep our industries going, to expand and to provide for a growing population, then we accept and, indeed, welcome outside investment. Some of the more leftish Ministers have learned this lesson and are now taking on world tours in order to attract foreign capital to this country.  If they succeed we will say &ldquo;well done&rdquo;.  We have no reservation on this side about investment in the country.</P>
    <P>It is easy to be critical.  We realise that the Opposition must point out the Government's faults in the hope of bringing them down from their Olympian heights.  There are people here on the hunger line.  There are <Col N="668" /> about 130,000 people unemployed. Thousands are looking for houses. These are the things the Government should be dealing with.  A big drawback of coalition is that the best principles of both parties must be sacrificed on grounds of compromise. Therefore, instead of getting on-going policies we get compromise policies which are of no use to anybody.  The people paying for this are those who get little out of life.  Old age pensioners, the unemployed man and woman and the young couple looking for a house are the victims of the ineptitude of this Government.  The Government should say &ldquo;yes we realise that things are bad and we have to do something about it&rdquo; but they do not.  We have statements to the effect that everything is going to be all right, things were good yesterday and will be tomorrow.  As in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> there is no jam today.  The cynicism throughout the country has been created mainly by the Government.  If a visitor from Mars were to come here and read some of the Government speeches, he would assume that this is a land flowing with milk and honey, fit for heroes to live in.  As a cynic said, you would want to be a hero to live in it at present.  The heroic struggle of the young and old people to keep going is not being aided by the Government.</P>
    <P>I feel that this Bill is something the Government do not care about.  I am the third speaker in succession from Fianna Fáil.  I do not know whether the Government are too involved in preparing for the general election but we on this side agree that they will have to do a lot to get a good election result.</P>

      <P>I do not worry about them.  I make allowances for the absence of the members there.  Only one Labour Deputy has spoken so far. This Finance Bill in the old days used to be an important occasion but now it is sent in as a time filler.  The Government Deputies show no interest in the Bill.  I can understand why. <Col N="669" /> What is in the Bill anyway to interest anybody?  I found some comic relief in some of the Minister's statements but that does not solve the problems.  We must switch off the comic relief and get down to hard talking and planning.  I have made suggestions of how to make things work better.  We are told that never before was so much put into housing, which may be true, but never before has there been such a rate of inflation to erode that money and destroy its value.</P>
      <P>A lot will have happened by this time next year.  It has been said that a week is a long time in politics and a year is a lot longer.  By this time next year we should see a change in Government and the new Government are not to be envied when they take over from the present one.  All the ills I have mentioned will still be there to be tackled.  But they will be tackled by people who are well versed in the science of Government.  I look forward to the Coalition Parties adopting a more constructive role back in Opposition than they have played in Government because they will have learned that it is not so easy to fulfil the extravagant promises they have been making.  The Government have been treating the people as if they had no intelligence, to judge from the banal statements they have been making, in the past couple of years particularly. We have one of the highest unemployment rates in the EEC and one of the highest inflation rates.  In spite of this the Government suggest everything is going well and that we have nothing to fear in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an awful lot to fear unless the Government even in their dying days, implement some hopeful policies to save the economy.  I suggest that they should resign immediately before any further damage has been done.  All their promises have been dishonoured.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary, who is the only Deputy in the Government front bench, to take back to the Taoiseach the message that the people are seriously concerned at the state of the economy and that irreparable damage is being done to the State. Even at this late stage they should <Col N="670" /> re-examine their priorities.  We have offered suggestions on how matters could be improved.  The Government have also had guidance from their advisers but I am afraid they have not taken any advice.  We on this side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister's opening statement contains a few amusing phrases, one of them, on page 9, being:</P>
      <P>Taxpayers would be well advised in their own interests to be distrustful of those who would freely spend money which only the taxpayer can supply.</P>
      <P>That, coming from this Government, is amusing because they have been borrowing money from any country in the world who would give it to them. Consequently, the national debt is in a dangerous position, £4 billion.  The servicing of that debt will be a terrible hardship on the people during the next few years and it will be a terrible job for any succeeding Government to tackle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course I welcome any efforts made in the Finance Bill to create new jobs.  This is an election measure but I welcome the things in it that have come out of the Fianna Fáil policy document published some time ago.  I welcome the adoption, even in a small way&mdash;too little too late, Deputy Colley described it&mdash;by the Minister for Finance of our suggestions. Borrowing abroad and borrowing at home are two entirely different matters. One could put the Government in the position of a co-operative.  It is <Col N="671" /> legitimate for a co-operative to borrow from within the country.  It is only when you go outside the country for money that you are in real danger. Even borrowing abroad is not too bad if it is for capital purposes&mdash;to promote employment instead of to pay for social welfare benefits.  Of course, social welfare must be provided for those who cannot work.  Nobody should get the impression that I am objecting to that, but the emphasis should be on the provision of jobs rather than on social welfare.  The young people want to work and it is up to the Government to provide them with jobs.  An attempt has been made in this Bill to do something in that direction, but it is belated.  Over the last four years there was no policy in relation to employment.  The Government tried to cushion the people against unemployment but no attempt was made to create jobs.  That is why we are in the position we are in today.</P>
    <P>Many people mentioned that no Labour Deputies were present for this debate, and I noticed that only one Labour Deputy, Deputy Halligan spoke on this Bill.  I am not surprised at that.  The Labour Party are supposed to be a socialist party.  I can see no trace of socialism in the reductions which are given in this Bill. I see no trace of socialism when I look at the national wage agreement negotiated by the trade unions which gives £8 to a man earning £100 a week and £4 to a man earning £40 a week. As far as I can see, the Labour Party have become as much a capitalist party as any other party.  Deputy Halligan made a slight protest against the reliefs given in the budget to oil companies and banks which were making huge profits.  I support his protest but it is no use for the Labour Party to say that they stand for a socialist or just society when very little is being done about it.  Any reliefs given in this budget are given to the higher income group.  I agree with any reliefs which will promote employment. People prepared to invest money are doing a good job.</P>
    <P>I would like to give my blessing to the proposed State co-operative.  There <Col N="672" /> is a different of opinion in relation to this on the opposite benches.  The unemployment situation cannot be solved by private enterprise alone, therefore, State enterprise is needed as well.  As Deputy Moore says, the Fine Gael partners in the Coalition are very slow to give their blessing to this.  I believe it is only an election gimmick, but I suppose we can expect all kinds of promises this year.</P>
    <P>Anywhere I have spoken recently I have been careful not to make rash promises.  People are fed up with promises, such as were made at the last general election.  They want performance.  We have an educated electorate.  I do not know why some people swallowed the 14-point programme on prices issued by the Coalition at the last election.  We know that the people on the other side of the House are intelligent and that they knew that they could not fulfil the promises that they made.  We knew that we could not reduce prices in a European situation.  Fianna Fáil will be an attraction in the next election due to their previous performance, when they never made promises that they did not live up to.  The biggest issue in the general election will be the cost of living, just as it was in the last election when Fianna Fáil were slated left, right and centre in regard to it.  Nothing is happening at present to give an indication that the cost of living is coming down.  Any reliefs given in the budget are nearly eroded by increases that have occurred since. Anyone going up for election this year should keep away from promises because people have become disillusioned with promises.  I spoke to young people in Dublin recently and they told me that they have no interest whatsoever in politics, that politicians only came out at election time with false promises.  They believed that every politician is a crook who will say anything to get elected.  We must be careful in our approach, if we are not to destroy democracy.  We must be honest and we must not promise from an election platform, something that we know will be impossible to carry out, as was done at the last general election by the present Government.</P>

      <P>I was not here for the draining of the Shannon, I came into this House late in life.  When campaigning in Ballinasloe in the last election I was attacked at almost every door in relation to the cost of living. I indicated that we could not do anything about it, that it would go up because of our entry into Europe, but that we would have to bring wages and social benefits into line with the cost of living.  Coalition campaigners came along behind my back and stated that not alone would they stabilise the cost of living but that they would bring it down.  Everybody in this House knew that on our entry into Europe the cost of living would not be reduced.  We should not tell people that we can do something which we know we cannot do.  I cannot understand why some individuals try to fool the people.  They will not get away with it any longer.</P>
      <P>Some of the items in our financial policy were taken into this Bill.  An Opposition is not expected to issue a policy, but for the sake of the country I am glad that the Government used some of our proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the abolition of death duties by the Government. I must highlight the fact that quite a lot of the holdings in the west are held by single people and these holdings will be transferred to either a brother, a nephew or a niece, and gift tax must be paid on the transfer. The abolition of death duty applies only to the immediate family.  Land is valued highly in the west, even though most of the farms are small. It has been stated that death duties were abolished but, in fact, they have not been as far as a brother, a nephew or niece is concerned.  There are many unmarried farmers in the west&mdash;nobody would marry them because their farms are too small&mdash;and when their holdings are transferred to their nephews or nieces the person benefiting must pay capital acquisition tax or gift tax which has replaced death duties.  Those taxes are there and must be paid by those who inherit land. When we were discussing the Bills <Col N="674" /> concerning those taxes, we tabled an amendment to exclude a brother, a nephew or a niece but it was not accepted.</P>
    <P>What I have said may not be applicable to any other part of the country but I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Public Service who is from the west of Ireland will agree that there are many unmarried elderly farmers living in the west and this applies to their holdings. It pleases me to know that a Deputy from the west is climbing up the ladder because he knows the problems of that area.  He knows that it is a cod to tell the farmers there that death duties have been abolished.  The title has been abolished but the duty has been replaced by other taxes.</P>
    <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle did not agree with Deputy Moore that housing was relevant to this debate.  I do not agree with that ruling because we should be entitled to complain about what is not in the Finance Bill. If we are not allowed to do that, we have little business contributing to the debate.  I am in favour of any measures taken to erect more local authority houses.  When I pointed out to the Minister for Local Government the difficulty young people have in getting loans for new houses he told me that if a young couple with £1,000 invested that sum with a building society they would qualify for a loan to buy a new house.  I accept that they can but the Minister must remember that the interest rate on a loan from a building society increases almost annually.  The unfortunate position is that if those people earn in excess of £2,350 per year they cannot avail of SDA loans or qualify for local authority grants.  Surely the Minister will agree that in 1977 very few, if any, work for that type of money.  In order to encourage young people to buy their own houses, thereby relieving local authorities, the Government should do something in relation to the income limit for loans and grants.  The amount of the loans and grants should also be increased to a realistic figure. The Minister should bear in mind that because only three plans exist for local authority houses they are almost all of the same design everywhere For the <Col N="675" /> sake of the appearance of the countryside young people should be encouraged to build their own houses because there would be a variety in the design of houses built.</P>

      <P>I sat throughout the debate yesterday and I heard everything discussed.  It reminded me of an evening during the Monaghan by-election campaign when the present Minister for Defence commenced to speak at 4.30 p.m. and did not conclude until 9.30 p.m. the following night. During that time he dealt with the problems of every village and town in the constituency of Laois-Offaly.  I do not believe in making long speeches but I feel I am entitled to highlight the problems of my area and draw attention to omissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A greater effort must be made to create employment for our young people who are very disillusioned. Our education system is geared towards clerical jobs which we do not have and the result is that many of our young people are unemployed.  They are the breeding ground of violence.  Last week I was interrupted by Deputy Coughlan when I mentioned this matter.  I pointed out that years ago those working in offices were only paid 10s. per week and they had no unions to support them.  Those who ran those offices addressed meetings condemning communism even though they had the breeding ground of communism in their own offices.  The same applies to violence.  If there are too many young educated people in our towns who cannot put their brains to good use, they will put them to bad use.  That is why I stated that they are the breeding ground of violence and why it is so important to get employment for young people.  We should not have <Col N="676" /> replaced workers by machines and something will have to be done about that matter.  Local authorities should also be given more money to spend on schemes.  A lot has to be done in relation to the improvement of our roads and the carrying out of amenity schemes.</P>
    <P>In relation to the taxing of farmers, I agree that there should be such taxation but I do not agree with the way it is being implemented, the way the income of farmers is assessed or the time set aside for doing so.  I am a small farmer and I pay tax on my Dáil salary but I would not be paying any tax if I was not a Member of this House.</P>
    <P>A person with a salary of £6,000 a year has to buy a car and pay VAT on it to earn that salary.  To earn £6,000 a year on a farm, the amount of implements needed and the amount of indirect taxation you pay are unbelievable. When I get my salary I know what I am getting.  A farmer has not the foggiest idea what he will earn without making many calculations. It takes a lot of book-keeping to keep farming accounts.  The cost of machinery has soared out of all proportion and you cannot farm without it.  Parts have to be replaced. We object to the way it is being assessed, not to farm tax.  The most ridiculous thing I ever heard was asking a farmer to pay his tax in September.  I am glad this has been altered but it has not been fully altered.  A farmer's income is not an assured income.  It depends on the weather.  A tillage farmer has to depend on the harvest.  If the harvest is good his income will increase, and if the harvest is bad that could be disastrous for him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>He cannot do any book-keeping until the end of the year.  If he has some weanling calves for sale, they will not be sold until October and he does not know what he will get for them.  He does not know how many of them might die.  If he is unfortunate enough to have brucellosis or TB reactors he could be almost wiped out.  He could lose £100 <Col N="677" /> a beast, which I can prove.  In the Revenue Commission and the Department of Finance there does not seem to be anybody who realises the problem. I am not blaming anybody.  There are very few farmers in this House.</P>
      <P>It would be ridiculous to expect that a farmer who made a profit should get away without paying tax, but we must be sure he has a certain income at the end of the year.  He cannot assess his income until the end of the year. It was the craziest and maddest system to expect a farmer to be able to say in September what he would have by the end of the year.  As a farmer, I do not object to farmers being taxed. There are certain modifications in the Finance Bill which improve it, but they do not go far enough.  The Minister may correct me if I am wrong.  A farmer will have to pay half his tax in September and half at the end of the year.  That means he has to do his accounts twice.  Is that right? How can he know what his profit is in September.</P>

      <P>I am coming now to the very important point of off-farm employment.  The Minister said it was a mistake to say people who were paying PAYE would be taxed on their small farms.  I understood that referred to people with off-farm employment. In my area there are six small agricultural contractors who have refused to work for farmers this year.  They said that if they earned anything which would put them into the tax bracket they would be taxed on the multiplier on their small holdings of £10 valuation. These small contractors are all over the country doing an excellent job. Where do you draw the line between the professional man and the trader?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about a man with a small farm who might do a little bit of building.  There is a disincentive for him to do anything now because he will be taxed on the multiplier on his small farm.  The west of Ireland is dotted with small contractors because farmers cannot afford to buy the machinery to do the jobs themselves.  Some of them cannot even afford ploughs and harrows.  I would ask the Minister to consider that problem seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also asked the Minister about another matter and he said people with valuations of from £10 to £20 are not getting any increase in their social welfare.  They are on the notional system and they can opt to go on factual income.  I asked what system is being used to assess factual income and I was told it was the same as the old age pension system.  My information is that is not correct.  Under the old age pension assessment you get an allowance for family labour which you do not get under the factual income.  Some people who went on factual income came out of it very badly.  I suppose it is the Minister for Social Welfare who will do the assessing.  I have asked for the factual income in relation to those cases but all I am told is that those <Col N="679" /> people are above the guideline and that they are out.  I cannot get a breakdown on how the income is assessed in those cases.  There is a great difference between the Department of Health in relation to medical cards and the Department of Social Welfare in relation to old age pensions.  I would like to know the system that is used.</P>
    <P>There are many people in County Galway who have a valuation of £20.50 or £21 who are just above the guideline. Many of those people have land which is under water for up to six months every year. Those people are all on factual income because very few of them are under £20 valuation.  I cannot tell those people how factual income is assessed.  Is it assessed the same way as it is for old age pensions?  Some people have told me that it is but as far as I can see it is not.  None of those people want to draw social welfare if they can get any other incentive.</P>
    <P>The Government should give incentives to those people to improve their land.  They would prefer this to getting social welfare money.  The Government were very free about social welfare payments a few years ago.  Some people, who wanted to have a political advantage, told others to apply for social welfare, even though they were not entitled to it.  No incentive was given to the people I refer to even when the cost of living went higher and higher.  I would like the EEC directive to be changed so that any of those people who work small farms to a plan will get the full grant.  Those small men should also get guidance premiums.  I am 100 per cent behind anything that will replace social welfare payments but so far there is nothing.  It was taken off the small farmer and he received nothing in return.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the great advantages received following the abolition of death duties.  I have pointed out that the majority of farmers in the west are batchelors who could not get wives because no girls were prepared to go into those small holdings. Their lands are now passing on to brothers, nephews and nieces who <Col N="680" /> have to pay capital acquisitions tax. You have to be a wife, son or daughter to avoid having to pay this tax.  I know that a certain percentage is allowed but after that they have to pay the tax. I know of many nieces and nephews who got land from their uncles and they are unable to pay this tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will accept that if the nephew or niece has been working on the farm during the lifetime of the donor that person is treated in the same way as the son or daughter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister knows that quite a number of those nephews and nieces live in their fathers' homes some distance away. Many of the people I am talking about have been living alone for years and would not like anybody to live with them.  When the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill was being discussed I mentioned the difference between the hard-working man who spent his life accumulating some wealth and the speculator who makes money out of a fast deal.  Those two categories should not be on the same level.  I would like to see those hard-working people getting something in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome anything in the Bill which will give incentives for employment.  I have pointed out that as far as the socialist policy of the Labour Party is concerned it certainly is not being implemented in this Bill.  Any relief in tax as well as the national wage agreement is all for the high income group. The lower income man got very little in the budget.  This has been eroded with the increase in the cost of living since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have two partners in this Government but as far as I am concerned very few Labour TDs have spoken about the points of the just Christian social society.  I am glad to see that one Labour TD is present and I hope that she will contribute later.  I cannot see how any Labour Minister can justify the reliefs in the budget being given to the higher income groups alone.  Are the reliefs in the budget given to the man with the higher income so that he can buy a bigger car?  Is the cost of living not the same <Col N="681" /> for him as for the smaller man with a family?</P>
    <P>With regard to the taxation of farmers it is only now that people on the Government side of the House have been meeting deputations.  They are now beginning to realise all that is involved in the assessment of farmers for taxation purposes.  It is a bad thing for anybody to get up and put the town <i>versus</i> the country.  The farmers know that a prosperous town is good for them just as a prosperous rural community is good from the point of view of the local town.  Therefore, it would be unfortunate if there was to be a division of town and country, or if there were to be a division as between the farmer and the worker.  Ours is a small nation so we must work together. As one who was reared on a small farm I know the hardships involved in that life but there are people who do not understand this.  They do not understand, for instance, that the farmer is at the mercy of the weather as well as several other factors.  We all remember how bad a year 1974 was for us.  There are certain journalists who endeavour to paint a picture of what can be done on a farm but the picture is always painted on the basis of everything being right.  This gives a false impression and is doing more harm than good.  Anybody associated with the land knows the variations that can occur from one year to the next.  The theory is all very well but in practice the situation is often very different.</P>
    <P>I have made the point regarding the necessity for providing an incentive for people to build homes for themselves and also the necessity for making available more money for housing through the local authorities.  I have referred too, to the problem of finding employment for our young people.  The situation in this regard is serious.  It is regrettable that we have not heard from more people on the opposite side as to what they think of these measures. After all, the Finance Bill is the instrument by which the budgetary proposals are put into legislation.  This Bill is one of the most important to come before the House but with the exception of two or three people from the other side we have not been given any indication of <Col N="682" /> how the people over there consider these measures.  Even if an election is near, the work of this House should not be neglected.</P>
    <P>I advise the Government that in campaigning for the general election, they should not engage in promises. The people, realising that the promises made on the last occasion have not been fulfilled, will judge the Government on performance.  It is on our performance that we will fight the election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In his Second Reading speech the Minister stated that a precept of the political belief of this Government is that people in similar circumstances should pay similar amounts of tax.  We all accept that as being basic justice but it must be said at the outset that when this Government assumed office in 1973 the situation was that people in similar economic circumstances were paying enormously different amounts of taxation. In this regard the Minister referred to those who, at that time, were engaging in tax avoidance measures, who were resorting to tax havens and who, although having incomes that would put them in the 80 per cent tax bracket paid no tax.  The Minister referred to people similarly situated, people who made money by way of capital gains&mdash;there were those who made a lot of money by way of land and property speculation&mdash;but who paid no tax.  These people did not have to resort to tax avoidance measures because the law at that time did not render them liable for tax.  Similarly there were large landowners who, if they were within the PAYE system, would have been in the 80 per cent bracket but they, too, were not liable for tax.</P>
      <P>Regardless of what Deputy Callanan may say about election promises.  I predict that there will be various promises from the Opposition during the next few weeks or months or whatever time remains before the general election.  However, they cannot expect people to take them seriously in view of their having opposed all reasonable efforts by this Government in the field of tax reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" /> During the 16 years of uninterrupted Fianna Fáil rule the only reform in taxation was to bring thousands of workers within the tax net with the result that the burden placed on those who were on the PAYE system increased during those years out of all proportion to the capacity of the workers to pay.  We have rough figures which indicate that the income tax factor in so far as PAYE was concerned increased by ten during the last years of the Fianna Fáil reign while the contributions of the self-employed increased by a factor of three and the net contribution from companies increased only by a factor of two.  Consequently, we inherited a legacy of injustice in the area of taxation.  Some of that injustice prevails yet but, hopefully, the situation will be rectified totally after this Government are returned to power at the next election. During our next term of office we hope to bring about a just system of taxation. Last year alone some 650,000 workers and others within the PAYE system contributed 81.1 per cent of the total income tax paid in the country.  This is a colossal figure when one realises that the last figures available show that the employees' share of the GNP was only 30 per cent.  I trust that percentage has increased in the meantime.  If the tax payable had been in line with income, the tax should have been in the region of 30 to 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>Under the PAYE system there is no room for discretion.  For instance, claims for expenses connected with one's work are not acceded to.  There is no such thing as a car allowance and neither is there any special consideration in respect of overtime. These are matters to which we should be addressing ourselves.  The question of transport to one's work has become very much a growing feature of our society, involving a good deal of expense and, consequently, worthy of consideration in terms of tax relief.  I am not saying that all money earned from working overtime should be exempt from tax but a case can be made for some concession in this regard. I agree with Deputy Callanan in <Col N="684" /> regard to the hardships associated with life on a small farm, hardships which should be taken into account for the purpose of assessing income tax.  Similarly, those people who are prepared to forego family and social life in order to work overtime so that they might be able to buy the necessities of life for their families should be given some consideration in relation to income tax.  Very often these people work in very difficult conditions, for instance, where there may be unreasonable noise levels.</P>
    <P>However, since this Government came to office considerable improvements have been made in the whole income tax code.  Capital taxation is a far greater feature and yields a far greater amount of money in most EEC countries than it does here and I think it is something that will have to be geared here more progressively as the years go by.  Wealth tax, also opposed on the Opposition benches, is something basic to a just system of taxation and to the relief of those sections of our community who are paying out of all proportion to their share of the wealth.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan made a case for tax on farmers and, particularly for the smaller farmer.  I take his case, but the case has been made against taxation of farmers&mdash;I know Deputy Callanan did not make the case that farmers are paying rates and I think he was right not to make that case&mdash; from these benches and elsewhere that rates are a substitute for taxation.  It has to be borne in mind that 75 per cent of landowners pay no rates and two-thirds of the rates on agricultural land is borne by the Exchequer and, of course, the Exchequer is the ordinary taxpayer and the ordinary taxpayer in the main is the person paying tax through PAYE so arguing that rates are a substitute for taxes does not make any case effectively and, as I said, Deputy Callanan did not make it.</P>
    <P>It is only fair in bringing about a just taxation code to appreciate that there was not enough tax on farmers and it should have been increased as is being done under this Bill.  Workers are taxed when they earn over £13 a week.  Now that is a very small income. <Col N="685" /> It is certainly not a living income and, when we talk about other sectors, we must realise that these are not contributing that much.  There is no other sector other than the person taxed under the PAYE system who is contributing taxation out of income in excess of as low as £13 per week. Whatever multiplier you apply, whatever acreage you are talking about, or whatever other source of income you have, you will not be taxed on an income of £13 a week.</P>
    <P>There is an omission from this Finance Bill which disappoints me.  I refer to the very low rate of working wife's allowance and the fact that this has not been adjusted.  A figure of £230 is very low and the whole attitude towards working wives must be altered.  Under the law the husband is liable for the payment of his wife's income tax on the joint incomes of both spouses.  I think this situation arises from an outdated common law entitlement of the husband to his wife's property.  The theory was that the husband, on undertaking to maintain and support a wife, became entitled to her property.  That principle no longer applies in regard to property rights.  The Married Woman's Status Act, 1957, made wide changes in the law and ensured that a married woman's property remained her own throughout her life and can be disposed of as she pleases.  Nevertheless, in the field of taxation, the out-dated concept that a married woman's existence merges with that of her husband still applies and her income is still deemed to be part of her husband's income.  He is legally bound to show her income on his return and he is liable for the payment of income tax on the joint income of both his wife and himself.  Even though either spouse has the right to apply to be assessed separately the end result is that the married couple pay the same amount as if they were assessed jointly, the only difference being that the usual allowance is apportioned differently between the husband and wife.</P>
    <P>This system works unfairly against the married working wife because the two salaries combined put them into a higher tax bracket much earlier than <Col N="686" /> if their salaries were taxed separately and there is a much higher income tax liability for a married working couple as compared with two single individuals with the same salary, except at the very lowest levels where the wife is earning less than £650 a year.  The British system works more beneficially to the married couple even though they are taxed jointly and in most EEC countries this is also the case.  In Canada and in the USA they are taxed individually.  The working wife's allowance should be substantially increased in the short term and the case can be made to have the working woman treated as a person in her own right, responsible for her own income and getting allowances in the same way as any other person.  I hope the next Finance Bill will as a priority take a new look at the taxation of married women.  That is essential to the whole concept of equal pay.</P>
    <P>I welcome the spread of the tax net generally and the removal of VAT from foodstuffs, clothing, footwear and other essentials.  I welcome the subsidisation of foodstuffs.  This is very essential.  Apart from the fact that inflation is only 3½ per cent lower than it would otherwise be, because of the burden of prices on the lower income groups it is essential to subsidise food. Because income and wealth are so unevenly spread we have this problem of price increases bearing very heavily on those who really have to bear more than their share.  The tax system has been used in the past few years to redistribute wealth but a great deal remains to be done.  There should be a prescribed minimum income.  There should be some way of determining what is an acceptable standard, of pricing that and of ensuring that every individual has that income on which to live.  The Government have gone a long way towards that in their social welfare policy over the last few years, upgrading social welfare rates and bringing in categories which were not covered before.  But no one in the Government is complacent.  There is a backlog and much remains to be done.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 7.  It is an excellent section and one which will have the support of these benches.  It is <Col N="687" /> designed to improve the financial situation of pensioners over 65 years of age on low incomes.  It provides for no tax being deducted from a person whose income is less than £1,000 a year, if single, or £1,800 a year if married.  That applies to the aged allowance group.  With regard to the married allowance of £1,800, does the spouse also have to be in the over age group to qualify because there are situations where the pensioner may well be in the over age group and the spouse a couple of years younger? From my reading of it I believe the pensioner will qualify.  This will benefit to a very great extent large numbers of pensioners on small incomes&mdash; county council road workers, CIE workers and others who have a small income in addition to their pensions and who, of course, were very unjustly taxed up to now and who certainly need the additional income this provision gives them.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes the case that persons with incomes slightly greater than the limits&mdash;the limits meaning the limits of State pensions&mdash;will get marginal relief designed to reduce the tax payable to one half of the excess of total income over the relevant pension limits.  Very definitely the relieving of some 10,000 pensioners is something well justified and I welcome it wholeheartedly.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Government have laid the base of a fair tax system.  That is quite true.  I am very glad that he makes the case quite clearly that further improvements are desirable and feasible because we did inherit a tremendously unjust system. Large improvements have been made in that system over the last four years consistently in budgets introduced by the Minister on which I compliment him heartily.  The burden, particularly that on the lower paid worker, must be further lightened and be tailored to meet his ability to pay.  There is no doubt that down the years the person taxed under PAYE has paid far more than his just share to the tax fund.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for what he has done particularly in relieving pensioners and those on the lowest level <Col N="688" /> of this burden.  However, a great deal remains to be done if these workers are not to carry more than their fair share, if all the other sections who have, by tax avoidance devices or because they were not taxed at all, are to be made pay their just share, bringing about a more equitable society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that our present economic position is very relevant to this debate.  Certainly it is and has been for the last few years and it is only now the Government seem to realise this.</P>
      <P>There are a number of items in this debate very difficult to reconcile with the performance of the Government over the last few years, especially now when they claim that the recession is over and when indications in many areas, especially my own, are that as far as industrial development is concerned it is far from being over.  This is difficult also when one takes into account Government borrowing in recent years with so little to be shown for it.  In such circumstances it is difficult to see how the Minister could be so optimistic in his introductory speech.</P>
      <P>Our main concern relates to job creation and rising prices.  We on this side of the House are glad that the Coalition have closely examined the Fianna Fáil economic policy document published last year even though they seem to have poached some of our ideas.  Indeed, had they stolen even more, it would have been to the benefit of the country as a whole.  To date, the Government have been unable to generate the type of confidence in industry the country so needs at present. Such confidence is necessary to get the country moving again.  In many fields we on this side of the House have shown how job creation could be implemented.  One field in which I am particularly interested is that of tourism.  We all accept that job creation constitutes the country's greatest single need at present.  Then there is the need for exports as a prime requirement to the recovery of our economy. A major contribution could be effected in both of those fields.  Certainly the Government's efforts have been less than adequate in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> The punishment inflicted in last year's Finance Bill had serious consequences not alone on tourism but on the country's finances generally when there was a massive increase in petrol, motor taxation and drink with the inevitable follow-up of the falling off of tourists from England.  The major advantage to be gained from placing greater emphasis on the development of tourism is that it has the capacity to distribute the nation's wealth evenly between the rich and poor and urban and rural areas which cannot be achieved as effectively in any other field.  Our aim should be to encourage the authorities to provide more money for its development and identify special features with potential for visitors.  Bearing in mind the present rate at which we are providing amenities in small centres and rural areas, it will be a long time before we are in a position to provide the high standard entitled to be expected by our visitors.</P>
    <P>In the matter of job creation one will have noticed from Press reports in the past few days that there have been further job losses especially affecting the area I represent where there were 250 lost in Roadstone.  It is not confined to that area alone but they happen to have a number of plants there.  It was stated that 250 men employed by Roadstone were to lose their jobs, that the redundancies were to take place over the next month and would be spread throughout the country, due to a cut-back in demand for materials in the building and construction industry in the private and public sectors.  In a statement by the company yesterday it was said that there was no foreseeable improvement in the level of activity in the industry and that, therefore, it was necessary to cut back.  That statement contrasts very sharply with the optimistic tone of the Minister's speech.  That was another industry in which Fianna Fáil foresaw the opportunity of job creation, through their economic policy, where we foresaw an opportunity of cutting down on the labour queues.</P>
    <P>While that problem obtains on a national scale, there is the problem in <Col N="690" /> my area of a number of quarries which until the end of last year were able to compete with manufacturers of concrete products across the Border. However, because of the massive increase in the price of cement allowed here without a similar one in the Six Counties manufacturers are faced with the situation now that there is a differential of over £4.50 in the price of a ton of cement.  When this is related to ready-mixed concrete or other concrete products, there is a difference of £1.25 in a cubic metre.  The result is that there is a £10 difference on every load of concrete produced here making our manufacturers unable to compete.</P>
    <P>On the 2nd February last I raised this matter with the Minister for Industry and Commerce when I put a question down asking him:</P>
    <P>. . . the steps he proposes to take to ensure continuity of employment in industries manufacturing concrete products in Border counties following the increase in cement prices.</P>
    <P>In the course of his reply the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The differential between the price of cement in Northern Ireland and that applying here is an important factor in the matter but my understanding is that the price of the Northern Ireland manufactured cement is expected to increase during the coming months with a consequent narrowing of the differential.</P>
    <P>He went on to talk about our being members of the EEC and about restrictions on imports and added:</P>
    <P>It is true that APC are currently seeking a 3½ per cent price increase, which is very small, but that is not the end of the story.  Press reports indicate that further increases will be sought during the spring and later and these should help to narrow, though not fully remove the price differential for cement.</P>
    <P>The Prices Commission in England have refused to award an increase in cement prices and the result is that manufacturers on this side of the border have been left in a completely <Col N="691" /> uncompetitive position which would have a serious effect here because subcontractors who were engaged in laying concrete laneways and farmyards&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the emphasis laid on job creation, I felt it is only right we should bring this to the attention of the Minister who controls finance.  If we brought it to the notice of either the Minister for Agriculture or for Local Government, we would be told that it is a matter for the Minister for Finance to provide the necessary money.  There are import facilities accorded to northern cement manufacturers without reciprocal arrangements from this side and I would ask the Minister, as I have already asked the Parliamentary Secretary, to take this up as a matter of urgency with the UK customs authorities. In his introductory speech the Minister said:</P>
      <P>Demand for imported materials for further production and for producers' capital goods, such as machinery and equipment, continues at a very high level indicating a continuing recovery in investment activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That cuts both ways.  Two weeks ago there was a report in <i>The Irish Press</i> indicating that 90 per cent of farm machinery is being imported.  Chris Young, president of a manufacturing concern, referred to 35 per cent of light machinery which can be made here.  We have the equipment and the know-how.  We are to have a regulation making it compulsory to have safety frames on tractors from next October.  These could be manufactured here.  Any of them manufactured here are manufactured under licence from a firm outside the country.  The reason why small manufacturers are not moving into that market is because the testing of safety frames made here must be carried out in England which necessitates both frames and tractors <Col N="692" /> being transported to England at a cost of £450 a time.  There are dozens of small engineering works anxious to get into this field and I suggest we should be setting up the necessary testing equipment here so that frames and other safety devices can be manufactured in this country.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister why has there been failure to honour the payment of cattle feed vouchers.  The scheme was introduced in 1974 but the Fresh Meat Exporters' Society failed to honour the vouchers and there is still £500,000 due to merchants throughout the country.  We have been told the matter is <i>sub judice</i> and that it cannot be discussed in the House, but the scheme was introduced by the Government with the blessing of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>They should be paid. A previous speaker mentioned the income tax provisions in relation to self-employed people but the Minister did not spell out whether they would affect small agricultural contractors.  We would hope that it would not be so severe as to leave us without those agricultural contractors.  If those who were doing work for farmers came completely under the tax net for the full valuation of their farms this could have serious consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to job creation, I appeal to the Minister to introduce and announce before Christmas a scheme under the EEC Regional Fund whereby moneys would be provided to enable the IDA to erect small advance factories where training could be done prior to larger factories being erected. He has said that the money is available for a number of factories.  Three were established in Carrick-on-Shannon. I asked the Minister to have some of the money channelled towards the north-eastern region where there has been a great percentage fall-off in jobs and where 27 industries have closed since January, 1973.  Not alone should the Minister give the money for the provision of those factories but he also should give that area additional <Col N="693" /> incentives and additional grant aids.  In the regional development report to which I referred earlier, Mr. Cullinane, the director, claimed that in that area up to the Border the business people were not eager to set up industries. The only way to induce people to go to that area is to provide added benefits and incentives.  Neither the Minister nor the IDA can direct industries into an area if people do not wish to go there, but if the incentives and benefits were increased sufficiently that area would be as acceptable as any other and the fall-off would be stopped.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the employment premium.  It is a great pity that over the last couple of years the Minister for Labour did not make the efforts he made in the last few days in announcing this.  It seems now to be an election gimmick or a personal advertisement. He should previously have advertised it widely and brought it to the attention of industrialists.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, there is very little in this Bill to create the confidence which is required to get this country moving and the people back to work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity of discussing this Bill because it puts into effect the proposals outlined in the budget announced some months ago and gives an opportunity to Deputies to highlight the many problems that exist in our society at present.  It will enable them to bring those problems to the notice of the Government and it is hoped that the Government will, in putting this Bill through, be able to remedy some of those problems.</P>
      <P>Two of the most difficult problems at present are inflation and unemployment. They have to be tackled by whichever Government are in power. The Coalition Government were elected primarily because they promised to stabilise prices.  Since they were elected in 1973 prices have almost doubled. The current rate of inflation is the highest in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not the highest it must be in the top two or three. Inflation is a fraud on the thrifty, the <Col N="694" /> prudent and the savers.  Such people are sacrificed to the spendthrift by continuing inflation.  For example, people retired three or four years ago on a fixed pension which was adequate when the Coalition took office.  Food, heat, light and so on which cost, say, £100 then cost £200 now.  These people simply have to do without many benefits. Such people have given their best to the community and it is poor gratitude that they should be savaged like this in their declining years.  However, that is how inflation works its various injustices.  It savages the weak and fawns on the strong.  It is an evil which only a strong, compassionate Government can rectify.  We in Fianna Fáil have always been helpful to the weaker sections of the community and that is one of the reasons for our existence.  It is important that we be given the opportunity to come to the aid of those people once again, because now they are in greater need than ever before.</P>
      <P>If inflation hits the weak it also hits the prudent and the savers who have built up our enormous amount of savings over the past three or four years.  I believe we are the greatest net savers in Europe.  When we consider how savings have been eroded for the past few years by inflation the fact must be faced that people will not have the heart to save any longer.  One hundred pounds placed on deposit four years ago is worth only about £50 at present money values and there is no guarantee that it will not be worth even less next year. How long is this to last?  Sooner or later the saver will recognise that he is being systematically robbed and exploited for his prudence by a Government who not only allowed inflation to run at such a high level for so long but also contributed significantly to it in successive budgets, in the teeth of advice to the contrary from Fianna Fáil.  Sooner or later the prudent are going to stop lending to this Government. They must at some stage withdraw their deposits and spend them before they are entirely eroded by inflation.  That is the crunch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several times in the past three or four years our spokesman on Finance stressed the urgent need for an economic <Col N="695" /> plan.  Eventually it was promised for mid-summer by the Minister for Finance, but mid-summer came and went and still there was no plan.  It was at this point that Fianna Fáil took it upon themselves to produce a document on the economy, setting out how we proposed to tackle the problems of unemployment and inflation. These two problems plus our steadily increasing national debt are sources of worry to every citizen.  Since the Coalition Government took office foreign borrowing has increased fourfold and the cost of servicing the national debt has trebled in the same period.  That combination, without question, constituted the most serious economic challenge to the nation since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>Unless the Government changes their current policy we cannot hope to see any improvement in the unemployment situation in the near future. The opposite is most likely to take place, with the number of school leavers now emerging from schools without any prospects of jobs.  If we look back over the past year we will find that a very high percentage of the school leavers who came on to the labour market last year are still looking for any kind of employment.  I often wonder why the Government could not put an injection of capital into the building and construction industry. This is one area where jobs could be created but at present it has the highest unemployment rate.  This is an industry which utilises a very low proportion of imported goods.  Money could be spent on community projects which would give employment to many young people.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Government have failed to increase the grants payable to people who are building their own houses.  They have failed to increase the income limit for qualifying for grants and loans.  How can the Government expect people to get married and settle down here, if they do not offer them grants and loans that will encourage them to make a start? Married people usually build houses for themselves and their families and <Col N="696" /> stay in these houses for the rest of their lives.  It is a shame that despite the fact that the price of building materials and of labour has been increasing over the past three or four years, the Minister for Local Government has doggedly refused to alter the limits set for qualifying for these grants and loans.</P>

      <P>I accept the ruling but I am sure that some of the taxation referred to in this Finance Bill will be used for the building of houses and it is relevant for me to mention this fact and to highlight my dissatisfaction with the Government for refusing to increase the grants and loans.  If it were necessary to alter the taxation system to provide for this great need, I am sure support would come from both sides of the House for such a worthy proposition.  These are just a few areas to which Fianna Fáil when returned to power propose to direct their attention.  Fianna Fáil's sound policies and good planning will solve simultaneously the three problems of massive unemployment, rampant inflation and excessive budget deficits. The present policy of borrowing on a large scale from foreign lending institutions must stop if we are to make any serious impact on inflation.  Were it not for the tax policy of the Government much of the money now being raised abroad could be raised here. Unfortunately our investors have no confidence in the Coalition Government and millions of pounds that could have been invested in industry have been withdrawn and invested outside the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot explain that. I doubt if it is true.  If it is, the Minister should proceed immediately to increase the grants and loans to the people I have mentioned who wish to build their own houses and live there. Incentives are needed to encourage investment because without investment the country cannot survive.  Reductions in income tax are necessary and can be provided as effectively and more efficiently than increases in money incomes. If companies are to invest and create employment they should be allowed to retain sufficient of their profits to help finance investments and thereby reduce the necessity for borrowing excessively at very high interest rates.  Fianna Fáil on return to Government will put these policies into operation and will pull this country out of the morass into which the Government have dragged it in the last four years.  A hopeless condition of gloom, despondency and pessimism now obtains here.  Businessmen and entrepreneurs do not know what to expect of a Government hopelessly divided on the most basic issues of principle as to the fundamental framework within which normal business can be planned and conducted.  The self-employed professional men and women and the executives who run the country's business feel that they have been victimised to the point where there is virtually no incentive to <Col N="698" /> apply that additional effort which the country obviously needs.  Every working man sees a bewildering reduction in his living standards and his worst fears are that the firm which employs him will collapse, that his job will not be there and that his future may not be as secure as he thought a few years ago.</P>
      <P>The same thing applies to the proprietors of small business concerns because they feel threatened on every side by competition from big businesses and by the draconian taxation system which makes no provision for the special position of small industry. The situation now could be compared with that which existed in 1956 and 1957 under the last Coalition Government.  Then, as now, the economy was not expanding, unemployment was growing daily and agriculture was depressed.  However when Fianna Fáil were returned to office there was a sense of relief, of confidence and of optimism. Following that, we witnessed 15 years of uninterrupted growth and I am confident that Fianna Fáil when called upon to do so again will perform in the same way as they did during those progressive years.  I am confident that they will face up to their responsibilities and provide the leadership and policies to pull the country out of the mess we have got into under the present Administration.  I am confident that then we will see the country moving forward once again.  That confidence and leadership is sadly lacking at present.  We need confidence and leadership to encourage people to establish industries to create employment and reduce the huge unemployment figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a lot during the course of this debate about tax on farming profits.  As has been pointed out by speakers from this side of the House, we do not object to farmers paying their fair share of tax on their profits but what annoys us is the hullabaloo that was made in the last two years by members of the Government and, particularly, by Labour Party members who are not present now about the huge profits made by the farming community.  Those people do not understand what a farmer has <Col N="699" /> to go through daily in order to provide a living for his family and himself. They seem to think that because a farmer may get a good price for his stock or milk for a few months annually it has been happening down through the years and, as a result, he is in the millionaire bracket.  When one thinks of what happened a few years ago one can well understand what the farming community suffered during that lean period.  It is absurd for the Minister to expect farmers to pay their tax before they know what their profits will be.  I hope the Minister will concede on this issue.  I understand the IFA made submissions to him in the course of which they outlined clearly what they would like to happen.  I hope the Minister will concede their demands.</P>
    <P>I am worried about section 10 of the Bill.  Under this section farmers with a small business will be brought into the tax net.  The £50 ceiling is being abolished.  That will affect many farmers in the west of Ireland engaged in small contracting businesses or who run a small shop in conjunction with their farm.  They all give a valuable service to the local community but now they must pay for their enterprise and their initiative.  That will stymie any effort by those people to progress, improve their standard of living or the service they are providing for the local community.  The Minister should reconsider that section.  The people concerned feel they would be better off to forget about their business and draw the dole with the rest of the boys.  That is a sad state of affairs. Those people are being victimised for their enterprise.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention the question of a means test for old age pensions and unemployment assistance. During the election campaign the National Coalition told us that they would abolish the means test for old age pensions but in recent times there has been an upsurge in the activities of the social welfare officers in our area.  Those officials are checking on the means of old age pensioners. Old age pensions and widows pensions have been reduced drastically in many cases as a result of a call by <Col N="700" /> social welfare officers.  It is very unfair to do this particularly at this time when prices are increasing so rapidly, the cost of living is increasing, and the cost of providing the necessaries of life for old age pensioners has increased substantially.  It is very unfortunate that they should be subjected to this kind of treatment.</P>
    <P>The same applies to people in receipt of unemployment assistance. They are being persecuted because their means have increased over the past couple of years.  I fail to understand that, particularly from a Government who said they hoped to abolish the means test.  Anybody who tries to improve his standard of living, or who tries to be progressive under this Government, is taxed and is chased by social welfare officers.</P>
    <P>I should like to see provision in this Bill for amenity grants for local authorities.  This scheme could be very usefully applied.  It was introduced by a previous Fianna Fáil Administration. Unfortunately, the present Administration decided they would no longer make money available for this scheme and they stopped it.  The result is that, if a local authority want to provide any type of amenity scheme, they must provide the money out of the rates.  It is a shame that the Government will not make money available for this purpose.  Not only would it help to provide a very valuable service to the local community, but it would also help to give very useful employment to our young people.  It would give them a sense of pride in their local community. It would help and encourage them to take an active part in promoting those schemes for the betterment of the whole community.  It is unfortunate that the Government decided to suspend payment of grants for those schemes.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters arising under this Finance Bill which I do not propose to deal with at present.  It is absolutely essential that money should be available for the grants I have asked for to enable young people to build their own houses.  The grants and the loans limits should be increased.  In doing so, the Government would be doing a good days work for the country, <Col N="701" /> and for the young people who are anxious to ensure their future and establish their homes here.  That is not happening at present.</P>
    <P>We want to see the figure of 118,000 unemployed, or whatever it might be, reduced.  The Minister says under his proposals he can reduce it to under 100,000 in a few years.  Even a figure of 100,000 is too many.  We want to see proposals put into effect which will help to create industry and attract foreign industrialists.  In order to do so, money should be made available to expand the infrastructures and to provide water and sewerage schemes in small towns and villages.  There are many areas which are long distances from growth centres.  Workers have to commute to those centres.  The cost of commuting has increased substantially over the years.  The Minister's increase in the price of petrol and motor taxation has contributed in no small way to the laying off of many workers who heretofore commuted daily to their places of employment which, in many cases, were 30 or 40 miles from their homes.</P>
    <P>Motoring has become so expensive that it does not pay people to travel to work.  Many of them would tell you that, when they have paid their tax, their social welfare contribution, the tax on their motor cars and the tax on petrol, they are better off drawing the dole.  This is a very sad state of affairs. Some concesions should be made to workers who have to travel long distances to work.  Unless this is done, those workers will leave their local community and go to live in the cities. or possibly emigrate if they can get jobs abroad.  Naturally, they are a loss to their community.  Every worker working away from home and travelling back to his own community is an asset to that community because, whatever he earns, is spent locally.  It is put into production locally and, for that reason, he is a considerable loss to his own community if he has to go away and live elsewhere.  If there were industries in our small towns the workers would not have to travel such long distances.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take note of the few points I mentioned.  I am glad I had the opportunity to make a contribution on this Finance Bill which <Col N="702" /> I consider one of the most important Bills to come before the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the provisions of the Finance Bill, 1977, and in particular the tax reliefs and tax reforms contained therein.  We have seen the efforts of the Minister for Finance over the past four years, plus, to achieve for the people a much more equitable and much fairer system for paying tax on their income.  It is no harm to look back on the system which operated prior to the change of Government in 1973 when the sector earning the greatest amount of money were paying the least amount of tax. I do not suppose we will ever achieve a system whereby every person will pay taxation completely in keeping with his earnings.  Now the amount of tax that is contributed to the Exchequer by the higher earning sector of the population, the self-employed people, professional people and people with companies is far greater, percentagewise, than it was when the Minister took office.  He deserves great credit for what he has achieved.</P>
      <P>We would like to see greater relief given to those we call the new poor of the urban areas, those people who are hardest hit at the moment who have to bear the burden of every price increase, increased school payments, increased transport costs and the increased price of clothing.  During the past decade the people known as the white collar workers have been hardest hit.  The Minister deserves the praise of every member of his party as well as that of every Member of the House for his efforts to alleviate the plight of those people.</P>
      <P>In this year's budget rates relief is given.  This will be spread right across the board.  There will be no means test involved.  Many people were victimised in the past because they owned their own homes.  Many people who were reared in homes which had a high valuation and wished to remain in them were forced to sell them and move into smaller homes because the wage earner died.  The Minister has now made it possible that in the foreseeable future people will not have to sell their homes because of the rates burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="703" /> Psychiatrists tell us that the second most dramatic thing that can happen to an individual after the death of the wage earner is having to change the address.  I have always thought it was unjust on families, particularly widows and orphans, when the wage earner died, to have to change their homes. Many widows were forced to leave their homes and move to smaller houses where the rates were lower and possibly the repayments were not as big.  The greatest saving was on the rates.  Widows were advised to sell their homes, because the rates would be a crippling burden on them, and move to smaller homes.</P>
    <P>We should give priority to the widow in introducing any Finance Bill because she is an unique person in our society.  We have the highest percentage of orphans under the age of 16 in comparison with other countries in Europe.  The person who is most often removed from the family circle is the husband.  The death rate is higher with the male than with the female.  We find that the Irish widow, in comparison with Europe, is an exception.  She has more children to look after than any other widow in the EEC countries and her children are invariably younger and are closer together.  We should single out the Irish widow who is a mother as being the person who is in greatest need of assistance.  Widows should be assisted to keep their homes until their children have finished school.</P>
    <P>Much has been done by the Minister for the single parent family.  There is an increased number of those during the past decade.  Many of those unmarried mothers have two or three children but they are now being helped by the State.  The deserted wife also receives assistance from the different State departments.  Those people are not as deprived as the woman who has lost her husband and is forced to leave her home.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the 25 per cent rates remission which the Minister introduced in the budget.  This is in respect of the second half of the rates payment due on the 1st of July next. This will be continued into next year. <Col N="704" /> No spokesman from the Fianna Fáil benches has come up with a proposal equal to this.  For many years the Minister for Finance, when in Opposition, advocated an equitable system of rates payment.  It is a great thing to see his work over the years bearing fruit now. It must be a source of satisfaction to the Minister to have been able to announce this reduction in the rates. Our effort should be now to abolish rates completely on private dwellings. This would not affect in any way the financial set-up of local authorities because they would continue to collect rates on business premises, office blocks and so on.  It was only in repect of private houses that we backbenchers have ever asked for rates relief.  It was only in this area that we were lobbied by the citizens for rates relief, at least, that has been the position so far as Dublin is concerned.  People did not object to paying rates on their business premises.  If they were making a profit, they were allowed include rates for the purposes of income tax assessment.</P>
    <P>One welcomes the extra provisions in regard to pension contributions. One would have liked, too, to see the income tax relief in respect of personal or mortgage loans being increased but obviously the Minister did not consider this an opportune time to make such a change.  The value of the £ has fallen so much in the past four years as to warrant consideration of a change in this area.  Having regard to the rampant inflation of recent years, it would be no harm to consider building in some sort of safeguard against inflation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred recently to the amount of money which we in Ireland spend on food for domestic pets.  It is interesting to recall that in the budget of 1970 there was no limit imposed in respect of the amount of medicines for domestic pets that were free of tax. However, the Minister has rectified that situation but some anomalies remain regarding tax on certain medicines.  This has always been a grey area.  There was always some question in regard to pharmaceutical preparations <i>vis-à-vis</i> preparations of a para-medical constitution.  I am of the opinion that all proprietary medicines <Col N="705" /> should be free of taxation.  I refer in particular to medicines that are injectable, to medicines in the form of creams or drops or, perhaps, suppositories. These may be small items but the defects that have persisted in legislation in regard to them for the past number of years should be corrected.</P>
    <P>There may be good reasons for the Minister excluding from tax certain types of medicines and for his placing emphasis on medicines that are taken orally.  The point is, though, that medicines can be administered in various ways.  They can be applied to the skin or applied to the eye, nose and ear or they may be applied by way of suppository.  Some effort should be made to rationalise the situation.</P>
    <P>One can only marvel at the massive benefits that have accrued to the people during the past few years.  For instance, we have now reached a situation where almost 40 per cent of the population are GMS card holders &mdash;in some counties it is as high as 60 per cent&mdash;entitling them to a choice of doctor and choice of chemist.  At the time of the introduction of the element of choice there was a misunderstanding. There were many who got the impression that this meant that one could go to any doctor at any time, whereas the choice in regard to time related only to a chemist.  In other words, a person must continue to visit the doctor whom he attended first until such time as the necessary arrangements for changing to another doctor have been made.</P>
    <P>Another misunderstanding arose in this regard in that there were some who thought that each patient would have a choice of doctor.  In practice, this is not the case.  The cardholder who is generally the husband chooses the doctor and should there be a wife and eight children involved, each of them, on requiring the services of a doctor, will have to go to the doctor chosen by the cardholder in order to be eligible for benefit from the service. The general principle of that scheme was changed slightly.  I presume this was in the interest of making the scheme more effective from an administrative point of view.  Our GMS <Col N="706" /> scheme is, perhaps, one of the best general medical schemes anywhere in the world.  It is financed entirely by the State.  There is no contribution on the part of the cardholder.  All medicines, appliances, transport costs, hospitalisation costs and back-up services are totally free.  In other words, from the cradle to the grave a medical cardholder need not spend a penny on health services.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy but he seems to be engaging in some detail in respect of the health services.  This, of course, would be a matter for the appropriate Estimate, the Health Estimate, and I am anxious the Deputy would relate his remarks more closely to the Finance Bill and the taxation measures therein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for drawing my attention to that.  I was referring to the situation where almost 40 per cent of the population have a completely free health service and what I would like to see in this Bill is provision whereby medical expenses incurred by non-medical cardholders would be increased for the purpose of being allowed against income tax.  A short time ago the amount was £50. That is roughly £1 a week or roughly 15 new pence per day.  There are certain anomalies here.  Are all the family included in that £50?  For instance, if there are six in family does it mean £300?  It is easy enough to discuss these things here but, when it comes to claiming, there can be different views on interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the purchase of drugs, we are very lucky in that 60 per cent of the population are covered by voluntary health insurance and those contributions are allowed against income tax.  One drawback in this scheme is that there is no built-in protection where costs have increased and the number of units is not sufficient.  For example, if units date from April, 1976, and an individual goes into hospital in March, 1977, we can rest assured that that individual will be covered to the extent of only 50 per cent.  It is only when there is a massive increase that the VHI covers the increase.  To take in the VHI into the ordinary health <Col N="707" /> network would not be a good thing. The VHI deserves great credit for keeping its administrative costs so low. Administration costs represent 8 per cent of the total collected.  This is a mini-miracle.</P>
    <P>I would like now to refer to the creation of the myth surrounding the wealth of individuals.  There are two very erroneous ideas associated with wealth.  The first is that wealth comes from the exploitation of others.  That may have been the case prior to the industrial revolution but, since the industrial revolution, nobody has been able to get slaves to work in a factory or in an office.  It is entirely erroneous for political ideologists to attempt to argue that wealth is created by individuals through the exploitation of other individuals.  Slavery went out a long time ago.  There was the implication that one could generate wealth by paying extremely low wages and this was a kind of cancer that affected trade union and management relationships. Admittedly, bad management and low wages were the cause of nonviable industries going to the wall.  But low wages are not paid today and wealth is no longer accumulated by savings on low wages.</P>
    <P>The other erroneous idea is that wealth is created from natural resources. There are very few countries that have become wealthy from their natural resources.  Saudi Arabia became dependent on a single natural resource but that resource was developed only because there was a market available for it.  There must be a market available outside the country to purchase the resource.  The bulk of the world's natural resources are used by the 15 per cent of the world's population that exists between the United States and western Europe and developing countries could not sell their resources unless the wealth was there in the western world to purchase them and the western world approximately 200 years ago discovered how to create wealth.  Wealth was created by an exercise somewhat similar to the training of a boxer&mdash;the muscle was the same but it became more productive and more proficient.  In that way wealth was created in the western <Col N="708" /> world.  It should never be held as a viable view that wealth automatically stems from natural resources.  Natural resources of themselves are useless unless there is a market available for them.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government's neglect of young people as exemplified by its failure to provide adequate employment opportunities for them and by its lack of concern for youth organisation and development generally.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy G. Fitzgerald.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I said that one cannot deal with youth in isolation, that one must tackle the youth unemployment problem as part of the overall national programme or plan to create opportunity.  Secondly, I said that one cannot deal with youth unemployment in isolation, that it is part also of the educational programme and I instanced, as effectively as one could in the circumstances, how we in Government, had tailored the direction of education at primary, post-primary and third level towards the opportunity there would be at the end of technology, the National Institution of Higher Education and the National Council for Educational Awards, that young people with third-level qualifications would make the maximum contribution to the development of our society.  I noted with regret that, for one reason or another, the Government had changed all that at every stage of the line.  Those are fundamental decisions that must be corrected and that hopefully we will correct in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said all of that, people always tend to ask: What precise plan do you have?  I regard the overall plan as being more important but one must have also precise plans to deal with what one might call the immediate emergency of young unemployed <Col N="709" /> people.  Perhaps I might be allowed to refer to a written reply given yesterday to a question tabled by Deputy Brennan to the Taoiseach.  On the face of it the question might not seem to have much to do with youth unemployment because it asked the Taoiseach the present estimated population of County Donegal.  The reply was that reliable information on the population of individual counties is available only for years in which censuses of population had been taken.  Therefore the population of County Donegal in April, 1971, was 108,549.  There is no reliable information on the population of any county since 1971.  If we want to plan for our future economic development we must be able not simply to count heads in Counties Donegal, Tipperary, Kerry, Dublin or Limerick, but to look at the structure of our society&mdash;agricultural and industrial&mdash;and ensure, as any businessman or farmer must do, that when we plan for the future we know about the present.  The Taoiseach, on yesterday's admission, acknowledged that we do not even know the number of people in each county on any reliable basis.  He was asked only for the estimated population.</P>
    <P>First of all, that regrettable decision would have to be changed and a census taken.  I know the political consequences which no doubt were in the Taoiseach's mind&mdash;that there would have to be a review of constituencies. If we are to think simply in terms of our narrow interests in this House and ask our economic future, and young people in particular, to suffer because we want to secure our positions on one or other side, it is shameful, and it seems to be the only reason.  I am talking of one precise area alone.  Let us assume £500,000 for administration, and that is very high&mdash;£1 million would employ 1,000 young people at £1,000 per annum for one year.  Did someone suggest that we do not need that? Did someone suggest there was any more appropriate activity in which our young people could be involved at present than that of taking a census of this nation, the consequences of which would be a plan for their future? Could there be anything more appropriate? About three times the cost of <Col N="710" /> that advertisement by the Minister for Labour&mdash;and I do not know what the cost of that nonsense would be&mdash;would have given employment directly to our young people, on the undertaking of a census, if there was any sense of direction or commitment.</P>
    <P>If we say it will take six months, then they have £2,000, or 2,000 young people at £1,000.  How vital it is that this plan be undertaken because they are the people who will be involved in our future and it would be important to give them even some short-term hope.  That is the number one, short-term, emergency proposal shamefully overlooked.  I suppose, because of the rather buoyant receipts from the inflationary VAT returns, at present the Government are sorry they did it because they now recognise how important it was.  For the sake of that small amount they killed it.</P>
    <P>Our young people have a commitment to our society.  Fianna Fáil have stated their commitment in relation to our Garda Síochána to maintain order and peace in our society.  I carefully avoid using the phrase &ldquo;law and order&rdquo; because that has been a term abused from South Africa to the North of Ireland.  Perhaps in some people's minds it means what we would all like it to mean but it has been abused to represent, sometimes, the State controlling, directing and disciplining all of us in every aspect of our lives.  But I do say the &ldquo;peace and security&rdquo; of every citizen in their individual homes. That is a constructive contribution our young people can make, and there are thousands of them at present waiting to get into the Garda Síochána.  An extra 500 of them are to be taken into the force to be able to contribute to the welfare of our society and pay taxes accordingly.  I know that in Templemore, in my constituency, where these people should be trained they are not being trained.  We are still waiting for them.  The position of Fianna Fáil is quite clear on that: we will, as a matter of emergency&mdash;because it is an emergency&mdash;correct that.</P>
    <P>Then there were the emergency economic proposals we made&mdash;and I am including them all in the context of my general comments&mdash;<Col N="711" /> which would be related to community youth projects.  We have the example of Canada and what they have achieved there.  When we stated this in our economic emergency document we had studied the Canadian precedent. Young people are at present creating opportunities for themselves in projects, such as those going on in this city under which our young boys and girls, through the Catholic Youth Council, are providing off-the-street employment, if one wishes to term it as such, in 124 clubs.  They must be supported through a State agency. They do not qualify for the goodies of the Minister for Labour who will give them £20 for nothing.  They have a little more intelligence than to respond to that type of thing.</P>

      <P>If I have a sense of urgency, I am entitled to have it. If I have a sense of shame that that is being done in our name, I am equally entitled to have it.  There are so many young boys and girls at home, having finished their education, waiting for work.  We will all meet them. Why should they have to come to me or to any Deputy but if they have to one thing should be acknowledged: it is no fault of theirs that they are being kept in their parents' homes while they await work.  They should not be assessed in a manner as if what their parents provide for them in the way of food and clothing were income.  They are entitled at least to the independence of thinking that for two years they will not be drones on their parents.  That is the saddest part of it all.  We pay unemployment assistance <Col N="712" /> to others but we put an estimate on the value of upkeep of young people who have to be maintained in their parents' homes and we say: They have a comfortable bed, a good suit, they get their breakfast, dinner and tea and that is estimated as being at least £14 a week and, therefore, they do not qualify for assistance.  That is sad and regrettable.</P>
      <P>This is a debate that could continue for a long time.  At least I hope it will have aroused something.  I started last evening by saying I did not attach any personal blame to the Parliamentary Secretary.  However, I do question a Government who will ask any man to be responsible for everything from consumer prices to industrial promotion, to a fair trade commission; to be assistant to a Minister in all of those spheres, and take him from the responsibility we created when the need was much less than it is now&mdash;a responsibility I was glad to shoulder&mdash;of full-time Parliamentary Secretary with responsibility for youth out of school.  If the Government want to show an earnest of their commitment they will restore some responsibility to that position so that young people will be rendered a focal point in Government they do not have at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to curtail my remarks to the extent necessary to allow the Minister for Labour to contribute to the debate.  I intended to deal firstly with the preparation which takes place in the educational system of young people for work and to the improvements made in that area in recent years.  Secondly, I will deal with some general measures taken to improve the economic performance, and thirdly I will deal with out-of-school education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy O'Kennedy said, it is very important that young people should be properly guided in choosing the right careers.  For too long young people have tended to go into academically oriented jobs.  Clearly there exists other opportunities in the skilled trade area and in business, and it is therefore necessary to provide the right <Col N="713" /> kind of advice for young people to make this most important and difficult decision.  It is for that reason that the Government have significantly in-increased the number of guidance teachers in our schools.  In 1973-74 there were only 214 guidance teachers, of whom three were in community schools.  In 1977 the number has been increased to 370 of whom 30 are in community schools.  This is of great value to our young people in making career decisions.</P>
    <P>It is very important also, and here I am in agreement with what Deputy O'Kennedy said, that there be an emphasis on technological education because it is in that area that the greatest opportunities exist, because there we can develop entrepreneurs and we need youthful entrepreneurs to provide initiative in our economy.  It is people with technical education who are best fitted to meet this need.</P>
    <P>I should like briefly to outline the expansion that has taken place in this area in the past four years.  The most apt figure to quote in this connection would be the number of young people who have had whole-time student enrolment in technician courses in the regional technical colleges, Carlow, Letterkenny, Waterford, Limerick, Sligo, Athlone and Galway.  In 1973, the number taking technical subjects at leaving certificate level was 13,051 and in 1977 the figure was 25,900.  Further expansions are planned and it should be remembered that in these schools there is a commitment of Government resources amounting to more than £8 million.  Therefore, there has been a massive increase in the number of young people with employment potential.</P>
    <P>From the figures I have just given it will be noted that the number of young people with these skills has practically doubled in the past four years. That is the result of increased financial provision, more teachers, more woodwork rooms and more rooms for the various technical subjects being taught in these various schools.</P>
    <P>It is also important&mdash;and I have spoken of this before in similar debates &mdash;that before leaving school young people should if possible have an opportunity to work for short periods <Col N="714" /> in a variety of different jobs.  In this connection I mention particularly Navan, in my own constituency, where a pre-work year has been laid down for pupils as an experimental measure. The pupils can go out to work in various factories in Navan while still at school.  I am proud that this initiative has been taken in my own constituency. In 1975-76, 139 pupils took part in this sort of pre-employment, mixed study-work programme.  In 1976-77 this number had been increased to 390.</P>
    <P>In regard to performance, and in particular to the provision of job opportunities for young people.  I should like to indicate some of the measures taken by the Government.  In 1972-73 as a result of IDA grant commitment of £30 million, a figure of 12,455 new jobs was aimed at.  As against this, in 1976, when it was less easy to get firms to agree to set up a grant commitment of £66 million led to the sanctioning of projects with a job potential of over 18,000.  This was an increase of 50 per cent in the number of jobs being created in 1976 as against 1973 with the aid of the IDA. This is the result of increased assistance and powers given by the Government to the IDA through various legislation in this House.  Approximately 25 per cent of the new jobs created by the IDA go to young school-leavers. The President of the Irish Management Institute said that in his opinion the opportunities for business in this country were never as good as at present and he felt that the ball was now firmly in the court for business to respond to the opportunities provided.</P>
    <P>Another indication of an improvement in our economy has been an increase in 1976 of 11 per cent in productivity in manufacturing industry. This compares with an average annual increase in that field of only 6 per cent.  That increased productivity has enabled us to increase exports vastly.  If we are to increase exports still further and avail of the opportunities presented to us by the devaluation of sterling, it will not be enough just to increase productivity.  There must be increased employment.  The indications are that production in 1977 <Col N="715" /> in manufacturing industry will go up by approximately 10 per cent, and that must mean more jobs.  This will be assisted by the new measure announced by the Minister for Finance to provide corporation tax relief in relation to certain manufacturing companies as an incentive to raising employment. This provides for a reduced rate, namely, 25 per cent, of corporation tax on profits for manufacturing companies who achieve in the coming year an increase of 5 per cent in volume of sales and 3 per cent in employment. This tax incentive to an increase in employment will accelerate the growth which is already taking place, and is one of the most important features in the Finance Bill currently before this House.</P>
    <P>In the very few minutes that remain to me as a result of my intention to ensure that the Minister for Labour has an opportunity of speaking, I will outline the measures which have been taken in the out-of-school provision for youth.  Since this Government came into office the amount of aid to youth organisations in the form of grants-in-aid has been increased by 225 per cent from 1973 to 1977.  That is a very substantial real increase which far exceeds the increase which has taken place in costs which had of course affected these organisations.  This is a real increase in the resources available to youth organisations.  We have not satisfied ourselves solely with increasing the money for their general programmes. I would like&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There was an increase this year as against last year.  In addition to the general increase since 1973&mdash;a very substantial increase in aid of youth organisations&mdash;there have been a number of specific new initiatives which I would like very briefly to recite.  First of all, we have given aid to the provision, which was not made before, of holiday activity centres for young people in County Westmeath and County Kerry.  We have provided a special counselling service for young people in Dublin through the Agency of CONTACT which will assist them with the problems which face young people coming to a large city for the first time.  We are providing too, through the recently-announced Youth Encounter Projects&mdash;and these projects have initiated in Cork, Dublin and Limerick&mdash;for youth organisations to assist other young people who have school attendance and other problems which involve them in conflict with the law.  We have introduced a new training programme for the various leaders in the uniformed organisations such as the scouts and guides.  We are introducing a training programme also for full-time youth workers in the various organisations.  Furthermore, an instruction is being issued to the vocational education committees to ensure that in their adult education programmes a special place is given to training for volunteer youth leaders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another very important measure which has been adopted in the youth field has been a young achievers' programme in Macra na Tuaithe which is again substantially aided by the Department.  The emphasis in this programme is on encouraging young people to develop a spirit of initiative and entrepreneurship.  In the long run I believe that the prospects of employment for young people will be greatly enhanced by young people developing such a spirit themselves.  The educational system can provide them with the skills but they alone can take the risks and the initiative in the business field which will create jobs for themselves and for other young people.  The type of programme being developed by <Col N="717" /> Macra na Tuaithe and also by other youth organisations in this context is the type of programme we wish to encourage, with young people helping themselves.  In any endeavour that young people may make to help themselves, particularly in the employment field, I can assure them of my Department's and the Government's full support.</P>

      <P>One can only be appalled at the contribution by the Parliamentary Secretary.  He has outlined studies, schemes, programmes, circulars but no work.  That is what this motion is all about:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government's neglect of young people as exemplified by its failure to provide adequate employment opportunities for them and by its lack of concern for youth organisation and development generally.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary tends to treat this motion very lightly.  We on this side and many thousands of young people also would like to know what programme the Government have for immediate employment.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that in addition to those school-leavers who will come on the labour market after the next Leaving Certificate examination, school-leavers who have left school in the past two or three years are still in the unemployment queue?  Are those people in the unemployment queue meant to be fobbed off with studies, schemes, programmes and circulars? This Government seem to be absolutely subsumed with the idea that if you give people studies, schemes, programmes and circulars you are doing something for them.  It is very shattering to hear the Parliamentary Secretary in a cynical fashion pretending that the Government are taking care of one of the most grave social problems confronting this nation of ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about the next generation.  The future and the continuity of the nation depend on the generation coming after the present generation.  If the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="718" /> thinks for one moment that by providing the various matters he has outlined he is engaging in some achievement he should examine his record.  What young people want is hope, not based on false promises but on realisable, deliverable promises.  I concur with what Deputy Fitzgerald says, that the Parliamentary Secretary is a decent and honourable man. Nobody can gainsay that, but we are talking about the Parliamentary Secretary's contribution to this very serious motion.  If this is the best that the Government can offer, God help the future generation of this country.  Their job prospects will be poor.  It is not my intention to embarrass either the Parliamentary Secretary or any other Members of this House, but I hope the Minister for Labour will give the needed injection of hope to young people who are listening to and who read the contributions to this debate.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware of the situation in a family where there are one or two young people finishing school having sat for their leaving certificates?  These young people when looking for jobs will almost invariably find that five, six or seven hundred people are applying for the same job. That is my experience in the Dublin area and I believe Dublin is representative of the whole country.  Many young women seek careers in the nursing profession but there is a very limited number of jobs available and all the applicants cannot be catered for.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government aware of the frustration and disappointment that results in that hopeless situation.  I do not want to inject a sense of hysteria into this debate, because as Deputy Fitzgerald said, we wish to achieve a solution to the problem.  There is no point in introducing an element of panic but this problem is serious and it must be recognised as being serious.</P>
    <P>I described rising prices as a recipe for revolution among the housewives. That is a fairly adequate description of the lack of job opportunities for young people.  Young people with too much time on their hands, who look to the established institutions for guidance and leadership, are not getting that leadership.  This could turn <Col N="719" /> them against the established institutions. That is a really dangerous aspect of the lack of job opportunities. Young people are subjected to pressures all through their school years while taking examinations but now they have the added almost insurmountable problem of seeking employment. There is pressure on the family unit because of this.  A family unit may be attacked from within or without.  In the case of a widow whose husband has died recently where there is a child of school leaving age, there is considerable pressure on that person to get a job.  It would have cost the parents a considerable amount of money to put the child through school but the widow must now do the best she can for herself and the remaining younger children.  If there is no employment for the child of school leaving age, she must endeavour to find employment for that child and she must also look after the remainder of the family and there will be considerable financial pressure.  Such a situation was outlined to me no later than yesterday where this constant strain and worry are placed on young people and on families.  That person may find a job that is not suitable to his or her talents but, due to financial and other pressures, he or she must take up employment which may last for the rest of his or her life.  This in turn causes frustration and the person may work in a cul de sac type of job to the detriment of the nation and to the detriment of his or her physical and intellectual development.  That is a tragedy which is almost worse than not having any job.  When one is out of work there is an aim to get into a suitable job and there is some degree of hope but a dead-end job offers no hope.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not dealt with that problem to any great degree.  In addition to the pressures on families living in urban built-up areas trying to exist on a day-to-day basis against crushing price increases and the other challenges that arise living in modern-day society, we now have the added ingredient of young families with no job prospects. The Government have a lot on their conscience.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> The Parliamentary Secretary told us that the recession is easing off.  Since this Government came into power we have been hearing that.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce came back from America recently and amidst all the usual Government propaganda we were treated to a cacophony of the prospects of new jobs.  I am pleased the Minister came back with these jobs under his belt.  Hopefully, they are there and the opportunities which the Minister says will arise will arise. Can the Parliamentary Secretary say what type of training is being given now to equip people for those jobs? Is it a continued haphazard development plan?  Have the Government any development plan in relation to the type of education young people require to fulfil those job opportunities?</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary spoke of AnCO, an excellent organisation.  He should also bear in mind the local authorities, the IDA and the regional development bodies who are all doing excellent work and going about training young people in their own way but where is the co-ordination? Where is the cohesiveness that is required?  Clearly, the Government have no plan as far as youth employment is concerned.  They are clutching at straws and that, for the future of this nation, is not good enough.  The Department of Labour is allegedly engaged in programmes for young people while the Department of <Col N="721" /> Social Welfare pay unemployment benefit to young males; we know that unemployed young females are not catered for by the Government.</P>
      <P>I do not want to submerge youth employment with the need for job opportunities for all our people irrespective of age.  The Government have an obligation to create an economic climate which will give everybody the right to a job but they are not creating such a climate.  The Parliamentary Secretary made reference to an organisation for which we have great respect, Macra na Tuaithe.  As far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, young people who embark on a programme of self-help will receive all the financial backing and encouragement they require from us.  Macra na Tuaithe is one of the leaders in the field of self-help and encouraging young people to help themselves. Members of that organisation are not like the Labour councillor in a part of rural Ireland who said that the young people never had it so good, they had the dole.  That appears to be symptomatic of a certain element in the Government; they think young people never had it so good because they have the dole.  That was a Labour councillor's solution to youth unemployment and it seems to be the general attitude of the Government as far as young people are concerned.  The Government are more interested in propagating themselves personally at the expense of the taxpayer than in providing employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Labour spoke about the cost of the advertisement in which he propagandised himself under an employment scheme to ensure his re-election in the next general election. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach told us that that advertising programme cost £20,000.  How many young people could be employed by a proper deployment of that money?  The Minister for Labour must, as a matter of urgency and in order to prove his sincerity, introduce a youth employment programme.  Under that programme he must ensure that all the agencies I have mentioned co-ordinate their efforts and that all the information goes to one area.  The difficulty is <Col N="722" /> that these well-intentioned organisations, while appearing to be doing an excellent job, do not appear to be achieving the results they were intended to.  It is possible that I am being unfair to them because in the final analysis the buck rests with the Government.</P>
    <P>While all these programmes are good if at the end of the day there are no jobs all the programmes the Government may start and all the schemes and studies they set in motion are worthless.  In an economic recession&mdash; we are experiencing one of the worst ever to confront this country at present &mdash;the first to suffer are the young men and women, those who are attempting to contribute to the economic life of the country for the first time.  We want to give these young people hope. Fianna Fáil have outlined their policies on many occasions and suggested many schemes.  One suggestion was that the retiring age in some areas of employment be reduced on a project basis from 65 to 60.  This could be done on a voluntary basis.  The Minister for Labour should give our young people some hope.  He should give hope to the thousands of schoolgoers who are about to sit for the leaving certificate and to the thousands who sat for the leaving certificate in the last two years.</P>
    <P>According to the magazine, the <i>Young Citizen,</i> dated April, 1977, a National Manpower survey revealed that of the young people who left school in June, 1975, 9,300 did not find employment in Ireland by January, 1976.  Of that figure, 1,200 emigrated, 4,600 continued to look for work while 3,500 returned to school.  Many stay at school to improve their employment prospects but do not succeed in doing so, according to a comment in that magazine.  The most serious aspect of this is that if these people were taken into account some say the job shortage for young people would be in the region of 15,000 rather than the suggested figure of 9,000 per annum.  These are appalling figures.  While the Parliamentary Secretary came in here with programmes and schemes, he did not suggest any hope for the immediate future for young people.  If this motion did nothing else than provide <Col N="723" /> a message of hope for the future for these young people, it would certainly achieve a great deal.</P>
    <P>We hear of the brain drain of academics in other countries due to greater awards offered because of their intellectual or scientific attainments.  There is a very serious brain drain here, with the compliments of the Government. It begins when the last word is put to the examination papers by the school leavers taking their leaving certificate. In addition to the young school leavers who find themselves without the prospect of a job, there is also a brain drain where the young school leavers find themselves in jobs which are not suited to their talents.</P>
    <P>These are some of the worrying features we on this side of the House see.  Much has been made of the crime figures in the recent past and the breakdown in law and order.  It would be very easy and, indeed, very wrong to charge young people with responsibility for those figures.  I do not agree with blaming the young for everything that happens in our society.  Quite the contrary. There has been a noticeable trend in the recent past, particularly in the centre city areas, to have quite large groups of young people roaming the streets and literally accosting people and demanding money.  In the main, these young people are unemployed. They have nothing to do and nowhere to go.  Apparently they have no prospects.</P>
    <P>In a city towards the south of the country, I came on such a scene minutes after it had happened.  Young people had just accosted a friend of mine and demanded money with menaces on a bright afternoon.  That is the type of legacy lack of job opportunities may create.  Mol an óige agus tiocfaidh sí.  Praise the young and give them hope in the future, but do not give them false promises.  A young person in the sensitivity of his or her intellectual development, if let down once, will become distrustful.  We would like to get from the Minister for Labour this evening hope based on real promises, not hope based on schemes which may or may not come to fruition.  We want schemes and programmes which can be put into effect <Col N="724" /> for the betterment of the individual&mdash; that is what this discussion is all about &mdash;and for the economic betterment of the nation.</P>
    <P>During the course of this debate we have been discussing the future of this country.  If we let this opportunity go past us, if we let the future go astray on us, there is every prospect that the Government will be accused of losing a generation, and one can only say the country must look out for its future. This is the real crisis: a young person with a lack of identity, with a lack of hope, with a lack of respect for his or her family, and these lacks brought about by an indolent Government.  The message is quite clear from the contributions made in this debate.  We look to the Government for the time being to assure the young people of Ireland that not tomorrow or the next day but today they will get the opportunities which are so badly needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker was right to pitch his comments in the serious vein in which he did, because undoubtedly unemployment has been and continues to be a problem.  It is fair to say that the unemployment figures show signs of improving.  The rate of unemployment and the numbers out of work are falling.  Compared with last year, in absolute terms there are 2,500 people fewer out of work.  We can say of an economy which recorded a growth rate last year of 3½ per cent, and which this year is confidently predicted to record a growth rate in excess of 4 per cent, that the stagnancy of the recession is over and people, if not back at work, are in prospect of an early return to work.  We can point to other demonstrable indicators of an economy returning to a permanent growth path. We can look at the volume of exports in the first four months of this year and see they are up 40 per cent on the comparable period in the previous year, that year in itself recording very substantial export gains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be conceded that with unemployment figures at the level experienced here, no one can exult and say our problems of unemployment are over.  They are not.  Nor are they <Col N="725" /> over in any of the larger economies of the industrial west.  Without being excessively partisan, I want to make the point that the leaders of the leading western economic nations at a meeting in London last week-end stressed the importance of obtaining an adequate answer to the problems of the unemployed young in all their economies.  I make that point briefly because sometimes the point is made somewhat unfairly by commentators that we are alone in facing the problem of unemployment.  We are not alone, but the dimensions of unemployment faced in this country have always been extremely high by contrast with other economies with whom we trade.  If our economy is returning to a growth path, if our economy is moving out of the stagnation of 1974 and 1975, itself part of the world stagnation and recession, it could be said that to meet the full dimensions of the Irish problem of unemployment our efforts will have to be that much better than those of even stronger economies.  Our economy has never measured up adequately in its performance to the task demanded of it in the context of the size of our unemployment. I would like to quote <i>The Economist,</i> which ran a special issue on this country in April.  It is not a partisan publication but I think it fairly expresses the kind of problem we have always had in relation to unemployment in our economy, even in our best performance period.  <i>The Economist</i> of the 9th April under the heading of &ldquo;A question of Numbers&rdquo; stated:</P>
    <P>In the 1960's, when economies throughout the developed world were experiencing an unprecedented boom, Ireland's gross national product grew by an average of 4 per cent a year.  Yet, at the same time, 135,000 people, or roughly 8 per cent of the then labour force, were forced to emigrate.  They went because new employment opportunities in the Republic grew at a net rate of only 250 jobs a year.  New jobs created in the manufacturing and service industries were only just enough to absorb the continuing drift from agriculture&mdash;a trend that <Col N="726" /> began in the previous century.  The surplus population, swollen each year by school leavers, was effectively exported through emigration.</P>
    <P>That is <i>The Economist</i> of April this year talking about our economy which still, after this period of recession, understandably enough, suffers from this problem of unemployment, which we have always had with us.  If I were to say one thing to some Opposition speakers it is that I am astonished at the note of discovery which enters their remarks, but when they come to this question of unemployment one would not think that theirs was the Administration that presided over this period in the 1960's when all economies were doing well and which presided over a picture which was as dismal as that painted by <i>The Economist</i> of the employment situation over that period.  They failed to create sufficient employment for our population at that period.</P>
    <P>The question before us now, just coming out of that recession, is: &ldquo;what must be our approach to the problem now and in the future?&rdquo; I believe we can say with confidence that unemployment will drop below its present figure, that it will drop below 100,000 in the coming months.  The trend shows a continuing improvement over this year.  There will continue to be a necessity for the creation of so great a number of new jobs over the next few years that the size of the task before the economy can be described thus.  If we are to halve the present unemployment rate by the middle 1980's we will require to create each year 35,000 new jobs.  That would require roughly double the rate of growth achieved in our best years repeated year on year continuously.  We have never succeeded in doing that.  If we are serious about providing employment for our population, young, not so young and all those capable of working in the country, those are the kind of jobs we will need to create.</P>
    <P>We must, first, discard the idea that there are any easy slogans for the creation of sufficient jobs for those in our economy who are looking for them, because there are not.  We do not have time in this short debate, which <Col N="727" /> addresses itself exclusively to the present unemployment problems created for young people, to go into the requirements of the kind of planning that will be necessary in our economy over the next few years if we are to come anywhere near those necessary targets in job creation.  We can say, however, that as an Administration we have, in our management of the economy over a very difficult period, pursued a policy designed to maintain employment at its maximum in a period when it was in greatest peril from forces to a great extent outside our control.  At this point of recovery going back to a definite 4 per cent growth in the economy we have as a Government attempted to channel as much of public funds as possible into the area of job creation.</P>
    <P>I am sure other speakers on the Government side have referred to the public capital programme for this year, which represents a very large increase over that for 1976, which was historically high, in an effort to create conditions in which a maximum number of jobs would be created for those looking for them.  In our budget programme we set aside an extra £56 million for job creation.  Of that sum £36 million is to be spent under the public capital programme on such items as the construction of schools, hospitals, office buildings, training centres, harbour and telephone development, and £14 million in current expenditure is to be spent on creating additional jobs in health, teaching services, roads and so on, all areas calling out for this kind of investment.</P>
    <P>We announced, as part of that programme, the details of an employment incentive scheme, which has been receiving some attention in the House this week.  I believe that the attention it has been receiving in the House will be of assistance in publicising the advantages and the provisions of that programme.  It is important that as many employers as possible in the community should know its provisions and that as many as possible should answer our appeal to participate in the provisions of that <Col N="728" /> programme.  Our target in the employment incentive scheme is the return of 11,000 people to work, 6,000 adult workers and 5,000 under the age of 20.  It is only a start if unemployment will drop this year below the 100,000 figure.</P>
    <P>It is a move in the right direction, but there is no cause for exultation in seeing unemployment drop from its present figure of 113,000 to below 100,000 in the next few months.  It is better than the contrary tendency, seeing it increase, which we have seen during the height of the recession.  Our employment incentive scheme will mean that any person under 20 years of age, who has left full time education for at least seven months and has not yet succeeded in finding permanent employment, will from the 1st January, 1977 qualify under the scheme.  A premium of £10 per week will be paid to employers in manufacturing industries and in agriculture who employ such workers who qualify in this fashion.</P>
    <P>I should explain that for the first time we have extended this scheme to school leavers in an effort to help that category of workers.  I believe that our answer to our employment problems must be a total answer rather than one that can be described as answering the needs of particular categories of workers.  I do not deny that young people have found themselves without sufficient work in this period of recession.  They have never had sufficient work in the Ireland I have known.  During the fifties and sixties large numbers of our young people had to emigrate to Britain. However, the exodus to Britain and other places in search of work has come to an end with the result that for the first time this State is faced with a great challenge, and if that challenge has a political aspect&mdash;the sort of challenge we have dealt with successfully&mdash;there is an even more serious challenge.  I would agree with those people on the opposite side who have said that the real challenge is not to democracy as we know but relates to our ability to meet this demand for employment on the part of our people.  This is the real economic challenge to the continuation <Col N="729" /> of our democratic state.  For the first time the demand is for sufficient work at home.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are making provision for direct employment creation in the capital area of between 7,000 and 8,000 jobs.  Under the Employment Incentive Scheme, a scheme that has been the subject of much comment here in recent days but comment which I expect will at least draw attention to the scheme's features, we hope to see 11,000 people returned to work.  The amount of money set aside for the purpose of the scheme is £4.1 million.  It operates from February of this year to February of next year.  All employers, either in manufacturing or in agriculture, are eligible for participation in the scheme.  To each employer engaging an extra adult worker who is over 20 years of age the State will pay £20 per week for the duration of the scheme and, in respect of school-leavers, the figure is £10 per week. This is in addition to the 11,000 workers we hope to put back to work. In addition, provision was made in the budget, under the community youth project programme, for the return to work of 1,800 people.  This year, also, we have provided for record sums of money for AnCO, the bulk of whose trainees are under 25 years of age.  These, then, are the responses of a concerned Government, but I would join with other Deputies in admitting that for the State to answer this problem of continuing unemployment in the years ahead will require a better arrangement of our resources.  I submit that we are acting on the matter.</P>

      <P>When we realise that as we speak here there are 44,000 teenage boys and girls who, removed for the moment from what can be regarded as the normal pursuits of citizens who are young and free, are applying themselves, in a spirit of self-sacrifice, to their leaving certificate examination, we realise the seriousness of the problem we are discussing.  We realise, too, the tragedy of those young people, a tragedy which has been dismissed rather cursorily by the young Minister for Labour who says that this <Col N="730" /> problem cannot be treated in isolation, that we must talk about the totality of unemployment.  In this I would venture to differ with him and to say that this generation owes as much to the coming generation in respect of employment as we owe to the adults. Regarding the scheme referred to so often by the Minister, we have a perfect example of the contrast in what he is saying, even on the point of taking the whole matter of unemployment in its totality.  That scheme, <i>ab initio,</i> discriminates against the young person, since for those under 21 the amount payable to an employer is £10 per week or half of the amount payable in respect of an adult.</P>
      <P>Two years ago when this matter was not regarded with the same urgency as is the case now, I recall referring to what I described as the outstanding failure of this Coalition. I do not mind repeating what I said then, which was that this Government have shattered the dreams of so many of our young people.  Of the 44,000 sitting for the leaving certificate there will be the average failure rate of 10 per cent, which leaves a figure of about 40,000 young people with the leaving certificate either coming on the market for employment or going on to third-level education.  The maximum that can be absorbed in the third-level area is about 10 per cent.  In other words, there will be at least 30,000 with leaving certificates seeking employment.  I am disregarding for the moment those who will opt out at intermediate certificate or group certificate stage, but we may take it that up to 15,000 in that category will be available for employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noted that during the Minister's 15-minute contribution the only reference to these young people was a mention of young and not so young persons.  I do not wish to be personal, but I am wondering whether the Minister, by reason of his not having been subjected to the normal and traditional anxieties of parents in watching their children pursuing education which is supposed to lead to their being fitted for jobs but seeing them at the end disillusioned, frustrated and disappointed, is in a position to appreciate the problem.  In <Col N="731" /> many cases the pursuit of education is taken so seriously by the children that it can injure their health.  Yet, the Minister thinks that we should not concern ourselves with young people alone.  That is more indicative of the attitude of old people.</P>
    <P>I am grateful that the teenage members of my family have been fortunate enough to find accommodation at third level education and I am not thinking of the chance or good fortune which allowed them in this extraordinary type of examination to get the adequate number of points to entitle them to enter university.  I am thinking of the other less fortunate students who, with two or three honours in their leaving certificate, could not get into a third level institute and, even if they could, their parents could not affort the expense. These students, with a great ambition realised, with this great leaving certificate in their hands, in their pockets or on the wall&mdash;wherever they keep it&mdash;cannot get employment behind shop counters.  We have employed by Dublin Corporation a graduate emptying bins.</P>
    <P>What is it all in aid of?  As far as the Minister for Labour is concerned, it does not seem to rate in his priorities. Here, I would criticise slightly the attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education whose only contribution apparently is that he will help young people who help themselves to get employment.  What exactly does that mean?  He boasts of a scheme he has for adult youth leaders.  In heaven's name, what will these people live on while being trained as apparently adult youth leaders?  Is this the attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary?  I know he is not to be blamed for the fact that he was forced out of an area where he could have been gainfully employed whole-time and was obliged to take upon himself duties in Industry and Commerce.  I am not blaming him for that.  I blame his Taoiseach.  Whatever one may say about the Fianna Fáil Party, they saw the need for the appointment of a person whose total and absolute responsibility would be in the field of youth. I am not going to indulge now in any <Col N="732" /> criticism of the holder of that office. I will not, as I could, castigate him for the fact that as yet we have no youth policy but neither he nor the Government can deny in the matter of the importance of the office that they are treating it with only half the importance with which the previous Government treated it in so far as they ask the holder of this office to apply himself to another office in another ministry.</P>
    <P>Schemes are attractive.  I accept there is need for planning but I am motivated by the realities of what I see around me.  In anticipation of this debate, knowing the scene as I do, wondering whether or not the area in which I live has been singularly unfortunate in respect of an utter inability on the part of leaving certificate students to find employment, I made some general inquires.  I inquired from Bord Fáilte, from Bord Iascaigh Mhara, from Bord na Móna, from the ESB, from CIE and from Aer Lingus as to how they saw the scene this year and in every case they told me it would be worse than last year in the matter of employment for young people.  Aer Lingus are going to recruit 13 or 14 air hostesses.  There are 4,000 or 5,000 applicants.  CIE, contrary to their giving any hope of employing young people, have advised that the position there is they will be reducing their numbers.</P>
    <P>What is all this talk then from the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary about the new day dawning and what will happen?  What is all this talk about the provision in the Estimates? Where is the proof?  Where are the jobs that are supposed to have been created?  What hope can one hold out to the successful leaving certificate student?  I use the word &ldquo;successful&rdquo; advisedly.  I do not accept that there is any great virtue in giving to a student who has sat his leaving certificate and who did not reach the required standard&mdash;in passing, may I say I abhor the whole idea&mdash;a certificate as to his failure.  And that is what we are doing. However, that is by the way.</P>
    <P>I am concerned with the successful, with those who for 13 or more years have been travelling hopefully <Col N="733" /> towards a point at which they believe they will have a guarantee of gainful employment.  What has the Minister for Labour, and the Parliamentary Secretary and this Government&mdash;it must be admitted that whatever other failings they have they do not fail in the matter of promises&mdash;to hold out to those students?  What promises have they, what prospects, what hopes for these children?  As I said initially, the answer is &ldquo;None&rdquo;.  That is quite obvious from the attitude of the Minister for Labour.  He did not indicate one single area where a group certificate student, an intermediate certificate student or a leaving certificate student could get employment.  He reflected. He said he knew when times were as bad.  I suggest to him he is entirely wrong.  I am quite familiar with the educational scene of the 1960s and early 1970s when, if one had a leaving certificate, it automatically guaranteed employment.  Out in the vocational school in Blanchardstown students with a group certificate could select apprenticeships in the ESB, in Posts and Telegraphs and many other areas of employment.  There was an <Col N="734" /> availability of employment then.  There is no employment available now.  The pattern in the 1960s and early 1970s completely contradicts the attempt by the Minister to relate present circumstances to those which obtained in the 1960s and early 1970s.</P>
    <P>I recollect meeting the present Minister for Foreign Affairs outside this House&mdash;I was concerned too&mdash;with a group of graduates who had been successful in their H.Dip. and because there was some fear that the Minister for Education, Deputy Faulkner, could not guarantee them positions there were scenes outside this House.  Actually the Minister found employment for every one of them.  I am citing that episode to show the appalling change that has occurred.  I am not blaming the Government for creating these circumstances but I am blaming the Minister for Labour who has nothing to offer.  He should at least hold out some hope we could take from this House to the many children who are waiting for some guidance.  Apparently there is none and, equally apparently, the Minister for Labour could not care less.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter relates to a strike which took place in the Killarney Hoisery Company factory nine weeks ago.  Having given notice of the question on 21st April, I raised the matter on 27th April when I asked the Minister to say if he was aware of the prolonged strike in the firm, if he would state when he had become aware of it and the efforts he had made to settle it.  In his reply he did not say when he had become aware of the situation or the efforts he had made to bring about a settlement.</P>
      <P>To my mind and to the business and working people of south Kerry this is a very serious matter.  Indeed, it is serious for the country as a whole when there are so many people unemployed. Here we had an industry catering for approximately 800 people and it looks very bad for the Minister and his Department that nothing appears to have been done by him to settle the dispute.  The probability had been obvious for approximately six to nine months before it occurred because of the industrial relations within the firm, which were not the best.</P>
      <P>The Minister has often spoken about the Department's early warning system which he had set up.  I now ask him what exactly has become of this system?  Does it apply only to Dublin or his own constituency in Dublin, or does it exist at all.  I ask him to tell the House the type of relationship that exists between his Department and firms such as the Killarney Hoisery Company where it was known approximately nine months beforehand that a strike was imminent.  It looks to me as if the Minister could not care less about the interests of workers so remote from Dublin as Killarney is.  It appears to the people there, business and workers, that the Government and the Minister have no interest whatsoever in those living so remotely from Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has had his photograph in the newspapers during the past few <Col N="737" /> days saying he would dole out £20 per head to employers in respect of people put back to work, but here we have a situation whereby 800 people could have been retained in employment if the Minister's so-called early warning system had worked and if he had made any effort to settle the dispute.  If this had been done generally by the Minister it would have been unnecessary for him to have put his photograph in the newspapers.  He could easily have averted this strike.</P>
    <P>I wonder does he appreciate the concern of the business community and the workers in south Kerry at the closedown of this industry which was brought into the country more than ten years ago, giving tremendous employment to the people of south and east Kerry.  It is an industry which was a great boom to the town of Killarney and to the agricultural community in east Kerry.  A number of smallholders were employed in this industry and the money they took home was put into building up their small farms and small holdings.</P>
    <P>It was quite clear from the Minister's replies to my supplementary questions on this matter on 27th April that he took the whole situation rather lightly.  I excuse him because he was busy then on legislation, but it appears that he did nothing whatsoever prior to that date to avert the strike and the closure of this major industry.  It is quite obvious that he has done nothing since then to remedy the situation. The Minister may think that nobody in south Kerry has any interest in this situation, but I assure him that as long as I am an elected representative in this House I will look after the ordinary man and the workers in south Kerry and Killarney.  I am not afraid to come into this House at any time and challenge any Minister on his standing in situations like this.  It is terrible that we have had the closure of a major industry and that nothing whatsoever has been done about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>Initially I must inform the House that the Labour Court have been involved in this dispute since it started.  Before the strike commenced an attempt had been made by a conciliation officer of the Labour Court to get the basic issues in dispute resolved but that attempt failed and the strike started with the withdrawal of labour by the 800 workers from finishing time on Monday, 21st March. I emphasise that a conciliation officer of the Labour Court was actively involved in the days preceding the withdrawal of labour.</P>
      <P>The workers were seeking, we understand, satisfactory redundancy compensation terms.  There was a question of part-timers being made redundant first and there was the application of seniority in female field departments and the question of voluntary redundancy.  The Deputy surprises me in his contribution when he says that he knew that relations in this firm were bad for almost nine months before the strike commenced. It is difficult for any Department of State, especially the Department of Labour, to know the exact state of industrial relations in every individual workplace throughout the length and breadth of the land on any one day of the week.  The Deputy did ask about the position of the monitoring unit of my Department.  Nobody claims that that unit is there to be infallibly correct about potential breakdown in industrial relations in the future over every industry and every workplace in Ireland.  When I established the unit I saw it as a helpful agency in my Department assisting me in gathering information about possible difficulties that might arise over major industrial sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this dispute the Labour Court was seized of the matters at issue from the start.  They failed to avert the withdrawal of labour and it happens occasionally in problems in industrial relations that one fails despite one's best efforts.  The strike proceeded.  A <Col N="739" /> meeting arranged by the managing director of Penneys Limited took place in Dublin on 23rd April and that meeting was attended by senior officials of the union concerned and senior management of the company.  The company is a cross-channel controlled company and senior management are generally in the other country.  An agreement was reached at that meeting which was endorsed and supported by the union officials who attended the meeting.  That settlement formula was put to a meeting of the workers in Killarney on 27th April but was rejected by over 300 votes to 165.</P>
    <P>The total number of employees in this firm was 800 workers, so that 200 workers did not attend a meeting which was called to decide whether an agreement reached at a top-level meeting between union officials and the company would have their agreement.  It is a case of the abstention of workers. It is regrettable that 200 workers did not come to a meeting at which so important a matter was to be decided.</P>

      <P>When the contractor appointed in February, 1977, commenced work on the completion of this school it was found necessary to undertake a detailed investigation of part of the work carried out earlier.  The investigation is in hands and until the results are known it will not be possible to say when the building will be completed. <Col N="652" /> I am aware of the unfortunate history of this school and I can assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to secure completion with the minimum of delay.</P>
