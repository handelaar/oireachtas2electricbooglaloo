      <P>Deputy Colley asked me yesterday when it is hoped to introduce the Finance Bill.  It is expected that it will be introduced in about six weeks. Under the revised Standing Orders introduced in 1974 it is not necessary to introduce it immediately at the end of the budget.  Deputy Tunney inquired about the Údarás na Gaeltachta Bill. That will be circulated in about three weeks.</P>

      <P>When I got in yesterday immediately after Deputy Desmond made his contribution I said that it appeared quite obvious to me that he had almost as many faults to find with the Bula Bill as this side of the House have but that he had to be far more genteel and evasive in the manner in which he criticised it.  The most significant statement Deputy Desmond made during his contribution was the sanctimonious one that he fully appreciated, that when Ministers were appointed and took up office, the responsibility of ministerial power had the effect of changing many Deputies' minds.  That <Col N="602" /> summarises the approach of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to his job as Minister where he threw, as is pretty obvious in this Bill, all his socialistic ideas out the window.</P>
      <P>The person he criticised most in the course of his script and also during his four years as Minister for Industry and Commerce is his predecessor.  His admission that this Bill is a complete let down for the State is justified, as he puts it, by the mess he found there when he took up office.  I was in the enviable or unenviable position, depending on one's point of view, of being an only child.  One of the things I learned from that is that one has to learn to stand on one's own feet.  I did not ever develop the habit, which obviously the Minister for Industry and Commerce learned at some early stage, of blaming somebody else for wetting one's bed.  That is what we have from the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister brings in this Bill at the end of four years in office and proceeds to blame his predecessor. He went out of his way to indicate that he spent that four years reading up the massive file in his Department on this mining question.  I am inclined to think that that is the truth because there is no evidence that he has done anything else over the past four years. We have an urgent mergers Bill on the stocks for the past three years. This Minister could not find it possible to bring in the Monopolies and Mergers Bill which I prepared and introduced to the House.  It was a mess that needed to be cleared up and he was going to do it within a few months and bring in a better type of Monopolies and Mergers Bill, which we are still waiting for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister came into the House yesterday and admitted, as bluntly as he could, that the Bula Bill was unsatisfactory. He was full of apologies for the necessity to introduce it and in typical Pontius Pilate fashion he said it was the least harmful thing he could do to the State arising from the mess his predecessor made.  I remember him about six months after taking up office, in answering a question in the House about the motor industry, saying that he would blow <Col N="603" /> the lid off and make full disclosures of the manner in which his predecessor made a mess of the motor car assembly industry.  That has not yet happened.  In fact, he has continued to make the same mess.  The statements the Minister made early in his speech are pretty eloquent testament to the fact that he, in being given plenty of time to prepare, cannot avoid telling untruths.</P>

      <P>I accept that and I will withdraw the expression if you will confirm to me that the statement made by the Minister on 13th December, 1974, in this House and the statement made by him here yesterday can be reconciled.  In column 1924, volume 276, of the Official Report of 13th December, 1974, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>... it is estimated that some 80 per cent of the minerals in the country are state-owned and there is no problem about these.</P>
      <P>The Minister's statement yesterday was:</P>
      <P>The position overall in the country is that some 40 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>That is, half of what the Minister stated in 1974&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the mineral rights of this country are clearly State-owned and it is well accepted that the State would probably be able to establish good title to a further 25 per cent;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can you tell me, Sir, what form of words I can use to draw attention to the misinformation given to the House under either of those two headings? I do not know which of them is right. My personal recollection is that some 80 per cent of our minerals are State-owned. Here we have the Minister establishing that after four years of his incumbency in the Department of Industry and Commerce there is a divergence of 100 per cent in three years, and he goes back four years to <Col N="604" /> talk about a mess.  Where does this new figure come from?  Has it been based on some different calculation than his own figures, or is this the outcome of the investigation of the arbitrators in London to whom he referred this case?</P>
    <P>When the Government wish to cover up for incompetence and inability and their overall non-performance, the spokesman invariably chosen to go on any radio programme is Deputy Justin Keating, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He is looked upon as the one man on the Government side capable of putting a good face on incompetence.  The man for raising red herrings and for taking people's minds off the practicalities of the time is the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. At successive Labour Party conferences the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been the man to bridge the bearna baoil and to try to pull the sides together when they depart from the policies on which a number of them have been elected to Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>I am anxious that the Deputy would not stray too far from the subject matter of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject matter of the Bill is Bula and the payment of over £9 million.  The subject matter of the Minister's speech to justify that was an attack on his predecessor.  From the fact that in his speech yesterday the Minister gave a figure of 40 per cent in respect of minerals as against 80 per cent in 1974 we can judge the veracity of the rest of his statement.  I say he has made a mess of this operation and is blaming somebody else for that mess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier in his speech the Minister said that the main event which led up to the introduction of this Bill was perhaps the compulsory acquisition order made by the Government in respect of the Wright farm in 1971. He went on to say that the involvement of the State in the private minerals at Navan would never have come about if that order had not been made.  It is remarkable to hear this ultra-socialist apologising for State involvement in mining.  I think I would not be doing him an injustice if I were to say he <Col N="605" /> was associated before the last general election with a type of platform labour electioneering propaganda which alleged that the last Fianna Fáil Government, through its Minister for Industry and Commerce, had sold out our minerals to foreigners.  He is now telling us that only for the change of Government and only for the arrival of Deputy Justin Keating as Minister for Industry and Commerce this is exactly what would have happened. We have made some progress.  In Feb-ruary-March, 1973, we had sold out, and this was being highlighted in documents being circulated around this country with which members of the Labour Party were very much involved, former friends of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, still members of his party but not friends of his any longer, as far as I can see.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister told us that he got some stick about this.  While I was Minister for Industry and Commerce this new and valuable discovery was made.  University groups and others carried out a great deal of research and came up with their own conclusions as to the value of this mine.  I could never understand the basis on which they arrived at the value of the mine and I do not know the basis on which the Minister worked out his value of the property. The Minister talked a lot about upcoming and on-going things in relation to gas and oil off the south coast during the last two years and told us that this matter was on-going and that we will have it this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us yesterday that production will not commence until some time this year.  Good times are always coming as far as this Minister is concerned.  When I was alleged to have sold&mdash;not sold; in fact, to have given away&mdash;the mineral rights of this country in 1971 and 1972 there was a tremendous amount of criticism of the conservative approach of the Fianna Fáil Government.  We were told that Fianna Fáil were working hand in hand with certain individuals who were subscribing sizeable amounts to the Taca fund.  Those wild allegations were made and we were being undermined and underpinned by literature <Col N="606" /> which flooded the country.  In my view that literature was paid for by money that was poured in here in order to offset the stability of government. Sponsored organisations at university level protested against us and weekly parades invariably led to the gates of Leinster House.  Thank God the present Opposition are responsible in this regard.  We will not be associated with any efforts to undermine the capacity of this House to legislate for the country. We will conduct our opposition in a legitimate way; we will give our views about the weaknesses of the Government and their incapacity to deliver in spite of all the wonderful promises they made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry Desmond joined with the &ldquo;red herring Minister&rdquo; by blaming the Constitution for the inability of the Minister for Industry and Commerce properly to resolve this problem.  Shortly afterwards the Minister, with the co-operation of a very efficient Government information service&mdash;the only efficient part of the Government&mdash;got across another promise of more legislation that would put this thing right, something like the Mergers and Monopolies Bill. Something is always going to turn up as far as the Minister for Industry and Commerce is concerned but the only thing that turns up is increased prices. After four years the Minister has apologised to the House for the fact that because of the mess his predecessor left him in he had to pay £9½ million for a 24 per cent share of this mine.  He told us that he had now discovered that the 1940 Minerals Act did not enable him&mdash;I presume he also means me&mdash;to make the proper order.  He said something would be done about this.  That is the message that has got through to the three Dublin newspapers this morning, with the aid, of course, of the GIS.</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister not take this action before now if that is so?  The biggest thing built into the Minister's speech yesterday from that point of view was the fact that he had been studying the British legislation as it relates to a similar situation in Northern Ireland and he was thinking along those lines for us.  According to <Col N="607" /> today's newspapers this legislation will be introduced in the course of the next few months.  The Minister talked about the reactivating of Mianraí Teoranta and made this peculiar statement:</P>
    <P>If it had been in active existence and competently staffed in the early seventies it is possible that the Navan situation would never have occurred.</P>
    <P>Only for his little brother wetting the bed, again.  The Minister told us that because the existing legislation was defective a proper order of acquisition could not be made.  He told us that he obtained legal advice from three leading senior counsels on this matter. In spite of all that, and in spite of what Deputy Barry Desmond described as the constitutional difficulties, the Minister told us that the simple solution to the whole thing was the reactivating in 1970 or 1971 of Mianraí Teoranta.  Can the Minister not make up his own mind? Which of the statements I have referred to is correct?  I presume there are prospecting licences in existence at present but if another valuable orebody is discovered tomorrow will the same problem which I had to face in 1970 not arise, as did then when the present Minister said I was caught with my trousers down.  What has he done over the past four years to prevent himself being caught in this way? He said he has been studying legislation and he believes there is a formula for the proper type of legislation.  Let him bring it in and I will certainly give him full backing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond says the Minister cannot do this.  Following the Minister's speech yesterday his own backbencher who, apparently is better informed than we are because he was able to tell us something about the agreement, said that the Minister's hands are tied and that the present unfortunate, brilliant Minister for Industry and Commerce cannot do the proper thing at present because the Constitution prevents him from so doing.  The Minister in his speech made reference to a constitutional difficulty <Col N="608" /> in this regard.  He was asked&mdash;this is rather significant&mdash;by me in May, 1973, if he would not make this amended order to which reference was made yesterday and he said that he had the advice of three senior counsel against making the order following the decisions of the High and Supreme Courts.</P>
    <P>By way of supplementary question on 8th May, 1973, I asked about this following the High Court decision before the case was taken to the Supreme Court.  The Minister yesterday conveyed the impression that he inherited from me the High Court and Supreme Court decisions.  This was not so; this is another glossing over of the truth.  If a Minister who has all the facts and figures before him makes a positive statement here which is not in accordance with the facts I find it very difficult to know how to describe such statements without being unparliamentary. As reported in the Official Report at column 563 of volume 265, I asked the Minister:</P>
    <P>Might I ask the Minister would it not be wiser for him to make an amended order?</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply was:</P>
    <P>I have indicated that, on the balance of the advice available to me, I consider the direct course to be an appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>When I left office as Minister for Industry and Commerce all the information available to me&mdash;the decision as far as I recall was not to hand&mdash;was that the High Court decision would go against the Minister.  I am not a legal man but I do not know, in view of that, how the Minister could have got legal advice or how any legal men could justify advising him to appeal the case to the Supreme Court because my understanding was that it could not succeed on appeal and the obvious decision would have been to make a fresh order on the morning when the High Court decision was made against him.  Instead of that he delayed for almost another 12 months on appeal to the Supreme Court and when asked later about it he made the reply that was conveyed in his speech yesterday, that his advice was that it would not work.</P>
    <P>We are backed in this by Deputy <Col N="609" /> Desmond, the only Deputy so far to speak on the Government side.  He agrees fully that a copy of the agreement should be made available to Deputies&mdash;he did not quite go that far; I think he suggested that a small subcommittee of the House should be set up to which papers of this nature would be presented in a confidential way.  We do not look for this in a confidential way; if there is an agreement of the kind referred to so many times in the Bill, we do not accept what the Minister says regarding the confidentiality of that agreement.  Deputy Desmond said that, as a result of his protesting and demanding, a copy of the Marathon agreement was laid in the Library of the Dáil.  From the reaction of the Minister to our demands in regard to this agreement I can see that it is fruitless for us to endeavour to re-echo the appeal so successfully made by Deputy Desmond in this regard according to himself, but I feel I am justified in asking that the Minister should place in the Dáil Library copies of the senior counsels advice to him in regard to whether he should or should not make an amended order in 1973.</P>
    <P>Doctors differ and patients die, but the Minister went out of his way to say that he had the advice of three senior counsel and, apparently, all their advice was that he should not make an amended order.  That is his justification for landing us in the mess we are in now on top of his claim that it was his predecessor's, Deputy Lalor's, responsibility.  In fairness to me, I should be given an opportunity &mdash;indeed everybody should be given the opportunity&mdash;of seeing this advice which the Minister received and copies of it should be placed in the Library.  I presume that he sought advice as to whether he should appeal to the Supreme Court the High Court decision given early in 1973.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accede to my request and will put copies of the advice recommending appeal before the House.  I cannot see that any responsible senior counsel or any responsible person whatsoever, unless as a delaying tactic at the time, would have recommended that the Minister <Col N="610" /> should appeal that case to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the progress that was made due to their withdrawing the tax concessions.  This is the only thing he has to go on now as justifying the handing out of this bonus of £7.5 million to Bula Limited.  He claims that 75 per cent of this will come back in tax.</P>
    <P>During my time as Minister for Industry and Commerce we set up an inter-Departmental committee to report on the question of mining taxation. Listening to the Minister yesterday, one would think that the decisions about leasing, the terms of the leasing and all of the arrangements with regard to Tara Mines and been made and that a deal had positively been done with regard to royalties, <i>et cetera,</i> with Tara Mines.  The fact that before I left office as Minister for Industry and Commerce, I was awaiting a report from the inter-Departmental committee to which I have referred, is clear indication that all the options were open to me as Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister got this report.  He was asked on 12th July, 1973, if he would make the recommendations in this report available to the House.  It was Deputy Tunney from this side who asked to have the report made available, if you like, laid on the Table of the House.  The Minister objected to this.  Because of my understanding of the situation, I intervened and said&mdash; column 911, Volume 267 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>I can see certain reasoning behind the Minister's argument.  Would he make available to Members of the Oireachtas the straightforward recommendations made by this committee without giving details of what led up to the recommendations?</P>
    <P>The Minister replied that he would not undertake to give a definite answer at that moment.  This is understandable. I fully appreciate that a report of that nature is prepared for the Minister or Ministers concerned.  It was inter-Departmental. Finance, Industry and Commerce and others would be involved. However, the recommendations of that committee should have contributed <Col N="611" /> to the Minister's thinking and the Minister's and the Government's planning in relation to taxation of mining.</P>
    <P>I was interested yesterday to hear Deputy Desmond criticising the Constitution and saying that but for this nuisance of a Constitution that we have the Government could and would own all of the minerals in the country.  I was interested in that statement in so far as we want the Constitution changed so that this is so.  I linked that statement immediately with a statement made by the Minister on 13th December. Following his statement about 80 per cent of the minerals in the country being State owned and that there was no problem about these&mdash;which is in direct contradiction of what he said yesterday&mdash;he went on to say&mdash;column 1924, Volume 276 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>Speaking as a farmer as well as Minister for Industry and Commerce we should, I believe, be careful not to be stampeded into a situation where farmers who own the minerals under their land are subjected to any compulsory procedures which have as their object the transfer of ownership to other private interests, whether the latter be foreign or Irish controlled.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister, when replying to the debate, will make observations on the intentions outlined by Deputy Desmond in this regard and indicate what his reactions would be as a farmer as well as Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the inter-Departmental committee that had been set up and whose report I was awaiting at the time I left office early in 1973.  I draw attention to that in the context of the statement made by the Minister yesterday that the former Government, under the mining policies they had adopted, would not have been entitled to any return whatsoever out of the Bula mine.  This is based on the assumption, convenient assumption from the Minister's point of view, that we would not have been able to establish the State's <Col N="612" /> claim to the minerals in the Wright farm.  I cannot accept that assumption from the Minister any more than I can accept his categorical statement about how much minerals the State owns, whether it is 80 per cent or 40 per cent at the present time.  Legal advice is one thing.  Application of it is another thing.  If the Minister says and can prove that three reputable senior counsel gave him this advice, I will accept it.</P>
    <P>This is where I am in fundamental disagreement with the Minister.  He says that the right of the Bula people to these minerals as private minerals had been clearly established by the High Court and the Supreme Court. That is on the basis of an order which was found to be ineffective but the Minister makes it as a statement of fact.  This is where I am in profound disagreement with him.</P>
    <P>In that same speech he went on to say:</P>
    <P>The former Government endeavoured to acquire Mr. Wright's minerals compulsorily with the intention of transferring them to certain foreign mining interests presumably in return for royalties only.  These royalties would then again presumably, after the hearing of claims by the mining board, have been in effect transferred to Mr. Wright and his associates leaving the Government with nothing out of the transaction.</P>
    <P>Is this the Minister's interpretation of compensation?  Under the old Minerals Act the State could acquire, and this is what I set out to do, subject to compensation. A board, of which an official of the Department of Industry and Commerce would be chairman, had to determine the compensation.  Even if the order made in 1971 had been effective, compensation would still have to be paid.  We are projecting a potential figure out of the mines at present.  I accept that there could be a sizeable legal wrangle in relation to the amount of compensation.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that he got legal advice from the senior counsel that if the order made by the Minister was a successful order, Mr. Wright could, by way of compensation, seek <Col N="613" /> the full value of the minerals under the ground.  That is why I fully accept that the legislation, from that point of view, needs to be updated.  I disagree with the Minister on this point: I cannot understand why he sat back in the Department for four years knowing that the legislation needed to be updated but did not do anything about it apart from conveying in his speech and at his Press conference last night that &ldquo;I am going to do something about it now&rdquo;.  Let us hope it will not get the same treatment as was given to monopolies and mergers.  The Minister reminded me of the Monopolies and Mergers Bill in yesterday's speech. That legislation is to try from the State's point of view to prevent unwanted mergers.  It is obvious from his speech that his ideal way of operating the orebody at Navan would be to arrange a merger but apparently it is not working out.</P>
    <P>I know enough about this business to be annoyed when I listened to Deputy B. Desmond trying to score points by having a go at my colleague Deputy O'Malley when he accused him of being spokesman on behalf of Tara Mines.  If someone is trying to make a practical contribution to this debate this kind of remark is out of order.  The Minister stated, and it is fully accepted, that the most economic way from the State's point of view to have the Navan orebody worked is by a single unit if it can be arranged.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>Whatever may have been the motives of those who made the order, the end result was to create a terrible mess.</P>
    <P>That is the most generous part of his speech.  He is condescending.  He does not question the sincerity of the previous Minister: &ldquo;He meant well, the poor old wretch, but he left me with a terrible mess to clear up.&rdquo;  That kind of excuse is just not good enough.  May I return the compliment and ask the Minister to spell out&mdash; taking into consideration the difficulties he has outlined in connection with minerals, and instead of wasting time blaming the man who left the job four years ago&mdash;what he would <Col N="614" /> have done.  I hope he will say that he would have changed the legislation. If I suggested that today, I would be criticised for wasting time and told that the orebody could have been worked for the last four years if the Minister of the day had done something about it.</P>
    <P>When outlining the way the £9.54 million was to be paid for he said:</P>
    <P>Let me point out by the way, that this money is payable in instalments, 50 per cent within 90 days, 25 per cent within one year and the remaining 25 per cent within two years.</P>
    <P>Fifty per cent within 90 days of what? My colleague Deputy O'Malley, asked the Minister a number of questions yesterday.  In his official reply the Minister said, at 3.25 p.m., that as Bula Mines would be dealt with in the next business, all his questions were covered in his speech and there was no point in answering the questions at that time.  There was a confrontation between the Minister and the Deputy.  The Minister then gave what he felt was the correct reply but, from Deputy O'Malley's reaction, he was not too satisfied with it.  I did not take a note of the Minister's reply to these matters but it was obvious that he did not give the information sought by Deputy O'Malley.  However, as the Deputy indicated, we did not expect the Minister to be in a position to reply.</P>
    <P>I am wondering what is meant by the statement that 50 per cent of £9.54 million must be paid within 90 days. The agreement was reached in December, 1975.  Last week I, as Whip, rereived a message to the effect that the Bill must be through by February 9th but I can see nothing either in the Bill or in the Minister's Second Reading statement to indicate any deadline in regard to the payment of this amount. I trust the Minister will tell us what is the meaning of this phrase &ldquo;within 90 days&rdquo;.  It must refer to a period within 90 days of something.  That is approximately three months but it cannot mean three months from December, 1975 because such date has long since passed.  Perhaps we have a three-month <Col N="615" /> period from the date on which the agreement is to come into effect but it is unfortunate that we have not been told specifically when this money is to be paid.  In these circumstances I must assume that we have three months from the time of the Minister making his statement, that is, three months from yesterday in which to pay this 50 per cent, but that is a part of the agreement of which we have not been apprised.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to accept the Minister's criticism of me as Minister in regard to this issue.  We recall the vicious arguments put forward four years ago, principally by spokesmen for the Labour Party but generally by anybody who was in opposition to the then Government, to the effect that we had sold out the country's mineral rights. This is the type of evocative criticism we get during election campaigns.  Yet, the Minister comes in now with a Bill which does not please us and which obviously does not please him because he introduces it with the apology that it is the best he can do as a result of the mess Lalor left behind.  However, allowing for the Minister's predecessor being a bogman, might we not have expected something better than this feeble excuse from a man who is supposed to be one of the leading academics who replaced us?  The Minister went on to explain how this socalled mess arose.  It was due, he said, to ineffective legislation but he knows that the remainder of the lifetime of this Dáil will not be long enough to have enacted the amending legislation he promises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of speaking on this issue.  As the Minister has indicated, in debating this issue of the agreement with Bula we are dealing with an issue which concerns the entire politics of mining, with the politics of State participation and in particular within this country with the attitudes which have been adopted by this Government and by their predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to begin by commenting on the attitudes of the Opposition. Their attitude on this issue can be likened in some respects to their attitude <Col N="616" /> on fisheries.  As the party who neglected this issue during the EEC Treaty of Accession negotiations they now do a complete somersault and attempt to blame the Government for the bind in which we find ourselves as a result of the negotiations at that time. Their attitude is even worse in relation to mining.  There have been aspects of national policy which have been concerning many of us for a number of years.  I am referring to some cases relating to mineral resources and to our general natural resources.  Many of us on this side of the House believe that we took over from a Government whose attitudes in some areas were enlightened and sensible but whose attitude in the natural resources area was the most reactionary and ultraconservative of any administration in the world.</P>
    <P>This Government have been attacked by the Opposition in relation to our policy on oil finds but in this regard we inherited a policy of a single licence being issued to a single company off the south-west coast.  Oil is flowing in Norway and Britain as a result of Government decisions made a decade ago.  It will be seen, therefore, that the criticism of the Opposition now is a reflection on their administration in this area.  Oil would be flowing here, too, if the correct decisions had been taken a decade ago.  I am merely emphasising those two areas of oil and fisheries to illustrate the lack of philosophy and the type of reaction we suffered from during the Fianna Fáil administration.</P>
    <P>There was considerable disquiet a few years ago because of an attitude which suggested that the mineral resources underground could be developed only in terms of a policy which allowed total relief from taxation to interested parties.  Despite the succession of discoveries within the past decade there was no change in the attitude of the Government from whom we took over.  The situation was entirely different from that of the industrial development policy because when we speak about that policy in terms of export tax relief we are talking about an operation that is continuous and which can go on for a limited number <Col N="617" /> of years.  It is a form of activity which has an infinite future and, when we are talking about mining, we are talking about something finite, a wasting resource which will be exhausted at a particular time.  It was for that reason that one of the first laws enacted by this National Coalition Government was legislation introduced to tax mining profits in the interests of the general public.  It is interesting to go back to that debate and examine the attitudes and see the extraordinary vehemence with which this legislation was opposed by the Fianna Fáil Party.  Deputy Colley, the Opposition spokesman on Finance, opposed totally the policy of taxing mining profits and he drew completely unfair analogies in suggesting that by introducing that tax measure the Government would lose credibility as a Government among the international community and that would result in a drastic reduction in the level of industrial development here.  According to Deputy Colley and the Fianna Fáil Party, the international trading community could no longer trust the integrity of the Irish Government and would be chary about future industrial development here.</P>
    <P>The country was assured at that time that the Government's attitude was entirely different from its attitude in the industrial development policy area and the Government did not intend tampering with export tax reliefs.  That has proved to be the case and it is an indictment of the attitude of the Opposition three years ago who were seriously suggesting there would be a huge drop in industrial development. Despite a major recession, we managed to extend the level of investment and that makes a total nonsense of the attitude adopted by the Fianna Fáil Party at that time on that issue.  As an undeveloped country, we are dependent on investment from outside because of lack of technology, technical resources and funds of the magnitude necessary. We are dependent on foreign investment and I think that, psychologically, the problem the Opposition have had is that, having been in Government for nearly 16 years and the overseer, as it were, of investment from overseas, they are hung up on <Col N="618" /> the question of the extent to which we have to make ventures profitable to foreign interests, even to the extent that we must sell everything.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that the legislation then would limit mining activity. The fact is that Canadians expressed to me their amazement at the situation because scope exists here that exists nowhere else.  More recently Canadian officials told me that mining people in Canada, when seeking concessions from their Government, invariably quote Ireland as an alternative for mining development if they are not getting the concessions they are seeking.</P>
    <P>This Government taxed mining development. That was in no sense a radical move.  It was a sensible move from a very right-of-centre position to somewhere nearer the centre.  I upheld the necessity for that legislation.  It was against that background we are now looking at the Bula issue.  It is easy to become emotional when talking about valuations and private ownership. It is easy to pander to emotion. We see enormous sums going into the hands of a few people.  But we must look at the reality and the background of the Wright case in which private ownership was established by our courts.  Private ownership is a fact of life.  It was something with which this Government had to deal where Bula was concerned.  Fortunately, the Minister had an option, an option that did not exist in the case of Tara.  In talking about valuation we are talking about a situation where 25 per cent of equity is coming to the Government without charge.  We are also talking about the valuation of the remaining 24 per cent which will form part of the Government's equity.  The kernel here is the question of the valuation of this 24 per cent.  The Opposition's allegation is that this is a gross price and a profligate expenditure by the Government utterly detrimental to the interests of the people.</P>
    <P>I would like now to deal in some detail with this valuation issue.  The valuation arrived at by the London arbitrators, by agreement between Bula and the Minister weighed up the background the Minister described in his speech, weighed up the evidence, <Col N="619" /> the extent to which ore exists, the planning permission and the objections as to the untried nature of the mine and its workability, production costs, the market situation now and in the future.  It was on that basis that the price arrived at has been criticised. Had the Government adopted the attitude of some Opposition spokesmen and decided not to take an option in the mine now but waited until two or three years hence when work had actually started, and then proposed to take an option in the same proportions, we would be talking of a valuation infinitely greater should the mine prove successful.  It seems to me entirely realistic for the Government at this stage to decide there should be this investment in this type of activity. This is the time at which to get in.</P>
    <P>Of course there is a risk factor in Bula.  Of course, there is the possibility that this investment can turn sour.  All investments can turn sour.  Investments of a risk venture nature are such that, if successful, they lead to enormous appreciation of capital.  In this case if the mining proves successful, we are talking about an enormous increase in the valuation of Government assets. Having regard to the fact that it is so close to the Tara orebody, and the fact that apparently the ore is very near the surface, it seems to me a very reasonable valuation of the 24 per cent of which we are speaking.</P>
    <P>Before there was any development of the Tara Mines there was an enormous market value appreciation in the stock market of Tara shares at the time when those mines were untried.  If the State waited and took the prudent course suggested by Deputy O'Malley, we could have a realist valuation of the 24 per cent which could amount to £100 million It is distinctly possible having regard to the valuation of other mines which have been developed.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on some of the remarks made yesterday by Deputy O'Malley about the valuation of this 24 per cent.  It seems to me he was reading a speech prepared by the research team.  It seems to me the attitude adopted was grossly unfair to the Minister and to the <Col N="620" /> people of this country.  An attempt was made to build up the actual valuation of the 24 per cent at £9.54 million out of all proportion, to gain political advantage.  As was pointed out in the Minister's speech, the gross valuation of the 24 per cent amounting to £9.54 million is less than that when you discount the interest involved in funds.</P>

      <P>On the question of this valuation the £9.54 million is a gross figure.  As the Minister has pointed out, taking into account the fact that a considerable proportion of those funds will not be paid for some time, the realistic valuation at present of the price paid is approximately £8.4 million.  Looking at the sums Deputy O'Malley as Fianna Fáil spokesman laboured on yesterday, we find he suggested that this £8.4 million net price to the Government represents a profit to the Bula people.</P>

      <P>For Deputy Murphy's benefit, the gross price is £9.54 million which is being paid by the Government in instalments of 50 per cent within 90 days, 25 per cent in one year, and the remaining 25 per cent within two years.  If you apply a reasonable interest rate to this schedule of payments and express it in terms of current values, the sum of money payable by the State comes out at £8.37 million. I suggest a round figure of £8.4 million which I believe is reasonably accurate. This is the realistic present value of the Government investment in Bula Mines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="621" /> I want to place particular emphasis on the Fianna Fáil's spokesman's speech yesterday in which the keynote was the quantifying of this profit to suggest it represented a gross profit to the promoters of the Bula Mines of £298 million.  This is a slightly technical matter which needs to be developed to reject totally and out of hand the sums worked out by the Fianna Fáil spokesman.  For example, as Deputy O'Malley said, we are talking about 24 per cent State investment valued at £9.54 million which suggests that the 50 per cent approximately retained by Bula has a valuation of £20 million which is in total a valuation of about £30 million on the 24 per cent which they have sold along with the 21 per cent which they have retained.</P>
    <P>He attempted to quantify this by suggesting this represented a profit of £298 million in the sense that corporation profits tax would be deducted from that gross figure leaving £149 million and suggesting that the private shareholders' tax liability on the remaining £149 million at approximately 8 per cent on personal income tax at a higher rate before the recent budget left the 20 per cent for this at £30 million.  This is a total fiction and it is quite dishonest in the sense that he extended it to suggest that the £298 million when quantified throughout the land meant that each unemployed person was paying a sum of so many pounds into the pockets of the promoters.  This is a farcical type of book-keeping and it totally lacks credibility and is a reflection of an attitude which seeks to get political exposure by pandering to the emotions of people who might be gullible in this area.</P>
    <P>The Government have merely purchased the 24 per cent to which I have referred.  The Government have got 25 per cent in addition to that as part of their equity for which they are not paying anything.  In so far as the excess of 50 per cent held by the Bula shareholders is concerned suggesting that this represents a profit to them of £150 million is merely a realistic appraisal by the London board of arbitrators of what the valuation of that mine is.  The valuation of the shareholding <Col N="622" /> held by Bula, in a free enterprise economy where private ownership has been established by the courts, is an issue entirely separate from the question of the Government taking their 24 per cent for £9 million.</P>
    <P>It seems extraordinary to me that a party such as the Fianna Fáil Party with their philosohical commitment to private enterprise and to free enterprise should twist this argument and twist the State investment in the 24 per cent to build up sums about 51 per cent held by Bula and suggest that is the type of profit the company are having. In a free enterprise economy if Bula hold a shareholding in excess of 50 per cent, if there is a shareholding in private ownership established by the Supreme Court, and if an institute of arbitrators put a value on the Bula shareholding, that is the value in their judgement.  The market value of the shares might be more or might be less. It might be outstandingly more when this mine is developed.</P>
    <P>Where on earth is the point in bringin this £9 million of Government investment to 24 per cent to suggest a profit of about £300 million and to suggest that this, scattered around the people on the dole would mean so much more to them?  It is a totally dishonest sum to be rejected out of hand.  There is no shadow of doubt about it.  I hope that it will be dealt with as cursorily as it should be.  It was a completely misleading speech and seemed to me to have been prepared by people with a commercial background, which even more makes it lack credibility, because at least people with a commercial background in quantifying these types of things dealing with corporation profits tax, discount and cash load, tax liabilities, knew precisely what they were talking about.  If they did it was an entirely dishonest exercise to project this £9 million investment in the 24 per cent of Bula and suggest profits of £298 million to Bula which were costing this country a fortune.  As the Minister stated, of the price paid by the Government for the 24 per cent in Bula a proportion of that works its way back into the Exchequer in different areas of capital <Col N="623" /> taxation.  As I have said, if the Government at a later stage rather than at the risk venture stage choose to become involved and to take their 24 per cent shareholding, then the costs could be infinitely greater than they are in this instance.</P>
    <P>There was an objection to the price paid and the deal made on the basis that the money goes to the shareholders and not to the company, but if this is the attitude of the Opposition Party, who have been the champions of private enterprise and opposed totally to socialistic philosophy that seems an unusual objection.  If we are talking about the mere purchase by the Government of shares held by a company, the purpose of the Government is to get the shares in question. If we are talking about private enterprise economy, what the owners of those shares do with that money is their business and is not the business of the Government.  It seems an extraordinary attitude of Deputy O'Malley and of Fianna Fáil to object to the shareholders getting these funds since the ownership of that mine has been established in the courts of the land.</P>
    <P>Again there is an objection from Fianna Fáil that there will not be Government control of the workings of this mine in that there will be only two Government members on the board of ten.  We are not seeking State domination.  It is a private mine in which the Government have a minority equity holding of a substantial nature.  In these circumstances we do not necessarily seek Government control.  There will be a watching brief for Government in the proceedings of that board.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has ultimate control in representing the Government's interest in so far as the broader issues of mining are concerned. I am quite certain that the Minister's directors on the board of Bula will keep him advised of the position of that company and if there is any reason for national disquiet about the workings of that board then the Minister for Industry and Commerce will ultimately be in a position to take the necessary action.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> There is not much more I want to say other than to repeat my approval of general Government attitude in the mining area.  I approve of the move to tax mining profits.  It should have been done long ago.  I do not believe for one instant that the mining resources of this country will not be developed because of that policy.  The Bula shareholding, while controversial, has my approval.  It seems a reasonable bet that this Bula mine will be a success in the long-term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing that surprises me in this Bill is that there is no reference, good, bad or indifferent, to the concern of the people of Navan. The State is buying a 24 per cent share in this mine without planning permission and without knowing whether it is going to be refused or whether the case will go to the appeal board who could refuse planning permission.  What will happen if a situation like that occurs? It is quite on the cards that it will. There is quite a high feeling in Navan since it was mentioned that it was to be an open-cast mine as against the underground one across the river at Tara.  This proposed mine is quite close to the main residential area in Navan which has been built up over the last ten years.  There will be quite a large number of objections to open-cast mining in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person is buying a site for a house or a factory he always pays a deposit subject to planning permission. There is nothing in this Bill to say that planning permission would be granted. We have seen in the newspapers, denied by the Minister and the Meath county manager, that there has been some verbal agreement between the officers of Meath County Council and the appeal board, that, irrespective of what happens, planning permission will be given for this mine.  I would be surprised that a State would invest so much of what is public money in a mine when they do not know whether it can get off the ground or not.  I know that the planning permission application is only half-way through and there are quite a lot of questions still to be answered by Bula to the Meath County Council. There will be the objections of the <Col N="625" /> residents which will go to the appeal board.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out why open-cast can be of such concern to those people.  It is only two fields away from Silver Lawn and beyond that are Blackcastle and Troytown Heights. The whole place has a very large number of houses and people, and a new school and a new church are being built there.  This mine and those houses are on higher ground in the line of the prevailing wind.  If there is any dust whatsoever coming from the mine, which can be expected from open-cast, it will reach those people.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister examined the health aspect, particularly where there is lead? I gather there are quite a number of other small trace elements which can be quite dangerous to health.  Have the Government examined that aspect of it before rushing in to invest money in Bula?  It has been mentioned that it is near the surface.  I understand that it will be necessary to go down about 68 feet.  If there is that type of head overground it should be possible to reinforce it and to work underneath.  This has been done in some of the coalfields in England.  I know that a certain amount of ordinary mining will be carried out if planning permission is given but the main concern is the large hole, nearly 300 feet deep, over almost 100 acres in such close proximity to the town of Navan.</P>
    <P>Speakers opposite have mentioned the assets which the Government will acquire.  They say the Government would have to pay more if they waited for three or four years and that they are getting good value at present.  But this is a diminishing asset and one must ask if it is worth the investment.</P>
    <P>The application to divert the River Blackwater has not yet been made. This diversion is essential, although I gather they can carry on work for a couple of years without the diversion. I wonder if the Minister has taken account of the fact that the diverted river will run through an area owned by Tara Mines.  This is part of the McCormack farm which has been fully purchased by Tara Mines.  If Tara refused to allow the river to be <Col N="626" /> diverted through this land there is nothing the Minister can do.  There is nothing in this Bill to give him compulsory purchased powers.  Since the Minister is only a minority shareholder in both the Bula and Tara companies he will not be able to force this issue. Both these companies are working the same orebody and relations between them are not the best.  It is quite possible that Tara will refuse to give the necessary permission to divert the river and the Minister has no power under any of the mining Acts to ensure that the diversion will go through.</P>
    <P>The main concern in Navan is the big open-cast.  We should like to see an underground tunnel and we also want the work to go ahead fairly quickly. There will be lay-offs soon by the contractors working at the Tara mine. There will also be lay-offs in the area by Roadstone Ltd. and extra jobs are urgently needed.  There has been delay on the part of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The figure of 75 per cent of profit is impressive but it is doubtful if there will be any profit.  I should prefer to see a system of royalties in line with what the mine is worth.  This would save the State from investing large sums of money.  The royalties could be fixed at a realistic rate and it would be necessary only to keep an account of the lorries or wagons carrying the ore from the mines.  Twenty years ago there were some people thinking of prospecting in this country.  They actually looked for a Government grant to aid them in this prospecting work. We have come a long way since then but it must be remembered that the geological office said that we had no minerals in Ireland.  We were all told at school that there were no minerals here. It was understandable that anyone thinking of prospecting here would seek a State grant.  However, our former leader refused to spend any public money on digging holes.  He told them to take their chances and said that the State would take royalties on any workings.  There was no stipulation as to the amount of such royalties.  They could be adjusted to meet the needs of the time.</P>
    <P>I feel, and it is felt locally, that the two companies should join together. <Col N="627" /> Mining should continue underground straight in from the Tara field, even for the ore that is near the top.  I understand it is at 68 feet, which is not too near the top, and it would not cost too much to reinforce it so that it could be mined underground.  Even though the Government have a minority shareholding in Tara, they have been allowed to implement plans for mills that they maintain will only cater for their own mines and could not take in Bula.  At the industrial planning stage the mills should have been made large enough to take in the whole orebody if necessary.  In regard to open cast mining, the company proposed to use the roads of Meath to Drogheda&mdash;not the main road through Navan and on to Slane but the back roads.  This will be heavy on the roads.  I feel sure that Meath County Council will incorporate something in the planning permission, if it is ever given, so that Bula will have to subscribe a certain sum every year to pay for the upkeep of the roads.  The Tara mine has already had to pay for the upkeep of roads.  Has that been taken into account?  How much money will have to be provided there and how much will be provided for landscaping?  Bula have set out their own plans and drawn them to scale, but it is possible that Meath County Council will ask for substantially higher figures and for substantially higher standards to be set.</P>
    <P>This is the first time I have ever heard a Minister and other Government speakers saying that they were going into a risk business with public funds, and that it is better to get in now than in three-or four-years' time. When dealing with public funds one must be more than careful and the element of risk should be cut to a minimum.  This is the most risky business in the world.  We do not know how it will develop.  While the Government have 49 per cent of the shares they have only two members on a board of ten and they can be outvoted.  They are holding a watching brief.  They have no control if directors are not carrying on as the State would like.  Of course the Government <Col N="628" /> could come back and nationalise it but that would mean more money going into this big hole.</P>
    <P>The granting of planning permission is a long way off.  The Minister should use his good offices to try to have the two companies amalgamated and to mine everything under ground.  If they got on with the work as quickly as possible there would be a lot less trouble with the planning permission.  We would have employment right away or within a reasonable time.  With the present proposal it would take 15 months from the time planning permission was granted until the mine goes into production.  If the amalgamation of the two companies took place it would allay the very genuine fears of people who have invested in buying houses in Navan near to the mine.</P>

      <P>Deputy Staunton in his contribution continued on the same lines as the Minister.  Deputy Staunton mentioned certain sources who had more or less complimented him on the Government introducing taxation on mining, and had asked why it had not been done before.  This is all hearsay.  To try to substantiate that and make it more credible, the Deputy took a remote source, Canada. Deputy Staunton referred to the State paying £9.54 million for a 24 per cent holding but said that we were not actually paying £9.54 million, that, because of the system of paying this money, the State will pay only £8.37 million.  This is ludicrous.</P>
      <P>If we had £9.54 million from our own resources it is possible that the Minister's programme would be feasible, because they would be able to invest it.  But the hard facts are that we do not have the £9.54 million. We will have to borrow that amount at extremely high interest rates.  I do not know how anybody could have the gall to try and put that across on Deputies and on the Irish public.  I had hoped the Minister would do better than that.  It is a scandal; it is a shame.  Where has the Minister this £9.54 million?  If he has it, where did he get it and what is he paying for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Staunton tried to refute the calculations made by Deputy O'Malley, <Col N="629" /> but I should like to tell him that these calculations were prepared by a well known actuary in Dublin and the source cannot be refuted.  Deputy Staunton continued the pattern of trying to throw mud in the hope that some of it would stick.  The Minister tried to throw some mud in the hope that some of it would stick on the Opposition but he fails to realise that the mud is so clammy and tacky that it will not fly. It is sticking to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I believe we will still have a substantial credit balance.  At the very worst.  I do not think that we can lose, because even if the minerals are left unworked in the ground our participating interest will remain to bear fruit at some later date in the future.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister has a wonderful and distinguished record in regard to the development of soil in agriculture, but I should like to know what fertiliser he is going to use to get this £9.54 million to grow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should now like to talk about the exploitation of mineral resources.  The litigation involved in determining the ownership of the minerals and the ignorance displayed by the Government, and the Minister, in their efforts to try and enter the commercial jungle highlight the inadequacy of the approach of the Government to an orderly development of our resources &mdash; metal, oil and other natural resources &mdash; for the benefit of the people of Ireland.  We should look at how this is being approached.  Where <Col N="630" /> is the orderly development?  Where will come the cream which will go for our hospitals, schools and homes and to improve the quality of life for our people?</P>
      <P>Surely, it is the responsibility of the Government to have a good policy that will be flexible enough to be applied to each individual situation and to see that the maximum benefit will yield from it, taking into account the current and future needs of the economy. At all times autonomy and control must be retained by the Government on behalf of the people.  If we look at this case we find that the payment of £9.54 million for a 24 per cent shareholding in a small mining project is not the way to develop an overall resources development programme.  The matter of paying this huge amount of money is incredible.  It borders on being a complete joke and would be so were it not so serious.</P>
      <P>The first thing we must do is to establish that any minerals are the property of the Irish State and its people.  Landowners, in some circumstances, may have rights to compensation, certainly for the land. Dependent on the type of title held, they may be entitled to compensation for the unexplored and undeveloped value of the minerals.  That is the way State ownership of minerals can become equitable, whatever the circumstances. Piecemeal legislation like this will not be successful.  In our progress as a State we have developed certain knowledge in the private and public sectors but have not yet developed the expertise to explore, to produce, to refine or to market lead and zinc.  For that reason we must accept that we require to get this expertise from outside.  It is the only logical way forward for us.  The end itself should not be the natural resource; it should be the utilisation of this natural resource to improve the quality of life for all our people.</P>

      <P>In addition to expertise there are substantial capital requirements connected with discovery and development of proven ore resources or reserves.  We must <Col N="631" /> look for a working partner, for a credible working partner, and the first requirements of the acceptability of a working partner must be expertise and money.  As we debate this Bill it is not apparent that the Government have acquired a partner with either, and I should like to ask the Minister if he or the Government have acquired on behalf of the Irish people a good working partner with expertise and money.  The State in its contribution to this partnership should be there firstly as a controlling partner taking into account the Government's appreciation of economic needs both in the short term and for the future.  While maintaining this control the Government can still contribute the facility to this selected partner who is providing the expertise and capital.  Like any commercial owner with an asset or invention for which there is a demand, the Government should permit by way of licence the development of the orebody.  It should be no part of the business of an Irish Government at this time, when one considers all the capital needs that exist here for the development of all facets of our economy and for the provision from taxation and current income, to have to meet this capital.  We must have capital to develop the various needs of the community.  We cannot starve all the other sectors to tie up capital in a project like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should certainly not spend our capital on providing a windfall of tax-free profits to shareholders, whatever the circumstances and whatever the hypothetical attraction.  We should charge our partner a licence fee based on each ton produced and taking into account &mdash; this is important &mdash; the need to reward that partner adequately. This can be done by royalty on production and taxation of profits.  We can stimulate development in this way, utilising our town scarce capital and allowing considerations other than short-term ones to prevail.  We can determine the economic production rates bearing in mind the prolongation of the life of the asset.  This, in turn, will give the opportunity for the <Col N="632" /> development of refining and other down-stream usages and all the economic benefits that could be derived from this.  Instead of diminishing the asset, quickly because of the need to recover our own capital, we can create an economic multiplier with its consequent effect on jobs, development and contribution towards the broadening of the industrial base. The method the Minister hopes to use in this Bill will not bring about the proper utilisation of the benefits that can be acquired from mineral resources for the Irish State and the Irish people.  I ask the Minister to ponder deeply and take this back.  It is not workable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose this Bill.  I draw the attention of the House to Deputy O'Malley's statement of principle at the beginning of his speech yesterday when he said:</P>
      <P>I support the principle of obtaining the maximum benefit for the people of Ireland from all our natural resources whether minerals of hydrocarbons, on shore or off shore.</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister for Industry and Commerce, from what I know of him, would have the same objective.  He would want to obtain for the country the maximum benefit for the people of Ireland from all resources, including those at Bula.  We contend that this Bill incorporates proposals which are not conducive to obtaining the maximum benefit for the people of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to change the scene a little bits, to get a kind of outside view of this Bill.  I suggest that we go outside the Dáil altogether, that we go to a boardroom someplace in Ireland.  We know from the air of expectancy around the boardroom, which is easily divined from the attitude of the directors, that there is something important on.  The usual procedures at the meeting is that the directors assemble and the chairman has the agenda.  The minutes, matters arising from the minutes and correspondence will be on it, but high up on the list will be this proposal to spend for the company the sum of £9.54 million.  I think it was Dr. Johnson who said that nothing concentrates <Col N="633" /> the mind like hanging. Nothing concentrates the mind of a board of directors as much as having to risk £9.54 million.  This is a substantial sum of money no matter how big the company is.  Consequently when the proposal comes before the board of directors they will be very careful about what they do.</P>
    <P>They will come to the proposition early on in their agenda and they will devote some time to it.  No hasty decision will be made.  I shall assume that I am the one who is trying to sell this particular deal to the board of directors. I have to answer their questions and their doubts.  It is presumed that the most careful and detailed study will be made of this proposal.  What approach am I likely to adopt?  I propose to the directors that they approve now the expenditure of £9.54 million for the purchase of 24 per cent shareholding in a company called Bula Ltd. They propose to develop a mining project on land near the Blackwater river, adjacent to the town of Navan and a built-up area.</P>
    <P>I cannot give very much more information to my fellow board members other than I am going to spend £9.54 million.  I am saying that, in my opinion, we on the board, on behalf of the shareholders, whom I will not let into all my secrets, should approve my proposal.  I tell them I have had a study made of the proposal, that I have got advice and that I have had the price adjudicated by arbitrators.  I am talking as if I were selling this thing myself.  I say to them &ldquo;You must approve this for me.  I give you my personal assurance that this is all right. You may invest £9.54 million.&rdquo;  One can imagine the reaction of the directors at this stage.  If we are to accept the normal human reactions they are looking at me rather suspiciously.  Indeed they must be thinking of giving me the brush there and then.  We will assume that they are temperate men and consequently they will start asking me questions.  The first one they will ask me is where this £9.54 million is to come from.  The company are not in such a sound financial position.  On current budget it has been running a deficit for a number of years.  Directly <Col N="634" /> itself, and indirectly, it has amassed a debt of something like £1.35 billion. Local leaders have been milked dry. Many foreign markets have been tapped, some of them carrying dangerous connotations of hard currency versus soft currency.</P>
    <P>This is the situation and the board of directors know this.  Deficits of three to four years have to be catered for. Therefore they ask &ldquo;Where am I going to get the money.&rdquo;  All I can say is &ldquo;Borrow it wherever I can, at home or abroad.&rdquo;  But I have to borrow anyway, so the deficit will be growing larger.  I expect to get more questions.  They have not exactly digested that one yet about borrowing.  &ldquo;When do I pay this money?&rdquo;  I just cannot tell them. That as yet remains confidential and secret.  &ldquo;Have I to borrow at the very high rates that obtain at the moment? If so, when does the operation begin to pay off?  When does the money begin to come back in again?&rdquo;  Of course, I cannot tell them how soon it will come back if it will ever come back.  It is a mining project.</P>
    <P>There is the question of planning permission.  All of them will have got a document from An Taisce recently about problems connected with planning permission and with open cast mining as against going down underground to mine.  All my directors are listening to this.  They know these problems exist, and I have no guarantee that planning permission will be received at all.  I know, and the directors all round me know, that this can be a very tricky situation.  They know it is more than likely that if the local council grant permission there will be a fight before the new planning board, and this of course means time and the people who lend money and fix interest rates will be chalking up all the time.</P>
    <P>I am asked then by somebody about this planning application.  &ldquo;Is it comprehensive? Does it cover all aspects of the development of this Bula mine?&rdquo;  If I am honest I have to say that around Navan and in circles that know the score on this there is talk about diverting a river and that in the planning application this is not mentioned at all and this is a very serious aspect of it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="635" /> Another question I may be asked is &ldquo;Is there a production plan for the project?&rdquo;  My answer is &ldquo;Yes, the company have a production plan.  I have seen it but I cannot tell you about it.  That is part of the secret and confidential area.&rdquo;  Then they ask me &mdash; and they are not on this board or they should not be anyway if they are not hard-headed, if they do not know all the questions to ask and if they will not be satisfied until they get straight answers to the questions&mdash;&ldquo;How much will it cost to get the mine into production?&rdquo;  I have to say: &ldquo;That is a secret also.  I cannot tell you that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then there is the question &ldquo;Will the company or I, putting the project, have to subscribe share capital or give guarantees for the company to enable it to get into production?&rdquo;  I cannot say that either.  I am beginning to get red under the ears at this board meeting. I am asked &ldquo;How did I get into this mess at all if everything is secret and confidential?&rdquo;  I am asked then, which is important from the point of view of capital equipment, whether the mining will be open cast mining or underground.  The open cast, as we know &mdash; all the Members of the House got a document from An Taisce &mdash; is a very dirty game and is likely to run into serious trouble in an area at the edge of a substantial country town.  I cannot answer that.  I do not know whether it will be open cast or underground mining.  The planning authority will have something to say about that.  The local planning authority or the newly-established one will have their conditions written in, but all that is secret, confidential, and the information is not forthcoming to the board.</P>
    <P>They ask me then what we are mining, what we are going to sell.  We know that.  Hopefully, we are selling lead and zinc concentrates.  At least the board are relieved to know I have some information, but I cannot tell them how much lead we will be producing by the time we have it for sale nor how much zinc will be produced. They themselves know, as has often happened before in this country in <Col N="636" /> the development of mining, that it was profitable to put money into mines at a certain stage and then metal or ore prices dropped disastrously, and the proposition became uneconomic.  There is great fluctuation in these ores.</P>
    <P>Then they will ask me, even if they do accept the need for secrecy about my proposed share purchase, my secrecy about the provision of capital, &ldquo;Who is going to run this company and how much experience have they in this field?&rdquo;.  I am afraid I will have to say that this is their first experience of a difficult and dangerous operation. The next question will naturally be in connection with the repayment of the £9.54 million.  I cannot give an exact time for that.  They will have to ask me bluntly whether I think the mine will ever go into production on its own or will long-term sales contracts be necessary as a guarantee beforehand. There will also be questions in connection with security for this £9.54 million.</P>
    <P>There is a story told about Disraeli and Rothschild in connection with the Suez Canal.  Disraeli's messenger arrived to ask for so many million pounds while Rothschild was having breakfast.  Over his buttered toast, Rothschild nodded and said &ldquo;Yes, that is all right, but what is the security of the British Government?&rdquo;. I do not know whether such a dramatic event is possible here, but the £9.54 million obviously belongs to the people.  They may very well continue to ask me questions, because it is a serious undertaking to invest such a large sum of money.  I cannot say when, if ever, we will get the money back.  Interest will have to be paid on it from the date of borrowing, irrespective of when work starts on the mine.  Again, that seems to be a secret.  I am being grilled at this meeting as it is an important matter for all concerned.  The meeting goes on for a long time and the chairman summarises the problem &mdash; that £9.54 million is required for the project and that it will have to be borrowed.  I do not know when we will be able to repay it.  I do not know what the <Col N="637" /> running yield will be on it.  The eventual value is in doubt.  There are too many variables for me to be able to give a hard answer.  I must also report that the directors are not experienced in this particular field.  I must include in my summary of the discussion that I do not know when mining will start or how long it will last.  At this stage I am defeated and the only attitude I can adopt is &ldquo;Whether you like it or not I am investing £9.54 million.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have been in control of this company for a few years and have lost money each year.  On 30th June, 1976, the public sector debt was twice what it was 18 months previously. Many of our trading operations have closed.  Prices have risen for goods and services.  All prices were increased to make money available for the unfortunate people who have lost their jobs in the closure over which we have presided.  I say we have the strength and the votes.  This must go through even if there is a grey area and a range of questions have not been answered and are regarded as secret or confidential.  The vote will be called for and people will troop in and support it.  They will spend the £9.54 million.  They must vote for it if they are to hold onto their jobs on the board of directors.  Businesswise, the situation is ridiculous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill, which is an important one for the mining industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sympathise with the Opposition who are trying to make a case against it.  So far, some of the speakers have made no case.  One can only come to the conclusion that they are trying to whitewash their past ineptitude and record in the mining industry.  When they had the reins they gave the nation's wealth away.  They were not concerned.  The late Gerard Sweetman gave a four-year tax concession which was good at that time because there was little doing in the mining area.  Without very much demand from the mining industry that tax-free concession was raised to 20 years.  Most people realise that there <Col N="638" /> is very little left in any mine after 20 years expect large mounds of earth.  A few jobs and little else would have accrued to the people in 20 years.  There was absolutely no planning and very little thought was given to the matter.  It was a lazy man's attitude in the hope that something might happen at the end of the road.</P>
    <P>It took this Government to change the tax concessions within the mining industry.  When the Government were restructuring the tax concessions we had puerile protests led by a former Minister who tried to say that the jobs of mine workers were at stake. The people who own the mines knew their stake was sound and that they had a duty to pay tax.  The important point is that the State is buying shares in the mining industry.  As well as getting taxes, the nation will benefit from being a shareholder in this great venture.  We are talking about £9½ million.  We will buy into 24 per cent of the Bula Mining Company and we shall get a 25 per cent stake in the company free.  As a result of that stake in the company we shall also get a 25 per cent stake in the Tara Mining Company.  So, for £9.5 million we are going to buy into one-third of the whole Navan ore industry.  Four billion pounds would be the estimate of the gross mineral value and as a result our stake will be one and one-third billion for our investment of £9.5 million.</P>
    <P>If there is anything to be said about this debate it is that Fianna Fáil are consistent in their attitude to mining. They are completely disinterested in it if they can come here and talk about this being a bad deal.  The arguments they put up were puerile and one is amazed that they persist in this debate because the longer it goes on in my view the more they are being shown up as an incompetent Opposition.</P>
    <P>They talk about secretary but there is nothing secret about this when it is being debated openly in the House. The terms of the deal are more than generous.  We have not had any alternative proposal from the Opposition as to what should be done except, I suppose, to adopt the attitude adopted in the past and let the multinationals have <Col N="639" /> a free for all, take all they can and leave us with nothing.</P>
    <P>We want to get this industry going as quickly as possible and that is why it is important that this Bill should be finalised and that the Bula operation can get under way.  There are jobs at stake as well as a vast income for the State.  Although there is an investment of £9.5 million there is a clawback by way of tax, wealth tax, capital gains tax and acquisitions tax, which will take back portion of that sum.  The Opposition bitterly opposed these taxes when they were going through this House.  Again, this shows the Opposition approach to the Bill: their spokesman said this £9.5 million was free of tax but it is not so.  Obviously, the Revenue Commissioners will examine the case in the light of the tax mechanisms and will take their share.  It is pathetic to find the chief spokesman on Industry and Commerce for the Opposition saying that no tax will be taken; obviously, he did not do his homework.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember the part the State can and will play in the development of natural resources.  Possibly the ideal would be for the State to undertake the development itself.  I think there was legislation enacted in 1940 and in 1942 to set up this type of operation but while it is all very well to pass an Act one must have the expertise and the capital in order to develop.  As it is being done, the expertise and the capital had to come into the country to open up the mining industry without any real cost to the State.  When companies spend millions boring holes for oil and find none it does not cost the State anything and when they bore for minerals and get nothing it costs the State nothing.  But when the wealth of these mines has been evaluated and the State then comes in, in a very prudent way, and for a very small sum of money buys into one-third of the total mining industry in the Navan area for £9.5 million, I cannot understand how that can be described as a bad deal.  I find the negative approach of the Opposition hard to understand.  We know they are bad but it is pathetic to find they are that bad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> Deputy Wilson's speech indicated his lack of conviction in this opposition because, by and large, he said nothing in the 15 or 20 minutes for which he spoke.  I suppose for the sake of opposition he had to make as good a case as he could in the circumstances when he knew in his heart that there was no case to be made.  This Bill highlights the ineptitude of the past performance of the Fianna Fáil Party and the role they are now playing in the House is purely an attempt to whitewash their own past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said that before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>And I am saying it again and if I have to say it again I shall say it.  Fianna Fáil will be continually reminded of their past sins in this area when they took no action. Had they been in Government today, the situation would be that these mining companies would still have their 20 years tax-free holiday.  We should examine the facts very carefully.  It is always better if one can get something for nothing.  If that is the argument, that is fine.  This figure was set by reputable arbitrators.  The Government did as any Government should do if they respect the competence of the arbitrators. They accepted the costings. When the overall figures are examined, what we are getting and what our equity will be in the mining industry, there is no argument whatsoever.</P>
      <P>There was such opposition being mounted against this Bill that I thought there must be something in it that was not coming out.  The Opposition have had their number of hours speaking against the Bill and they have said nothing to convince anybody.  This is an excellent deal.  It will give the State a real income direct from mining and a clawback from taxes.  The net gain to the State, having regard to the amount of money the State is investing, is tremendous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we should be discussing and pushing now is not this particular deal but the further development of the industry as quickly as possible and the setting up of a smelter.  It is important that as much as possible of the wealth from the mining industry should be <Col N="641" /> retained within the country.  One way of doing that is to get a smelter established as quickly as possible.  It is important that a decision should be taken as quickly as possible on the siting of a smelter.  Otherwise, various groups will set themselves up in opposition to a smelter on all sorts of grounds.  Most of us realise that a smelter industry would be a dirty industry but we are a developing nation and must look at development as a whole.  If there is prolonged delay in making these decisions, pressure groups will develop as in the case of the oil refinery, which was eventually turned down, possibly on good planning grounds &mdash; I am not going to dispute the reasons&mdash;but there was a tremendous lobby group against it.  If we delay too long in getting people interested in a smelter, there will be this type of agitation, which in my view would not be warranted.</P>
    <P>Great play has been made with regard to the investment of the money without planning approval being obtained for the Bula Mine.  In any planning authority or board the national interest would be taken into account.  The wealth that can accrue from the mine and the job potential must be taken into account in any planning decision.  There would have to be compelling reasons for refusing permission.  I have no doubt that permission would be granted and if it is granted for open cast mining, that will considerably reduce mining costs, making the ore from this particular mine reasonably cheap.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disputing that.  This is an area that will have to be gone into.  It happens elsewhere.  I do not think that by burying our talents in the ground and leaving them there we can increase the gross national product.  In order to progress we have to make certain sacrifices.  I believe that in the national interest this will be done.  Using modern technology a lot of pollution and dust can be curtailed. This should be remembered.  We can learn from other areas.  I say this also in regard to a smelter.  If we have a <Col N="642" /> smelter we can build up a very big metallurgical business which can contribute to exports and from which there can be a tremendous spin-off in the manufacturing side.</P>

      <P>Let us talk about what Deputy O'Malley said or did not say yesterday.  The case he made, or the case he did not make, was rather pathetic.  While his delivery may have been good and his phraseology and legal expertise may have helped him out, what he had to say did not reveal anything new as regards the mining industry or how it might be improved. He was critical of the deal, critical of the fact that all the facts were not made known to him.  He stated that there would be no tax clawback on the £9.54 million as, of course, there will be and as he should have been aware.  The Deputy did not suggest any alternative or say what he would have done if he had been in Government. His record in the past and the fact that he did not suggest any real alternative would indicate that the <i>status quo</i> would have been maintained.  As Opposition spokesman for Industry and Commerce, he did not throw any new light on the mining industry or indicate the mining policy Fianna Fáil would have evolved if they were on this side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the steps he proposes to take to ensure continuity of employment in industries manufacturing concrete products in Border counties following the increase in cement prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the problems which imports from Northern Ireland are creating for the concrete product manufacturers in the Border counties.  The differential between the price of cement in Northern Ireland and that applying here is an important factor in the matter but my understanding is that the price of the Northern Ireland manufactured cement is expected to increase during the coming months with a consequent narrowing of the differential.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, Ireland's freedom to take steps to restrict imports is limited by our international commitments including in particular our membership of the European Communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister know that the increase expected in Northern Ireland will be very small in comparison with the increase here? Would he agree that should the nominal increase expected take place, it would still leave our manufacturers in a non-competitive position?  He will agree that his Department and others have received submissions from those manufacturers over the past few months pointing out the difficulties they encounter in regard to VAT and relaxed restrictions at border posts.  If he does not do something for these manufacturers, there will be wholesale unemployment which will have a large spin-off in quarries and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The root cause of the difference in price is the difference between the price of cement charged by APC in the United Kingdom and Cement Limited in the Republic. <Col N="644" /> APC have two plants in Northern Ireland, one oil fired and the other coal fired.  They have a policy of averaging their price throughout the United Kingdom and have a very advantageous contract with the United Kingdom National Coal Board.  There may be an element of subsidy in their Northern Ireland price because of their large volume in the United Kingdom and because of their policy of equalising the price throughout the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>The situation is as follows: the contracts with the national coal board are being currently renegotiated by APC.  That will result in a considerable increase in their costs.  The indications are that the resulting increase in price in Northern Ireland cement will be phased over a period rather than happening at once.  It is true that APC are currently seeking a 3½ per cent price increase, which is very small, but that is not the end of the story.  Press reports indicate that further increases will be sought during the spring and later and these should help to narrow, though probably not fully remove, the price differential for cement.  This is a serious situation and one I would be happy to take any steps within my legal powers to deal with.  There have been representations about this, but it is also fair to say that this is a situation where the inbuilt advantages of Northern Ireland cement products producers are expected to diminish quite substantially during the course of this year, though not at one stroke.</P>

      <P>I share discomfort perhaps more acutely than other people, because it is necessary for me under legislation &mdash; and I have not sought to evade it &mdash; to be the person whose name is associated with this. They hurt me, therefore, in the same way as they hurt the Irish construction industry.  The prices are carefully examined by the National Prices Commission which contain representatives both of the consumer interests, from the <Col N="645" /> manufacturer's point of view, and domestic consumers and trade unions and they are thoroughly processed.  In the vast majority of cases I have had investigated, I have very rarely been able to fault the professionalism, justice and fairness of their recommendations. Indeed, the people making the recommendations have no pleasure in them either but we cannot enter a circumstance where we forbid firms to earn profits and to recapitalise.  While I have acute discomfort and no pleasure in being the statutory sanction for these increases, I am satisfied that in the vast majority of cases they are justified.  Where they are not, I reexamine them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the official statistics show a fall of 1,200 in employment in the clothing and footwear sectors between September, 1975 and September, 1976.  This reduction, is, of course, a matter for serious concern, but, I am glad to <Col N="646" /> note that employment in the footwear industry seems to have stabilised.  The statistics indicate also that employment in the combined textiles, clothing and footwear sectors increased marginally in 1976.</P>
      <P>I have given details in reply to similar questions over the past two years, of the protective measures taken against imports of clothing and footwear with the agreement, or under the aegis, of the EEC Commission.  I might add that the Multifibres Arrangement, which governs trade in textiles, is now under renegotiation, and we, in conjunction with certain other member states of the Community, are pressing for increased safeguards against low cost imports.</P>
      <P>Firms in these and other sectors of manufacturing industry have benefited and continue to benefit from the wide ranging and valuable facilities being made available by the Industrial Development Authority and the other State agencies.</P>
      <P>The promotion of rationalisation and development in the clothing and footwear industries is at present being pursued by these industries in conjunction with my Department and the State agencies concerned.  I have to stress in this respect that the State's efforts to safeguard existing industry depend for their success on an adequate response from the industries themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will make a statement on the proposed increase in the price of fertilisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A system of price monitoring and surveillance for fertilisers was introduced from January, 1974, on the recommendation of the National Prices Commission and was endorsed, with modifications, by the Fertiliser Prices Advisory Body in their report of July, 1976.  This system requires, <i>inter alia,</i> that the three manufacturers, Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta, Goulding Chemicals Limited and Albatros Fertilisers Limited, should give me 21 days' notice of price increases arising from internal costs, other than raw materials costs.  No advance notification is required in the case of price increases arising from raw material costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with these arrangements, NET notified me on 1st November, 1976, of proposed price increases averaging 13.8 per cent.  I understand that NET have so far implemented this increase only to the extent of an increase of £10.27 per metric tonne on calcium ammonium nitrate 27½ per cent.  On 3rd December, 1976, Goulding Chemicals Limited <Col N="648" /> notified me of proposed price increases averaging 8.1 per cent and on 6th December, 1976, Albatros Fertilisers Limited notified me of proposed price increases averaging 7.08 per cent. These increases have since been implemented. The price increases were necessary to compensate the firms for increased costs under the headings of materials, wages and overheads.</P>
    <P>I should mention that during the months of September and October, 1976, there were temporary reductions, averaging about 4 per cent, in the prices of fertilisers by the three firms mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary agree that increasing the price of fertilisers at this time of year directly hits the small farmers since most of the large farmers can purchase their requirements at discounts early in the year? It seems strange that in December last we should have had an Estimate where there was a saving of £800,000 due to the fall off in the use of fertilisers and now we have farmers paying £30 a ton extra for a popular brand.  Is that not a ridiculous situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that an increase at this stage does pose problems for farmers.  It is very desirable that land should be fertilised and that fertility should be maintained in both the long and the short term.  I think we can be reasonably satisfied that any increases are only those absolutely necessary.  As a result of the fall off in the use of fertilisers there is, as the Deputy is aware, very keen competition and I believe that competition will result in increases being kept to an absolute minimum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the information that was available to him as to the stock of fertiliser and coal in the premises of wholesalers at the time of the recent price increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no evidence to indicate that there were excessive stocks of fertilisers in the premises of wholesalers at the time of the recent <Col N="649" /> price increase nor have any complaints been received in my Department about stocks held by traders at that time.  I am informed that only minimal stocks of home produced fertilisers are at any time held by wholesalers.</P>
      <P>With regard to coal, particulars of stocks held by all importers were obtained before the recent price increases were approved.  With one exception, the stocks held by importers were minimal.  In the case of the importer who held a significant stock, a price increase will not be implemented until the stock is exhausted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary recall that on the last occasion on which an increase was granted it was brought to the notice of the Minister that there were substantial stocks on hand and the Minister promised these stocks would be monitored?  What was the outcome of that?  What action was taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely what I have just told the Deputy.  There was an inquiry by the Prices Advisory Body into coal prices in June and the result of that inquiry was published in September, 1975.  One of the recommendations, probably the most important one, was that the level of stocks should be monitored prior to any price increase being granted. That was done on this occasion and the evidence indicated there were not significant stocks on hand except in one case and, in that case, the increase is not being allowed until those stocks are exhausted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>What would the Parliamentary Secretary regard as substantial stocks?  In trading one has to have fairly extensive stocks of any commodity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, stocks were very low indeed.  I think there is some evidence that one particular distributor had bought coal at the new price and, because the increase had not been sanctioned, for a short time he was selling at the old price.  Investigations are sufficiently detailed to ensure that no significant stocks were in existence and no exorbitant profits were therefore made.</P>

The policy of employing lay enumerators is still the policy. If there are areas in which there are no suitable persons available then the statistics are collected by the gardaí.

In August, 1976, eight additional gardaí were detailed for traffic duty in Dublin.  The number of gardaí now allocated to the traffic corps in Dublin stands at 70 and they have available a fleet of 19 motorcycles, six patrol cars and two towing vehicles. The Commissioner expects that the effectiveness of the traffic unit will be increased as a result of measures of redeployment which are being implemented and it is also anticipated that the traffic warden service will shortly be <Col N="652" /> in a position to give further assistance to the Garda in respect of clearways and otherwise.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying that and that will be normal practice with regard to the consultancy report in both the public and private sectors.  There are a number of considerations why confidentiality has to be maintained.  For example, the report might contain references to individual posts or individual persons and it might be invidious to publish these in the overall scheme of the report.  When the consultants are assessing the facts for their report they obtain information in confidence and unless there was such an assurance to the degree of co-operation necessary a complete full study might not be forthcoming.  Of course there is a particular reason with regard to Garda matters in that the report necessarily has details of the strength of stations, manning and so on, and there would be certain implications which it would be undesirable to publish.</P>

      <P>I understand the necessary confidentiality that the report must have and I appreciate that when the consultants were doing their work they got confidential information, but I want to know who is going to study and assess the report which is going to form the basis for the reorganisation of the Garda force for the years ahead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a steering committee representing the public service and the force.  They will be the people to whom the draft report will go in the first instance and it is in <Col N="654" /> consultation with them that the final report will be prepared and it will be submitted to me and from my assessment the ultimate decision to implement will be mine.  In its implementation I will have the fullest discussion with the persons who are going to be directly involved, the members of the Garda and the Garda Representative Body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister if he would not consider it reasonable to make the report available to representatives of the Garda Representative Body?  Surely the Minister will trust their capacity regarding confidentiality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of not trusting them.  I do trust them completely in this matter.  For the reason I have already indicated the report was prepared on the basis of confidentiality and on the basis of all such reports, that is that they are management consultantcy reports for submission to management in either the public or private sector, and it is standard practice that such reports are not made available to the people on the staff side.</P>

      <P>I wonder if the Minister is aware of the opinions held by members of the Garda Síochána that not enough consultation took place at the lower level with the ordinary guards when this report was being compiled and that there is a certain amount of unrest and they believe now that they are going to be kept from seeing this document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware. The information I have is that the consultants in compiling the report had the fullest consultations and that there was no inhibition put on them by reason of the terms of the reference which were drawn in very wide terms and enabled them to go anywhere and see anybody they pleased in the Garda Síochána.  Consequently they would exercise their professional judgement in carrying out their brief. They would have gone wherever they felt it necessary to go and consult with whomever they felt necessary.</P>

This view may be held and they are quite entitled to put it forward in their editorial.  The information I have is that because of the terms of the reference, which were wide, it was a matter for the consultants to decide how to carry out their terms of reference and they made whatever consultations they felt were necessary to compile their report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be, but even among gardaí who had the leaving certificate it would have been necessary to hold the examination in order to establish an order of merit.  In addition to that we had to consider those applicants who did not have the leaving certificate and it would be unjust to deprive them without adequate notice of the opportunity of competing for entrance to the Garda Síochána.  Many of them have not done the leaving certificate through no fault of their own. Many of them might have very good intermediate certificates.  It would have been unfair to have excluded them. That consideration plus the need to establish an order of merit coerced me into the decision that a competitive examination was the only fair way to deal with the problem.</P>

      <P>May I say that I do not accept necessarily that the people with leaving certificates will have a head start over other applicants?  I think I made it clear that you can have excellent people with very high IQs who for some good reason were not able to do the leaving certificate. Also, nowadays a person can have the leaving certificate with just one subject whereas four years ago there had to be a certain minimum number of <Col N="657" /> subjects, so possession of the leaving certificate is not necessarily a mark of academic excellence.  There is of course an interview procedure as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Keaveney Mr. Keaveney  Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Keaveney</b> asked the Minister for Justice if he has carried out any in-depth inquiry into the alleged ill-treatment of prisoners in this country's jails, particularly Portlaoise; and, if not, if he will do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the allegations referred to are without justification.  With the premission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report a memorandum in regard to conditions in Portlaoise Prison.</P>
      <P>Following is the memorandum:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Conditions in Portlaoise Prison.</P>
      <P>1.  Allegations are being made publicly by individuals and groups about conditions in Portlaoise prison. In particular Provisional Sinn Féin, through their newspapers and by means of posters, are attempting to convince the public that the regime in the prison is unbearably and unnecessarily harsh and that this represents the deliberate policy of the Minister for Justice or of the governor of the prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  The allegations are manifold, but particular reference is made to the strip-searching of prisoners, to the controls on visits and letters, to the prohibition on what is called free association between prisoners and to the frequency and severity of punishments for breaches of prison discipline including, in particular, the denial to some persons while under punishment of freedom to associate with the other prisoners.  The matters complained of <Col N="659" /> vary from time to time.  One of the more surprising complaints is that no oratory or chapel is available for private meditation.</P>
    <P>3.  The prisoner population in Portlaoise at present (and for some time) numbers about 150 men, a significant proportion of them having been convicted of very serious crimes.  While they are split ideologically into several groups they are a cohesive set of determined criminals such as no prison system in Europe outside this island has to deal with.</P>
    <P>4.  While it can be said of most prisoners they will escape if they can, the prisoners in Portlaoise are prepared to go to great lengths to do so, particularly so it would appear on occasions when they or their associates outside the prison want one or more prisoners at large for some special purpose.  This is a direct and continuing challenge to the State and the sort that must continue to be met. The special restrictions in Portlaoise are made necessary by that challenge. The cost in money terms of maintaining the prison and those restrictions is high.  Resources that could be usefully employed on such things as an expanded welfare service and the replacement of some of our older institutions have to be diverted to the containment of those prisoners.</P>
    <P>5.  As mentioned above, the prisoners are a close-knit highly organised group (or, more accurately, one large and several smaller groups).  Any request (sometimes made in the form of a demand) for a change in the regime or for concession has to be considered in the knowledge that, more often than not, it is obviously part of a general strategy to weaken the security of the prison.</P>
    <P>6.  Experience, which includes experience of successful and unsuccessful attempts at violent escape, of riots, of unprovoked attacks on individual prison officers and Garda and of the smuggling of explosives and other materials and messages has dictated the nature of the special restrictions and controls which distinguish Portlaoise from other prisons.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" /> 7.  In recent years the privilege of free association was grossly abused in that, for example, it facilitated the concealment of material in cells and the elaboration of plans for escapes and the like, and that moreover it was imposing such a severe and costly strain on staff that the situation could not be allowed to continue. Supervision of the prisoners during the time had to be increased and can fairly be described as close. In fine weather half of them are allowed outdoor exercise at any one time between 10.30 a.m. and noon and between 2.30 p.m. and 4.00 p.m.  Those not on outdoor exercise have the option of remaining in special recreation rooms or, at their individual choice, locked in their own cells.  They have also the option of working in the craft shop but, as is explained below, in practice they deny themselves this option by refusing to be strip-searched when leaving the shop&mdash;an essential precaution after work with craft materials and tools. Having regard to the constraints on space imposed by the need to keep the various groups of prisoners separated as far as possible to prevent violence between them and also imposed by the size of the prison itself, the recreational facilities are as good as can be provided consistent with the maintenance of the necessary level of security.</P>
    <P>8.  Strip-searching of prisoners has been played-up emotively and is, of course, a distasteful procedure though how distasteful it is depends on whether the prisoner behaves reasonably. It is necessary to prevent the smuggling of contraband&mdash;including explosives.  The allegation has been made that prisoners have been strip-searched repeatedly and, by implication, capriciously.  This is untrue. Occasionally it may happen that a particular prisoner may be required to undergo two or even three strip searches in a short space of time but that would be because of special circumstances and would be quite fortuitous.</P>
    <P>9.  Visitors to Portlaoise have to undergo a brief rub-down search and <Col N="661" /> they are permitted to speak to the prisoners only through a metal grille. This latter precaution was shown to be necessary when a woman visitor was found to have passed explosives to a prisoner which she had brought into the prison concealed in her vagina.</P>
    <P>10.  Visitors tend to come on Saturdays and the chaotic situation in the visiting room when several visits were going on simultaneously was a serious security risk since it was impossible to be sure that messages in relation to escape attempts (timing being all important in this respect) were not passing.  Moreover the identity of the visitors was often unknown to the prison staff.  The number of visitors allowed on any one day is now limited and proof of identity is required.  The prisoners have so far refused to co-operate in operating a system whereby intending visitors would be allocated a definite day and time for the visit thus avoiding possible disappointment to them.  Such a system has been offered to them.</P>
    <P>11.  Allegations that prisoners were denied letters at Christmas are quite untrue.  During the month of December, 1976, prisoners in Portlaoise prison received a total of 1,138 letters and 1,402 Christmas cards.  In general prisoners may write two letters per week and receive all incoming mail. All mail is censored and certain material is blanked out&mdash;for example reference to prison matters.  Incoming letters are not allowed unless they have been signed fully and have the full address of the writer.  Letters are not allowed from persons who are not allowed visits.</P>
    <P>12.  The complaint made on behalf of the prisoners that is being played-up most of all at present is that discipline is harsh and they are, in effect, being driven into the ground.  What is particularly significant and reprehensible is that attempts are made to pin responsibility for the alleged harshness on the prison staff.  The Minister for Justice wants it to be understood that he is completely satisfied that the governor and staff are acting reasonably and to his explicit instructions and that the level of discipline in the <Col N="662" /> prison is what must be imposed because it is necessary.  Staff in the prison have been subjected to assaults, threats and abuse and, in general, the prisoners try to make the running of the prison as difficult as possible.  Breaches of discipline are dealt with firmly, but not inhumanely or otherwise than in accordance with the prison rules.  The rules provide that prisoners under punishment may be segregated from the others for a period not exceeding three months&mdash;but such punishment is imposed only for very serious breaches of discipline.  During this period they must take outdoor exercise each day on their own and remain in their cells for the rest of the time.  No dietary punishment is imposed on them and their meals are brought to their cells. They are supplied with slippers rather than shoes in such circumstances because experience has shown that it is necessary to remove the shoes of prisoners in segregation: they have literally kicked out the doors on occasion.</P>
    <P>13.  Suggestions that the prisoners in Portlaoise are at the mercy of vindictive and inhumane staff are false and at times malicious.  The efforts that have been made to discredit the visiting committee of local citizens are vicious in the extreme.  The reality is that they discharge their duties in a most conscientious manner and deal fully and carefully with any complaints made to them by the prisoners. Furthermore the governor and his staff are at all times willing to meet the prisoners in any way where legitimate and reasonable requests are made.</P>

      <P>The Deputies can be assured of my goodwill towards the use of Irish by all officers of my Department including, of course, those who serve in Gaeltacht areas.  The Department actively co-operate with Gaeleagras na Seirbhíse Poiblí by facilitating and encouraging participation by officers in the activities of that body which include courses in Irish and social activities through the medium of Irish.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that court offices and Garda stations in Gaeltacht areas and elsewhere are supplied with such copies of Acts of the Oireachtas as are required for their work.  The bound volumes of the Acts, which of course contain both the Irish and English versions, are supplied to all court officers, primarily for the use of the Judiciary.</P>
      <P>The conduct of court business is in every case a matter solely for the presiding judge or justice and accordingly it is not open to me to comment on the status given to Irish in the conduct of court proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>An bhfuil an tAire ag rá gur mar seo atá an scéal?  Is the Minister saying that what happens in court in a Gaeltacht area in relation to language and general procedure in court is a matter for a district justice involved?  I understood that the question that what happened in relation to the use of language in a court depended on the individuals involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  If an individual wants to have his case heard through Irish it is his right.  It is a matter for the court as to how the <Col N="664" /> arrangements are made for the hearing of it in that language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, a citizen has the right to have his case heard in Irish if he so wishes.  How much of the case is conducted in Irish will then be a matter for the district justice in so far as interpretation is concerned.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 23 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with long-established policy, fishery protection is one of the peacetime tasks assigned to my Department.  Essentially, fishery protection is afforded at present by LE <i>Deirdre</i> and three minesweepers. The training vessel LE <i>Setanta</i> has also a fishery protection capability.  No foreign vessels are assisting in the patrols.  As indicated by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech on the 26th January, 1977, an extra £1.2 million is being allocated for fishery protection this year in anticipation of a substantial supplement from EEC funds.  This will be used for a downpayment on a third all-weather fishery protection vessel and for the provision of other patrolling resources. It is Government policy to increase the State's fishery protection and patrolling capability as an on-going matter.</P>

      <P>The present strength of the Naval Service in relation to fishery protection duties is four vessels.  There are three coastal minesweepers. One was delivered late in 1970 and two early in 1971.  One specially designed fishery protection vessel, the LE <i>Deirdre,</i> was delivered in May, 1972.  A second fishery protection vessel, similar to the LE <i>Deirdre,</i> is at present under construction at Verolme dockyard in Cork and is expected to be delivered at the end of the year.  The <i>Setanta</i> which was recently purchased from the Commissioners of Irish Lights will be used primarily for training.  The vessel may, however, carry out other duties including fishery protection while being used for training purposes.  I can assure the Deputy that all steps are being taken to protect our fisheries.</P>

    <Title>Bula Limited (Acquisition of Shares) Bill, 1977: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the important elements of the development of natural resources is the need to have a good balance between the needs of State and those of private enterprise. There has been a lopsided development in the past but as a result of this Bill we will get the balance necessary so that the State can participate in a meaningful way.  It is not desirable that the State be the major shareholder. In my view the 49 per cent shareholding which the State has is sound because the controlling interests who have the expertise and the years of experience of this type of development will still be running the industry. At this stage of our development it would not be desirable for the State to have a controlling interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that we have two mining companies operating in this area is causing concern.  Obviously, and for reasons that are well known, they are at one another's throats but now that the State has one-third of the control of the development here it should play a major role in an effort to get the mining companies working together. <Col N="690" /> We are all aware that the cost of separate development and providing the expertise for this development is too high to be duplicated.  I hope the Minister will succeed in bringing these companies together.  If he succeeds, he will get the maximum output from the mines for the benefit of the companies and the State.  I commend the Bill and hope it is passed by the House quickly so that we can get on with the business of developing our resources and the establishment of a smelter plant.  Many jobs will be created as a result of this and that is what we need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts that have emerged so far in this debate from the Government side could best be compared with a small boy who put his hand into a sweet jar with a very narrow neck and, having grabbed a big handful of sweets, had then to look at the alternatives open to him. The boy could not get his hand out of the jar because of the number of sweets he had grabbed but if he dropped some of the sweets he was holding he was afraid that the jar might not be there when he would return.  That is the position the Minister created for himself in December, 1975.  He had no need to do so in this case because he had all the powers of the State behind him and plenty of time to do the right thing as far as the people of the country were concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are entitled to expect from a Government behaviour different from the behaviour of a small boy which I have just mentioned.  It gives me no pleasure to see a Minister with egg on his face, as has happened on this occasion, particularly when it arises out of a situation relating to the exploitation of our natural resources.  He knows what my recorded views are in regard to the development of natural resources for the benefit of the people.  We know that we suffer from lack of capital and expertise.  When it comes to owning and controlling the exploration, production and downstream development of our natural resources we therefore have to get ourselves into the position where we can go into partnership with those who can make up for these deficiencies.  But there is a right way <Col N="691" /> of doing so and very many wrong ways of doing it.  In our view, the Minister has chosen one of the many wrong ways open to him.  Tricking around with shares whether obtained by purchase or by gift, is not in our opinion the proper way to do it.</P>
    <P>Purchase of shares in an established mining operation is recognised the world over as being risky because mining itself is a risky business.  Accidents will happen; production will be affected and market prices change; metal usage changes.  This is certainly no place for the innocent.  It is particularly no place for the foolish but it has been and always will be a place for the greedy and the losers.  As we see it, the Minister has become one of the losers before he even starts in this case.  He has really put himself on a highway to nothing.  And we ask: for what?  A minority share in a mining operation with an uncertain start-up date, an undetermined capital requirement, unproven production plans, unproven viability, limited management experience in metal mining and no marketing plans that we know of. Surely the Minister will not continue to argue the justification for this payment.</P>
    <P>Before he continues to do so, I want to point out the position of the Minister in regard to his approach.  In the Navan area he will be a 49 per cent shareholder in Bula Ltd., a private company with no stock exchange quotation.  He has already obtained or will obtain a 25 per cent share in the adjoining mining operation owned by Tara Mines Ltd.  This company's shares are dealt with on stock exchanges in Ireland, England, Canada and the US.  He knows that the supervising authority for all shares traded in on the American Stock Exchange is the Securities Exchange Commission.  He also probably knows that American shareholders have become quite accustomed to litigation between themselves and company management; it is not uncommon over there.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the Minister's most important position in this case.  He is the regulating authority for mining licences, exploration and production. <Col N="692" /> We have heard and read much about the diversion of the River Blackwater. I understand that a condition imposed by the Minister in granting a mining lease to Tara provides for what in effect is a facility to be extended by Tara to Bula in regard to the river diversion.  He has therefore already imposed as a condition of a mining lease a basis for cost for Tara, a company with American shareholders and in which he has rights over 25 per cent of the shares.  I have read many estimates of the possible cost of this diversion; they range from £2 million to £10 million. Has he considered the possibility of inter-shareholder lawsuits before the American courts because of his 49 per cent shareholding in Bula?  Whether he realises it or not, it is a distinct possibility.</P>
    <P>Has he considered the effect of his position as Minister for Industry and Commerce of being involved in such litigation whatever the outcome might be?  The Minister has made visits to the United States and Canada, very properly supporting the efforts over there of various State boards and companies to expand our exports and promote interest in Ireland as a base for American capital and industry.  He knows as a result of his first visit that despite the size of the USA, the financial club there is very small.  We can imagine what the effect will be and we can easily judge the effect on the economic development of this country as a whole.  For what are we putting ourselves at such risk?  The uncertain return on shares costing £9.54 million in a small mining operation at Navan. Where is the evidence there of the broad view necessary to the development of our natural resources?  It may be that the Minister's strategy is to use Bula concentrates to feed an Irish smelter.  That would at least ensure a market for Bula concentrates but Bula has a limited life of perhaps 12 or 13 years and we ask: what happens then?</P>
    <P>We come back to the Bill which provides for the payment of £9.54 million, starting next week.  The Minister knows that there is a surplus capacity of zinc refining; in fact, existing smelters are at present operating at 60 to 70 per cent capacity.  He knows that <Col N="693" /> even a Government financed smelter with present day costs would never achieve viability or be able to produce and sell refined metal with such underutilisation of existing capacity.  Bula is not part of an international group; it is very much more a once-off effort.  It is not even potentially a rich mine with ore reserves or high mineralisation. There have been details of a new proven mine elsewhere with over 30 per cent mineralisation which is not being pressed into production at present by its owners because of the level of world demands for lead and zinc.</P>
    <P>We must remember that the mining business is and always was a &ldquo;Big Boys' League&rdquo;.  The Minister in this case has been out-manoeuvred.  He should examine whatever means are now open to him to extricate himself or delay finalisation of payments referred to in this Bill.  On this side of the House we will wait until another day if he says he will have another look at the Bill.  We shall not think any the worse of him if he comes back to say that he has changed his mind.  In the hope that he may do so I want to tell him what our approach would be in the Navan situation.  First, we would recognise that we require development of the orebody using other people's expertise and money but obtaining the greatest benefit for the people.  We would want job opportunities, contributions towards necessary infrastructure investment, revenue based on sales realisation.  Royalties in our opinion represent the safe way to obtain a monetary return: taxes are another way.  A combination of both may not be popular with the mine owners but that is where a balance has to be struck, taking into account a fair return for expertise and capital encouragement for further explorations.  It is one thing to dangle a carrot.  The Minister is paying the interest fee in this case and the bill for the whole Bula affair.  We should be prepared to be flexible but we should be firm.  We have the expertise at least to ensure a fair return for what is Irish-owned.  We know enough now about inter-company billings and transfers, commissions and rebates to ensure a fair return on the money.  It will be no part of a Fianna Fáil policy <Col N="694" /> to provide windfall profits to shareholders for the exploitation of Irish resources.  Above all, it will not be Fianna Fáil policy to commit scarce capital resources to unproved risk situations, because that is what this Bill is now doing.  It provides tax-free windfall profits for shareholders who did not even discover the existence of the ore in the first instance.  It makes no contribution towards bringing the production one day nearer commencement in this case because it is no aid to the commencement of the mine's production.  It makes no contribution towards providing one job.  Can you wonder then why we oppose this measure?  We are not playing a game. We are dogmatically against the Minister's approach.  We say it is wrong and we demand it be corrected.</P>
    <P>During the Minister's contribution we noticed that the Minister takes the opportunity of benefiting himself by association with the other mining company in its commencement of production of the Navan orebody scheduled for this year.  Just in case anybody might believe in this case that it is Bula which is starting to produce this year, as one might be expected to believe having regard to the fact that we are dealing with Bula in this debate, it is Tara which is starting production.</P>
    <P>We expected to hear facts from the Minister but what we have had is an irrelevant history lesson here yesterday. The few facts he has provided caused the greatest misgivings.  The Minister said that he has a report from the London School of Mines recommending that, for safety as well as other reasons, the river should be diverted sooner rather than later.  We should like to ask when did he get this report?  If he got it prior to December, 1975, when he signed this agreement, what clarification did he obtain from the Bula management and why have Bula not included any proposal for the river diversion in its planning application at present before the planning authority?  Is this an admission of his knowledge of the inadequacy of the application now being considered at great length and at great expense by the local authority?  If he did not know, surely, <Col N="695" /> as a contracted buyer for £9.54 million of 24 per cent of the shareholding, the management acting on behalf of the shareholders getting our money from the Minister should be dismissed for acting in such a negligent manner. But, then, perhaps this is just a continuation of the saga exposed here by my colleague, Deputy O'Malley, of nobody telling anybody anything.</P>
    <P>When the Minister rambles through the maze of valuation he puts his finger on what may be the explanation for all the confusion about this matter. Under the heading &ldquo;Are we Getting a Good Bargain?&rdquo;, the Minister seems to be asking a question.  I thought that as he is about to spend £9.54 million he would be in a position to give us some answers.  He said that it was agreed between the State and Bula that we would have the price for the 24 per cent element settled by independent arbitration.  He goes on later to say that with each side employing well-known experts in order to put their best case forward the end result was that the estimates of the value&mdash; and here I am quoting directly from the circulated copy of the Minister's speech&mdash;of the private minerals in question varied from £1 million to £106 million. He then goes on to say that this may seem to be an extraordinary situation. It is, for reasons other than those considered by the Minister.  We are not being asked to approve the payment of £9.54 million for 24 per cent of the value of the minerals.  The Minister's Bill in this case requires the money for something completely different.  It is required to purchase 24 per cent of the shares in the company, not the mineral value of the company.</P>
    <P>Is this the reason for all the confusion about the value of the shares, then?  Were the arbitrators valuing the minerals and were the Minister's financial adviser or advisers valuing the company?  Is this where everyone has gone wrong.  Or, is it that the Minister was unable to distinguish the difference? If this is so, he should be condemned for his ignorance of the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that he accepts the decision of the three arbitrators.  We <Col N="696" /> must ask the questions: had he any option but to accept and was it the decision of all three arbitrators in this case?  If they made their decision based on the assumption that planning permission will enable Bula to develop the mine in an economic fashion, as he says, then they were wrong.  Decisions on planning applications are based only on considerations of proper planning and development and they have no regard whatever for the economic consequences of the planners' decision.</P>
    <P>The mystery of the diminishing value of a natural resource should be a mystery no more.  The reason that value diminishes is that there is only a certain amount there in the first place. It reduces with every day's production. So, in the end, it all becomes exhausted. This investment is for real and it is real money that is being paid next week.  That is why people like Lazard, who are experienced and responsible in the spending of depositors' money and are answerable for what they do, who know what the rules are, valued on the basis of a discounted cash flow.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Minister says that even if the mine does not start in the foreseeable future it will not matter as our money will be safe in the ground.  This is, surely, a new concept of economic development, namely, plant your money in a zinc mine and watch it grow in the ground.  Is he really serious when he says this?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in sooner than I expected to reply to the Second Stage debate.  I want to divide my reply into three sections.  I want first to talk about the question of the valuation, the arbitration and the accusation by the Opposition that we did not know what we were doing, that we were duffers. That is one section.  Taking the speeches by and large, that was the core of their attack on this Bill and on my own handling of the whole matter of mineral development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a second matter to which I referred at length in my opening speech and I was very interested to see the almost total evasion of it by the Opposition, and that is what I <Col N="697" /> would call the chronology of past events, or the road we went, whether it is a mess or not, what the timing of getting into that mess was, and what should be done to get out of it.  In other words, the continuing analysis of the actions of my predecessors, whether they were capable of being brought to a successful and advantageous conclusion, whether I should have gone on reiterating their policy as I was urged to do today.</P>
    <P>The third point, again untouched by the Opposition, was whether there existed here two strategies about our mineral resources, the strategy of the Government and that of the Opposition, whether they are really the same, whether the protestations of the Opposition that they want the greatest possible benefit for the Irish people is the hypocrisy of an election year, or whether it can be validated in any way by their past actions when they had power and by their enunciations of policy by their spokesman now that they are out of power.  Those were the three areas.</P>
    <P>First, were we professional, were we expert, were we thorough, were we responsible in the question of evaluation? Secondly, is existing policy and legislation as inherited by me adequate to carry the burden of the policy my predecessor was trying to carry through?  If not, what are the alternatives? If it had been carried through, where would we have ended in terms of national interest?  These areas were not touched by the Opposition.  They had better not because, when they look into it, they dare not.  Thirdly, are there genuinely two strategies, or are we all trying in our different highminded way to maximise the advantage for the Irish people?  Is that what we are doing or is that a mounthing of platitudes by the Opposition to cover the exact opposite, because that is the truth I will maintain in the finish?</P>
    <P>Let me come first to the matter of arbitration.  In that context I am reminded of a story which relates to someone who considered himself improperly committed to a psychiatric home.  He was visited by a friend and <Col N="698" /> convinced the friend that he was totally sane and that a great miscarriage of justice had been committed. The friend promised to go away immediately and try to secure his release. When the friend had gone ten feet down the passage he was hit on the back of the head by a heavy book which the inmate had thrown at him. He turned in fury and the inmate said &ldquo;You will be sure to get me out, won't you?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley's little mistakes yesterday add up to something much more than that.  I want to talk about the &ldquo;little mistakes&rdquo; first and the psychological and policy significance under these little mistakes.  This &ldquo;little mine&rdquo; for example, was the phrase used at the beginning and end of his speech.  If you want to abolish it and amalgamate it into something else, you make it small and insignificant.</P>
    <P>In 1974, there were only two lead and zinc mines in Europe bigger than Bula and in the whole world there were only about 17 bigger lead and zinc mines, and that is ranking in a world list of over 100 mines.  Of the total new lead and zinc projects being considered worldwide in 1975, Bula was number 4.  Bula, not the whole body but this &ldquo;little mine&rdquo; he would like to pull down and make insignificant. It is not little but belittling it is not an accident; it is a very systematic policy with a very clear end in view. The little silly thing shows among the welter of received actuarial information which is not understood, the great appearance of expertise and mastery.  He talks about being 3,000 feet underground at two different places in his speech.  Once may be an accident, but not twice.  That is wrong in such a fundamental way that anybody who has any feeling for what mining, orebodies, dimensions or scales are like, could not have done it.  That is not important but silly.  That is the book on the back of the head. It says it is not great expertise; it is a carefully worked up performance of expertise which in reality covers ignorance and other people's information. That is the little point, and now we come to the sinister one.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> I referred to shadowy multi-national companies quite deliberately.  Deputy O'Malley said I really meant the Irish company.  He said I had tried to tell the House that I was not really thinking of Tara Mines, or Tara Exploration or Northgate or Irish Base Metal &mdash;I was not thinking about them&mdash;but that I was thinking of people like Cominco, Noranda and others, who have little harmless shareholdings of 2 per cent, 5 per cent, 10 per cent of shareholdings in some of these Irish companies.  Then he said that it was the practice of all mining companies to have these interlocking small shareholdings with one another.  When he says &ldquo;small&rdquo; he is saying something bogus, something to conceal the truth. He went on to say that it is perfectly normal and perfectly harmless.  That is the impression the little word &ldquo;small&rdquo; conveys, but it is not true.</P>
    <P>The annual report of Tara Exploration for 1975 says that Charter Consolidated have 10.75 per cent, not a small shareholding in some of these companies but in the one we are interested in; Cominco which he mentioned have small, normal, interlocking shareholdings of 17.43 per cent; Noranda have small interlocking shareholdings of 19.93 per cent.  Add the shares for those three companies and you are as near to 50 per cent as damn it, which Deputy O'Malley knew as well as I did.  The small amounts of 2, 5 and 10 per cent were to cover the reality of his policy which is precisely to deliver one of the greatest orebodies in the world to those shadowy multi-national companies.  I was not talking about either of the higher Tara companies; that is what I was talking about.  Of course, little inaccuracies, little mistakes of that kind, are not important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not rush it, friend; you will gag on facts before I am through.  We got this work, as Deputy C. Murphy told us, of a distinguished actuary, who could not be named.  No <Col N="700" /> doubt he is a distinguished actuary but the exact scientific exercise prepared on an actuarial basis is wrong in fact and it is wrong in principle.  He says that existing shareholders in Bula Ltd. obtain in cash and kind an amount of £29.81 million tax free which would have required earnings liable to tax of £298.01 million if they had to wait until the mine went into operation to generate profits.  The Minister is not giving the shareholders £20.27 million for the 51 per cent interest they will retain in the company.  I am buying on an open market valuation a 24 per cent interest in the company, a straightforward commercial transaction, and the value in the future of the shares which I bought and the 51 per cent interest which the shareholders are keeping will entirely depend on the profits the mine makes over its life. Deputy Myles Staunton dealt with that little exercise in phoney figures in the silence of the embarrassed media. Deputy O'Malley did not understand it. As I say, it was wrong in fact and wrong in principle and perhaps it deserves best the silence or the laughter with which it has been so widely received.</P>

      <P>It is dotty.  I will offer the exercise to the financial journalists for their delectation.  Deputy O'Malley set a figure for the prospects of the mine and I want to talk now about the figures for ore reserves and annual production and therefore for the mine life.  These figures are publicly known. If I can find my way through my papers I will put them on the record again. The point can be made, I think, that I will not be saying anything that is not fairly widely available already.  If Deputy O'Malley, with the aid of the experts he has been parading, cannot find the sort of figures I am now about to give, which he was calling for passionately yesterday when everybody knew them, if he has not got his own <Col N="701" /> resources for looking up the papers or the help of the think tank, or any of those things, I am happy to give them to him again.  As the Deputy knows, the figures for the reserves in Bula are estimated.  He made a reasonable guess at it.  He did not need to be told it.  He was not too far wrong. They are estimates because total precision does not exist in these things. The figure, which is a reasonable figure, is 15 million tons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I said the Deputy made a pretence of the figure not being available.  That is what I am sneering about.  In regard to the grading of the mine a reasonable estimate of the reserves of Tara are 60 million tons.  The grading in Bula is 7.9 per cent zinc and 4.1 per cent lead.  Again these are estimates within the normal scientific range of error.  The grading for Tara is 11 per cent zinc and 2.4 per cent lead.  A reasonable estimate for the capital cost of development&mdash;and I will talk about the expertise that has been brought to bear on this and how the figures were worked out and their validity&mdash;is about £25 million.  Capital cost for Tara, 150 million dollars and, if one were to revise that either way, it would be upwards.  Construction employment in Bula, 400; in Tara 900; mining rate in Bula, 1 million tons per annum; mining rate in Tara, 2.25 million tons per annum; production employment <Col N="702" /> in Bula, 250; production employment in Tara, 800; annual concentrate output in Bula, 134,000 tons zinc and 19,000 tons lead; annual concentrate output of Tara 395,000 tons zinc and 65,000 tons lead; estimated payroll &mdash;very approximate&mdash;£1.3 million or thereabouts for Bula and £3.4 million for Tara.</P>

      <P>No mystery about those figures, none whatever.  They have been available to everybody for a long time.  They are the sort of things that were being called for in parliamentary questions and elsewhere, the implication being that they were being concealed by me when in fact they were very widely available to everybody. Deputy O'Malley did two contradictory things.  Having made the hooha about the information he then proceeded to demonstrate that it was widely available by using it in his own exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>When is production in Bula going to start?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We will deal with that.  Do not rush it.  The figures for all reserves and annual production and, therefore, the mine life are matters of public knowledge.  Deputy O'Malley then made a calculation about capital cost, metal income, and operating cost and he said that left an average of 13.5 million dollars per annum gross profit over the lifetime of the mine.  A recognised way of taking a view about the attractiveness of an investment, one very common and widely used yardstick, is to look at the payback period.  Even taking Deputy O'Malley's figures, and they are very conservative figures, it can be seen that all the initial capital investment involved and all the State's payment of £9.5 million will have been fully paid back within eight or nine years of the commencement of the operations. That is on Deputy O'Malley's own figures.  This means that all the income thereafter to the State from its shareholding will be profit on the State's investment.  In effect, 75 per <Col N="703" /> cent of net profits from the mine will accrue to the State.</P>
      <P>I said Deputy O'Malley's figures are pessimistic.  The ore reserve figure may well ultimately prove to be significantly higher and that could drastically affect the calculations.  He gave a range of figures between £35 million and £45 million for preproduction capital investment.  In my view the lower figure he suggested would be the upper figure of the expert estimates I have received, and estimates substantially lower have been made by reputable experts after detailed studies.  His 30 million dollars a year to revenue makes no allowance for real price escalation.  Admittedly, this is a point subject to legitimate debate.  Of course it is, but it is something that has occurred in the past 15 years and if one, therefore, wants to draw on past experience as to whether it would or would not, it would be better to argue there would be such real price escalation rather than that there would not be. His average figures for production and concentration costs are $13 per ton for open-cast and $20 per ton for underground.  These are too high. They are not supported by current or projected experience in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Applying the pay-back formula and taking a very conservative view about the future ore reserve, making no allowance for real metal price escalation, making a realistic adjustment in the capital and operating costs, the pay-back position emerges as follows: all initial development costs and the State's contribution will be recovered by year seven.  Since, as I said, 75 per cent of the profits thereafter will accrue directly to the State, the revenue involved for the remaining year is extremely large and the return on the State's investment will be handsome by any standards.</P>

      <P>Well, the Deputy can say that five plus seven is 12.  We can play these games.  Deputy O'Malley talked about investment science today.  I do not deny that there is some science in it, but by <Col N="704" /> training he is a lawyer and I am a scientist.  Real science expects harder predictions than can be made in investment. We, for example, have referred to the range of figures from £1 million to £106 million.  We told Lazards, and our brief was specific, that we wanted to negotiate valuation and the matter of arriving at a final arbitrator's valuation is very like the matter of buying a horse.  The vendor goes in wildly high, the purchaser knocks like hell what he is going to purchase, a meeting point is reached and the deal is sealed.  The purchaser is often quite pleased with what he got though he had been knocking it. Is it to be thought that with this negotiating valuation we will get a middle figure?  Of course it is not, but since we have made great play on precision&mdash;Deputy O'Malley produced a set of figures vastly impressive to the uninitiated, which we were told today by Deputy Ciaran Murphy emanated from one reputable actuary in Dublin.  I would have to consider this but we are dealing in an area where we are looking down, not just the years but the decades.</P>
      <P>We are looking at an area where certain things like the gradings of lead and zinc in a bore-hole are precisely quantifiable and have been widely published for years and are available to everybody; where other things, such as the real evolution of costs, of wage rates, of metal prices and of exchange rates between different countries are not quantifiable in the scientific sense.  Anybody who tries to blind the innocent with a mock parade of phoney exactitude is a cod.  A great deal of what Deputy O'Malley was doing yesterday&mdash; ignorantly because he is a lawyer&mdash; was this sort of codding.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley in saying that what we are getting was ridiculous was depending on that sort of exactitude on the basis of the offer of one well-known and reputable Dublin actuary.  That is cheating in a serious debate.  You cannot have that.  If you want to be fair you will identify the non-variables and you will identify the variables and you will discuss them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister allow me to intervene for a moment in order to clear the air?  The point of my argument from start to finish was that the whole affair is so riddled with variables, extraordinary variables, that it is impossible precisely to quantify it in the way that the Minister has.  What the Minister is now seeking to do is turn my own argument against me.  I make the point that the Minister cannot be sure that 24 per cent of this is worth £9.54 million or anything like it. In fact, Lazard Brothers who are not going to make a false valuation for negotiation purposes, value the whole lot at £7¾ million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not interrupt.  I yielded to him and I think he abused that.  I tried to listen to him in silence and I think I am due the same courtesy.</P>
      <P>I said I was going to make three parts of my speech.  The first part revolves around this matter of valuation and Deputy O'Malley challenges the findings of the Institute of Arbitrators Board.  He says their valuation is too high.  He said first that you can attain precision and that precision that you can attain proves that we paid too much.  Then he says contradictorily that you cannot attain precision and therefore you have no basis for making decisions, so you should not act at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practice of business, mining or any other, is precisely to make informed best estimates about wage rises, international events, currency fluctuations, the evolution of consumer prices <Col N="706" /> and wholesale prices and all sorts of prices, in ways that you cannot precisely quantify with accuracy.  If you were to say: &ldquo;So you cannot act at all then because you cannot quantify with certainty&rdquo; that is fine and you do nothing.  Then you shift your argument around 180 degrees and berate us because we do not act.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley says the valuation is too high.  In passing I would remind people that in 1974 the financial expert of an Irish paper valued the Bula property at £25 million then with all reserves that were less, with a metal price that was less.  If you make adjustments on that&mdash;another man's valuation but he was a financial expert&mdash;only for the ore reserves, then you get something within the range of the valuation of the board of consultants. That 1974 valuation was in 1974 pounds.  We are not paying 1974 pounds; half is being paid in 1977 pounds, a quarter in 1978 pounds and a quarter in 1979 pounds.  Deputy Ciaran Murphy today waxed very pseudo-indignant about applying this counting to the fact that you pay some a year later and some two years later.  This is a perfectly normal and correct practice with which everybody is familiar.</P>
    <P>In the range of valuation the top and bottom figures are not realistic. They are what might be called sighting shots at each end but they demonstrate that the discounted cash flow technique will produce any figure almost if the variables are pushed to extremes.  The valuation range that was considered by the board of arbitrators was approximately £40 million at one end and £63 million at the other end.  That is the range.  Once you have your sighting shots of £1 million and more than £100 million then you narrow in.  Your next narrow-in is £40 million to £63 million. While this range of valuation would be affected by factors that Deputy O'Malley mentioned, an actual sensitivity analysis will show that it is not particularly sensitive to these factors.</P>
    <P>The range of valuation is highly sensitive to three factors.  Those are currency changes, metal price changes <Col N="707" /> and the discount rate selected. Whether you go from the upper or lower end of the range will depend on how you answer some of the following questions.  It is fair that I should make these questions explicit. For example, over the next 15 to 17 years will the sterling dollar rates vary to an extent which is not explained by relative US and UK inflation rates? Over the same period will lead and zinc prices increase faster than relevant costs and expenditures?  What rate should be selected to discount the future cash loads so as to calculate their present net value?  These three factors interact on each other and they must be analysed to identify the interactions and a decision must be made on any necessary adjustments. These matters were fully debated in expert submissions made by both sides, to the board of arbitrators who had access to expert advisers of their own and not surprisingly they took a middle view.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley can wax as mock eloquent and pseudo-outraged as he likes about the board of arbitrators, but he is taking them on and not me. They are reputable people and are a common internationally accepted recourse as a board of arbitrators for settling difficulties of this kind.  I was taxed yesterday with going into this lightheartedly, being ignorant, being ripped off, and with being codded up to the eyeballs and so on.  Anybody who has been in a Department like mine knows that every step of the way has to be highly analysed by experts and that a Minister is continuously subject to the best advice he can get. These are not arbitrary things from some guy sitting behind his desk and sticking pins and saying I will do X or Y.</P>
    <P>I will indicate the range and depth of expertise that I have brought to bear on this problem.  I have to assure people that if I did not indulge in these sort of exercises in public debate to put it on the record, in what are complex and difficult areas of expertise and areas of great variation, it is not because I do not understand figures, it is because I do understand and know how very <Col N="708" /> little meaning a lot of these things have and especially how little meaning they can have when they are used for propaganda purposes of a partisan kind, and used by people who are not concerned to discover the truth but are concerned to score political points at all costs.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable, in the Bula valuation proceedings, that I should indicate to the House the range of expert advice that I had and the thoroughness with which it was gone into.  I had the Geological Survey Office. While I wish they had more money and more staff, I do not think anybody on earth questions their expertise or dedication or their scientific honour which is not perverted by me or by anybody else.  I had the ICC which is not an agency of my Department but of the Department of Finance. They have a subsidiary called Mergers Ltd., so that I had financial and economic advice from the outset.</P>

      <P>The State has very many relations with all sorts of people not employed in the civil service, as advisers, as consultants, people from whom it purchases with contracts, as people to whom it gives grants and advice, as people to whom it offers services and from whom it receives services, as people with whom it enters into commercial contracts and so on, some of them of a very extensive and detailed kind such as are carried out by the Industrial Development Authority, some of them which involve alienation of thousands of millions of pounds in gross value, of State property, like Tara Mines.  In my years in my present job I have never received a request to reveal these documents.  In regard to parliamentary questions about what the IDA does, be it taking shares or giving grants of sometimes comparable millions of pounds to what we are now considering expending, such questions by a tradition, initiated by the present Opposition are not answered.  People are referred to the annual report.  Anybody who has looked at that knows it is not very important.  That is the accepted practice of this House both by the Opposition when they were here and by them since they arrived over there. In relation to one single company, which they want to disrupt, for reasons that I will indicate when I wind up, they demand a scale of publication which is unmatched in the public service in any country and which was never asked for by them in regard to any company in this country.  We are entitled to ask why. That is a piece of the pattern which fits and it is a piece of the pattern which I will be putting together at the end.  I would like to be permitted to move towards that end.</P>

    <P>I want to talk about a crucial question <Col N="711" /> which was carefully avoided by the Opposition.  We had those heartmoving expressions of concern about the wellbeing of the people.  The question they avoided asking was what is the take for the State under the different regimes?  I would like to talk about that a little, about what my predecessors did and what we are doing because there is a crunch point there. When I saw people shedding tears for the taxpayers this morning, and for the lack of investment, I had to ask what sort of revenue the State received by our predecessors and what sort of revenue would be received by a continuation of their policy, as still advocated by their spokesman.  The crucial question is: &ldquo;How much for the State?&rdquo;.  No Deputy addressed himself to the statement I made that under the previous regime with private minerals there were no royalties because they were private and there was no taxation because they abolished it and opposed its reintroduction. There was no participation because, as Deputy Barrett said, that was not the road to go.  Therefore, from the private minerals of Ireland there was a zero return to the State.</P>

We have some experience of what they did in pursuit of their policy.  Over approximately the last 11 years 25 million tons of ore were mined at Tynagh, Silvermines and Gortdrum.  The total we received in these magnificent royalties, which Deputy O'Malley still persists in telling us is the road to go, was 10p per ton. The total income accruing to the State in that period from those mines, from that 25 million tons, is something I should put on the record of the House. Those people who bleed for the taxpayers did not get in the money which was required for telephones, roads and the things the Opposition are so concerned about.</P>

      <P>There are a few other figures which the Deputy will not like. Under the policy of the previous Government, which Deputy O'Malley was determined to continue, the State did not receive its full share.  Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Lalor have asked why I did not continue what they were doing.  I mentioned that we would have got from the entire Navan orebody, State and private, on the basis of their past performance over the years, £220,000 per annum.</P>

As a result of the actions taken by the present Government we can now expect an income of at least £30 million per annum in constant money terms from the total orebody. Let me put it on the record of the House that that is 150 times more than our predecessors would have taken by the continuation of their policy.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley, as their spokesman on Industry and Commerce, yesterday advocated&mdash;his fellow members said the same thing today&mdash; a policy under which we would have got 150 times less.  People bleed for what the State is giving away and what the State is spending.  How about bleeding for what the State does not receive, for what is foregone, about 25 million tons of ore over 11 years&mdash; some of those orebodies are now gone &mdash;and about taking 150 times less from one of the greatest natural resources we have under their policy, which they still wish to continue, than under our policy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with Deputy O'Malley's 20 points in a minute but before doing that I want to refer to some of the specific things he said.  In the unedited transcript of his speech yesterday I see that he stated that the zinc concentrates from Tara will not be available for from eight to ten years.  That is a nice example of people saying in a bald, unvarnished, unqualified and emphatic way without a doubt, something which is not true.  That is a good old lawyer's trick.  It does not matter whether or not it is right, say it anyway, it helps the debate, it is on the record.  Under the Tara lease they are obliged to supply concentrates for an Irish smelter as from the anticipated date that the smelter will be ready, about five years from now.  There is a similar obligation on Bula.  In relation to the question of additional capital for <Col N="714" /> Bula under the agreement with them the Minister cannot be compelled to provide additional equity or other capital for the development of the mine. Since my consent is required for any rights issue I have a control over that situation.</P>
      <P>The agreement does not bind the State to afford a guarantee in respect of financing required for the development of the mine but the question of a guarantee may arise and it will be a matter, in the first instance, for the Government to consider whether, in all the circumstances of the case, they should assist by way of guarantee, which could of course be on a commercial basis subject to conditions. There is an existing well-established machinery for dealing with State guarantees which are granted in a number of circumstances, and that machinery involves reporting the matter to the Oireachtas so that there can be no question of anything secret or irregular being done.  I think it is fair that I should also say, as someone anxious for this mine to come into production as rapidly as possible, that I would be a pusher, a goman, in that situation.  I would want to see the mine rapidly capitalise, but I reiterate that there is no guarantee binding on the State to afford the financing required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are delighted to hear that, but would the Minister not publish the agreement rather than selective bits of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want now to talk about the royalty alternative and then to deal with Deputy O'Malley's numerous points <i>seriatim.</i>  On this royalty alternative, it was interesting to see the front breaking on the part of the Opposition in the persons of Deputy Lalor and Deputy Barrett, because with a little more practical knowledge they have their doubts about going the road of royalties or production or, as has been so eloquently said, the aspiration of the Irish State to put a man with a cap at the top of the mine watching the loads passing out and counting them.  It is an interesting role in which to cast the Irish State in regard to mining development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="715" /> Let us see if this royalty question has any possibility of providing a mechanism by which to obtain a reasonable return for the State.  It was interesting to note in passing that it was a system that operated in some instances in the last century.  It is interesting because it comes from Deputy O'Malley.  It is a last-century suggestion and is irrelevant to the present day for reasons that were found out a long time ago.  I will repeat this to him, because although he has heard me say this before, apparently neither I nor the people on the other side who knew anything about these things could convince him that he should get back out of that blind alley as quickly as possible and not be nailing his party to something undesirable.</P>
    <P>What are the objections?  Deputy O'Malley knows as well as I do that you cannot tweak it up and down every year.  You have to fix it for reasonable periods of time.  If you were to tweak it up and down every year saying: &ldquo;Last year was a bit hard on you; we will reduce it.&rdquo;  Or: &ldquo;This year you are doing better; we will put it up a bit&rdquo;, there is no way you could finance a mine on that basis.  The banks will not wear that.  There is no way even in vaguer terms that you could do the sort of calculations we were both talking about earlier.  It is impossible in that way.</P>
    <P>Therefore, you fix a royalty on tonnage for a period of time which will make it possible to plan a little bit, five years perhaps.  What happens?  The price of metal goes up and down.  There is a boom and the profits are enormous but the royalty is fixed and a huge profit is being taken.  That is not good. Then there is a slump.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Fix it at a percentage of the price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley's suggestion was a man with a cap at the mouth of the mine counting the stuff going out when there are royalties on production.  When you have a slump you still collect your royalties but there is no profit in the mineral, but you still collect it, profit or no, <Col N="716" /> and so you shut the mine; you put people out of work, so it is silly that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the royalty not go down when the price goes down and go up when the price goes up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  That makes it more complex and messy and makes it harder to finance.  Of course, orebodies are not all the same.  There is part of the orebody grading extremely high, but the barrels are being counted going out by the fellow with the cap. It is not enough.  Then there is a place where the orebody is bad but the royalties continue to be collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>At a much lower rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, so a whole series of adjusters are built in which end up as being completely impracticable.  If people would just read the history of tonnage royalties in the last century they would see that this had an extremely damaging effect on the mining industry, on employment, on investment and on growth.  The other factor is that collection starts from the first ton that goes out, which was paraded today as an advantage, but that so loads the investment at the beginning of the process that there is difficulty with pay back and the total costs are put up.  The front end of the process is being loaded in a way that is extremely detrimental to investment.  I am not an expert; neither is Deputy O'Malley, but I would beg somebody on that side to get him off that hook, because as I said, the history of mining in the last century shows this process was messy and imprecise, extremely inflexible and damaging to investment, to employment, and also to the utilisation of the lower grades of ore.  In fact, a worse way of taxing orebodies than a royalty on the volume of production, which is what the Deputy seems to want, would be very hard to find.  It would also be arbitrary which is another highly objectionable thing from a planning point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I go on to the second part of my speech, which is concerned with what I called at the beginning the chronology of the road that we went, <Col N="717" /> I want to talk about Deputy O'Malley's 20 points.  Perhaps they summarise the very essence of his speech.  The various points provided great listening but do not read so well.  I propose to comment on them one by one.</P>
    <P>May I observe, that the first point is right.  He says no planning permission exists to permit the mine to start up.  That is true, but final planning permission in regard to Tara did not exist at the time of the Cominco bid. People make economic decisions when there are variables and the question of planning permission was extensively discussed by the arbitrators.  When they took submissions on it they were aware of it.  Had it been settled we would have to pay more.  Had it been settled we would come to the matter a good deal later, because it is not going to be settled instantly.  While that point is true, it is not an excuse for doing nothing.  It makes action a little more difficult, but it is normal for people, State and public companies, for private companies and individuals to make decisions when things like that are not finally settled. That was taken into account by the arbitrators and argued, and the fact that it is not finally settled is reflected in their decision.</P>
    <P>I want to make a wider point about planning permission&mdash;I am trying in a less organised way than I would wish to respond to different things said.  As a Minister, I have some responsibility in the area of planning permission of mines and my officials will discharge that responsibility correctly and neutrally.  We have a range of possibilities in regard to orebody, the part which is owned by Bula.  One end of the range of possibilities is that it should be approached underground through the Tara tunnel and the other end is that it should be done open-cast by pit.  At one end there is dearer production while at the other there is cheaper production.</P>
    <P>We have experts on these matters here and an involved mechanism for dealing with planning permission which I respect.  In regard to environmental protection I should like to state I was a member of An Taisce about 1959 and I have been a <Col N="718" /> conservationist and environmentalist most of my adult life.  What I want and what I believe to be possible is the completely neutral and correct exercising of their planning function by the relevant authorities, be they the local authority or the appeal board and it will be uninfluenced by me.  It is not for me to tell them their job but the limitations on them would seem to come from two sides (1) they must protect the environment and (2) within that they must see that the economic resources of the country are developed.  They must balance the two things together.  As was correctly observed, there is a great deal of technology, of skill and knowledge involved and what one wants is the most appropriate trade-off between the protection of the people who live within the immediate environment and the interests of the people in the country at large to maximise the benefit.  That trade-off position is to be technically determined by experts uninfluenced by me or anybody else for political reasons and if that costs a little money to the State and the country and if that disadvantages the basic economies of that mine so be it. It is a reasonable price to pay for the environmental protection of the people in the area.</P>
    <P>I believe a reasonable meeting point can be found.  I believe we can reconcile their protection with the exploitation of a great natural resource but that meeting point should be found technically and not by anybody trying to twist their arm.  I give the undertaking that no such effort has emanated from me or will.  I want the correct technical solution taken by the experts; I want the correct balance but it is not for me to determine or to influence that correct balance.  It is for them to find it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <P>I have to tell the Deputy that mines and companies of all kinds, manufacturing all types of products, have a series of hurdles to traverse in reaching the point where they have a product for sale.  They make more and more precise their plans as each hurdle is traversed.  For mines and companies of every kind detailed production plans are prepared properly by widely understood and accepted procedures in circumstances where they do not have the sort of information the Deputy requires.

That agreement exists because as I said in my opening speech that were the river to remain in place it would sterilise this sloping pillar to hold up the river of ore estimated at a value of, I think, the figure I gave&mdash;it is in my text&mdash;of £200 million.  That agreement has been negotiated and exists.  We have had the London School of Mining do a careful study of this.  It is perfectly right to raise it and I can assure the House that it has been properly approached and that we have negotiated a solution to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That relates to river diversion.  The extraordinary arbitration valuation which comes to about £40 million for the mine and which is to be compared with the reported value of £7.75 million placed on the entire undertaking by the Minister's own financial advisers must have been based on very high recovery figures provided by Bula which may not be justified, particularly for the lower grade of ore to be mined&mdash;I am sorry to go on so long but that is accusation No. 20.  I have said, but let me repeat that the brief to our advisers was that we wanted a negotiating figure and if those advisers had come up with what was settled for, we would be very cross, indeed, with the ultimate arbitration figure.  This is a process like buying or selling a horse.  We asked for a negotiating figure and, therefore, they took the most pessimistic estimate of the various variables and that is what they came up with.  Of course, they did. Their procedures were correct, were scrutinised by the arbitrators, were internationally accepted and were valid procedures.  But there are two things: the techniques by which you value a mine and the assumptions on which you do it, on the techniques internationally accepted, well-known, used by us, analysed, scrutinised, probed by the arbitrator and accepted and the assumptions which you plead into that process.</P>

      <P>They certainly did not give a false figure.  Again, that is a sort of bogus effort to cheat and twist. Everybody except Deputy O'Malley understands perfectly well what they did.  Their brief was to give us a negotiating figure and they did it.  This scheme, the concentration, cost estimates could be inaccurate if extensive pilot plant work had not been undertaken. Deputy O'Malley says this work was not undertaken, that facilities do not exist.  The Department is in possession of results of pilot plant work carried out.  We are in that fortunate position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Nos. 16 and 17 go together and they say that it is not possible to quantify the effects of all these deficiencies for a projected cash flow and, therefore, the resulting value of the project is not possible to quantify. There is point 17 which is really the same point in which he says: &ldquo;I do not think they can be quantified in the discounting factors used for valuation purposes&rdquo;.  Deputies may or may not think it but the fact is that this is a common practice and it is a common practice by experts in the industry. One can say that if it were not a common practice it would be very hard to get many of the mines not in <Col N="725" /> Ireland but in the world off the ground.</P>
      <P>In point No. 18 it is stated that the Minister and the arbitrator have relied upon reports by Bechtel for Bula and submitted to the Minister and the arbitrators.  Then he asks: &ldquo;Was there a full report or was it just four or five pages from some open-cast expert commenting on someone else's report&rdquo;? First there was a Bechtel report, one of the great companies of the world in this area with a professional reputation much too important for it to give distorted results to anybody.  People in that category must give honest reports or they do not stay in business.  Their size in relation to Bula is such that Bula could in no way&mdash;if they wanted to, which they did not&mdash;influence them in any way.  First, it is a good report from a company of very high standing.  Secondly, it was not four or five pages.  We had a number of responses from a range of experts which I am told is more than one volume.</P>
      <P>It was said that we cannot obtain confirmation or evidence of the Bula report prepared for them by Bechtel in regard to reservations and operating costs.  The arbitrators were made fully aware of any such reservations and it is fair that I should record that. It was suggested that no acceptable investment analysis as applied to equity investment in mining projects is possible, etc.  That is great stuff but mining companies do make investment on the basis of the best information available.  It is continually happening even outside mining, happening throughout the whole of industry and commerce, with much less expert back-up, with much softer information than we have, much less precise information in regard to accuracy and quality and quantity than was available to the board of arbitrators. Deputies may believe me or not but I assure them that both in regard to mining and industry that is normal practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt with Deputy O'Malley's 20 points.  I am sorry it took so long but I was diverted and I was interrupted.  It was only fair that when accusations were made I should try to answer them.  I think that ends what I would call part one of the speech I <Col N="726" /> have to make, with one or two small exceptions.  Deputy Lalor this morning quoted me, giving a Dáil reference which I shall not repeat, saying that about 80 per cent of the minerals in Ireland were State owned.  He quoted me as saying this in the Dáil on that day and it is a correct quotation.</P>
    <P>He quoted me yesterday as saying that 40 per cent were clearly State owned and that you could probably make good title for another 25 per cent, making a total of 65 per cent and because of the difference in those figures, one given in 1974 and one given now, he questioned my veracity in regard to those figures and, indeed, generalised it to say that in general I was not to be believed.  He can make what innuendos he likes, of course. That is his business.  The clear position is this: I do not research those things and the number of people there who have been Ministers know that I am telling the practice like it is, that on a question like that I do not go into these papers myself.  I am not a lawyer. I would not know where to find them and would not understand them if I went into them.</P>
    <P>I give an opinion and very often, if I have not looked up the full quotations I put in a word like &ldquo;estimate&rdquo; or &ldquo;belief&rdquo; or &ldquo;is probably&rdquo; or what not, because I know they are estimates.  The estimate given by decent people, not trying to skew the evidence, in 1974 was 80 per cent and that is on the record and the estimate given since there have been a number of court cases and things like that and a lot of scrutiny of the whole area and a lot of thought about it, now, a couple of years later, is 40 per cent clear and 25 per cent problematical, a total of 65 per cent, with 35 per cent privately owned. That is a bigger private sector, unfortunately, I say with regret, but that is a decent estimate made by professionals in the same way who have not gone into the whole thing. It is theirs.  It is not mine.  I passed it on in good faith as I received it. I do not think it makes them dishonest for making it.  I do not think it makes me dishonest for passing it on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> I am sorry that the estimate has varied and particularly sorry that it has varied as it has because the private sector is now 35 per cent instead of 20 per cent as I thought it was.  It was a mistake in good faith. If the Dáil feels that I have misled it and that my veracity is in question, I apologise to the Dáil.  I did not intend to mislead it and neither did the people who prepared it and whose words I passed on in good faith.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may travel that for what it is worth and good luck to him.  I want to come to the second part of the speech, which relates in fact to the strategy of the Opposition and to what happened and to whether the delays and mistakes could have been avoided and most importantly of all, whether when it came to my turn to make decisions I did the correct thing or whether I should have done totally opposite, which is what the Opposition suggested, which is, that I should have made another order as soon as I got the High Court decision and should have persisted on that path.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make the point to anyone who will listen to me seriously in any sort of neutral way that that path was fraught with the most terrible difficulties because it turned out that the law was bad under which we were working and which had been operated quite successfully early on, before there was big money and, therefore, before there was High Court and Supreme Court challenge.  When the High Court and Supreme Court challenge came it turned out to be very bad law and the rectifying of it turned out to be extremely difficult, first because&mdash;no criticism about their decisions&mdash;there were decisions from the High Court and the Supreme Court that did not resolve our constitutional uncertainties and anybody fair in the legal profession will know that there are very great difficulties about the law itself and very great difficulties about correcting it because of the constitutional <Col N="728" /> aspects of any effort to correct it by another piece of legislation and anybody fair will accept that that is a reasonable presentation of the facts of the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister were there any court cases challenging the constitutionality of the Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Not so far as I am aware.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>But there were both submissions of opinion and subsequent opinion submitted in judgments which raised those questions, obviously, or I would not be raising them because these are not areas that I know about, but there were very severe questions of the kind that I will indicate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since it has been said today that I made the mess and it is my fault, let me give the chronology and let me see what happened them.  The orebody was discovered towards the end of 1970.  Can I say this about it?&mdash;the people who definitively made that discovery were, indeed, the Tara people but there were a few pointers in other places.  There was an analysis of animal health in the area from the levels of poisoning by heavy metals which I knew about as a veterinarian because there were very interesting results as to why there were these diseases in the stock.  There were very interesting results from analysis of water in streams done by another agency for other people.  There were interesting results from herbage analysis.  Rio Tinto Zinc&mdash;it is hard to put it on the record but it is true&mdash;had prospecting rights on that area, did not find the orebody and surrendered them.  So, lots of people had the instinct, yes, that is very exciting, that there was something there.  Good luck to the people who found it.  They have a lease over the State part of it now and they are coming into production this year and the State is in partnership with them.  I wish them profit, long life and health and success, no regrets about it.  They were not alone in that discovery.  That was in the end but they nailed it down <Col N="729" /> clear and got bore holes and got assay figures and they were the people on the spot at the crucial time, whatever pointers there were of the sort of sniffing the air that good prospectors have. They were the guys that got it.  That is the truth of the matter.</P>
    <P>In March, 1971, Bula announced the purchase of the Wright farm and in March, 1971, remember, there was the acquisition order of my predecessor. When I say &ldquo;predecessor&rdquo; I am not thumping an individual.  I am not worried about Paddy Lalor.  I am not trying to make him an idiot.  I am talking about what Governments did collectively.  I am not in the business of going at individuals or individuals' characters.  Could I say in parenthesis that I do not suppose there is anybody in this House who does not know people in both companies and possibly does not have relatives in both companies or in one or other company? Deputy O'Malley was cross about this yesterday.  I have made and I will make severe charges against Deputy O'Malley.  They will be of a political kind.  I am not in that business.  I never made these imputations.  I never suggested that in this matter anybody's opinion was changed at any level by who their brothers or brothers-in-law or anybody else happened to be or what company they happened to work for.  It is more serious than that.  If we have profound differences, as we do, they are about serious things and not about that sort of political muck.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May we take it that the Minister's reference last week was made in the heat of the moment?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir.  That was not made in the heat of the moment but was very careful, contained no such imputation and I have amplified what I said in my opening speech, and Deputy O'Malley made reference to my amplification in the beginning of his speech, that I did not make such an imputation against Deputy O'Malley and when I talk about shadowy multinationals <Col N="730" /> I am not, and I repeat, talking about either of the Taras, either the Canadian parent or the Irish subsidiary. I am talking about the people behind them, distant people, who are much more difficult to identify and to control.</P>
      <P>The acquisition order was announced. The process of getting that orebody into production was announced in March, 1971, with the acquisition order.  In April, 1971, there was an undertaking given, under some duress I think, and I know not too happily, by the previous Government &mdash;they gave it nonetheless&mdash;an undertaking to Tara to grant a mining lease. The ores were found in 1970.  In February, 1972, quite predictably, there was a case in the High Court for mineral ownership.  We are that much down the road.  We were still in Opposition. May I say for myself, and I am not revealing anything, I had not the faintest thought that 12 months later, from March, 1972, I would have this on my lap?  In July, 1972, the hearing in the High Court finished.  There was a reserved judgment.  I was in office then and if you get a reserved judgment you wait until you see it.  I did not get to this question by April, 1973.  In April, 1973, judgment came down and Bula won.  Then there was an appeal by me on advice precisely because none of the very worrying issues was resolved by that judgment. We thought there was a chance that by going to the Supreme Court we would get, as only they could resolve it, the basic legal issues resolved so that we would know where we stood.  The balance of advice to me was to go to the Supreme Court and try to get clarification.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I will accept the Deputy's word.  Then there was the question of the Supreme Court.  They upheld the High Court decision.  By then we had reached March, 1974, in a process I did not initiate and which all my advice was that I should allow go to its completion in the Supreme Court, and I regret it as much as everybody else that all that time was lost. My only change of policy, instead of making another High Court order immediately to try to perfect it, was to go on to the Supreme Court to see if the legal position would be clarified there. I will come back to that point in a minute because it is important.</P>
      <P>In July, 1974, three and a half months after I got the Supreme Court decision, I had an agreement with Bula which enabled the process to take place which will open the mine.  It took me longer to get the agreement I wanted from Tara.  Let me make my strategy completely clear.  I wanted a shareholding in both companies for the sake of the knowledge, participation, expertise and the profit, but with the undertaking that Tara had got under duress, and with other technical difficulties because their orebody was very messy and was not totally State-owned; there were private currants in that cake, I could not have got my free 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition said they did not want it and that we should not be looking for it.  They might have thought if they stuck out there would be a change of government and the old plan would be put into operation after all. If I had not had the free Bula 25 per cent, I would never have got the free Tara 25 per cent.  If I had not been willing to buy 24 per cent of Bula, I would not have got the free 25 per cent.  What did the expenditure we are now discussing unlock?  It unlocked 24 <Col N="732" /> per cent of Tara.  We have been doing elaborate exercises considering whether that 24 per cent alone was profitable. The arbitrators are experts and gave a figure which was a little more than I wanted, but it is not unreasonable.  We have been conducting this debate as if it were on that 24 per cent, but that got me another 25 per cent.  In other words, my purchase price of 24 per cent got me 49 per cent of Bula.  That free 25 per cent got me 25 per cent of Tara which I could not have got otherwise. Look at the sequence in time which I spelled out.  Without that, I could not have got what I now possess which is 30 per cent of one of the richest lead and zinc ore bodies in the world.  That is what it unlocked for me.  That is obvious surely.  Do I have to say it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  The Minister had a card in his hands which he has just discarded.  He had the card in his hand of making a proper order&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had a lot of interruptions and while I am happy with reasonable interruptions, I do not want contributions.  Deputies had their chance to speak.</P>
      <P>I have given that chronology and explained the basic strategy.  Now let me turn to what I was urged to do today by Deputy Lalor who was the man responsible at that time.  He said: the minute you got your High Court decision in April, 1973, why did you not perfect the order?  In other words, he was saying his policy was correct although up to then, it had produced delays from October, 1970, to April, 1973.  Yet he asked why did I not perfect the order.  Here is the point.  This is not for me to decide; this is for expert lawyers.  I did not take that decision alone.  I got very good advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Had I gone ahead then to make a new order, do Deputies believe that it would not have gone to the High Court again?  Of course it would.  The case was brought to the High Court in February, 1972 and we got the judgment in April, 1973.  It had taken 14 months.  If I had made the order again, I am not prejudging whether it would stand up or not, I am simply saying that there we were going to <Col N="733" /> the High Court and waiting another 14 months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let us halve it and say it would only have been seven months.  My guess that it would be as long again is as good as the Deputy's that it would be shorter.  If the Deputy likes, I will concede that it would be shorter.  Having gone through the High Court in seven months, do you think that would have settled it with issues like this at stake?  Would we not head straight for the Supreme Court again.  Of course, we would.</P>

      <P>Then I would have all the pressures of saying: &ldquo;There is an orebody.  Men have been taken on and a shaft has been sunk without a lease&rdquo;.  The pressures are there to get them to work.  That was the ploy; that the pressure to give the release on any terms would be irresistible to carry out the undertaking.  Remember Tara sued me to carry out that undertaking which had been given under duress by my predecessor.  So I am playing their scenario, but nobody from the Opposition did this today.</P>
      <P>Let us say that in the Supreme Court the new order is perfect and stands up. Then you put into operation the procedures of the 1940 Act under which we are going ahead, which is that after the Minerals Acquisition Order has been completed, you proceed to evaluation of what has been acquired by the State?  Do you think that would have gone smoothly?  Of course, we would have ended in the Supreme Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get on with this because it is interesting and I do <Col N="734" /> not want interruptions from either side. Then we proceed to the Supreme Court.  I have been told by neutral expert lawyers that there was more than an even money chance that the compensation, as in the past when the Act worked and small valuations were given, would have to be on appeal to the Supreme Court with legal arguments I do not profess to have mastered, and would have been at the full commercial value of the orebody of the privately owned business.  There is a lovely situation.  There is catch 22.  I would not be paying for the value of 24 per cent; I would be paying for 100 per cent.</P>
      <P>Let us take it that we have an even money chance.  If the Supreme Court say: &ldquo;Full commercial value for 100 per cent&rdquo;, then I pay 100 per cent to private owners who have done very well out of this.  But then I would be doing it just for the privilege of perfecting the State's title in order to attach the private bit on to the public bit.  Then I could try to recover that which I had expended on the State's behalf from the lessees. Of course, if I recovered it all the State would get nothing from the private bit and, if I could not recover it all, the State would be at a loss.  It is perfectly possible they would say to me, at that price, since it was valued at the full commercial value by the Supreme Court, that they did not want it and then I would have been buying at 100 per cent commercial valuation and not getting any shareholding rather than buying 24 per cent at a commercial valuation and getting 49 per cent.</P>

      <P>All right, but I am very much further.  Here is the point. The part that I was urged to pursue was fraught with great uncertainty and delay.  Delay!  What we had was nothing to the delay that might have ensued with the possibility at the end of it of the State buying 100 per cent at the commercial valuation in order to possess simply the title.  Really I am not trying to make a political football of this.  I will come back to that later. That was not a prudent course.  Then the Opposition say: &ldquo;OK.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been necessary to hold up production.  The way I read it it has got a very great deal of work done on the larger part, on 80 per cent of it, and I will soon get work done with any normal spectrum, not taking a very optimistic and not taking a very pessimistic view but taking it in the middle, taking the normal spectrum, will get the other bit, so I am doing it quicker and more cheaply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was bitterly reproached because I said this was not a good solution.  I did not like it.  It was not perfect.  We have reached a damn silly state in debate if Members are expected to say that everything they bring to the House is perfect.  Everything is not perfect.  I do not like it, no.  It is not perfect.  I wish <Col N="736" /> the 1940 Act had been good.  I wish all the minerals were clearly vested in the State.  I wish one could be certain of obtaining those that are private under the old-fashioned style of compensation which compensated owners before they were evaluated.  I wish all those things.</P>
    <P>But that was not the situation and no one offered me a better alternative and I took steps.  Let me sum up what this did because I ended up with 30 per cent of the ore mine and I ended up with that 30 per cent of the whole ore mine.  I did that at an expenditure of £9.5 million and I cannot quantify any more than Deputy O'Malley can the amount of clawback through taxes but there are three tax headings which are relevant introduced by this Government. Deputy O'Malley with his usual lack of respect for what is verifiable says &ldquo;No tax&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I see the position as the following: the people who are recipients will do their utmost to evade it and the Revenue Commissioners will collect as much as they can.  There will be a trade-off between them.  I cannot say with certainty how much.  That will be between the recipients and the Revenue Commissioners.  To assert blandly, as Deputy O'Malley did, and this is what is so frightening about any sort of truth telling in debate, and to assert without qualification &ldquo;No tax&rdquo; is simply silly. I believe there will be tax and I believe it will be substantial and I believe it is right to count that as a clawback from the total amount of State expenditure and, indeed, the amount you are then left with in millions of pounds is the amount I expend month after month through the IDA to individual companies with no shareholding, no participation, no tax on exports, but just to create jobs.  I spend that much money and I do it with the approval of the Government and it never comes here before the Dáil and, if any Member asks a question, I say it is tradition to wait for the annual report.  When, however, I expend a comparable amount of money to get in the end onethird of the richest zinc-lead orebody in the world I am told I am profligate and I am an idiot and codded up to my eyeballs.  That is enough.</P>

      <P>Wealth, Capital Gains and Capital Acquisitions.  I have been saying what is the scenario in time. How did it evolve?  What were the choices before me?  I was saying I was faced with very real difficulties and I was mocked for saying I did not think this was a real solution, a perfect solution, and I am sorry about that.  I could play politics and say it is perfect. But it is not.  It is messy.  I am doing my utmost but those who have been Ministers will know that the Department of Finance, the Attorney General and the parliamentary draftsman and others are involved in getting a Bill. It is really frightening.  It is backwards and forwards and I have done my utmost to get it quickly.  I am told how long it has been, but I got the judgment of the Supreme Court in March, 1974, not quite three years ago. I would hope to have a Bill in three years but I may not succeed.  Any reasonable member knows the difficulties. That was moving not myself but them as fast as I could immediately it became evident how bad the legislation was and that we needed new legislation.  Can we not all agree <Col N="738" /> that we do?  Can we not all agree that it is very difficult because of the constitutional aspect?  Can we not all agree, those who have experience of bringing Bills to this House, that that sort of time lapse is not unreasonable with those difficulties and constraints?  Can we not all agree it is not the responsibility of one individual Minister but of the whole machine in operation, parts of which he can influence and parts of which he cannot in regard to the rate of work?</P>
      <P>I have offered the history of what happened.  I have offered the choices and I have indicated to reasonable people the path I took was the best way out of a very difficult situation which produced a very good result for the Irish people in terms of a return of 75 per cent on one and 62½ per cent on the other and the whole expenditure in terms of that vast orebody for 45 per cent of one and 25 per cent of the other is £9.5 million with clawback. That is profligate and foolish. What have we reached in terms of dottiness and in terms of political opposition for the sake of opposition? I cannot quantify the clawback.  Any sensible person, anybody who is not trying to make mischief in an election year, would know that was a wonderfully good deal for the Irish people and was rectifying a position that had gone by default.</P>

      <P>That leads me to the third part of my speech which is to analyse the thrust of politics between the two sides of this House, to say what fundamentally each side is and to say then which side policy thrust I believe to be in the interests of the people because we have been having an auction yesterday and today and protesting our commitment to the interests of the people and the greatest possible return for them.  I do not suppose there was a speech on either side that did not contain that phrase. But nobody wanted to look at the figures.  I said in my opening speech that for the private minerals under the regime that Deputy O'Malley keeps saying we ought to continue to operate, the return to the State from <Col N="739" /> the private minerals now known to be 40 per cent of all in the land would have been zero, nothing, nought; and no royalties because it is private, no tax because you do not believe in it, because you have abolished it, no participation because that is wicked, so there is nothing from the 40 per cent. That is one bit.  The other is royalties only which from the 25 million tons taken out in the 11 years until I came along yielded £2.8 million to the State and when we bleed for the public money going out&mdash;and I am as careful of it as anybody&mdash;would we not bleed for the money that did not come in, for the investments that were not made in the telephone system or the roads?  Is money foregone by the State 20, 30, 50 times less to be counted than money spent by the State?  Is the passing up of revenue unimportant?  No answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to analyse the fundamental thrust of the policy of the Opposition when they were in Government and when they were in opposition.  To do that I refer to something I said at the beginning. Deputy O'Malley minimises as two or five or ten per cent the shareholdings in the various companies.  I mentioned at the beginning the shareholdings in Tara by some of the great international companies and I said that Charter Consolidated and Comicon banded together owned practically half, not the little interlocking shareholdings that Deputy O'Malley referred to, and I put his quote onto the record.  The policy of the Opposition was to deliver the whole orebody to those people.  When you look at the share register of Tara Exploration and Development you see that those people are nominees so there are lots of others whom you cannot identify.  The Opposition policy was to deliver it to them totally, and, therefore, to deliver the total control, not only over the physical orebody but also over what became of it and over the smelting, the marketing and the whole future of our natural resources in regard to lead and zinc.  What did they do?  They made an order against some internal advice in the Department to possess for the State, compensated by the State, the private bit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Wright was very lucky.  He was an old man and a farmer and he had lived there all his life and he had certain rights.  He was not a runner-in; he was resident and it was his land. Tara came to him and tried to buy it out.  He is dead and we will never know what transpired between them but it ended up that they knew already that he was sitting on something <Col N="741" /> immensely valuable, worth many millions of pounds.  It could have been solved then if they had not made him a derisory offer because they could have bought it and amalgamated with the public bit.  The State did not give its undertaking then but gave it a few months later in April, 1971 and the whole could have been unified and developed as a single ore-body.</P>
    <P>Tara had it with the people I have mentioned at the back of them.  There are Irish people among them and they are perfectly reasonable people and I hope to go on working with them for a long time.  Except for the State's bit, Tara Mines is a wholly-owned subsidiary of a Canadian company registered in Toronto.  I have mentioned some of the shareholders and there are plenty more nominees on the share register.  The effort was to deliver the whole thing to the controlling shareholders of Tara Exploration Development and the bit that by accident belonged to a local farmer, and that he did not choose to part with for a fraction of what the intending purchasers knew it was worth they were going to acquire by a compulsory purchase mechanism under a minerals acquisition order, not for the State but for the purpose of transferring it to people who were already some of the most powerful people and the hardest to identify in the whole of the mining world.  We know enough about them to know approximately who they are.  I am glad Deputy O'Malley has come back because I am going to turn to something else but that was the thrust of the strategy.  Give them the orebody <i>in toto.</i></P>

      <P>Yes, but use public money so there is no competitor.  I am going to reiterate facts but not comment because I leave comment to others.  I want to put on record my awareness of certain facts that Deputy O'Malley uttered yesterday because he was Minister for Justice in that Government <Col N="742" /> and he knew about the undertaking. Presumably he was a participant in that decision in April, 1971 and he knew about the acquisition order and about the Government discussions behind it and he knew the effort was to use the whole weight of the State to push through an order and if it did not stand up the first time to go on pushing it through and so harass the people who at least are Irish, who have at least shown remarkable entrepreneurial flair, have created a very large number of jobs, have shown great management skill and production skill in Ireland, not to get the minerals for us for our development but to deliver them to the people I have already mentioned.</P>

      <P>The thrust of the policy of the Opposition, from the beginning, was that a single lease should be given to Tara, and that the only return that we would obtain was by way of a royalty.  They have gone on disapproving of shareholding and of taxation even in this debate. National interest lies in having more than one grouping, particularly in having an Irish end as well as a very distant end that we find difficulty in identifying.  We need the great international companies with great expertise, but we need to deal from a position of strength and to keep them at a distance so as not to be eaten alive by them.  If it is decided to give them one of the greatest natural resources we are ever likely to find, and if the policy of neither taxing nor participating, but of having a royalty is persisted in the most that can be got from any royalty is a tiny return.</P>

      <P>The reality of those who bleed for the Irish people is that they are willing to forego huge amounts of revenue.  The policy of those who bleed for the defence of national resources is to hand them over to people who can hardly be identified.  I am glad to say that this Government got into office in time to operate a policy of mutual and hopefully fruitful and equal co-operation, but not domination with those great companies.  If we persisted in the policy of our predecessors the return would be 1/150th part of what it will be under the regime with which I am proud to be associated.  The choice was republican words and a totally supine posture in regard to State income and State influence on the Opposition side, and on the Government side a posture of a mixed economy of State participation, of having the knowledge, the power and the directors to understand the ploys, develop the expertise and keep these people at bay.  We need them, yet we need to control them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very proud to recommend to this Dáil a Bill which spends £9½ million to obtain 30 per cent of one of the greatest orebodies in the world. We are extremely lucky in terms of long term national interest that a change of Government took place <Col N="745" /> when it did, before the policy of our predecessors was irrevocably stamped on that orebody, and that we had a chance to get a reasonable balance, a good take for the State, and a reasonable return for Irish entrepreneurs and for the people from overseas, whom I fear, but whom we need.  I am for a balance of equal power between them and us.  I believe we have got that, and that is good for the Irish people.</P>
    <P>In the presentation of this there is a psychological difficulty, because the alienation from the State via a lease to Tara of ore worth thousands of millions of pounds, and the foregoing of those huge revenues in the past and the promise to forego them in the future is money that the State never sees so it is not a big issue.  When £9.5 million gathered from the Irish taxpayer goes out to give a capital gain to a small number of people, everybody bleeds.  That is an aspect of it which I do not like, but I have never said that this is a perfect solution. When revenue is foregone and assets alienated it is not a big issue, but revenue given is another thing altogether.  In terms of balance of national interest, in terms of the value of this deal to the people, in terms of recovering a position where we have directors, not two out of seven as has been stated but two out of ten&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is a great piece of good fortune that we were able to attain a position where we got a shareholding, where we got taxation as well as royalties and where we were able to deal with the great international companies, which we need, in a position of equality not from a position of servitude, not from a position where they can rip us off.

      <P>May I ask a question? When the Minister got the decision in 1973 from the Supreme Court, and having learned of the difficulties that he would be facing with a new order, did he at any time consider recommending to the Government that the Constitution be changed to deal with this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not recommended that course to the Government. Of course, the question of change has arisen in the experts' efforts to draft remedying legislation. If we ran into the stone wall and if in the experts' opinion it was not possible with our present Constitution to remedy the legislation and if we were faced with the circumstances where we might have to buy out all the 40 per cent ore in the country at current commercial value then, of course, I would have to go to the Government to recommend a change in the Constitution to enable us to obtain the rights of the Irish people to their minerals, which I believe to be the intention of the Constitution to uphold.  I have not been advised by the expert drafters that that is the only road to go and, therefore, I have not done it.  I do not rule it out.  If that is the only road to go I would certainly go it.  I expect to get an answer fairly soon as to whether it is the only way out of the difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly a final way out, with great regret, not faster.  My purpose was to solve both things simultaneously, that we get on with the ore-body and get the men working on the one hand and that we try to solve the thing in parallel.  Why does one have to choose one road or the other? I did not.  I tried to go both roads and I believe I am a long way along both roads.  You do not choose one path or the other.  You try to solve it both ways simultaneously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Holidays (Agricultural Workers) Regulations, 1977,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Regulations in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 26 January, 1977.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that, under the Industrial Relations Act, 1976, a Joint Labour Committee has been set up under the aegis of the Labour Court to regulate the rates of pay and conditions of employment of agricultural workers, of whom there are 20,000 in full-time employment and 14,000 in part-time employment.  The general purpose of these arrangements is to ensure that future agreements arrived at under the procedures of that Act will lead to the progressive elimination of the conditions differential that has been allowed to develop over the years, resulting in a growing gap between the working conditions of farm workers and those of other industrial employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the arrangements established by the 1976 Act, the Agricultural Wages Board will be abolished in due course.  The intention is that in that event the enforcement of holiday entitlements of agricultural workers would pass to my Department.  For that purpose, I must have a set of regulations setting out the holiday entitlements of agricultural workers by reference to the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973, under which I am responsible for holiday entitlements of workers generally.  The draft regulations laid before the House for approval meet the objective of setting out rules <Col N="751" /> to govern the holiday entitlements of agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>The draft regulations preserve the current holidays entitlements as contained in several Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Acts, which fall to be repealed, but effect certain modifications in the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973, to take account of their special circumstances.  I expect that, at a later date when both sides of the agricultural industry have reviewed holiday entitlements in discussions at the Joint Labour Committee, proposals may be put forward in relation to the future pattern of holiday entitlements in that industry.</P>
    <P>I recommend that the House should now approve these draft regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can see this Order merely brings the holiday regulations of agricultural workers under the 1973 Act and from the point of view of our party there is no objection to that.  Basically, there is no improvement in the holiday entitlements of the agricultural workers and this order only brings them under the control of the Minister for Labour.  I notice that, in regard to the public holiday entitlements, there is a difference between the Act and the order laid down by the Minister in relation to agricultural workers.  Why does this difference exist?  The Minister mentioned the need to bring agricultural workers and industrial workers in line. I should like to draw the Minister's attention to section 4 (2) (a) of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973 which states:</P>
      <P>In the case of day to day and part-time employments, the employee must, for entitlement under this section, have worked for the employer for at least 120 hours (or 110 hours if under 18 years of age) during the five weeks ending on the day before the public holiday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's order seems to make a change because it states that an agricultural worker must, for entitlement, have worked for the agricultural employer for at least 125 hours during the five weeks before the public holiday. There may be a good reason for this difference of five hours but I do not <Col N="752" /> see any reason why the Minister did not bring agricultural workers in line with those of industry.  If the Minister is sincere in his statement about agricultural workers he should see that the same conditions govern public holidays for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that 20,000 people are engaged in full time employment and 14,000 in part-time employment in the agricultural industry. At a time of high unemployment we should do everything to continue that employment, and expand it if at all possible.  In this regard I should like to ask if the Minister for Finance made a sensible move in removing the allowance payable to a farmer if he is availing of the notional system.  In my view that is a disincentive to the agricultural sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures mentioned by the Minister are very important and I am questioning whether the Government are sincere in obtaining this level of employment in the agricultural sector.  We supported the Act setting up the joint industrial council to cover agricultural workers and this order is a follow up to that. The order states that where board, lodging or board and lodging are part of remuneration, the agricultural worker may, subject to being given double pay elect not to take holidays and I find that slightly confusing. Does that put the agricultural worker who is availing of board or lodgings in a different category from the agricultural worker who is not?  If it does not, what is the necessity for this provision? I notice that under the order the facility that has long been shared by agreement between employer and employee in the agricultural sector regarding the six sporting days during the year, other than church holidays or public holidays, such a day may be taken by the employee as part of his annual holidays.  Basically, I support the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>On the main entitlements of industrial and agricultural workers, the three weeks' annual leave <Col N="753" /> and public holidays, the provisions are similar but, as the Deputy points out, there are some differences.  He said that 125 hours per month were required to qualify in the case of agricultural workers and only 120 hours for industrial workers.  This regulation ensures that holiday entitlements can be affected by any subsequent decision by the Joint Labour Committee which we have established.  To do this, it is technically necessary to make it apply under the new Joint Labour Committee arrangement consequent on the Act that has been passed.  But we must await the verdict of the Joint Labour Committee when they come, in their work, to tackle the question of holidays. They are at present involved on the wages side which is the more important question.  No doubt, very shortly they will come to holidays.</P>
      <P>The other point raised by the Deputy was the question of board and lodgings as part of the remuneration of an employee. If this is part of the remuneration of an employee, if given double pay he may elect not to take holidays. That is taken over from section 3 of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973 and is re-enacted here simply for ease of drafting and no other reason.  The main point is that this motion is necessary in anticipation of any decision which the Joint Labour Committee may make in regard to removing any differentials that may continue to exist between agricultural and industrial workers.  I have no doubt they will be tackling the holiday area very soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputies will be already aware that this Bill is not only one of the longest which has come before the House for many a year, but is also, of its very nature, one of considerable complexity. Perhaps it might be helpful, therefore, if, instead of coming to grips at once with the substantive provisions of the Bill, I were to give the House some idea of the main purposes the Bill is intended to serve and the general background to the legislation.</P>
      <P>First of all, the Bill is a consolidating measure.  It re-enacts in one comprehensive statute all the existing statute law dealing with the subject of landlord and tenant enacted since the inception of the State.  That means that it brings together the provisions from the Landlord and Tenant Acts of 1931, 1958, 1967 and 1971 together with certain provisions in the rent restrictions code and the planning Acts which are proper to the landlord and tenant code.  The rent restrictions code as such is not being dealt with in this Bill and remains an entirely separate body of law from the landlord and tenant code.  Many of the provisions brought together in the Bill are not being changed in any substantial way. A number of others are being considerably amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from these amendments, some completely new matters are being dealt with.  Perhaps the most important is the prohibition of the creation of new ground rents on ordinary dwelling-houses and the introduction of a new system for the purchase of ground rents which is intended to minimise the legal <Col N="755" /> costs involved.  As a consequence of the consolidating element of the Bill &mdash; but of considerable importance in its own right &mdash; the Bill also extends the procedure for settling disputes by the arbitration of county registrars which was introduced in the 1967 Act in relation to the purchase of ground rents.  I should like to come back to all these specific matters later on.</P>
    <P>As to general background, I think that one must start with the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1931.  This was an extremely important piece of legislation because it effectively set the pattern for the statutory regulation of relations between urban landlords and tenants. It really was a tenants' charter in that it introduced for the first time protection for urban tenants against dispossession on the expiry of their tenancies. It gave them rights of renewal of tenancies. It is easy to forget that prior to 1931 an urban tenant whose lease expired had no legal right to remain on in the property and that the landlord was entitled to recover possession. This was so even where the tenant had put up the building himself.</P>
    <P>The 1931 Act was also of considerable importance in a technical sense. It introduced the statutory concepts of &ldquo;building lease&rdquo; and &ldquo;proprietary lease&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;occupational tenancies&rdquo;.  These terms are of considerable importance in any discussion of the present Bill.  I hope that Deputies will bear with me if, at this stage, I try to distinguish between them.  First of all a &ldquo;building lease&rdquo; in the classical case is a lease under which the landlord leases the tenant a plot of land with a covenant in the lease that the tenant will build a house on the land.  A &ldquo;proprietary lease&rdquo; is a sublease under a building lease.</P>
    <P>The essential thing about both kinds of leases is that it is the tenant who owns the &ldquo; bricks and mortar&rdquo;.  The landlord has only a minor interest in the whole property and this is normally represented by the fact that the rent is low.  This rent in the case of this type of lease has come to be known as a &ldquo;ground rent&rdquo;.  On the other hand an &ldquo;occupational tenancy&rdquo;&mdash; which may be by way of lease or any <Col N="756" /> other kind of agreement &mdash; is one where the landlord owns the bricks and mortar. The tenant's interest is related primarily to his occupation of the premises.  In such cases the rent is higher or what is commonly called an &ldquo; occupational rent &rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are many leases and tenancies which do not fit comfortably into these relatively simple classifications. In particular, over the years the statute law has had to extend considerably the scope of &ldquo; building lease &rdquo; and &ldquo; proprietary lease &rdquo; so that these expressions would truly reflect the classes of lease which were commonly taken to reserve a ground rent as distinct from an occupational rent.  Perhaps of necessity, the result has been that the law has become extremely complex.  One of the purposes of the Bill is to simplify it.  It does this, in particular, by dropping the terms &ldquo; building lease &rdquo; and &ldquo;proprietary lease&rdquo; altogether and by simply setting out a list of the conditions with which leases will have to comply if they are to attract the right to a reversionary lease, that is a renewal of a ground lease and the right to purchase the fee simple.</P>
    <P>To revert to the background, the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1958 dealt with ground rent leases only and extended the rights of tenants.  The 1967 Act &mdash; many Deputies will recall &mdash; introduced the concept of leasehold enfranchisement.  It gave ground rent tenants the right to buy the fee simple. The 1971 Act dealt with two rather special matters.  It gave rights to clubs or organisations using land for outdoor recreational purposes to get sporting leases and in addition it extended to new classes of tenants the rights given in the 1958 Act and in the 1967 Act to get a reversionary lease and to purchase the fee simple.</P>
    <P>So much for the background.  I should now like to deal with the main changes in the law which the Bill proposes.  These are the prohibition of the creation of future ground rents on dwelling-houses, the introduction of a new procedure for purchasing ground rents at minimum legal cost and the further extension of the <Col N="757" /> various rights given under the existing law.</P>
    <P>As to the prohibition of future ground rents, some Deputies may recall that when the Bill for the 1967 Act was under discussion in this House, a number of Deputies advocated a prohibition on the creation of new ground rents.  Such a prohibition had, indeed, been mooted by the Ground Rents Commission but they had been unable to recommend means by which such a prohibition could be achieved.  At the time the main objection to such a prohibition was that it would, of necessity, increase the initial price of new houses.  This, it was argued, would lead to hardship, particularly in the case of young people purchasing a house for the first time.  It was also argued that the lease reserving the ground rent also provided a mechanism through the use of covenants whereby the development of an estate could take place in an orderly fashion and that the houses would be properly maintained and used.</P>
    <P>It may well be asked why we now find it possible to introduce a prohibition on the creation of new ground rents.  First of all, I am satisfied that the means adopted in the Bill will be adequate to secure the desired result. The method adopted is to declare void any lease made after the commencement of the Act which is of the type which would attract the right to purchase the fee simple.  As to the practical issues, I think few people will disagree with the view that things have changed considerably since 1967.  In the first place, the maximum purchase price of the same ground rent under the Bill will be only about half of what it was in 1967.  Fourteen to 15 years purchase was the figure mentioned as the maximum purchase price when the Bill for the 1967 Act was under discussion.  The maximum price at the moment would be about seven years' purchase.  So that as compared with the £300 ten years ago the purchase price might be no more than £150 nowadays while, of course, the value of money has declined considerably and the property to which a ground rent relates, which might have been worth little over £2,000 then, <Col N="758" /> would be worth the best part of £15,000 now.  It is true of course that ground rents being created nowadays are higher than those created ten years ago.  Nevertheless the difference today between a freehold purchase price and a leasehold purchase price will not be as significant as it then was.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the question might still be asked whether it is morally justifiable to prohibit a particular type of business activity and to interfere with the citizens' right to enter into particular types of contracts.  I think it fair to say that the general consensus on all sides of this House during the proceedings on the 1967 Act was that there was a valid case for interfering with freedom to dispose of property in the particular circumstances.  A prohibition in particular on the creation of ground rents on dwelling-houses can be clearly justified and that is what is provided for in this Bill.  The controls arising from the existence of covenants in a lease can now be effected through the medium of planning law and so the need for covenants for such a purpose has disappeared.</P>
    <P>The Bill in this respect distinguishes between private dwelling-houses and business property.  This, I would submit, goes to the very fundamental causes of the agitation which has been going on since the last century for leasehold enfranchisement and more recently for the abolition of ground rents.  I believe that one of the fundamental aspects of this agitation could be described as an emotional rejection of a system which allows the landlord an unreasonable degree of control over the tenant's family home.  This is particularly so when the tenant considers himself the owner of the house in the fullest possible way.  It is not only a matter of feeling aggrieved at not owning the land on which one's family home is built.  There is also a more objective criticism of the system in that the powers reserved to himself by the landlord under the lease are often excessive.  I refer in particular to covenants which give the landlord sanctions in relation to non-payment of rent and in relation to breaches of covenants which appear to the tenant to be out of all proportion to the landlord's financial interest in the property. <Col N="759" /> While such covenants in this type of lease have been ameliorated in their effects to a considerable extent in the various statutes since 1931, I accept that they still form the basis for a residual fundamental objection to the whole ground rent system.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to leases of business property is different.  Here the parties are more likely to be on an equal footing.  There is not the same sensitivity with regard to property which is to be put to commercial use rather than form a family home.  Of course, the considerations surrounding the creation of a ground rent for commercial purposes would be altogether different from those pertaining to private dwellings, particularly with regard to the relative strengths of the parties.</P>
    <P>Perhaps a measure of the dissatisfaction that I mentioned is the call that is made occasionally for abolishing ground rents altogether.  This is really a call for the termination of the landlord's interest without compensation. It is a call that has in the recent past been answered by pointing to the Constitution and its protection of property rights.  It would be unconstitutional to provide for the termination of the landlord's interest unless adequate compensation were paid.  Indeed, the point was made in the course of the proceedings on the Ground Rents Act that if the statute did not provide for full compensation it might be &ldquo;torpedoed&rdquo; within a few months by the courts.</P>
    <P>I should like to go a little deeper than that into the constitutional question. For one thing, I think that, irrespective of the constitutional law aspect, it would be wrong to have any element of confiscation in this legislation.  I say this because some people unfortunately seem to deduce that the Constitution is in this respect merely an obstacle to doing something which is otherwise justified.  It has even been argued that all we need do is amend the Constitution and then it will be permissible to go on and provide for the termination of ground rents without compensation. This view completely misunderstands the role of the Constitution in the protection of personal rights.  The constitutional provisions are declaratory <Col N="760" /> of certain antecedent principles.  They simply give expression to rights which have evolved over a long period of time, and, as it were, encapsulate a kind of history of legality.  Moreover, the values involved have been universally accepted by our people and are indeed at the root of most civilised legal systems.</P>
    <P>While I think this is first and foremost a question of principle, it is also salutary to have regard to the practicalities. If the State were to remove the constitutional protection of property rights who would benefit? Would the new fee simple owners benefit?  They might get a fee simple at lower cost but they would then find themselves in the same position the landlord was in previously.  Such tenants would, indeed, constitute possibly the greatest single class of property owners.  But they would no longer have constitutional protection of their rights.  It would be possible for the State &mdash; say in the interests of better planning &mdash; to abrogate their rights and confiscate their property without fear of constitutional hindrance. While I cannot see any Government doing this in the foreseeable future, I think Deputies will agree that the removal of the constitutional protection of these basic rights would be a most undesirable thing.</P>
    <P>Again on a practical level I think it must be emphasised that when it comes to ground rents it would be a gross over-simplification to regard landlords as the rich and powerful and the tenants as the underprivileged. Many ground landlords are relatively poor people or public authorities, while on the other hand tenants under ground leases can range from ordinary suburban houseowners to the biggest industrial and commercial giants.</P>
    <P>It is frequently stated that the right to purchase the fee simple which was introduced in the 1967 Act has not been availed of to any great extent. There is a genuine difficulty in evaluating such statements.  In the first place it is in the nature of things that a high proportion of transactions under the Act will never come to <Col N="761" /> official notice.  They are private transactions. Only those which have been the subject of some difficulty which needed solution by reference to the arbitration procedures provided for in the 1967 Act have come to attention. It is also true of course that even if the right to purchase the fee simple given in the Act were not availed of by people generally, this would not prove the Act a dead letter.  The existence of a right can serve a useful purpose even if the right is not exercised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was making the point that the biggest problem facing the fishing industry at the moment is lack of confidence. That is one of the stumbling blocks to future progress of the industry.  All we have got from the Government in the last four years has been a number of restrictions on certain types of fishing. There have been increases recently in the prices of drift-net licences.  We have had a doubling of the interest on loan repayments for fishermen, a shortening of the term of years for loan repayments and many severe increases in the cost of diesel and fuel oil for boats. Even our processing plants, small as they may be, are finding it impossible to continue and many of them have laid off workers.  This has happened in Killybegs and Rossaviel.  It all adds up to one sad story as far as the fishing industry is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come now to the case we have been making in the EEC where we have been completely ignored.  When one examines the facts one asks, is it any wonder?  Our commissioner was sacked by the Taoiseach in the middle of the negotiations.  We lost our vicepresidency in the EEC.  This Government's standing has been shown by the way our new commissioner was treated. He was placed in a minor role in <Col N="762" /> Europe.  Again one can hardly wonder at this in view of the fact that there was so much wrangling and fighting in the Cabinet prior to the announcement.</P>
    <P>One has to have a certain amount of sympathy for the Minister for Foreign Affairs who is trying to make a good case for us in these circumstances.  It is unfortunate that our fishermen are the people who must suffer as a result of all this bungling.  The IFO are to be complimented on the manner in which they have conducted the affairs of the fishermen, the way they have highlighted the problem and the assistance they have given the Minister in trying to make the fishermen's case. Now they realise that they were fooled and they say this publicly.</P>
    <P>Last night I was amazed that my colleague from west Mayo, Deputy Staunton, tried to justify the Government's action and that of the EEC by saying that as we are benefiting from our membership of the EEC we should not rock the boat.  This is a defeatist attitude and sums up the whole position in relation to the negotiations we have been carrying out in the last few months.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House will continue to fight to maintain the right to get a coastal band for our fishermen. Anything we have been doing was done with the intention of strengthening the Minister's hand.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to hear this debate as fully as possible.  I was unavoidably absent during the first part and have read with great care the contributions made then and listened to the contributions made yesterday and the brief speech by Deputy Gallagher today.</P>
      <P>There is common ground between us on certain key points, however much we may differ about procedure. The condition of the Irish fishing industry at this stage, in view of the extent of over-fishing in recent years, is totally unsatisfactory.  The damage that has been done, some of it not readily retrievable in any short space of time, by over-fishing off our coast&mdash; normally outside the 12-mile limit where there has been occasional poaching &mdash; is on a very large scale. This is part of a general problem of over-fishing in many parts of the world, particularly in the North Atlantic, but I feel it is, in some respects, more acute in areas near our shore than it is elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The damage done to an industry like ours, whose fishermen are inshore fishermen and have not the opportunity, <Col N="764" /> because of the nature of their boats, craft, tradition and capital investment in the industry, to go afield to look for fish if their stocks near home are depleted, is exceptionally great.  This industry should be recognised by everybody as being a natural part of the process of economic development of this the least developed part of the Community, except part of southern Italy.  The fact that damage has been done to an industry which should be helping to lead our economic growth, but which has been instead prevented from making any real progress and has suffered a series of setbacks, is deplorable.  The primary duty of the Government is to set this right.</P>
    <P>There is no problem to which my Department have had to devote more time and attention.  No problem has been more complex or more misunderstood. Some of the misunderstandings arise quite naturally from the extreme complexity of the issues and the way the issues have evolved.  A number of them derive from persistent misrepresentation by the Opposition which goes, I think, beyond the appropriate role of an Opposition to probe, to press the Government, and to oppose them when they think they are wrong.</P>
    <P>Much of the campaign that has been waged by the fishermen and their union, and part of the campaign by the Opposition, has been, in a sense, helpful in that it has begun to make clear to our partners in the Community the major issue this is at home.  I am afraid the Opposition campaign has gone beyond that, and in one important respect has been damaging to the national interest.  Their denigration of what was achieved on 30th October, undertaken for party political ends, has certainly helped to undermine confidence within the fishing industry and has led to a hesitation about investment which can be highly damaging to our interests.  There is no moment at which this industry needs an injection of investment more than at present.  We have the guarantee.  The common fisheries policy has to be so adapted as to yield a doubling of our catch, if there are boats and men to catch the fish, within three years and expand further thereafter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> That guarantee in the ordinary way, if it had not been misrepresented and denigrated by the Opposition, would have led in ordinary circumstances to an injection of investment into the industry and a demand for new boats so that the process of building up to the doubling of the catch by 1979 would now be well under way.  That is not happening in the way it should because the Opposition, instead of carrying out their proper role and helping to establish how vitally important this matter is, have gone far beyond that in attempting to damage the Government and damage my role and that of the Parliamentary Secretary in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in a way which has proved a real disincentive to investment because it will mean that the benefits which should accrue from the implementation of a coastal band later this year have now been postponed seriously and one cannot ignore the danger that the fact that this has happened will make negotiation more difficult.</P>
    <P>It has been difficult enough to persuade our partners we had a right at a time when they must cut back seriously in their fishing to be given the opportunity to expand our industry rapidly.  We succeeded in doing that but, if it now appears that the opportunity provided is one of which advantage is not taken, and they will not go into the reasons, because of the effective Opposition propaganda on the morale of the fishing industry, then further negotiation becomes distinctly more difficult.  The helpful aspect of opposition which at an earlier stage was a factor, if I may say so, can become a nefarious influence in the negotiations.  I am seriously disturbed about this and about the prospects of the industry if the kind of uncertainty created, without any grounds whatever, should continue to undermine the position, prevent investment, delay expansion and weaken the prospects of getting maximum benefit from the industry.  In this instance I believe the Opposition have gone beyond and against the national interest.</P>
    <P>I come now to what seems to me to be the two main criticisms of the <Col N="766" /> Government in this debate.  I have read the parts of the debate that I missed and I listened carefully today and yesterday to the debate.  It seems to me the criticisms fall under two headings. First, the Opposition contend we should have made a unilateral declaration of a 50-mile zone, that we have legal power to do so and by failing to exercise this legal power we have damaged the national interest and the fishing industry.  The second and alternative argument would appear to be that whether or not we took that action we should not have joined in the declaration of the 200-mile zone at the time the other EEC countries did because, by doing so, we lost bargaining power.  I think that is a fair summary of the arguments.  I am not aware of any other arguments.</P>
    <P>As far as the first argument is concerned, nothing could have been simpler, easier or more satisfying to the Government than simply at the outset to declare a 50-mile exclusive coastal band.  The Government had the legal right to do so and it would have secured the applause of the Opposition, even though it might have been muted applause, the applause of the fishing industry and of the people generally. After that muted applause the Opposition could have basked in its laurels. One does not need to think much about the problem to realise that any Government that could have done that would have jumped at the opportunity and no Government would have been deterred from doing that except by compelling considerations.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, as I said before, the manner in which the Opposition when in Government acted and the timing of their action in 1970 meant there were no proper negotiations of our interests at the time the regulation was drawn up.  I have checked again and, while the Commission's proposals on fisheries policy were known some months earlier, it was not until 21st September that the Opposition, then in Government, took the matter up in Brussels, exactly four weeks after the date the Council's decision was taken, at a stage so late that there was no possibility of any change being made in the wording which would have covered the case <Col N="767" /> we have before us today.  That inaction in marked contrast to the action of Norway, which took the matter up much earlier and more effectively, was commented upon by the Government of Norway publicly when they complained about the lack of support they got from the British as well as the Irish Governments of the day.  It was that deplorable failure which contributed to the situation we are in now and no amount of falsification by the Opposition can hide that fact and no attempt, as has been made, to allege negligence on our part can alter the fact that from that moment onward our bargaining position was reduced to virtually nil and we have had to work from that basis onwards and make the best of the situation.</P>
    <P>The legal situation, despite the convoluted arguments attempted by the Opposition, is unfortunately clear.  On the advice available to me from several sources, the view of the Commission's legal services and the Council's legal services, all are unanimous on the point that unfortunately the regulation as adopted and now in force, and despite the derogation in time offered by the Accession Treaty, is of such a character that it precludes unilateral action and the declaration of an exclusive zone.  It does not necessarily preclude another type of unilateral action of a different character in regard to conservation which I shall come to later on but it precludes the declaration of an exclusive zone.  The Opposition know this because in fact they are responsible for it and assertions to the contrary carry no weight, even if they succeed in confusing the issue and confusing some of those engaged in the industry.</P>
    <P>The problem the Government faced was would they attempt to pretend they had a legal power and purport to exercise it knowing that on the first occasion it sought to do so by intercepting a vessel of a Community country operating within 50 miles that decision would be challenged in our domestic courts and, under our domestic law and Community law, would be found to be null and void. We would then be faced with our bluff called and the unremitting hostility <Col N="768" /> of those whom we had tried to bluff out of their legal rights.  Was that the policy to pursue or was it better to face the facts, the heritage that Fianna Fáil had left to us, and proceed to try to negotiate ourselves out of the hole they had left us in?</P>
    <P>The Government took the second view, and rightly, and decided we must seek to assert and prove objectively the need for a coastal band of up to 50 miles if the Irish fishing industry is to have a chance of developing. That was the policy pursued.  The attempt to throw dust in the eyes of the public will not succeed.  The public will not be taken in by it.</P>
    <P>The second argument is that we should not have declared a 200-mile zone.  I have tried to follow this argument. I have tried to discover the <i>rationale</i> of the Fianna Fáil suggestion. It is not clear.  I have carefully read the debate and listened to what speakers said but that has not left me with any clearer picture of what bargaining power the Opposition think this would have given us.  It is clear enough what disadvantages there would be in not declaring this 200-mile zone.  Had we not declared it, it would certainly have been extremely disruptive of Community solidarity, offensive to our partners and, to say the least, would have caused great irritation on their part.  The question is would it have injured their interests to such an extent that they would have been forced by such a threat on our part to make a major concession with regard to a coastal band at that time.  Nothing said on the Opposition benches suggest to me that they think this is the case, nor have they indicated why they think it is the case.</P>
    <P>The declaration of the 200-mile zone has two effects.  First, it has the right to exclude countries outside the Community from fishing.  It is in the general Community interest that we exclude these countries from our part of the 200-mile zone as well as from theirs because it keeps more fish around Community coasts.  But their hearts would not break if we postponed that declaration and permitted other countries to continue to fish for a period in our area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="769" /> The other purpose of obtaining the 200-mile zone is to enable the Community to enter into bargains with countries controlling waters within their new 200-mile zones in which Community countries have hitherto fished so that, for example, countries like Britain and Germany can benefit from a reciprocal arrangement with Norway, Iceland or the Faroes under which by offering the possibility to those countries of continuing to catch certain kinds of fish in the Community 200-mile zone or some parts of it, they could secure in return the right to catch fish in the 200-mile zone of Iceland, Norway, the Faroes or the Soviet Union.  For the purpose of that second objective of the 200-mile zone, the Irish non-declaration of it would have been ineffective in preventing this.  Of the four countries I mentioned, which are the ones with whom reciprocal agreements either are under negotiation, are being attempted or could be attempted because there is a reciprocity of catch, with the single and limited exception of the Soviet Union, none fishes to a significant extent in our waters.  Therefore, the basis for the bargaining required by the Community countries in order to secure their interests in Norwegian, Faroese or Icelandic waters is to be found in the declaration by the other member countries of 200-mile zones. Our failure to declare ours and therefore the absence of a possible bargaining counter for them in these negotiations is of no importance because these three countries do not catch fish in our waters, and the bargain to be made between the Community and these countries of a reciprocal nature would be in no way impeded or rendered less efficacious had we held back from declaring a 200-mile zone.</P>
    <P>Therefore, had we decided not to join with our Community partners this would not have embarrassed them in any significant way.  It would have annoyed them and would have destroyed Community solidarity.  It would have weakened the moral validity of our case.  It would have damaged our interests but it would not have put any pressure on them, unfortunately.  I wish it would.  It would have damaged our interests, <Col N="770" /> however, very severely.  Had the Opposition policy been adopted Soviet vessels would be continuing to fish within 12 miles of our coast today on a scale immensely damaging to our fishing.  Moreover, had we adopted their policy it would not be open to the Government, either by common accord within the Community or by unilateral declaration, to seek to impose conservation measures outside 12 miles which are badly needed. What the Opposition are proposing, therefore, is that we should have refrained from declaring a 200-mile zone which is vitally important to the national interests, to exclude eastern European vessels from 12 miles off our coast, vitally important to enable us to take, either in conjunction with our partners or unilaterally, conservation measures.  If we were to do this because it would give only a mythical bargaining power, our Community partners would not find themselves in any way at a serious disadvantage for the absence of our 200-mile zone. That argument falls to the ground completely and is self-evidently fallacious.</P>
    <P>We are left with the reality of the situation we find ourselves in because of what Fianna Fáil did not do in 1970, the dog that did not bark in the night in June, July and August of 1970 or before 21st September.  What we have done has been to use the first stage of our possible threat of veto on reciprocal agreements with other countries to secure concessions for this country of vital importance in themselves but also concessions which lay the objective groundwork for achieving our demand for a coastal band, a demand which without that objective groundwork is simply a unilateral assertion of something we would like to have.</P>
    <P>The concessions we secured on 30th October included an agreement in principle that we should not have to bear the full burden of protection costs in our very large share of the Community waters; the Community would help us in that regard.  Secondly, there was the recognition that Ireland is a special case different from all other Community countries as far as fishing <Col N="771" /> is concerned, different in particular from Britain and Scotland.  Thirdly, we secured acceptance of the principle that the Irish fishing industry must develop when all other fishing industries in the Community are held back for conservation reasons and must develop at a rate to enable it to double its catch in three years and must have the right to develop further thereafter. Those, despite any denigration by the Opposition here, were vitally important gains, not only intrinsically in themselves at that time, but also because the provision with regard to the quantitative growth of the industry provides the objective basis for a claim to a coastal band.  Why?  It can be shown arithmetically without much difficulty at this stage of affairs after the depletion of stocks in the North Atlantic and off our coasts that the total volume of fish available to us near our coasts is of such a magnitude that we are going to need effectively all the fish near our coasts and the great bulk of the fish somewhat further out in order to achieve the target which we have had endorsed by the Community. We can now say to them that they are committed by a binding obligation so to apply a common fishery policy as to enable the Irish fishing industry to develop in accordance with the Government's development plan and to develop progressively and continuously beyond that date.  But we could not say to them before we got that agreement that we were asserting a 50-mile band claim when we had no basis for it.  We can say to them: &ldquo;There is no way in which you can put forward a proposition that we can achieve that without any coastal band, because the volume of fish stocks near our coasts is such that unless we get a coastal band we could not achieve that target and you are committed to our achieving that target&rdquo;.  We now have a firm quantitative basis for the claim to a coastal band and that is a crucial achievement and it places our bargaining position on a firm foundation for the first time which it did not stand on previously although we were nobly making the assertion that we wanted this band.  Those achievements, denigrated by the Opposition, provide <Col N="772" /> a firm basis for the negotiation to come.</P>
    <P>What has unfortunately confused the position, or helped the Opposition to do so, is that in the period since 30th October the Community has become bogged down in a wrangle about the interim arrangements for fishing between that time, now, and when the permanent regime to be negotiated comes into effect, a wrangle which in its complexity, legally and politically, rivals any type of international dispute or argument I have ever heard about and the Byzantine complexities of which we have been trying to unravel as rapidly as possible in our interest. There has been the problem of the interim arrangement in respect of other countries where there are reciprocal fishing interests and the Commission is endeavouring to negotiate with Norway, Iceland and the Faroes. This is complex enough.  Then there is the problem of the exclusion, after a very short and rapid phasing-out period, of eastern European vessels, something which is basically satisfactory to us.  It involved a very substantial cut-back to a fraction of previous catch by these vessels in the three-month period.  It involved the whole of this very reduced catch being secured as far as we are concerned over 50 miles from our coasts so that none of these vessels may come within 50 miles of our coasts.</P>
    <P>These are very important concessions indeed, helping to preserve what is left of the fish around our shores.  These arrangements had been based on quotas not backed up by anything but quota arrangements, quotas to be respected by a nonCommunity country over whose affairs we have little control.  There is evidence that this quota system did not work and, as has been said in this debate, in an imprecise form the British reported that in 17 days the Soviet Union had in parts of the North Sea caught more than their quota of sprat already for the three-month period.  As a result negotiations proceeded for a licensing system to licence a small number of boats in different parts of Community waters. That has now been agreed after considerable difficulties about the wording <Col N="773" /> of it where we had to safeguard our national interests and at one stage we had to hold up the whole negotiations while what we regarded as our vital national interests were safeguarded.</P>
    <P>That is only part of this interim affair.  The other part is the working out of interim conservation arrangements to try to preserve what fish is left while we engage in negotiation for the coastal band during the rest of this year.  That has proved a difficult and intractable matter.  We are quite clear that no quota system, never mind a quota reduction of only 10 per cent, could be in any way adequate to preserve our stocks from over-fishing by Community boats even with the departure of Eastern Europeans during the course of the present year.  We are not prepared to accept that a quota system of dubious effectiveness involving a cut of only 10 per cent should be the only measure of conservation. We have indicated the measures we would like to take and we have pressed these measures.  Had there been total resistance to them and evidence that no circumstances could measure along these lines we proposed be accepted, we would have acted unilaterally in December or in January. There was a measure of good-will towards our position.</P>
    <P>Proposals were made which went some way to meet our position.  I am not satisfied with these proposals, and I am not satisfied that these proposals have been, can be or will be amended to meet our needs but it would have been damaging to our interest to refuse to negotiate and discuss these proposals and to insist that on the deadline of 31st December we take unilateral conservation measures regardless of whether there was a willingness to discuss the problem by our partners. It may well be that next Tuesday we may fail to reach agreement and have to take unilateral action.  On the other hand, we may find people in a reasonable frame of mind where they will agree to the measures that we need to take to conserve our fish stocks in which event we will be happy to do by general agreement what we are willing to do unilaterally if we do not <Col N="774" /> get general agreement.  That debate has continued through December and January and it has had the disadvantage that it has held up the start of the negotiation of the permanent regime and the coastal band.  People who have not followed this extremely complex negotiation closely have felt that the coastal band has been lost somewhere. In fact, it is the crucial issue yet to be negotiated on which we have conceded nothing and for which we have secured a firm basis in the agreement of October 30th by the doubling of our catch within three years.</P>
    <P>Our job is to get this conservation arrangement sorted out one way or the other so that in addition to the pushing out of the Eastern European vessels from our shores there will be a substantial reduction in Community fishing off our coasts and adequate conservation and preservation of our fish stocks during this year because we cannot afford that they be further depleted while these countries engage in long negotiations over our coastal band claim.  The conservation measures that we need to take are quite extensive. They can cover a range of matters in relation to the size of nets, the size of boats, and in relation to closing off areas of fishing.</P>
    <P>We are not wedded to a particular individual solution.  We made our proposals but if we can get something substantially like them, better in some respects and less good in others, but giving the same result overall, we will accept it, but if not we will take the necessary unilateral action which will be non-discriminatory in character and, therefore, unlike the Opposition's idea of an exclusive coastal band, legal within Community law, as established by case law and as evidenced under the terms of the Community Acts in question and by the whole way in which Community law operates.  I hope that by next Tuesday we will have settled this interim issue of conservation one way or the other satisfactorily to Ireland so that from then on we can concentrate on the real battle for the coastal band which must be the primary objective.</P>
    <P>I do not see any way and nobody has suggested any way by which our <Col N="775" /> vital interests in this matter can be preserved except by an exclusive coastal band of up to 50 miles.  Provision could be made for traditional fishermen, small boats from nearby countries, who have fished for centuries in our waters, within limits, and on a basis which will not impede our conservation efforts or produce a slowdown in the expansion of our domestic industry.  There must be a band which we control where we can be sure that its method of operation is such as to produce these results in terms of expansion of our industry and in terms of conservation.  That is the object of our policy and we will not be deflected from it by any attempts from the other side of the House to obscure the issue.</P>
    <P>Responsible opposition cannot conceivably allege that it is helping the national interest by making accusations against a Minister of the kind made by Deputy Molloy last night. Deputy Gallagher who spoke immediately afterwards started by saying that he agreed with the previous speaker. In the Deputy's interest I had to suggest to him that he could not have agreed with the allegations made by Deputy Molloy, that I was deliberately sabotaging the Irish national interest with a view to feathering my nest by a job in Brussels.  I find it unbelievable that such an allegation could be made from the front bench.  Deputy Gallagher did nothing to maintain the honour of his party by repudiating the allegation.  If the Opposition Party Leader had been here he would have repudiated the allegation and he would be very slow to return a Deputy like Deputy Molloy who makes remarks like that to his front bench.</P>

One has not come to expect much personal or sour and unwarranted criticism of the type he has indulged in this evening from the Minister.  It seems to be out of character both with the Minister's style of delivery and with his general performance.  Nonetheless, things can be said in a low key in an apparently reasonable approach, which are for that reason <Col N="776" /> more offensive and more damaging, than when said in a manner that one is accustomed to receiving from him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="777" /> The Minister opened the debate on the basis that irreparable damage has been done to our fishing industry by the Opposition's misrepresentation of the facts.  He charged us as an Opposition, who have raised this matter on many occasions here, with, in fact, being directly responsible, as he related it, for the lack of investment now in the fishing industry.  He charged us with being responsible for confidence in this industry being undermined, that our international reputation has been undermined and that the potential of our industry to realise what he has presented as being great targets within two or three years, has been undermined by what he said was our misrepresentation. I shall deal with those points later.</P>
    <P>We have been asking for and teasing out in the course of numerous debates here precisely what the representative organisation of fishermen and those engaged in the marine industry have been looking for, that is the guaranteeing of an exclusive coastal band to protect the interests of our fishing industry and our fishermen. We have done that by searching and analysing in every possible way the legislation involved, the Articles of Accession, the activities of other States and we have confined ourselves to that at all times.  If the Minister finds that that has damaged the potential of our fishing industry and that now the undermining of confidence in that industry can be directly related to any action of ours it is the first time he has ever said it.  I do not believe any Minister has said anything so serious about an Opposition in the House.  The Minister is now charging us with what I may now say no element in the Press or the media or otherwise has charged us with, that we are directly responsible because there is not now an investment confidence in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I repudiate that.  It is reprehensible and irresponsible.  It is an attempt by the Minister to attribute the blame to us for his own failures.  It sometimes happens with people who fail in particular areas that when they are not prepared to acknowledge&mdash;we acknowledge the difficulties he had&mdash;their <Col N="778" /> failures to deliver on their promises they turn to others to attribute to them the consequences of their failures.  We reject entirely that what we have said, what the fishermen's organisations have said&mdash;we have been saying the same thing&mdash;or what the public have said has in any way been responsible for any lack of investment confidence in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I would not go so far as to charge the Minister with what he has charged us with but if there is a direct responsibility he would be better advised to look to the consequences of his own negotiating tactics, to the great presentations of what would be achieved, to the high expectations he raised, as is his custom, in the early stages of the negotiations, in the minds of the fishermen, the minds of the public and through the media at every opportunity and then, as happened before in the Regional Fund, the failure to live up to his own expectations and the obvious frustrations on the part of the public and, in this instance, the fishermen.  This has been caused by the Minister talking about the great targets and the great developments that would be achieved.  In the final analysis it has been proved that his negotiating tactics and his negotiating capacity were not of the kind that achieved what all of us wanted and what he set out to achieve.</P>
    <P>As far as my memory goes it was the Minister who first mentioned, from the political benches, the 50-mile coastal band.  It did not come from this side of the House.  When it came from the Minister we supported it.  The fishermen's organisations rolled in behind him.  All of us recognised that this was desirable and lent our support to it.  From then on we had to watch the position where our opportunity to ensure it diminished every day.  We had to watch a situation where, because of the Minister's failure to rely on our rights and to point out the limitation on the Community rights, we reached a stage at the end of the day where, frankly, we have done little or nothing.</P>
    <P>I want to quote from an article by the Minister which appeared in <Col N="779" /><i>The Skipper</i> of November, 1976.  He was referring to what was achieved without prejudice to our right for a 50-mile coastal band.  I want to refer particularly to the portion of the article where he referred to what he and the Government would do, if necessary, to protect our fishing industry on an interim basis before a final regime was introduced.  He stated:</P>
    <P>Accordingly, in the interim period, pending the establishment of the socalled internal fishery regime of the Community member states must, if there is neither an agreed Community policy for the conservation of resources nor an agreement within the international fisheries commissions be able to take, as an interim measure, conservation measures in their own 200-mile zones, designed to protect fish stocks generally, and this is provided for under Annex VI to the Council Resolution of the 30th October.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>In our case a special issue arises, however, as pending the Commission securing the power so to apply the Common Fisheries Policy as to secure the achievement of our Fisheries Development Programme, we must be able to take whatever action is necessary to start this process of doubling our fish catch&mdash;which is to be completed in accordance with the current stage of our Development Plan, as agreed by the European Commission, within the very short space of three years.</P>
    <P>He subsequently said that this action that we would take would not be dramatic.  He continued:</P>
    <P>Do not therefore expect dramatic gestures on 1st January.  We shall do no more&mdash;but certainly no less&mdash; than is necessary to create the conditions necessary for the availability of fish stocks to Irish fishermen off our coasts to increase in line with the kind of growth necessary to move towards the doubling of catches by 1979.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done nothing about all that talk and about the action that <Col N="780" /> we might take so that the Community would have to recognise our special position&mdash;the talk of October, November and December, the response from the newspapers to that talk, the unilateral action which our Minister might take, to which he referred in that article as no more but certainly no less on 1st January, has all evaporated like so much more which the Minister promised in the early stages of those negotiations.  We have done absolutely nothing.</P>
    <P>So much for the brave talk of unilateral action which the Minister was to take to ensure our position during this interim period pending the finalisation of an internal regime in the Community.  Is it any wonder that our fishermen feel so frustrated, the public feel so frustrated and we, as public representatives, feel so frustrated that we should express annoyance and dissatisfaction with the Minister's performance when he does not even deliver on his own commitments written in <i>The Skipper</i> a few months ago at a time when we all expected glory in the great achievement that we could double or treble our fish stocks within a stated number of years?  It is quite clear at the moment that because we have reneged on our right to take our own action the Minister can then say that we have <i>ipso facto</i> ensured that the doubling of the catches by 1979 cannot be achieved.</P>
    <P>The Minister summarised our case by saying that we want 50 miles.  I want to say to him that he does also. The other point he made was that we make the case that the extension of the 200-mile limit and his agreement to do so compromised our position, in that, had we not done so we could have been in a stronger bargaining position and would have obliged the Community, as a condition of our extension to 200 miles, to agree to a 50-mile band for us.  He rejected that argument too.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Your point was that we should make a unilateral declaration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Our point was&mdash; and I could quote extensively from the debates which took place at the <Col N="781" /> time&mdash;that at The Hague we should have made agreement to an exclusive 50-mile limit for us a condition of our extension to 200 miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The points are bound up one with the other.  The Minister attempted to confuse this before. There is no such thing as a 50-mile concept in itself under the international law of the sea.  It is now the 200-mile concept that is being respected and promoted.  The 50 miles was our bargaining position, our minimum demand within that established 200-mile concept.  He relinquished our bargaining position and conceded to the other members of the Community what they asked for, the 200-mile limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy contradict Deputy Haughey who said we should declare unilaterally an exclusive 50-mile band and that we had a legal right to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister failed to use it as a bargaining position, the only option left to us was to make a unilateral declaration.  It is not the way we would have done it, as I have said.  We would have made it a condition of the extension agreement.  The Minister having failed to do that, we were then left with the last option.  We certainly would have pressed for that and I shall give many reasons why.</P>
      <P>After the last debate in this House I sought a response from the Directorate General for Research and Documentation in the European Parliament on some of the issues concerned and was given this through the auspices of the European Progressive Democrat Group.  The paper from which I now intend to quote is not a publication on behalf of the European Progressive Democrat Group but, as I say, a response from the Directorate General for Research and Documentation for the European Parliament which every group apparently has the right to consult from time to time.  I asked the EPD group to put certain questions to the Directorate General and to get their response to these questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily a legal opinion.  We ourselves have given legal opinions to the Minister which he rejected.  The object of the research was the legal implications of a 50-mile exclusive limit for fishing.  The first question was whether the Treaty of Accession was negotiated having regard to the creation of a 200 miles zone.  The answer was:</P>
      <P>The Treaty of Accession was not negotiated having regard to the creation of a 200 miles zone.  It was signed at Brussels on 22nd January, 1972, at a time when the principle of the creation of exclusive zones was not generally established.  The concept of the 200 miles exclusive economic zone appears to have received legitimacy through the UNCLOS III, irrespective of whether or not the concept is finally approved in Treaty form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this responsible and informed centre says the treaty was not negotiated having regard to that, then it is quite clear&mdash;and we have been arguing this all the time against the Minister's point&mdash;we had no competence to deal with anything outside our territorial waters, 12 miles.  At the time of the Treaty of Accession, from 12 miles to 200 miles were open seas, and we could not bind the Community or anyone else to any arrangement in respect of such international seas.  That response clearly indicates that we can persuasively argue that what would be required now is a new and formal agreement which would be an amendment of the Treaty of Accession, if <Col N="783" /> necessary, so that what was not within our competence then and is now within our competence as a coastal state can be included, and so that we can make arrangements within the Community for internal administration within that 200 miles.</P>
    <P>So much for the point the Minister has made that we should have foreseen then what was not within the competence of anyone to deal with in any event.  The Minister said the last day that this Dáil did not bark at that time in relation to the 200 mile limit.  The Minister has been known to be fairly vocal both in Government and in Opposition but not only did the Minister not bark but he did not even whimper in 1972.</P>

      <P>It is amazing for somebody who took such an active interest in the whole matter of accession to the European Community at that time&mdash;and fisheries was a major <Col N="784" /> element in this&mdash;that it did not occur to him not even once in the course of all the statements he made in this House to say to the Government: &ldquo;What about the possibilities of extensions beyond the territorial limits&rdquo;? In fact, the position is that it was not relevant then and is not relevant now because you cannot make agreements in respect of waters over which you have no control.  For that reason we cannot be bound by agreements in respect of waters over which we then had no control.</P>
      <P>The second question posed to the research and information centre of the European Parliament was on the competence of the Community and its institutions in the creation of 200 miles and 50 miles zones.  The answer is:</P>
      <P>The competence to set up a 200 miles zone belongs to the Member States.  Therefore the Council, meeting in The Hague on 30th October, 1976, adopted a resolution calling upon the Member States to act in concert to extend their fishing zones to 200 miles from 1st January, 1977, and emphasising the urgent need for Community measures to protect its legitimate interests in the fisheries sector.  As for the limit of 50 miles within the 200 miles `Community fishing zone', it cannot be excluded <i>a priori</i> that the Community institutions decide to set up this limit if it conforms to the general framework of the common fisheries policy.</P>
      <P>I take it the Minister will not disagree with anything there.</P>
      <P>The next question is whether Ireland has a legal right to declare a national exclusive zone of 50 miles and the compatibility of this with the Rome Treaty, the Treaty of Accession and the Commission's proposals for internal and external fishing regimes and here is the confirmation of what I have been saying:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By its decision to jointly set up a 200 miles &ldquo;Community fishing zone&rdquo;, Ireland has implicitly recognised the Community's competence to cope with the new fishing conditions resulting thereof.  It is difficult, for that reason, to admit that Ireland <Col N="785" /> can unilaterally set up a 50 miles national exclusive zone, since such an autonomous act would trouble the application of the common fishing policy and would lessen the possibilities of the Community reaching satisfactory agreements with other countries which have established an exclusive maritime economic zone.</P>
    <P>We are told that such an autonomous act &ldquo;would trouble the application of the common fishing policy&rdquo; but we are not told that it would be completely inconsistent with the application of that policy or that it could not be done because of that policy.  Significantly, it states, as we have been stating all along, that from the time Ireland decided to jointly agree to the 200-mile Community fishing zone without getting a guarantee in advance about our position within 50 miles we implicitly recognised the Community's confidence.  The Minister who did that is the person who is now telling us that we have undermined the future potential of our fishing industry.  He is the person who threw away that bargaining point.  We had asked him before doing this to get a guarantee on the 50-mile limit but he did not.  If we are paying the price now and if there is a lack of investment and confidence in the fishing industry it is attributable to the Minister's ineffectiveness and incapacity rather than to the arguments we presented in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>The next question asked was in relation to Article 103 and one which we have raised on many occasions, whether the Commission's proposals which have been adopted to a limited extent comply with Article 103 of the Treaty of Accession.  We have always maintained that they do not comply and in so far as they do not comply the provisions of the Treaty are not being relied upon or being adhered to by the Community.  The document I have been quoting from states in relation to this matter:</P>
    <P>Article 7 of the Commission's proposals for a Regulation establishing a Community system for the conservation and management of fishery <Col N="786" /> resources extends beyond 31 December, 1982, the application of the arrangements estabished by Articles 100 and 101 of the Act of Accession. This provision seems rather &ldquo;premature&rdquo;, since Article 103 of the Treaty of Accession gives time to the Commission until the 31st December, 1982, to present a report to the Council on the economic and social development of the coastal areas of the Member States and the state of stocks.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to the comment &ldquo;rather premature&rdquo;.  Our comment is, premature indeed.  If the research and information centre of the European Parliament are ready to acknowledge that there is something which the Commission are now doing which is &ldquo;rather premature&rdquo; having regard to the binding obligations on them and our rights under Article 103 of the Treaty of Accession, then at least the Minister might have relied on that legal position, he might have insisted on it.  He might have told them &ldquo;you have no right to introduce a new fishery regime unless and until you have satisfied the conditions of Article 103&rdquo;.  Those conditions require the Commission to do a survey and present a report on the economic and social development of the coastal areas of member states and of the state of the stocks.  They have not done that nor have they been required to do that.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, we have acknowledged that apparently they are entitled to introduce a new fishery regime which is, to say the least of it, not consistent with the Treaty of Accession which relates to matters not anticipated when we signed that Treaty.  On that basis the new developments were not foreseen and for that reason the provisions of that article should be relied upon as a strong bargaining position from our point of view.  The response to the question in relation to the derogations of a member state's right to create a national exclusive zone of 50 miles as a result of the Treaty of Accession was:</P>
    <P>According to Article 100, paragraph 3, of the Treaty of Accession, a Member State is entitled to extend <Col N="787" /> its fishing limits &ldquo;in certain areas&rdquo; from six to twelve nautical miles. Article 101 extends the limit of six nautical miles to twelve in some areas which are specifically enumerated. Assuming that a Member State should retain the right to establish a 50 miles national exclusive zone, this new limit would also be subject to the general principle laid down for extending the fishing limits to twelve miles, namely that there must not be any &ldquo;retrograde change&rdquo; by comparison with the foregoing situation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, assuming it could be done it would be subject to the same overriding principle that there must not be any retrograde change by comparison with the foregoing situation.  I should like to deal with the question as to whether there would or would not be a retrograde change.  The position before the extension to 200 miles was that the waters from 12 miles to 200 miles were open international waters over which we had no control and over which the European Community had no control.  They were open to the Soviets, the Norwegians, the Eastern European and all fishing fleets interested in fishing them.  They were open to the world and so fished.  Now, as a result of the extension to 200 miles countries other than members of the European Community are excluded from these waters, subject to interim arrangements.  What benefit do we confer on the European Community? We have agreed that those waters will now be confined to the European Community.  We are giving them the added bonus, the surplus of excluding others from outside the Community from those 200 miles.  In effect, we are telling the fishing fleets of the community that the zone will be theirs exclusively to be fished.  That is a big plus that Ireland has contributed to the European Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If a 200-mile limit was not of much importance, I do not think there would have been the long and detailed negotiations at the Law of the Sea Conference.  Far from depriving the Community of anything they hitherto had or demanding from us something which we were not prepared to share with them, our position is that we are offering to the Community what they could not otherwise have, the exclusive right between 50 and 200 miles.  Surely, that would not represent a retrograde change by comparison with the foregoing situation. If, unfortunately for Germany, Holland, France or Denmark they now find themselves excluded from Norwegian, Icelandic and Spanish waters, because of this new concept of 200 miles we are hastening to compensate them, to cushion the blow. That, in fact, is what we are doing. Otherwise, they would have to suffer without any compensation.  The compensation we are giving is the exclusive right to fish from 50 to 200 miles.  That is point one and it is something they could not enjoy without us.  Were we not in this strong bargaining position the Russians, Bulgarians or the Germans, the French or the Danes would have nothing to compensate them for the loss of the fishing rights they had in the Norwegian, Icelandic and the other waters concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Point two, in a sense, is more important. Between base and 50 miles we have never said here on behalf of Fianna Fáil&mdash;nor have the fishermen ever said it&mdash;that we are insisting that only Irish fishing vessels will fish.  I have had discussions with the fishermen on numerous occasions and they are not insisting on that, but what they and we have said is that only Irish fishing vessels will have the right to fish within the 50-mile zone.  We made very specific proposals to the Minister on <Col N="789" /> this and apparently he has ignored them: that we would propose a system of licensing within that 50 miles for vessels which have traditionally fished within that zone subject to the condition that it would be our Government, after consultation with our interests, who could determine in consultation also with the Community how these licensing arrangements could be made effective from year to year.</P>

There was no response from the Minister then on that basis.  I repeated the proposal in the second debate.  I consulted with the fishermen's organisations about it and I introduced it as an initiative on which our Government could rely. The Minister now tells us that this is precisely his objective.  I challenge him to say where he has stated this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair. What I am saying is what is required and, perhaps, even still it can be achieved despite the fact that the Minister has taken no interim steps unilaterally as he threatened to do some months ago.  Nothing is still being done on that basis.  We can still take the initiative and I now invite the Minister again to do it, to go to the Community partners and say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The only way out of this wrangle is to acknowledge that we have the right within the 50-mile zone: give us the right to negotiate with our partners. Acknowledge our right to issue licences to certain traditional fishing fleets and these rights would be determined by our needs and our potential.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the doubling of our capacity within three years.  Obviously, in deciding how the licensing would be effected, we would have regard to the doubling of that capacity.  I think that what we are concerned with here may be only a matter of terminology.  Let me, on behalf of this party, again suggest that initiative to the Minister, that provided we are the people who will determine after consultation with our fishermen and fishing interests what happens within that 50 miles, surely there is a way out of the impasse which will guarantee that our fishing industry will develop.  But no, the Minister has taken the timorous approach and has not seen the legal issues involved and at no stage yet has he made any such presentation.  Again, I invite him to do it because the fishermen themselves recognise that our fishing capacity is not such as would enable us to supply the European market which depends to a considerable extent on fishing within that 50 miles.  Therefore, we must be reasonable enough to recognise that some arrangement should be reached and the Minister has the opportunity and has had it for a considerable time to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why we seek this exclusive 50 miles, why we are trying to restore <Col N="791" /> what the Minister has conceded.  That is why we look now for this right to be enshrined in our legislation so that with it guaranteeing our position we can negotiate and issue licences in the same way as we issue exploration licences for mineral development or any other purpose within waters under our control or jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>January 1st has come and gone and all that the Minister threatened has not happened.  But something has happened; the fishermen have been frustrated and as they say themselves they have been fooled to the point that they can no longer rely on the <i>bona fides</i> of the Government or its effectiveness. They have had to bring legal proceedings to have declarations as to our constitutional rights under the Treaty of Accession and as to the limitations, such as they might be, on those rights under the Treaty of Rome.  One presumes they had to do this because they were frustrated.  Yet, the Minister charged us with having undermined confidence in the fishing industry.  If he asks the fishermen to say who undermined the confidence of the industry they will reply they have already given him their answer in having to issue proceedings against this State to ensure that their interests would be protected. There is no point in the Minister trying to turn on us the blame for his own ineffectiveness.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the longer this interim arrangement continues and the longer the period when no firm arrangement is made to protect our position, the more we suffer because it is we who are suffering while waiting. The sooner our specific coastal band is declared, protected and guaranteed the better.  The longer the interim is prolonged or the decision delayed, the longer there is vague talk of interim arrangements which achieve nothing, the more we are being deprived by the access which other countries have from inside and outside the Community to water which we should have for our exclusive use.</P>
    <P>The Minister must recognise that all this interim wrangling is a greater blow to us than to any other country in the Community.  He must also realise that <Col N="792" /> to prolong the wrangling may very effectively meet the needs and wishes of some members of the Community because, as long as this goes on, they have the right, apparently, under interim arrangements which are not as yet clearly determined, to fish where they will outside the 6-mile&mdash;12-mile limit.  The only ones losing there are those who have the right to the waters outside that, namely, the coastal State which in this case is Ireland.  That is why it is vitally important that the Minister should present firm, positive, consistent proposals of the nature we have outlined here and which we have repeated so that this matter can be resolved as quickly as possible.  Until this is done we are losing every day.</P>
    <P>Some other comments in relation to the Minister's general position: there is a little rock called Rockall.  Some years ago a certain amount of amusement was aroused when I made reference to it and to the position of the British Government.  It does not arouse much amusement now.  I stated to the Minister at that time that we should do what the British were doing and claim a right to that little rock.  The Minister said no, that was not our position.</P>

      <P>As far as I can recall, in 1955 we had a Coalition Government.  There are many people who have very good reason to remember the Government of that time, as they will remember this one for a considerable time.  I begged the Minister three years back, much to the amusement of some journalists who have since retired from the national scene, to do what the British had done, to claim a right to the rock.  No, he would not.  I told him what the British response would be, that next they would be claiming the shelf outside Rockall, and so they did, for exploration purposes. <Col N="793" /> What was our response?  Meek and timorous: &ldquo;We do not accept your extension.&rdquo;  But, we did not put in our claim, no.  We told the Minister that the British Government would do what any determined government would do, having got one inch without being properly or effectively contested, they moved the next one.  Within the past two weeks we saw evidence of it. They have claimed that within two miles of the Rockall rock they have an economic zone which they can use for the purposes of the fishery regime. What has our Minister done?  Once again, he has not claimed the same for us off Rockall, no.  Once again, meekly and timidly, he said, &ldquo;We do not accept that claim.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that the Minister is pursuing the objections to Britain's claims, both as to the shelf and the fishing zone, within the Community and at international level but it is a principle of law that every possible case you can make to protect your position should be made.  The Minister has allowed himself to be out-flanked and has allowed Britain, who have no more claim than we have unilaterally to make such claims to it as they wish and having done so to make extensions of those claims both in relation to fisheries and the Continental shelf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Coalition Government did not do it at the time when they might have done it.  Over all those years it did not seem to be of consequence.  I accept that the first Coalition did not know what the second Coalition knew, or the second Coalition Government did not know what the third knew, what we all became aware of.  That is why I raised it at that time, that there were significant resources around that rock.  Only then did all of us on both sides become aware of it and even then something <Col N="794" /> could have been done and was not done.</P>
      <P>I want to say that our position has been consistent in this.  We reject totally and as positively as we can the misrepresentation from the Minister that the lack of confidence in the fishing industry for investment purposes is attributable to the case we have been making here for the last few months and outside this House wherever we got the opportunity to protect the livelihood and interest of our fishermen. If there is lack of confidence in the fishing industry it can only be attributed to the Minister's failure.</P>
      <P>Perhaps we might look at the Minister's track record as a negotiator.  The fishermen, obviously, have done so. The public are doing so now.  Can the Minister tell us, apart from being a presenter or articulator, in any area, either the Regional Fund or fishery negotiations, the two areas with which he is specifically charged, if he has done anything comparable to the promises he made to this community and this State?  Throughout the discussion on the Regional Fund we heard all the great promises, the Germans were coming around to our position, the French and the Italians were coming around to our position. The gullible Press swallowed this presentation and day in and day out, week in and week out we were told that the Minister was making a great impact on the European scene.  What did we get in the end of the day?  Nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>About one-fourth of what the Minister was promising at the beginning.  We are now in the same position with the fishing negotiations. These are the only two areas in respect of which the Minister has been committed to carry out the negotiations.  Once again, despite the great response at the beginning to what the Minister was going to achieve, it is patently obvious that the has said everything and achieved nothing.  He has not even honoured <Col N="795" /> what he said a month ago, that by 1st January we do no more and no less than would be necessary to protect our fishermen's interest pending the announcement of the final regime. We have done nothing.  You cannot do less than nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want, finally, on behalf of this party, to repeat what we have said so often: when we come into government we will seek to do as we have a right to do under the Treaty of Accession, under the rights we have as a coastal State, to renegotiate the terms of the Treaty having regard to the provisions of Article 103, so that the new regime for our fishing industry and all the Community will take account of the new contribution we <Col N="796" /> have made to that Community since we signed in 1970, namely, the contribution of 200 miles.  Fianna Fáil will renegotiate on that position.  We will renegotiate it, as I have stated here more than once, on the basis of issuing licences to the fishing fleets of other traditional fishermen from member states and thereby ensure the development of our fishing industry and, it is fair to say, as a Community member, also ensure that the fishing interests of our Community partners will be protected and guarantee that we will fulfil our obligations under the Community and also, of course, guarantee that we will ensure the development of our own fishing industry.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the selection of allottees is a matter which is reserved by law to the lay commissioners. They have the final decision and responsibility in all matters relating to the division of Land Commission lands.  Such recommendations as they receive from inspectors prior to these decisions are confidential matters which may not be disclosed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Donegan) Patrick S. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Donegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I need hardly remind the Deputy that the selection of allottees for Land Commission lands is a matter which is reserved by law to the lay commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Land Commission that they have received a <Col N="685" /> protest about the manner in which the Griffin estate was divided and that the protest relates in particular to an allotment of 22 acres to one farmer who had sold a 14 acre farm in the last year of so and who at the time of allotment held some 76 acres.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the lands held by the allottee in question are mainly of poor quality with a rateable valuation of £10.65 and that on the sale of the 14 acres already referred to he bought lands nearer his residence.  In those circumstances the Land Commission did not regard the sale as unfavourable to his application.  It may be mentioned that the purchaser of the 14 acres&mdash;a local congest&mdash;also received an allotment from the Land Commission.  The Griffin estate contained a large portion of bad land which took up much of the road frontage thereby necessitating the creation of some large divisions.  The allottee in question being an excellent farmer and having the capacity to reclaim the inferior lands was selected for one of the larger allotments.</P>

      <P>Under current land settlement policy, holdings and enlargements are planned to provide family farms of 40 to 45 acres of good land or the equivalent in land of mixed quality.  Applicants with holdings below that level are eligible for consideration for enlargements. In the case of the allotment of land acquired under the farmers' retirement scheme to a potential development farmer with a land requirement the area to be allotted would depend on the requirements of the development plan drawn up under the farm modernisation scheme.</P>
